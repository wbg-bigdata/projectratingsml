MEXICO
SECOND CONTRACTUAL SAVINGS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM LOAN (CSDP II)
PROPOSED LOAN AND PROGRAM SUMMARY
BORROWER:         Banco Nacional de Obras y Servicios Puiblicos, SNC (BANOBRAS).
GUARANTOR:    United Mexican States.
AMOUNT:           US$400 million
TERMS:            The loan is proposed to be a fixed rate single currency loan in US dollars,
with a maturity of up to fifteen years.
OBJECTIVES:    The proposed loan would support the second phase of the Government's
Contractual Savings Development Program (CSDP), which is designed to:
(a) increase the equity, efficiency, and sustainability of the old age security
system and gradually lead to greater effective coverage; (b) implement a
financially viable pension system; (c) limit the fiscal impact of the current
pension system; (d) raise the level of institutional savings and improve the
allocative efficiency of domestic savings; and (e) enhance capital market
development by stimulating greater private financial intermediation.
DESCRIPTION:   The first phase of the reform focused on the establishment of the legal,
regulatory, and institutional framework for the reform of the country's old
age security system.  The second phase concentrates on the actual
implementation of the reformed pension system. Specifically, the second
phase of the CSDP supported by the proposed loan (CSDP II), included:
(a) implementing, consolidating, and fine-tuning the reformed system for
private sector workers by: (i) ensuring a flexible and responsive regulatory
framework; (ii) initiating operation of the reformed system and increasing
its efficiency; (iii) transferring SAR92 balances from the Central Bank to
individual AFORE accounts; (iv) fine-tuning investment policies and
improving risk management; (v) strengthening supervision and
enforcement; and (vi) initiating payment of disability and survivors benefits
by private insurers; (b) updating estimates of the fiscal costs of transition;
(c) deepening reforms to INFONAVIT to ensure adequate returns on the
housing sub-account; (d) advancing in the technical preparatory work for
the reform of the public pension systems; (e) sustaining public confidence
through education and information; and (f) advancing in the
implementation of complementary financial market initiatives.



- iv-
BENEFITS:          Overall, the program will lay the basis for a marked increase in the
volume of institutional savings and provide the institutional basis through
which domestic savings can be channeled to productive investment. It
will also lead to the creation of a new class of institutional investors and a
new set of longer-term instruments. Pension and social security reform
will move the actuarially bankrupt defined-benefit system to a fully
funded defined contribution scheme.   Public confidence will be
strengthened, as workers will no longer view their contributions as a tax
to provide benefits to current pensioners; instead, they will view these
contributions as a means to build personal wealth. The separation of the
pension and health sector schemes will result in pressure for greater
efficiency in the delivery of public health benefits. Reforrns in the
insurance industry will create a larger class of insurance products such as
annuities, life and disability and pre-paid medical insurance. Reforms to
improve Mexico's legal framework for mutual funds, secured lending and
asset backed securities will deepen the capital market over time and
broaden the base for domestic savings. In addition, over the longer term,
as pension funds increase their equity fund investments, they will become
major catalysts for improved corporate governance.
RISKS:             The reform could lead to higher fiscal costs if the savings generated from
defined wage contributions do not earn an adequate real rate of return.
These fiscal risks arise from the Government's continued guarantee of a
minimum pension benefit to everyone participating in the social security
system at the time of retirement. Without the housing fund component
earning a positive real rate of return, these risks are high, making
INFONAVIT reforms key to the scheme's sustainability. Given the legal
limitation on investment in foreign securities, the success of domestic
capital market reforms are also crucial to the success of the pension
reform especially because of the weakened state of the banking system,
which is currently the only major private source of financial assets. Low
real rates of return on the average pension fund's assets are also likely to
increase the moral hazard associated with providing a minimum pension
guarantee by encouraging contributor preference for high risk pension
investments.
The risks of political pressures to reverse fiscal management policies will
always exist but are mitigated by Mexico's growth potential over the
medium term. On the banking side, specific programs are in place to
increase the capitalization of the banking system while the overall level
of supervision  has improved  markedly.   CNBV's strengthened
supervisory role for INFONAVIT should ensure the viability of its
operational and financial restructuring program. All the above factors
will be important for improving the likelihood that pension funds will
earn reasonable real rates of return, thus reducing moral hazard concerns.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED
SECOND C'ONTRACTUAL SAVINGS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM LOAN
TO BANOBRAS WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE UNITED MEXICAN STATES
1.1   I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed
Loan to the Banco Nacional de Obras y Servicios Pzublicos, SNC (BANOBRAS) with the
guarantee of the United Mexican States, in the amount of US$400 million to support the second
phase of the Government's Contractual Savings Development Program (CSDP II) which focuses
on the implementation of the legal, regulatory, and institutional framework for the reform of the
country's old age security system. The loan would be single currency loan at the Bank's
standard fixed rate, with a maturity of up to 15 years, and would be disbursed in a single trariche
of US$400 million.
I. MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT AND FINANCING REQUIREMENTS
1.2   Recent Economic Developments and Prospects. The Mexican economy rebounded in
1996-97, following the financial crisis of end-1994 and the severe recession of 1995 when GDP
fell by 6.2 percent and domestic investment dropped by an excess of 30 percent. In 1996, real
GDP rose by 5.2 percent reflecting continued export expansion and a strong recovery in
investment. The implementation of tight financial policies led to a near halving of inflation, a
significant lowering of nominal interest rates, and a greater stability of the peso. Investor
sentiment improved, leading to a substantial rise in foreign direct investment, a marked
improvement in Mexico's access to international capital markets, and a substantial increase in
international reserves. Preliminary data suggest a consolidation of the economic recovery in
1997, while inflation continues to decline. Real GDP growth reached 7 percent in the year with
another healthy expansion of investment in excess of 20 percent.
1.3   As other ermerging market economies, Mexico was jolted by the events in Southeast Asia
in the second half of 1997. But, in Mexico, the contagion effects from Southeast Asia were so
far relatively small when compared to events in other emerging market economies. Areas of
vulnerability of the Mexican economy to adverse external developments are likely to be found in
(i) the international oil price,  (ii) capital flows to emerging markets and (iii) trade
competitiveness.
1.4   Mexico's external accounts experienced a marked improvement since 1994. Exports
boomed in 1995 prompted by the large change in the exchange rate and by the contraction in
domestic demand; and these same forces led to an opposite impact on imports. With the
expansion of domestic output and demand as of 1996, imports recovered rapidly whereas export
growth was reduced to more sustainable levels. The trade balance observed a surplus in 1995
and 1996, of 7.1 and 6.5 billion dollar respectively, which diminished rapidly to 0.6 billion dollar
in 1997 and is likely to become negative over the next few years.



2                                                                     PREsIDENT7SREPORT
1.5   A steady appreciation of the real exchange rate has been observed over the past two and
half years and can be attributed mainly to a resumption of capital flows. The combination of an
appreciating real exchange rate and growing domestic absorption contributed to a reversal in the
trade account and an increasing deficit on the current account. In 1997, the deficit in the current
account exceeded US$ 7.3 billion, and it is expected that it will continue to expand in 1998.
Nevertheless, on balance, the level of the deficit (at about 2-3 percent of GDP), and of external
borrowing, is prudent and consistent with a solid long-term creditworthiness position.
1.6   Underlying the strong performance of the external accounts and of private sector has been
the supportive role of government. The operations of the public sector resulted in an increase in
the primary surplus from 2.2 percent of GDP in 1994 to 4.5 percent of GDP in 1995-1996, in a
context of overall fiscal balance which was prolonged in 1997. Despite declines of government
expenditures reflected in transfers to public enterprises, lower spending on wages and salaries,
and a rephasing of some capital projects, expenditure on social programs was safeguarded.
Monetary policy has supported the fiscal stance and has focused, primarily, on disinflation.
Monthly rates of inflation have been on a declining trend since end-1995 and, as a result, the
annual rate of inflation has fallen from 52 percent in 1995 to 28 percent in 1996 and to less than
16 percent in 1997.
1.7   The short- and medium-term prognosis for the conduct of macro policy, hence for the
economy as a whole, is positive. In 1998, real growth is expected to slow down to a more
sustainable rate of about 4.8 percent with continued expansion in investment and progress in
disinflation. However, the public sector balance is expected to deteriorate for structural and
policy-induced reasons, even as the fiscal authorities come under increasing political pressure for
authorizing expenditure increases and/or revenue reductions.
1.8   Justification for Adjustment Lending. The recent decline of international oil prices has
led to additional pressures on public sector revenues, with oil income responsible for an average
of 38 percent of total public sector revenue. The lower levels of oil prices observed in particular
as of December 1997, prompted the Government to announce expenditure reductions of an
amount of 0.7 percent of GDP for 1998 in order to maintain its public deficit target at 1.25% of
GDP. While the estimated public revenue reduction to date has been mainly on account of
external sales and those domestic sales that are contractually tied to price developments on world
markets (e.g. natural gas and fuel-oil), a longer lasting weakness of international oil prices will
increase pressures to reflect part of the international price decline in other oil related products
sold on the domestic market, such as gasoline and diesel.
1.9   The contractual savings reform program as implemented by the Mexican government as
of 1997, adequately addresses one of the major areas of public contingent liabilities. The reform,
covering workers in the private sector, is causing a near term pressure on public finances with an
estimated annual fiscal cost of 1.5 percent of GDP. Furthermore, other quasi-fiscal losses and
contingent liabilities were allowed to expand and will require additional fiscal outlays in the near
future. These losses arise mainly from the successive bailouts and/or rescheduling of the debts
held by private banks, firms, households (mortgages and credit card debt), tollways operators,
etc., in the wake of the 1995 financial crisis. The total cost of the financial sector rescue



MEXco - SECOND CONTRACTUAL SAVINGS DEVELOPMENTPROGRAM(CSDP II)                  3
programs are now estimated at 14 percent of GDP, or a near term annual pressure on public
finances of at least another 0.6 percent of GDP.
1.10   Admittedly, at the level of 40 percent of GDP, Mexico now holds one of the lowest
levels of public debt among OECD countries. Yet it also faces the unique challenge of providing
an adequate social and productive infrastructure for its expanding and aspiring population, and
for its increasingly competitive firms. Public investment now stands at about 3 percent of GDP
per year, and this may be insufficient to meet future challenges. Moreover, an overhaul of the
fiscal-federalist system is overdue, with a significant shift in the relative balance of fiscal
capabilities between the federation and the states. The combination of greater pressure on
expenditure with an unavoidable recognition of contingent losses could threaten the medium
term fiscal prograin.
1.11  In these conditions, maintaining fiscal discipline is essential as is the policy of sustaining
a careful balance between domestic and foreign sources of funding of the fiscal deficit. Given
the success of its recent macroeconomic performance, and the credibility of its policies, Mexico
again enjoys an arnple access to international financial markets and, thus, did not face a funding
constraint for its balance of payments requirements. Nevertheless, the current account deficit for
1998 is expected to be approximately 3% of GDP, and could in fact be higher. Hence,
maintaining adequate access to medium-term financing as provided by IBRD is an essential
element of the Government's strategy. Moreover, the Government faces a seriously binding
fiscal constraint. rhe current program of reforms would exacerbate the difficulties to be faced by
the government in abiding to this constraint. World Bank support would allow the authorities
more room to maneuver. It would safeguard the limits of domestic borrowing and improve the
overall quality of the medium-term fiscal response.
II.  THE GOVERNMENT'S CONTRACTUAL SAVINGS REFORM PROGRAM
2.1   This section presents the genesis and overall objectives of the Government's contractual
savings reform  and its medium-term  program.  This section also highlights the main
characteristics of the World Bank's support through a phased reform approach. Finally, it
summarizes accornplishments in the initial stage of contractual savings reform.
A.   Genesis and Objectives of the Pension Reform
2.2   Since coming into power, the Zedillo administration recognized that Mexico's contractual
savings system  suffered from  several weaknesses.   These have significant economic
consequences that limit the viability of the social insurance system, constrain the development of
the country's financial sector, and limit prospects for sustainable economic growth. The
Government of Mexico has embarked on a major and important reform of the old age security
system which should prove beneficial both to individuals, through the opportunity to obtain
increased retirement income, and to Mexico's economic growth prospects over the medium and
long term.
2.3   Demographic changes, rising health costs, as well as an increased level of benefits not
properly backed in sufficient actuarial reserves indicated that the public pay-as-you-go (PAYG)
pension system operating in Mexico, would become financially unsustainable by the end of the



4                                                                   PRESIDENT'SREPORT
decade. A limited and failed attempt at reform was made in 1992 by establishing a mandatory
individual retirement savings account (Sistema de Ahorro para el Retiro - SAR92) - with
mandatory 2% defined contribution individual accounts - and by raising the contribution quota to
the Mexican Social Security Institute (Instituto Mexicano de Seguridad Social - IMSS). The
worsening financial situation of IMSS, labor market distortions, unfairness linked to the benefits'
scheme, and the need to generate higher domestic savings - particularly after the December 1994
crisis - led to a growing consensus for pension reformn.
2.4   The reform of contractual savings is one of the key goals in the Government's National
Development Plan (1995-2000). It is a medium-term program aimed at:
* increasing the equity, efficiency, and sustainability of the old age security system
gradually leading to greater effective coverage;
* implementing a financially viable pension system;
1 limiting the fiscal impact of the current pension system and ensure transparency of the
fiscal costs of transition;
* enhancing financial market development and reducing volatility by stimulating
greater private financial intermediation and increasing the array of financial
instruments and contracts available; and
l  contributing to enhance the allocative efficiency of domestic and, in the longer-term,
to raising aggregate savings.
B.   The Government's Medium-Term Program
2.5   The initial stage of reform. The shift of a country's pension system to a more equitable
and financially sustainable one and the implementation of complementary financial sector reforms,
is a long-term process. The Mexican Government could not afford - financially and politically - to
tackle all aspects of the reform in one fell swoop. Also, the fine-tuning of the reform depends on
the outcome of the implementation of the initial phase. The Government decided to initially focus
its efforts towards the reform of the old age insurance scheme for private sector workers. During
1995-96 the Government implemented a number of policy actions that resulted in shift from a
public PAYG, defined-benefit system to a privately managed, defined-contribution system. Also,
the Government set up the supervisory framework for the private pension fund administrators and
issued the investment rules to be followed by the pension funds. Section C below summarizes the
key accomplishments of this initial stage of reform implemented during 1995-1996, and supported
by the World Bank's fist Contractual savings development Program Loan (CSDP I).
2.6   The remaining agenda. Full realization of the objectives of the reform depend on the
consolidation and fine-tuning of the reforms initiated during 1995-96, on maintaining the
necessary flexibility to cope with implementation challenges, as well as addressing a number of
design limitations. The remaining agenda needs to address the following strategic issues:
c Increase the efficiency of the reformed system to lower administrative costs and
augment the amount of funds available for investment. This challenge entails:
the successful operation of the AFORE industry, including authorization, affiliation,
and switching;



MEaCO - SECOND CONTRACTUAL SA vINGSDEVELOPMENTPROGRAM (CSDP 11)                  5
* the smooth and efficient operation of the new centralized system for collection,
individualization of accounts, and record-keeping;
* The development of pension performance benchmarks for investment return and
pension plan service.
* Ensure that CONSAR continues delivering:
* A flexible regulatory environment - able to respond to the changing needs of the
reformed system. Key short-term actions include the issuance of rules relating to: (i)
switching among AFOREs (traspasos); (ii) disclosure; (iii) transfer of SAR 92
balances into individual accounts; and (iv) orderly consolidation of the industry; and
* A strong supervisory framework with enhanced enforcement capacity.
1 Create the conditions for adequate risk-adjusted returns for AFOREs. Critical to
contain fiscal costs for transition generation and to ensure adequate retirement income to new
generations. The focus should be on:
* fine-tuning the investment regime and expanding investment opportunities; and
* Strengthening risk management systems.
D Design and implement mechanisms to ensure a competitive return to the contributions
channeled to the housing sub-account (INFONAVIT). The reform will not fully succeed
unless adequate returns can be assured on the 5% contribution to INFONAVIT - which
represents 37% of total contribution for a worker earning the average wage.
> Improve the efficiency of the provision of life and disability insurance and foster
continued delvelopment of the insurance industry and annuities markets. Disability and
life continues to be provided by IMSS with a fixed charge of 2.5% of payroll. The cost is
high compared to that observed in other Latin American countries that have opted for
allowing competition by pension fund mangers and the purchase of the insurance from an
insurance company.
*  Continue monitoring of fiscal cost estimates, including sensitivity analysis. The Mexican
plan is riskier on the fiscal side than the approach followed in other Latin American countries
because the Government's liability is uncertain. The reformed system allows for a lifetime
switch between the old and new system for every transition worker. Mexican fiscal costs, as
compared to Chile's, for example, could be (i) higher, if returns on individual contributions
(AFORES + INFONAVIT) are not high enough to ensure that a large number of transition
workers choose, at retirement, the new system, but could be (ii) lower, because Mexico is
saving the cost of recognition bonds if the market value at retirement of individual
accumulated balances exceeds accrued benefits under the old PAYG system. Also, the
Government did not restructure the current PAYG system as part of the 1997 reform and it
continues to be a nominal system with many structural weaknesses that make the results of
the reform program very sensitive to the future rate of inflation.
* Sustain the public confidence in the system by building public support and confidence in
the new pension system so as to avoid evasion and attract informal workers.
* Accelerate complementary financial sector reforms to ensure an adequate supply of
quality financial assets available for pension fund investment and support the development of
financial infrastructure needs (such as custody services and rating agencies).

* Expand the reform to Public Sector workers. The current reform did not contemplate
changes to the ISSSTE, PEMEX, other parastatals, armed forces, and the state pension plans.
Hence, the portability constraint across private and public sector workers' pension plans will
remain for now an issue along with the financial disequilibrium to be faced in the future by
these pension funds.
* Expand coverage. One of the longer-term objectives of the Mexican reform is to extend
coverage and minimize the incidence of old-age poverty. Even in Chile, where the AFP
system has been in full operation for nearly 16 years, that portion of the economically active
population that is informally employed has increased from 49.9% in 1990 to 51.2% in 1995.
This suggests that the removal of labor-market distortions via pension reform, may be a
necessary but not sufficient condition either for formalization of the factors of production, or
for widespread participation in the privatized pension system.
* Allow investment in equities and in foreign securities. The explicit legal prohibition on
investment in foreign securities was introduced by Congress as an amendment to the draft
legislation proposed by the Executive branch. This prohibition is based on the argument that
it would not be desirable to channel abroad long-term savings required by the domestic
economy. However, this prohibition restricts the possibility of diversifying the investment
portfolio and inhibits diversification of country risk.
C.   World Bank Support: A Phased Reform Approach
2.7   The World Bank's support in the area of contractual savings in Mexico began in 1990
with the preparation of an economic report, which provided a detailed analysis of contractual
savings issues. The proposed loan is the outcome of a close dialogue between the Bank and the
Government on the development of Mexico's financial sector and the need to improve the
allocation of financial resources and set the basis for the effective channeling of domestic
savings. The Bank's participation accelerated in late-1994 with the provision of advice and
technical support in the area of pension reform and capital market development. This culminated
with the decision to support the Mexican Government's reform objectives through a series of
one-tranche adjustment operations.
2.8   To provide a strategic framework, this section highlights: (i) policy actions supported
under the first Contractual Savings Development Program Loan (CSDP I) - approved in
December 13, 1996; (ii) policy actions supported by the proposed CSDP II; and (iii) the key
benchmarks of further progress in addressing remaining issues (para. 2.6) which could be
supported in follow-up operation (s). The Policy Matrix in Annex II provides additional details
on the medium-term framework.

D  strengthen CONSAR's independence;
*  introduce greater portfolio diversification including investment in equities;
D  design and implement measures to contain the administrative costs of the system;
D implement measures to reduce the cost of the disability and life insurance scheme;
. ensure the financial viability of the pension schemes for public sector workers; and
. identify specific actions to increase coverage if reformed system has no significant
impact.
D.   Key Accomplishments under the First Phase of the Contractual Savings Reform
2.9    The reform covers private sector workers and self-employed - approximately 12 million
contributors. These workers represent approximately 80% of the labor force in the formal sector. It
is estimated that approximately US$4 billion will flow into the system annually (Figure 1).
2.10    Along the lines of recent pension reform programs in Latin America, the Mexican design
is based on a multipillar approach to old age security. The reformed scheme consists of:
* a publicly managed first pillar with a redistributive objective providing a guaranteed
minimum pension equal to the indexed minimum wage for low-income workers
meetingJ the legal requirements;
*  a fully-funded second pillar with mandatory individual savings accounts and
competitive, but exclusive and specialized, mutual fund management, and
* a third pillar consisting of voluntary savings.
2.11  Legal Framework. In December 1995 the Mexican Congress approved legislation (the
new Social security law - Ley del Seguro Social) modifying the public PAYG, defined benefits



8                                                                   PRESIDENT'SREPORT
scheme to establish a privately managed, mandatory, defined contributions scheme permitting
private management for private sector workers affiliated to IMSS. A second legislative package on
the implementation of the reforms (the Pension Systems Law - Ley de los Sistemas de Ahorro para
el Retiro) was enacted in April 1996. Legislation was also approved in December 1996 to make the
legislative framework for the housing scheme (INFONAVIT) consistent with the new pension
system. The reform became effective on July 1, 1997.
i ~~~12
2  6
2.12 Institutional responsibilities. Individual retirement funds (SIEFORES -Sociedades de
Inversion Especializadas en Fondos para el Retiro) are administered by investment management
firms (AFORES - Administradores de Fondos de Ahorro para el Retiro) established by the
private sector and IMSS. INFONAVIT retains the 5% housing sub-account and will provide
returns based on its operating surplus. IMSS, in addition to managing one of the AFOREs,
continues to be the legal enforcer of all contributions and collections, the provider of benefits to
transition workers choosing the old PAYG system; and the administrator of disability and life
insurance - although benefits are provided by private insurers.
2.13 Eligibility, contributions, and benefits. The reform separated the old age, severance,
and disability and life system (JVCM - Jnvalidez, Vejez, Cesantia, y Muerte) into the Old Age
and Severance insurance (RCV - Seguro de Retiro, Cesantia en Edad Avanzada, y Ve]ez) and the
Disability and Life Insurance (IV - Seguro de Invalidez y Vida). Each worker's individual
retirement account consists of two compulsory sub-accounts, the RCV sub-account managed by
the AFORES, and the INFONAVIT sub-account. Under the reform, contributions to old age and



MExCO- SECOND CONTRACTUAlLSA VINGSDEVELOPMENTPROGRAM (CSDP 11)                   9
severance in the AFORES' individual accounts equal 6.5% of a worker's wage and a
Government contribution known as the social quota. The social quota equals between 1 and
5.5% of the worker's wage depending on the level of each workers' wage and will be indexed to
the July 1, 1997 CPI. On average it will be equivalent to 2.2% of wages. It will be transferred to
each worker's account to which active contributions are being made. Transition workers have
the right to transfer their past SAR92 balances into the chosen AFORE. Contributions to the
INFONAVIT sub-account, equal to 5% of a worker's salary, will continue to be invested in
INFONAVIT housing. Total contributions for retirement, therefore, amount to between 12.0 and
17 percent of a worker's wage - for the worker earning the average wage (approximately 2.8
times the minimurn wages) contributions represent approximately 13.5% of the wage.
2.14 For workers who do not choose an AFORE, contributions go to a Central Account
(Cuenta Concentradora) kept at the Central Bank (Banco de Mexico) for a maximum period of
four years. A 2%Xo real return on accumulated balances is guaranteed. At the end of the four
years, CONSAR will assign an AFORE to each affiliate.
2.15  Benefits uader the new system fall into two groups: benefits to new workers and benefits
to transition workers. For new workers - defined as those beginning their contributions to the
system after July 1, 1997 - benefits will consist of the accumulated balances in their individual
retirement accounts (AFORES plus INFONAVIT accounts) or the Minimum Pension Guarantee
(MPG) to equal to the minimum wage in Mexico City as of July 1, 1997, indexed to the
Consumer Price Index (CPI). At retirement, workers will choose between a gradual withdrawal
option or buying en annuity from an insurance company.
2.16  Transition workers are defined as those workers contributing to the PAYG system prior
to July 1, 1997. Although all workers began contributing to their new individual retirement
accounts, transition workers retain the right to the benefits of the old system exclusively in the
case of retirement (lifetime switch option). The lifetime switch option allows transition
generation workers to choose at retirement the higher of the acquired benefits under the old
PAYG system and the accumulatfu balances in their individual retirement accounts under the
new system (AFCIRES plus INFONAVIT accounts). Accumulated balances in the INFONAVIT
sub-account (accumulated between 1992 and August 1997) and the SAR92 balances
(accumulated between 1992 and August 1997) will be surrendered to transition workers upon
retirement regard:less of which pension scheme they opt for. If the old system is chosen, the
MPG is equal to one Mexico City minimum wage indexed to the actual minimum wage.
2.17 The Government provides the MPG to both transition and new workers in the event that
the value of the worker's accumulated savings in all retirement accounts is inadequate to provide
for the minimum pension. The Government contribution will only be equal to the difference
between the MPG and funds available in the individual retirement accounts. The years of
contributions required for eligibility for the MPG were raised from 10 to 25 years (1250 weeks).
2.18  Supervision. The Pension System Law gives CONSAR (Comisi6n Nacional del Sistema
de Ahorro para el Retiro) broad powers to set and enforce rules and standards for all aspects of
operation of the reformed pension system. CONSAR has full supervisory authority over
AFORES and SIEFORES, as well as supervisory authority over other participants in the pension



10                                                                              PRESIDENT' SREPORT
system (such as banks and insurance companies) to the extent the activities of such entities
involve the pension system.
2.19 Administration. The key characteristics of the AFORE industry are as follows:
*  Nature and control of AFOREs. AFORES are single-purpose business corporations with
independent capitalization and minimum capital and special investment reserve requirements.
The paid in capital and special reserve are required to be invested in shares of the SIEFORES
managed by the AFORE.
*  Foreign ownership. Regulations allow for a class of AFORES majority-controlled by foreign
financial institutions (but not individuals or industrial concerns) to up to 49% of the capital of
the AFORE. Financial institutions from NAFTA countries, Colombia, Costa Rica and
Venezuela may establish majority-owned AFORES.
*  Conflicts of interest. The Pension Systems Law establishes strict limitations on permissible
transactions between AFORES and affiliated financial institutions and issuers.
*  Initially Single Class of SIEFORES.  The Pension Systems Law authorizes CONSAR to
permit each AFORE to manage and offer to its customers a variety of SIEFORES with
different portfolio compositions, provided that each AFORE offers at least one SIEFORE
whose portfolio is composed "fundamentally" of securities whose returns are indexed to the
Mexican CPI. There are no minimum return requirements for the AFORES. At the outset
CONSAR will allow each AFORE to establish only a single SIEFORE, "fundamentally"
invested in indexed instruments. CONSAR intends eventually to permit each AFORE to
offer customers a variety of equity and debt funds with distinct investment policies. This
decision to restrict each AFORE to only a single debt fund at the outset reflects the
government's desire to simplify supervision in the first year of pension fund operations,
reduce potential confusion among the public and build public support by avoiding volatility.

MEXICO - SECOND CONTRACTUAL SA VINGSDEVELOPMENTPROGRAM (CSDP II) 11
IH. THE SECOND PHASE OF THE CONTRACTUAL SAVINGS PROGRAM
3.1   The policy actions supported by the proposed second Contractual Savings Development
Program Loan (CSDP II) include:
(A) implementing, consolidating, and fine-tuning the reformed pension system for
private sector workers by:
(1) Ensuring a flexible and responsive regulatory framework:
(2) Initiating operation of the reformed system and increasing its efficiency:
(a) AFORE industry authorization, affiliation, and switching;
(b) smooth and efficient operation of new centralized system for
collection, individualization of accounts, and record keeping;
(c) Identifying opportunities for cost cutting and development of pension
performance benchmarks;
(3) Transferring SAR92 balances from the Central Bank to individual AFORE
accounts;
(4) Fine-tuning investment policies and improving risk management;
(5) Strengthening supervision and enforcement; and
(6) Initiating provision of disability and survivors benefits by private insurers.
(B) updating estimates of the fiscal costs of transition, including sensitivity analysis;
(C) deepeining reforms to INFONAVIT to ensure adequate returns on the housing sub-
account;
(D) advancing in the technical preparatory work for the public (ISSSTE) and State
pension systems by finalizing in the actuarial and financial diagnosis and evaluating
alternative reforn strategies;
(E) sustaining public confidence through education and information; and
(F) advancing in the implementation of complementary financial market initiatives
in: (1) the banking sector; (2) mutual funds; (3) occupational and voluntary pension
plans; and (4) the development of new instruments in the long-term Government debt
market, the corporate debt market, and the housing mortgage market.
The main issues in these policy areas and the Government's response are described below.
A. Implementation and Consolidation of the 1997 Pension Reform
Al. Regulatory Framework
3.2   Timely and flexible regulation of pension funds by CONSAR will play a major role in
ensuring the success of the reform. Though justifiable as initial conditions or explained by the
fragility of the financial sector and political constraints, some features of the initial regulatory
framework may limit the most productive long term investments and/or require more flexibility
as the system evolves. Short-term actions include the issuance by CONSAR of rules relating to:
(i) disclosure; (ii) administration of individual accounts in Central Account (Cuenta
Concentradora); (iii) limits in market share; (iv) switching among AFOREs (traspasos); (v)



12                                                                 PRESIDENT' sREPORT
collection; (vi) commissions; (vii) transfer of SAR 92 balances; (viii) investment management;
and (ix) sanctions.
3.3   To ensure the flexibility of the regulatory framework and to respond to additional
regulatory needs after the initial implementation of the reform, CONSAR has issued a number of
key regulations (Circulares) since January 1997 (see Technical Annex Table A13 for a listing of
key regulations issued by CONSAR as of March 13, 1998). This section will focus on
regulations relating to disclosure and administration of individual accounts still in the Central
Account. Rules and guidelines relating to the other areas are discussed later in the relevant
sections.
3.4   Disclosure. In the reformed system there are three main flows of information: from the
participants in the operation of the system (AFOREs, SIEFOREs, PROCESAR) to CONSAR;
from the AFOREs to the affiliates; and from CONSAR to the affiliates and to Congress (See
Table Al 3 in technical Annex for a list of reports required by CONSAR). The key regulations
issued by CONSAR relating to disclosure [Board Presentation la] include guidelines for:
o general information disclosure from entities involved in the operation of the system to
CONSAR (Circular 19-1 [11/17/97]);
* accounting and balance sheet information to be sent by AFOREs and SIEFOREs to
CONSAR (Circulars 12-1 [4/16/97] and 12-4 [3/11/98]);
* the monthly report to be sent by each AFORE to CONSAR (Circular 25-1 [12/11/97]);
* general information disclosure by AFOREs to affiliates and the public in general (Circular 9-
1 [1/10/97]);
 prospectus for each SIEFORE (Circulars 10-1 [1/14/97] and 10-2 [6/30/97]);
* Individual Statement to be sent to workers' with the financial performance and balances of
the AFORE and INFONAVIT accounts (Circular 8-2 [2/12/98]). A sample of the required
format is contained in Table Al4a of the Technical Annex; and
o Confidentiality of individual account information by entities involved in the operation of the
system (Circular 23-1 [12/2/97]).
3.5   "The AFORE maquiladora": administration of individual accounts still in the
Central Account. As of the end of February 1998, 2.3 million workers had not yet chosen an
AFORE and their accumulated balances are currently in the Cuenta Concentradora held at the
Central Bank (para 2.12). CONSAR has issued rules relating to the outsourcing of informnation
to workers in the Cuenta Concentradora (Circular 27-1 [2/20/98]) [Board presentation lb(i)].
This service is to be provided by.the AFOREs - under a scheme to be called AFORE
Maquiladora. The regulation also determines the principles upon which interested AFOREs will
be assigned these accounts (initially, it is based on the number of CURPs generated by the
AFORE as of September 30,1997). The AFORE maquiladora will charge a fee of 1. 15% of flows
(according to general guidelines issued by CONSAR in Circular 29-1 on February 27, 1998)
[Board Presentation lb(ii)]. These workers' individual accounts at the Central Bank will
continue to pay a return of 2% above inflation - compared to the 6% real return currently posted
on average by the AFOREs. It is expected that this system will foster additional affiliation to the

AFORE system, since it will allow the AFOREs to access the database of workers still remaining
in the Cuenta Concentradora.

A2. Operation and Efficiency of the New Pension System
(a) AFORE industry authorization, affiliation, market share limits, and switching rules
3.6    Authorization process.  CONSAR  has authorized 17 AFOREs in a timely fashion,
ensuring that foreign-owned AFOREs receive equal treatment with Mexican-owned AFOREs
[Board presentation 2a] (Table 1 above).
3.7    Affiliation Process. CONSAR issued the general rules governing the affiliation contract
between the worker and his/her chosen AFORE on February 18, 1997 (Circular 11-1) [Board
Presentation 2bl. Since then, there has been an extremely positive initial response to the new
system - as demonstrated by the affiliation of over 98% of potential workers by end-February
1998 (Figure 2a) '. In early 1997, the expectation was for approximately 60% of potential IMSS
affiliates to choose an AFORE during the first year of operation of the system [Board
'Note that the size of the market was subsequently increased (para. 3.9).

3.8    Market share limits and concentration of the industry. The law stated that for four
years - beginning in 1997 - there would be a 17% maximum market share limit for each AFORE.
This limit could then be increase to 20% after 4 years. CONSAR issued regulations which
determine that the limit is determined in terms of number of workers affiliated to IMSS registered
in each AFORE. To assure that no AFORE receives an unfair competitive advantage, CONSAR

3.9 The originval estimate of the potential IMSS affiliates for 1998 - based upon which the
initial 17% limit on the market share of AFOREs was calculated - was 11.7 million workers.
During the initial months of implementation, it has became clear that this number did not include
"inactive" workers, i.e., those workers who affiliated to an AFORE but are not currently
contributing to the social security system. Inactive workers are currently estimated at

approximately 3.2 million workers. As a result, CONSAR will issue a circular specifying that
the actual market consists of the current active workers - contributing bimonthly - and those
IMSS workers that contributed to the system between 1992 and 1997 but are not currently
contributing to the new system. This entails an increase in the potential affiliates to the new
system to 14.82 million affiliates (Figure 4).

(January 8, 1998) regulating the switching of workers' accounts among AFOREs [Board
Presentation 2d]. A heated debate preceded the publication of these rules. As could be expected,
the smaller AFOREs felt that affiliates should be presented with as few barriers as possible in
order to be able to switch funds (e.g., avoid excessive bureaucracy). The larger AFOREs, on the
contrary, would have liked to see stronger barriers to switching. The experience of Chile and
Argentina - where almost 30% of total cost accounts for vendors (promotores) trying to
encourage switching among fund administrators - highlights the importance of regulating and
limiting the cost of this process. In this context, there is a consensus that the one year limitation
for switching - expect in cases where the commission structure is modified - is an improvement
over other reforms.  Tables A17a and A17b in the Technical Annex describe in detail the
switching scheme - through an intermediary or directly between AFOREs, respectively.

(b) Smooth anad efficient operation of new centralized system for collection,
individualizationL of accounts, and record keeping
3.11  Mexico decided to follow a centralized scheme for contributions collection and
information gathering. Despite its theoretical advantages, the Argentinean experience has shown
that this kind of scheme might lead to operational and incentive problems. The Mexican version
of this process faced a critical problem in the worker's ID number - which was one of the key
factors behind the failure of the SAR 1992 reform. There are other risks present in the
Argentinean scheme that may appear in Mexico, increasing operation costs and reducing the
workers' balances: delays in the flow of money and information due to excessive operations or
identification problems in the national data base.
3.12  The enactment by the Assembly on October 28, 1996 of legislation postponing the
implementation of the social security reform from January 1 to July 1, 1997 sought to address
this concern. At that time, the Government felt it was not ready with the unique identification
system, which is essential to avoid evasion, ghosting etc, and had not yet addressed all issues
relating to systems for collection of contributions and their transfer to the AFORES. Also, at that
time, the Mexican authorities, decided that it was necessary to install a more powerful system for
individualization of accounts and to move towards a centralized and more reliable and
accountable computer-oriented scheme for the payment of contributions.
3.13  The objectives of the integrated collection system are to guarantee the quality of the
information in the individualized accounts; integrate collection of all social security payments
(including INFONAVIT contributions) in a unique contribution payment system; facilitate
payment by employers; and facilitate conciliation and control by social security institutions. In
fact, in a fully funded defined contribution system, information is as critical as the actual funds -
a payment without the correct information will not be deposited in the workers' account. The
specific operational requirements were: (i) a unique identification number for each worker; (ii) a
unique system for compliance with employers' obligations; (iii) the existence of appropriate and
homogeneous infi^astructure in the institutions receiving the payments; (iv) a centralized system
for the identification of individual accounts; (v) an efficient system for the reconciliation of
payments and data; (vi) computerized entry system for employers to avoid inconsistent
information; (vii) coordination among participants to the system; and (viii) a telecommunications
network to integrate all participants to the process.
3.14  Individualization and record-keeping responsibilities have been given as a concession to a
privately managed data collection firm (PROCESAR) that receives daily information on fund
flows and affiliates. PROCESAR was given authorization to manage the system's data base,
including the following obligations: (i) receive the information from the authorized banks on
payments received; (ii) reconcile this information with the funds deposited; and (iii)
individualize the lunds and ensure that they are deposited in the appropriate AFORE.
3.15  The basic tax collection activity for pension funds in Mexico requires that each covered
private sector employer determines what each employee owes, and then deducts this amount
from each employee's gross salary. At month's end, and within a pre-determinated number of
working days, the employer must deposit the amount owed at special authorized banks



18                                                                PRESIDENT'SREPORT
(Entidades receptoras). Individual AFORES and their agents do not have an active role to play
in the week-in and week-out grass-roots tax collection effort in Mexico (unlike in Chile). Table
A10 in the Technical Annex contains a summary chart of the information and money flows and
the institutions involved in the process.
3.16  To ensure the smooth and efficient operation of the collection and record-keeping
process, the following actions have been taken by the authorities:
.  Regulatory framework. CONSAR has issued the following Circulares regulating the
functioning of the collection and record-keeping system: 7-1 (1/9/97); 16-1(6/30/97); 20-1
(11/11/97); 22-1 (12/10/97); 20-2 (3/2/98) [Board Presentation 2e].
*  Unique identification number. In terms of account individualization, it was decided to
initially utilize the IMSS and gradually move to a more reliable identification number called
Clave Unica de Registro de Poblacion (CURP). The CURP is expected to eliminate
duplication of accounts and diminish transaction costs. As of February 28, 1998 over 4
million CURPs had been generated - equivalent to approximately 34% of potential accounts
(Table A12 - Technical Annex) [Board Presentation 211.
*  Computerized collection system. A Unique Autodetermination System (SUA - Sistema
Unico de Autodeterminacion) was developed and agreed upon by all relevant parties on May
27, 1997 [Board Presentation 2g]. The SUA consists of a computer (diskette-based)
software program for the reporting of payroll taxes (all social security payments and
payments to INFONAVIT). All employers with more than four employees are required to
use it. As of February 1998 all required employers are using the SUA.
*  Outsourcing of payroll tax collection function by IMSS. An agreement was signed
between IMSS and 12 special authorized banks (Entidades receptoras) relating to the
collection of payroll taxes and their transfer to the Banco de Mexico. Banks are required to
send the funds to the Banco de Mexico within 2 working days and the information to
PROCESAR within 3 working days (which will decrease to 1 day beginning in July 1998)
3.17   In the next several months, the authorities will focus on the following areas as part of
the fine-tuning of the system:
¢ Cutting costs. Currently the total costs for the centralized system is approximately 3% of
the flow into AFOREs, and it is shared by:
* IMSS: for affiliation, collection, and control
* Authorized Receiving Banks: for receipt of contributions and transfer of information
to PROCESAR
* PROCESAR: for processing, reconciling, and disbursing: The maximum
administration charge is NP$10.80 per account per year Circular CONSAR No. 14-1,
dated June 27, 1997) [Board Presentation 2h] Additional fees are charged for
specific operations performed by PROCESAR (affiliation, switching, etc.).
* Cutting time. Currently it takes approximately 10 days between the employers' payment of
contributions (t) and the actual arrival of the workers' funds into the AFOREs (t+1 0) to be
invested. Since PROCESAR is jointly owned by the AFOREs and the AFOREs start
collecting fees only when the funds are deposited in its account, there is an incentive for
PROCESAR to increase the efficiency of the system (Table 2 below).

Q  Assigning float to workers' accounts. Currently the float accumulated during the
individualization process (approximately 8 days) - while the contributions are held in the
Central Bank and earning 2% real interest rate - is being transferred to the Finance Ministry.
CONSAR has issued guidelines (Circular 22-2, April 29, 1998) for the transfer of the interest
earned on the contribution flow during this period into the workers' individual account in
his/her own AF'ORE.
(c) Identifying opportunities for cost-cutting and development of pension performance
benchmarks
3.18   In Mexico, the Government does not regulate the level or the form of commissions. On
average, commissions charged by
Mexican pension managers are

government minimum guarantee
3.19   The issue of cost cutting is particularly crucial in the case of Mexico, since the
contribution to the AFORE system is lower than in other DC schemes. Currently the average
worker's annual AFORES contribution (gross of fees) is estimated at about US$325/year (8.7%



20                                                                  PRESIDENT'SREPORT
of $312/mo2 - 6.5% plus 2.2% of the social quota). The average commission charged is
approximately 1.9% of flows, or approximately US$61 per account yearly. In even the rosiest
scenario - one consistent with rates at the lowest-cost institutional US mutual funds - a low-cost
AFORE might charge an administrative fee of $50 with investment costs close to zero. Even in
this best case, the low-wage Mexican worker would give up a substantial amount of his funds to
administrative costs each year, leaving him with only around $275 to invest in the pension per
year. Evidently such a low contribution level will not guarantee a very comfortable retirement,
even with reasonable real returns and a relatively long work period prior to retirement. The
minimum-wage earner would fare correspondingly worse.
3.20  Identifying opportunities for cost-cutting is merely a means to an end - namely, lower
administration costs increase the amount of funds that will eventually be available to pay benefits
to retirees (and their dependents). But because pension saving takes place over such a long time
period, it is useful to formulate a range of output standards when monitoring pension system
performance in the short and medium run. To this end, supervisory agencies charged with
oversight for pension plan behavior should delineate performance benchmarks regarding
investment returns as well as indicators of services delivered to system participants.
3.21   Since the Mexican pension funds now only offer a very standardized and limited
portfolio, and for the most part no differences in services, money management fees are the main
area where competition might occur. However, the commissions charged are difficult to
understand and compare. This is because the average plan participant faces a range of front-
loaded, asset-based, and return-based commissions that change in different ways through time
(Table 4). To make these comparable, one requires a model of contributions, returns, asset
accumulation, and holding periods.
3.22  CONSAR has finalized a study (October 1997) making these costs comparable [Board
Presentation 2i]. The study simulates eventual commissions paid and benefits received under
the different AFORES commission structures This requires assuming (i) a wage level and hence
a contribution level, (ii) a holding period, and (iii) a real rate of return and wage growth rate. In
the CONSAR figures, it is assumed that the hypothetical worker's pay is 3 times the minimum
wage (approximately the average pay of workers covered by the AFORES system), and real pay
growth is zero. Real annual investment returns in this simulation are alternatively set at either
3.5% or 5%, and the two holding periods considered are 25 and 40 years, respectively. These
computations also assume that the government's additional "social quota" is not included in the
contribution amount, and that the participant has a SAR accumulation of $4,000, immediately
transferred into the AFORES plan. Some illustrative comparisons of commissions charged under
the various AFORES are reported in Table 5 below.
2 Assuming lmw=30.2 pesos per day and assuming that the average worker earns 3mw. With a rate of 1US$=8.7
pesos, the monthly wage of the average worker is approximately US$312. The average bimonthly 8.7%
contribution into individual SIEFOREs is approximately US$54.

3.23   Since pension systems produce a number of services in addition to money management,
CONSAR is currently developing a set of indicators permitting the government - and more
importantly the plan participants - to judge a plan's performance over time on non-financial
criteria. Performance standards should include indicators of how quickly and satisfactorily the
system responds to participant queries, how quickly and accurately taxes are collected and
invested, how long it takes claimants to determine eligibility for benefits and start receiving
checks, and how the system detects and corrects fraud. Related issues include how well the
system can acquire SAR92 fumds accumulated under the prior retirement system's arrangement,
and whether people add their own voluntary contributions on top cf the mandated sums.

A3. Transfer of SAR 92 balances
3.24     Transition workers have the right to transfer their accumulated contributions in the
retirement sub-account made between 1992 and August 1997 to AFORES. The AFOREs will
maintain these funds (SAR92) in a separate sub-account - invested in the same portfolio as the
SIEFORE. Workers have an acquired right to a 2 percent real rate of return on these funds for
the first year if they choose to maintain their balances in the Central Bank.
3.25     To ensure the smooth transfer of SAR92 accumulated balances from the Central Bank
to AFOREs, CONSAR (Circular 24-1, 12/10/97); SHCP (Oficio No.305, 12/10/97) and Banco
de Mexico have issued detailed processes establishing the means to authorize transfers and to
ensure that contributors are informed about the transfer [Board Presentation 3a]. TableA18 in
the Technical Annex describe in detail the SAR92 transfer scheme.

A4. In vestment Policies and Risk Management
3.28   The long-term sustainability of the pension reform undertaken in Mexico is critically
dependent on the investment returns that are obtained by the AFOREs and the financial
performance of INFONAVIT. CONSAR is responsible for the regulations governing the
investments by the AFOREs. The only constraint on CONSAR is that it can authorize

investments only in domestic assets (the law does not allow international investments). The
investment regime governing the new pension system was issued by CONSAR in June 1997
(Circular 15-1, 6/30/97). Currently each AFORE is authorized to offer only one SIEFORE to all
its affiliates and the regulations governing the first SIEFORE are summarized in Table 7 below.

(I) Short-term obligations (less than one year maturity) must be rated in the top three rating categories by an authorized rating
agency; long-term obligations must be rated in the top two categories. CONSAR's Risk Analysis Committee will establish
criteria for when a rating from a single agency is inadequate and when commercial banks would be required to secure a rating
from an additional agency.
(2) The securities of banks that have undergone intervention by the authorities are ineligible for investment by SIEFORES.
3.29 The actual investments of the AFOREs as of March 13, 1998 are provided in Figures 6(a)
and 6(b). The AFOREs are largely investing in government bonds (CETES, BONDES, and
UDIBONOS) and the limit on private bonds (issued both by banks and corporates) is currently
not binding. Due to requirement that inflation-indexed bonds form a large part of the portfolio,
the AFOREs are investing proportionately more than the share of instruments available in the
market in UDIBONOS. Less than 0.25% of the aggregate investments are in bank securities and
less than 1% of the aggregate investments are in other private debt instruments. The average
annual rate of return obtained by the AFOREs as of February 28, 1998 was 21.5%, implying a
real annualized rate of return of 6.2%.

regime of the new system. Its                         A
activities have focussed on three issues: (i) the evolution of the investment regime; (ii) the
financial and market risks of the system and their management; and (iii) systemic problems that
could impact sound management of assets.
3.32 Regulations governing the investment regime. CONSAR has issued a number of
modifications and changes to the initial guidelines to address some of problems that arose once
the system became operational (Circular 15-2 dated 29 October 1997). [Board Presentation
4a]. The most important modifications made are discussed below.
*In vestments in Inflation-indexed bonds. A waiver was granted until the end of 1997 on the
earlier requirem-ent that at least 51% of the SIEFORE investments be made in inflation
indexed securities (the requirement that at least 65% of all investments be in governments
bonds continues). The reason for the waiver is that there were not enough inflation-indexed



26                                                                 PRESIDENT's REPORT
instruments for the SIEFOREs to invest in. It is expected that the Government's own
borrowing program from the market will provide these instruments over time.
*  Cash holdings. Earlier the SIEFOREs were not allowed to hold any cash balances. This
blanket ban on cash holdings created many operational problems for the SIEFOREs,
especially when there were any errors and omissions during the cash transfer process. In
order to simplify the process, the SIEFOREs are now allowed to hold up to NP $250,000 in
cash balances.
*  Repurchase Agreements. The requirement that SIEFOREs hold no cash also implied that all
the money received through contributions had to be invested immediately. This requirement
significantly constrained the investment plans of the AFOREs. In order to allow SIEFOREs
to better manage their cash positions and time their investments, CONSAR has issued
regulations allowing the SIEFOREs to invest in repurchase agreements or repos. The
amounts invested by a SIEFORE in repos is restricted to the lower of: (i) the amount
received in the most recent bimonthly contributions; and (ii) 10% of the overall assets under
management. For the next several months, the second constraint will be binding.
*  Asset Valuation. CONSAR earlier issued guidelines that the valuation of the asset holdings
of the SIEFOREs should be done on a daily basis using a vector of prices published by the
Bolsa de Valores - the Mexican Stock Exchange. It was soon discovered that the prices
received by the SIEFOREs and CONSAR were sometimes erroneous (and amended later by
the Bolsa on the following day) or sometimes were not available. In this situation, fresh
regulations were issued to clarify that the SIEFOREs were authorized to use the most recent
and accurate price vector available to report valuations.
* Others. CONSAR has clarified the earlier investment regulations so that the limits on
various investments should be adhered to at the time of investment. Changes in valuations
due to market movements do not constitute regulatory violations. This clarification is line
with international industry practice.
3.33  Risk management. In addition to providing the framework for the overall investment
regime, CONSAR also has responsibility to ensure compliance of the investment guidelines by
the AFOREs. CONSAR also needs to ensure the sustainability of the new system by getting a
measure of, and then requiring the AFOREs to manage the risks to which the investors' funds are
exposed. At present, there is a significant overlap between the compliance and risk management
functions of CONSAR. As a regulator, it is essential that CONSAR perform the compliance
function and provide regulatory procedures to resolve violations with guidelines. As regards risk
management, different participants in the system have responsibilities to manage different risks.
CONSAR should ideally focus on system-wide risks and the AFOREs should be held
accountable for portfolio and security level risks.
3.34 . CONSAR constituted two committees - the Comite de Analisis de Riesgos (the Risk
Analysis Committee) and the Comite de Valuaci6n (The Valuation Committee) to oversee its
operations in the risk management area [Board Presentation 4b]. Also, to achieve its
compliance function, CONSAR has put in place an extensive reporting system, which obtains
data from all AFOREs. The systems currently in place provide information to CONSAR about
the specific investments being made by the AFOREs. CONSAR is also developing systems that
would allow it to assess system-wide risks and allow it to identify potential trouble spots.



MEXICO - SECOND CONTRACTUAL SA VINGSDEVELOPMENTPROGRAM (CSDP ll)                27
3.35 In the area of risk management, issues remaining to be addressed include: (i) separating
CONSAR's compliance function from the risk management function, while focusing CONSAR's
activities on regulation and supervision; (ii) institutionalizing procedures to address systemic
risks - especially procedures to resolve AFORE mergers and bankruptcies; (iii) strengthening the
capacity of AFOREs to take on the risk management function internally; (iv) establishing
uniform standards of risk reporting by AFOREs; and (v) strengthening CONSAR's internal
capacity to oversee risk management function and provide institutional strengthening to
AFOREs, if necessary.
3.36  Broader financial sector issues. CONSAR also has a major role to play in addressing
some of the more miedium-long term issues in financial sector development in Mexico to resolve
some systemic problems with the objective of making the investment process more efficient and
effective. These aspects - which CONSAR is currently working on - include: (i) reducing the
time taken between the payment of contributions by workers and receipt by AFOREs; (ii)
improving the overall environment for investment by AFOREs; (iii) establishing a market
determined benchmark for performance evaluation and risk assessment of AFORE performance;
(iv) instituting a custodial system for AFORE and mutual fund assets; and (v) assisting in the
development of the corporate bond market and strengthening credit rating agencies.
A5. Supervision and Eforcement
3.37  Most outside observers, and many of the fund managers themselves, have judged
CONSAR's regulatory performance to be highly professional and effective. Within CONSAR,
the Direcci6n General de Inspecci6n y Vigilancia, a department that in 1997 accounted for
roughly 15.7% of the regulator's budget, is charged with the operational and financial
supervision of the new private pension system (See Table A14 in the Technical Annex for the
Organizational Structure of CONSAR). The department operates with a total staff of 55 and
carries out its supervisory function through remote, automated data analysis, validated by random
on-site inspections of the AFOREs. CONSAR has developed customized systems software that
feeds data on affiliation, the status of retirement accounts, SIEFORE investment activity, and the
eligibility of acquired instruments to the department's analysts on a daily basis. Financial data
on SIEFORE investment regulated by Circular 21-1, published November 11, 1997 [Board
Presentation 5a], establishes the methodology for the valuation of eligible investment
instruments.
3.38  The majority of supervisory functions are computerized, and operate in conjunction with
IMSS operating system. Since October 1996, with the formulation of a joint IMSS-CONSAR
working plan for the implementation and operation of the reformed system of social security,3 a
close working relationship has been maintained between the two agencies. Circular 16-1 and
20-1 published on June 30 and November 11, 1997 (see para 3.16) respectively, fornally link the
regulator's task of supervision of the AFORE system with the centralized collection
infrastructure established under IMSS and managed by PROCESAR. CONSAR's supervision
procedures are the only mechanism of daily financial surveillance that exists in the country, and
are supported by programs that perform crossehecks on data received electronically from the
AFOREs, PROCESAR and IMSS. CONSAR Circular 19-1 (11/17/97), specifies the data

28                                                                    PRESIDENT' sREPORT
required by the supervision department from each of the actors in the pension system, a uniform
format and a strictly enforced schedule for their delivery. In addition, Circular 25-1 (12/11/97),
sets out the data and format specifications of the monthly reports required of each AFORE (see
para. 3.4).
3.39  Over the course of 1997, the department developed instruction and carried out training
programs for its staff in both off-site monitoring and on-site inspection. The bulk of these efforts
at building the supervisory capacity of the staff have been financed with World Bank technical
assistance. When staff monitoring operational and financial data detect AFORE activity outside
the regulatory framework, the offending fund manager is notified immediately, and if the
infraction cannot be satisfactorily explained or resolved remotely, an inspection team equipped
with portable computers linked to CONSAR's mainframe is dispatched to deal with the problem
on site. To date all the infractions that are detected have been dealt with in 24 hours.4 Staff has
noticed that imposing swift penalties on even minor infractions has rapidly established standards
for the industry. If one AFORE is disciplined, the others quickly correct their own activity in the
area of infraction. CONSAR's expanded technical capacity has accelerated response time,
reduced the amount of human resources necessary for supervision, and contributed to the
viability of the system.
3.40  CONSAR is required to report once every six months on the operation of the new system
to Congress. The first such report was prepared in February 1998 covering the July-December
1997 period. CONSAR will also provide statistical information on the new pension system in its
bimonthly bulletins. The bulletins will have a wide distribution and can be accessed from
CONSAR's web page. CONSAR emphasizes that the statistical bulletin will follow the system's
development by providing data on each contribution cycle, and that it is intended purely for
disclosure. CONSAR will refrain from any formal economic or financial analysis in this forum
that could be perceived or implied as an endorsement by participants in the market. The first
bulletin will be issued by June 1998.
3.41   Regarding challenges ahead, of the supervision department's fifty-five staff, only
seventeen are available to monitor the activity of all of the new market's participants. When
compared with the human resources dedicated to supervision in other Latin American countries
that have established similar systems of private pension fund management, this is relatively
meager. Also, the number of workers participating in the system is equal to that in Chile and in
Argentina combined, adding to resource demands. The department's task will be further
complicated by the eventual introduction of additional SIEFOREs per fund manager, and the
corresponding evolution of the investment regime. The supervision department will soon need to
upgrade its software to automatically perform notification and follow-up tasks that currently can
occupy up to two or three days of a supervisor's limited time. CONSAR has identified the
increasingly binding constraints on its supervision staff, and plans to considerably expand the
department's capacity to monitor complex financial transactions in order to ensure that as the
investment activity of the fund managers becomes more sophisticated, that the regulator is able
to keep pace.
4 The majority of infractions have been related to tardy or erroneous delivery of the daily, weekly, and monthly data
required by the regulator.

A 6. Disability and Life
3.42  Under the reformed system, the risk of disability and death is covered by two types of
insurance: workers' compensation (Riesgo de Trabajo - RT) and the life and disability insurance
(Invalidez y Vida - IV).  When a covered accident occurs at the workplace, workers'
compensation applies. When the disability or death are not work-related, the life and disability
(IV) insurance applies. The IV system requires a fixed premium to IMSS of 2.5% of private
sector workers' payroll. IMSS retains responsibility over the certification of this line of
insurance. Private insurance companies pay benefits through annuities to all cases beginning on
July 1, 1997.
3.43   Coverage for IV benefits is conditional on 250 weeks of contributions to the national
social security system, and there is no minimum age for eligibility. However if the disability is a
" major" one (with 75% loss of function) only 150 weeks of contributions are required. Benefits
under the disability pension are equal to 35% of the average covered wage the worker earned
over the 500 weeks of contributions prior to the disability, adjusted by the CPI. However the
benefit must at least be sufficient to equal the government-guaranteed MPG. Survivor insurance
benefits are equal to, 90% of the disability pension for a widow, and dependents receive 20% of
the disability pension (30% if both parents are deceased).
3.44 The worker seeking disability benefits must go through IMSS certification. In both cases,
workers' compensation and disability and life, once the certification is provided, IMSS has the
responsibility of comnputing the present value of the annuity flow payable to the disabled worker.
IMSS must pay the worker or his beneficiaries a sum insured (suma asegurada) equal to the
difference between the cost of an annuity (monto constitutivo), based on the benefits mentioned
above, and the accumulated balance in the individual AFORE account. With the sum of the
accumulated balances and the sum insured paid by the IMSS, the worker or his beneficiaries
must purchase the corresponding annuity from a private insurance company chosen by the
worker. If the accumulated balance is higher than the cost of the annuity, the worker or his
beneficiaries can withdraw the excess funds or increase the benefits of the annuity. In any case,
if the benefits are lower than the minimum pension the government will put up the difference so
that the worker can purchase an annuity with an income flow equal to the minimum pension.
These pensions are adjusted annually according to changes in the CPI.
3.45  The Government is currently focusing its reform efforts in three areas: (i) containment of
the costs of the IV scheme; (ii) design of the technical and operational mechanisms and the
regulatory framework for the smooth initiation of payment of annuities by the private sector; and
(iii) analytical work toward the fine-tuning of the system.
3.46 Cost containment. On June 18, 1997 IMSS and SHCP signed an agreement (Convenio de
Entendimiento) by which SHCP commits to pay for the disability pensions for current pensioners
while IMSS commits to a maximum increase in levels of disability cases ("siniestralidad') not
higher than 2.5% relative to 1996 levels. Also, SHCP commits to a medium-term financing plan to
make up for the difference between accumulated balances in the individual AFORE accounts and
the required amnount to purchase the annuity for the period in which AFORE balances will not be
sufficient. As part of this agreement, an SHCP-IMSS Committee was established to follow up on

the levels of disability pensions and any modifications in the expected flow of funds necessary to
finance disability and survivors pensions.
3.47 Regulation and Supervision by the Insurance Superintendency (Comisi6n Nacional
de Seguros y Fianzas - CNSF). On January 3, 1997 the Insurance Law (Ley General de
Instituciones y Sociedades Mutualistas de Seguros) was modified to incorporate the changes to
the provision of IV benefits under the reformed Social Security Law and to make operational the
provision of such benefits by authorized private insurance companies [Board Presentation 6a].
In addition, the CNSF issued a number of regulations to make operational the new scheme
[Board Presentation 6b], including: (i) operational rules (Circular S-22.1, 2/13/97); (ii)
contractual documentation (Circular S-22.4, 3/31/97); (iii) format to be used by the insurance
companies in making their offer to the worker (Circular S-22.10, 6/13/97); (iv) rules on
additional benefits which private insurance companies can provide to the worker (Circular S-
22.3.2, 11/13/97); and (v) marketing rules (Circular S-22.1.3, 1/8/98). In addition, on March 5,
1998 a Department in charge of supervision of pension-related insurance (Direcci6n General de
Supervisi6n del Seguro de Pensiones) was established within CNSF [Board Presentation 6c].

A 7. Update of Fiscal Costs of the Transition
3.50   The full benlefits of a pension reform  are not felt unless the fiscal costs of the existing
unfunded system are made explicit to the extent possible and are funded through a credible
financing plan. As part of the design of the reform, the Ministry of Finance (SHCP - Secretaria de
Hacienda y Cr&dito Ptblico) developed in 1996 a model to 'estimate the fiscal costs of the
transition, including- sensitivity analyses under various assumptions. A detailed analy sis of these
costs, including an explanation of the model as well as sensitivity analyses under various
assumptions, is presented in Annex V of the MOP of CSDP I. SHCP has revisited these early

3.52   The Government has completed the 1997 update to the sensitivity analysis of the fiscal
costs of transition and the evaluation of actuarial methodologies and the database [Board
Presentation 7]. Also, pension related transition costs for 1998 have been included in the 1998
budget. Figures 8a and 8b show that the 1997 revised estimates of transition costs are slightly



MEXICO - SECOND CONT4RACTUAL SA VINGSDEVELOPMENTPROGRAM (CSDP 11)                 33
lower than the 1996 projections. This results from: (i) higher GDP growth rates; (ii) changes in
biometric hypotheses, particularly disability and mortality rates; (iii) lower than projected
increases in the minimum wage - which has led to lower payments to current pensioners; and
(iv) lower actual cojmmission levels (on average, 1.5% compared to 2% for a 50 year horizon).
B.    INFONAVIT
3.53  Background. As the largest of Mexico's special housing funds, INFONAVIT is an
important source of mortgage loans and potentially mortgage funds in Mexico's housing finance
system. Along with its critical role in housing finance, the reforms undertaken in 1996 by the
Government to the social security system have given a key role to INFONAVIT for ensuring
adequate pension income through positive real returns for contributors.
3.54 Under the reforms, the 5 percent contribution of a worker's wage to INFONAVIT
represents between 30 and 40 percent of total contributions to pension accounts. Hence it is
important that these funds earn positive real rates of return. Other benefits from positive real
returns include: (i) potentially lower fiscal costs as the better performance of INFONAVIT
increases total returns on individual accounts and lowers the probability that younger transition
workers will choose the old PAYG benefits over the new system, or that the Government will
have to provide the minimum pension guarantee to new workers; and (ii) the higher potential
retirement income by workers just entering the new system which could reduce evasion or
provide incentives for workers to join the fornal labor force.
3.55  As can be seen from Table 9, INFONAVIT accounts for more than 38% of the supply of
mortgages in Mexico. In 1997, INFONAVIT granted nearly 100,000 mortgage loans with a
value of P$11.5 billion. INFONAVIT's total loan portfolio at the end of 1997 amounted to over
US$10 billion. Using the new collection system of the pension reform, workers' contributions
and loan repayments for 1998 are estimated to reach P$22 billion (US$2.6 billion).

3.56 CSDP I. Se'veral measures were introduced to improve INFONAVIT's financial
perforrnance. They include:
A strengthenedl supervisory role for the National Banking and Securities Commission
(CNBV). CNBVI has initiated a regular supervisory process using procedures applicable to



34                                                                   PRESIDENT'SREPORT
similar financial institutions. It is recognized that CNBV's role remains constrained since
according to the INFONAVIT law, CNBV's functions are limited to the approval of
INFONAVIT's accounting system and its internal audit function. It is empowered only to
report irregularities to the SHCP.
*  A stock taking of INFONAVIT's portfolio by external international auditors. As a first
step, CNBV commissioned an external audit and portfolio review of INFONAVIT (KPMG
was the selected auditor). The audit was completed in March 1998.
*  Greater public disclosure. The Government will disclose to the general public as well as
contributors in their individual account statements the rate of return on pension accounts,
including the AFORES and INFONAVIT. Greater disclosure has already raised public
awareness about the quality of INFONAVIT's portfolio and its impact on workers' savings.
*  Changes in the INFONAVIT law (Article 43 bis).  The revised 1997 law allows
INFONAVIT to undertake "virtual" cofinancing arrangements for mortgages through
commercial banks and other financial institutions.  This will subject a portion of
INFONAVIT mortgages to commercial pricing and standards to loan underwriting.
Since September 1997, the Bank has been working with the authorities in carrying out technical
analysis focused on the performance of INFONAVIT's mortgage instrument and the quality of
its loan portfolio.
3.57  Key issues. The 1995-96 reforms did not constitute a fundamental change in the way
INFONAVIT operates. In many ways, INFONAVIT's role and operations work against the
creation of a modern housing finance system and social housing policy. Key issues include:
*  Profitability of mortgage portfolio. Real rates of return have been negative in past years,
including 1997. The overall portfolio is weak, characterized by an excessive number of non-
performing loans estimated at between 46 and 62%.5 The poor quality of its asset base
requires provisions in excess of INFONAVIT's equity.
*  Portfolio management. Collection efforts by INFONAVIT of its overdue loans have been
minimal as it relies on large annual flows from workers' contributions to remain liquid.
Existing information systems are inadequate and cannot easily identify workers' loan
accounts or track payments into individual accounts that are identified. The systems also
cannot differentiate among workers that are not paying and are in arrears from those that are
evading or those that qualify for grace payment options while out of the formal sector. More
importantly, INFONAVIT's accounting and financial management systems do not
distinguish between loan principal and interest payments.
.  Nature of mortgage instrument. Loans from INFONAVIT have outstanding principal
indexed to changes in the minimum wage. Borrower loan payments are adjusted to a
maximum of 30 percent of a workers wage at interest rates which range from 4 to 8 percent
based on the worker's wage. The protection provided under INFONAVIT's mortgage
instrument goes to both relatively lower and higher income wage earners. Given its current
structure the instrument is not commercially viable nor securitizable as the minimum wage is
policy instrument not subject to market forces.
Because of the nature of the mortgage instrument the classification of performing and non-performing loans do not
have the same implications as in a commercial financial institution.



MEXICO - SECOND CONTRACTUAL SA VJNGSDEVELOPMENTPROGRAM (CSDP II)                35
*  Lending practices. Modeling INFONAVIT's mortgages shows that many of its loans are
too large for the purchasing power of its lower income borrowers or to older, higher income
borrowers. Credit criteria do not give enough weight to borrower payment ability.
*  Distortions to, housing finance and social interest housing policy. Excessive lending
amounts have resulted in directing lower income workers as well as developers away from
more affordable housing options. Such practices have contributed to market segmentation
and act as a disincentive to market-based housing finance solutions. The implicit subsides
provided have been ineffectively targeted.
3.58 Recent developments. The extent of INFONAVIT's problems as revealed by the
external audit, CNBV's supervisory efforts and the new disclosure policies has prompted the
Government to confront a long overdue restructuring of INFONAVIT's operations and finances.
Immediate concrete steps have been hampered by the lack of reliable loan account and income
recognition systerns. One of the first actions to be taken is for INFONAVIT to set aside
significant provisions amounting to more than P$30 billion. The size of the required adjustment
exceeded INFONAVIT's reserves and equity. After careful analysis of alternative actions,
CNBV was prepared to grant some supervisory forbearance provided INFONAVIT embarked on
a comprehensive reform and financial restructuring program over the next five years to return it
to financial soundness. These discussions with the Government and INFONAVIT culminated in
the recent signing of an intergovernmental agreement (the Convenio) dated March 27, 1998
signed by Secretary of Finance, the President of CNBV and the Director General of
INFONAVIT [Board Presentation 8a]. INFONAVIT's Board of directors approved the
Convenio on March 30, 1997. The Convenio was subsequently ratified by the Assembly of
INFONAVIT's shareholders on April 29, 1998.
3.59  Proposed Restructuring Program. The Convenio base represents a minimum set of
reforms that INFONAVIT must undertake immediately. The restructuring program covers the
following key areas:
Accounting reforms and prudential requirements. INFONAVIT has accepted new
accounting standards to be issued by CNBV which are consistent with the rules applicable to
commercial banks for mortgage loans (Circular 1343 and Article 1 of the Convenio) [Board
Presentation 8b]. CNBV has also required that INFONAVIT stop accruing and create
required provisions against interest and indexation on non-performing loans6[Board
Presentation 8c]. CNBV has adopted a new interpretation of INFONAVIT's law regarding
non interest expenses. With this new interpretation, current operating expenses will need to
be reduced significantly since they exceed the level permitted by law.
* Provisioning. CNBV has taken a conservative approach to provisioning. Under the
Convenio, INFONAVIT will provision P$30.4 billion, coming from: (i) existing provisions
(P$13.2 billion); (ii) equity (P$8.5 billion); and (iii) deferred provisions (P$8.7 billion)
[Board Presentation 8d]. CNBV permitted INFONAVIT to create a deferred asset to be
amortized over the next five years. If loan recovery improves, INFONAVIT will have to
demonstrate to CNBV's satisfaction that its financial performance justifies the reversal of
excess provisions. During the remainder of 1998 INFONAVIT will maintain parallel
accounting systems under its old and the new accounting standards. Beginning in January
6 Past due loans exceeding more than six months.



36                                                                PRESIDENT'S REPORT
1999 INFONAVIT will have to present its financial statements in full compliance with the
new accounting standards to be issued by CNBV.
*  Portfolio and individual account management. By January 1999 INFONAVIT will have
in operation a new portfolio management system designed to track individually service
performance of each loan, distinguishing between interest and loan repayments. It is
expected to trigger collection action and determine the quality of INFONAVIT's loans. The
new system will strengthen INFONAVIT loan origination activities and its financial
programming area by providing timely feedback on actual loan performance by type of
borrower. In addition, the new system will allow improved management of individual
accounts.
*  Changes in staffing. CNBV will maintain a permanent evaluation program to ensure
adequate staff and manager financial skills and compliance with agreed policies. CNBV can
recommend personnel changes should they be necessary.
*  Reengineering INFONAVIT operational processes. Based on the diagnostic work that
will be performed by external consultants and CNBV during 1998, INFONAVIT will start a
reengineering of its different operational functions, such as internal controls, loan approvals
authorizations, compliance with loan criteria and informational requirements, and loan
recovery actions. If needed, organization/structural changes would be started in 1999.
*  Loan recovery program. In lieu of opting for a good bank/bad bank approach INFONAVIT
will undertake a special loan recovery program with specific targets and timetable to be
strengthened, if needed, by outsourcing loan collection actions. The program will also track
delinquent borrowers who have exited the formal labor market.
*  Revamping of credit policies. Lending to high-risk groups which might entail losses to
INFONAVIT will be adequately provisioned against or discontinued by September 1998 at
the recommendation of CNBV. New credit guidelines will be developed and implemented
incorporating creditworthiness criteria, including adjusting the maximum amounts of credits
to reflect the borrowers ability to pay. The technical and financial standards used for
computing these amounts will be approved by CNBV. The new lending criteria, which will
give sufficient weight to favor borrowers with the capacity to make down payments, will be
presented to INFONAVIT's Board by no later than September 1998.
*  Reduction of operating expenses. INFONAVIT has committed to present a plan to reduce
its operating expenses gradually, starting this year, to comply with the law over a period not
to exceed seven years. The reduction in 1998 is agreed at about US$10 million.
*  Launching of pilot cofinancing program with commercial financial institutions. The
Convenio requires the management of INFONAVIT to propose the rules for this program to
its Board by July 1998. The rules proposed will have to be pre-agreed with these institutions
prior to their presentation.
*  Reform of treasury operations. INFONAVIT will establish an investment committee with
representation from professional financial experts from SHCP and SECODAM. New
policies and controls for managing INFONAVIT's liquid funds will be established. The
staffing and new procedures for this will be presented to INFONAVIT's Board, after prior
consultation with CNBV, by July 1998.
*  Revamping of Information Technology (IT) and Management Information Systems
(MIS). INFONAVIT will revamp its IT and MIS, focusing on the flow of information from
loan origination through loan recovery. The new systems will ensure linkages between



MEXCO - SECOND CON)TRACTUAL SA VINGSDEVELOPMENTPROGRAM (CSDP II)              37
various databases and a validation of historical data.  A full diagnostic study of
INFONAVIT's IT and MIS needs will be carried out along with definition of a time bound
implementation plan by December 1998.
3.60  Complementary Actions to the Convenio. Complementary actions will be implemented
in conjunction with the Convenio, including:
Strengthening governance. No changes to INFONAVIT's formal governance structure,
requiring legal modifications, are under consideration. The Government has taken or will
take a number of actions to address governance concerns. Among them are:
.  the approval of the Convenio by INFONAVIT's Board of Directors delegates
important decisions to CNBV, especially on the accounting, financial and personnel
fronts;
* CNBV's autonomy will be enhanced once new legislation is approved to transfer
control of its Board of Governors to the independent Central Bank;
*  SHCP is setting up a coordinating/steering committee for Government Board
members of INFONAVIT (SHCP, STPS and SECOFI) to ensure a coherent strategy
among such representatives at both Board and specialized committee meetings in
support of the reforms. The Government is also upgrading its representation at Board
meetings from the Director General to the Undersecretary level. A Monitoring
Committee made up of representatives from SHCP (Chief Advisor), CNBV (Vice
President) and INFONAVIT (Director General) will be established to review progress
weekly on implementing the Convenio;
* The Government intends to propose a policy of rotation of external auditors; and
* SHCP will prepare and implement a technical assistance program to carry out the
reforms and build institutional capacity.
-  Improving management capacity. Key appointments are to be reviewed by the Monitoring
Committee with the aim of selecting experienced and well qualified financial professionals
and managers. It is anticipated that in the course of the next few months the Government will
conduct an overall review, and further structural and organizational changes will be adopted.
*  Ensuring adequate returns to pensioners. INFONAVIT's law only requires INFONAVIT
to achieve a rate of return no less than annual changes in the minimum wage of Mexico City.
Since historically the minimum wage has lagged behind inflation, there is the possibility that
even financial performance complying with the law will yield a negative real return to
pensioners. Aware of his, the Government has agreed to use a benchmark indicator to
monitor this situation.
* Eliminating segmentation in housing finance. The Government's policy is to facilitate
INFONAVIT's current clientele that is bankable to obtain financing through the 43 bis
mechanism. This includes higher wage earners and borrowers eligible for the PROSAVI
program. Through the virtual cofinancing arrangement some INFONAVIT loans will be able
to utilize FOVI funding but benefit from direct loan repayment through payroll deduction
which is INFC)NAVIT's comparative advantage.
* Managing possible additional losses for 1998. Following the implementation of the new
credit rules, CNBV, with INFONAVIT, will review 1998 financial performance and require
additional provisioning, should it be necessary.

Defining enforcement plans. In addition to the powers granted to CNBV under the
Convenio, CNBV has expressed strong commitment to its enforcement, indicating that its
reputation as a financial sector supervisor is at stake. The signatories to the Convenio have
agreed that CNBV will withdraw regulatory forbearance if the terms of the Convenio are not
complied.
3.61  Compliance with the Convenio: CNBV's Implementation Arrangements. CNBV is
developing a set of financial performance indicators to follow up INFONAVIT's compliance
with the agreed clauses of the Convenio. Although it is still an ongoing exercise, the following
indicators are expected to be monitored: loan recoveries; past due loans; structure of loan
portfolio; operating expenses; leverage; loan-loss provisions; and financial performance.
3.62  Actions to be takenprior to CSDP II effectiveness include:
* establishment of an appropriate system of external financial controls beginning in 1999;
*  submission of a revised table of maximum credit amounts agreed with CNBV and approved
by INFONAVIT's Board of Governors; and
*  review of credit rules and loan rationing mechanism, and if necessary, submission of revised
rules to INFONAVIT's Board of Governors.
3.63 Bank Staff's assessment. A number of policy choices to reform INFONAVIT were
evaluated by the project team. From a technical perspective, introducing greater worker choice in
how workers' contributions in INFONAVIT are invested would have been the preferred policy
alternative along with deeper reforms which would change the institution's governance structure
and severely restrict its loan origination activity with the existing mortgage instrument and credit
rules. These reforms would have required important changes to INFONAVIT's law which, in
staff s judgement, were not feasible. The policy approach adopted by the Government through
the implementation of the Convenio could have a major impact on improving INFONAVIT's
operations and finances. It should be seen as a major step in the reform process which will lead
over time to the achievement by INFONAVIT of market rates of return for pension contributors
thereby bringing sustainability to this important component of the Government's social security
reform program.
C. Preparatory work for the Public and State pension systems
3.64  The 1997 reform did not contemplate reforms to the ISSSTE (Institute for Security and
Social Services for Government Workers - Instituto de Seguridad y Servicios Sociales de los
Trabajadores del Estado), PEMEX, other parastatals, and the state public pension plans. Hence, the
portability constraint across private and public sector workers' pension plans remains for now an
issue along with the financial disequilibrium to be faced in the future by these pension funds.
However, public sector workers only are approximately 2.5 million (Table 10). Thus, it should be
noted that the majority of covered workers (approximately 12 million) were included in the 1997
reforrn.

Source: 1996 Actuarial and Financial Valuation
3.66   In the preparatory work for the reform  of the public and state pension systems the
Government has advanced in the following two areas:
ISSSTE [Board Presentation 9a]:
The actuarial and financial diagnosis by an internationally recognized actuarial firm has
been finalized. The main conclusion is that the system is already facing a cash deficit,
estimated at P$3.7 billion in 1997 (approximately US$0.5 billion); P$4.6-4.8 in 1998, and
over P$6 billion in 1999. Contributions would have had to increase from 7.25% of payroll
to 14.95% to close the 1996 gap.
.  Given this financial disequilibrium  and the worsening demographics of the ISSSTE
population, the Government has initiated the detailed evaluation of the feasibility and the
fiscal transition costs of alternative reform strategies - supported by World Bank grant
financing.

States (32 pension schemes) [Board Presentation 9a]:
* In early 1997, the Government completed an initial survey of the available databases and
the actuarial and financial situation of the 32 public pension schemes at the State level. As
a result of this preliminary exercise, the Government decided to initiate an effort to institute
a minimum database in each State and to develop a standardized format for the actuarial and
financial valuation to be completed by all States.
*  During the first week of March 1998, the Ministry of Finance approved a standardized
format for the valuation (Proyecciones Demogrdficas y Financieras). These valuation
guidelines were designed through a joint effort of 7 actuarial firms. The Ministry of
Finance will provide the macroeconomic and financial hypothesis.
A Seminar is planned for early June 1998 to share with State representatives international
experiences on pension reform and the standardized formnat. This seminar will be
implemented with World Bank grant financing. The next step will be the application of
the standard format to the 32 State pension schemes.
D. Public Information
3.67 CONSAR is responsible for the dissemination of information about the new AFORE
system to the public. In the months leading to the system's start of operations the regulator
undertook a series of public relations efforts to educate workers on the premise behind the
reform, the mechanics of the system, and the role of its principal actors. CONSAR designed
information campaigns, ran advertisements on buses and billboards, recorded television and
radio broadcasts, released statements to the press, and closely monitored the content of
advertisements made by the AFOREs to ensure their integrity.' However, despite their efforts,
the authorities have been criticized for not communicating the fundamental changes to social
security brought about by the shift from the PAYG plan, to an individually capitalized, defined-
contribution system to the majority of Mexican workers. CONSAR is aware of the need for a
wider public education effort, but is constrained by the high price of radio and television
broadcast, that up to now, it has received at no cost by using non-peak airtime reserved for the
Government.
3.68  CONSAR has tried to bypass this constraint by designing information materials such as
brochures and video presentations that it latter disperses to the larger employers in the country
(employing 50 workers or more) and to job centers, in order to familiarize workers with the
benefits of the new system. Three separate promotional campaigns have been designed from
analysis of data gathered in worker surveys. Furthermore, in an effort to remain accessible to
employers, recently affiliated workers, and those considering affiliation, CONSAR maintains a
phone-in service to respond to questions and complaints. In addition, participants in the AFORE
system can go directly to CONSAR's headquarters to make their complaints in person: from
January to December 1997 CONSAR attended to the needs of 7,000 workers who visited the
regulator's headquarters. These efforts are being financed through the World Bank Financial
Sector Technical Assistance Loan (FTAL).
7 It should be noted that the bulk of fines levied on the AFOREs by the regulator in the months leading to full
operation of the new system, and shortly thereafter, were for misinforming the public.

E. Complementary Financial Market Reforms
3.69 The sustainability of the Mexican pension reform hinges on implementation of
complementary financial sector reform. As an integral part of the overall financial sector, the
performance of the pension system is linked to the health of the overall financial sector. The
Government recognizes this link and is undertaking a series of steps aimed at strengthening
various institutions in the financial sector. This section provides a brief overview of some of the
developments in the financial markets in Mexico. Annex V provides further details on the
reforms in these sectors.
El. Banking Sector
3.70 Mexico's financial system continues to be dominated by commercial banks and their
financial holding companies. These banks were hard hit by the devaluation of the peso in late
1994. The ensuing crisis in 1995 revealed and deepened the already poor asset quality in banks'
balance sheets. The Government has taken steps to restructure the banking system and increase
public confidence in the banking system, though at high fiscal costs (estimated at over 14% of
1997 GDP). The sector has been opened up to foreign investments, supervision and regulation
have been improved and universal deposit insurance (FOBAPROA) is now available. In addition,
several systemic issues are being addressed including the fiscal recognition of the costs of the
banking crisis.
3.71  In designing the new pension system, the Government took various steps to insulate the
AFOREs from the problems of the banking system:
*  The influence of the banks on the management of the AFOREs was minimized through
the requirement that all AFOREs be established as single-purpose separately capitalized
companies. T'he capital of an AFORE that is a subsidiary of a financial group is not available
to meet the obligations of other subsidiaries of the group.
* The extent of' pension fund investment in the banking sector was also limited by requiring
that SIEFOREs be permitted to hold a maximum of 10% of their assets in bank securities.
*  A regulation requiring that this 10% investment be made only in bank instruments with a
high credit rating (AA or above or equivalent by any of the three approved rating agencies)
ensures that the pension assets will be invested only in high quality instruments.
As of March 13, 1998, the AFOREs had invested an extremely small portion of their aggregate
portfolios (less than 0.25%) in bank instruments. The investments are in high quality short term
commercial papers. Hence, the limit of 10% of assets of each AFORE's assets is far from being
reached at the moment.
E2. Mutualfundts
3.72  As of January 31, 1998 the Mexican mutual fund industry consisted of 345 mutual funds
and 39 mutual ftnd operating companies, with total assets under management of $13.8 billion
with an investor base of about 321,000 investors. Almost $11 billion of assets are invested in
debt instruments and the balance in equities. The industry has been characterized by volatility in
both the number of investors and assets under management. The trend has been that individual
small investors have been declining and the funds have become more institutional. The number



42                                                                PRESIDENT'SREPORT
of investors has come down sharply since the high in 1993 and the industry is still recovering
from the impact of the 1994 peso crisis. The size of the industry, measured by the aggregate
amount of assets under management as a percentage of GDP, has been in the range of 3.2-3.4%
since 1995. Mutual fund shareholders in Mexican population is currently 0.3%, a fifth of the
population with bank accounts. This percentage has been gradually declining since the early
1990's. Performance data on an industry wide-basis along with an appropriate comparative
benchmark is unavailable.
3.73  The introduction of the private pension system has had a salutary effect on the regulation
of the mutual fund sector in Mexico. Recognizing the weaknesses in the regulatory structure for
mutual funds, the CNBV is currently considering reforms, which would bring the mutual fund
regulation more in line with the pension fund regulation. As part of the reforms, the CNBV is
considering the introduction of a mutual fund rating system along the lines of those published by
Morningstar in the US. These ratings are proposed to be done by the rating agencies.
E3. Voluntary pension plans
3.74  Several Mexican corporations have established voluntary pension plans for their worker's
over and above the mandatory social security programs. These schemes involve employee
contributions of between 2-6% with the plan assets managed by a bank or a brokerage firm.
These plans are essentially unregulated, although they are subject to certain broad portfolio
requirements by the SHCP. As part of the reform of the mandatory system, the new pension law
provided a framework to bring the voluntary pension plans under CONSAR's supervision.
CONSAR has recently issued regulations by which a voluntary pension plan can be registered
with CONSAR. Such registration is voluntary at the moment. Pension plans choosing to be
registered need to be certified as actuarially sound and maintain that status on an ongoing basis.
Participants of plans that register with CONSAR and subject themselves to its supervision have
significant advantages such as the ability to transfer their retirement accounts' at the AFOREs to
their private plan upon retirement and receive pensions under the terms of the voluntary plan. As
many voluntary plans provide pensions at an earlier age than the mandatory system, such
flexibility is attractive to the workers.
E4. Development of Long-Term Instruments and Financial Services
3.75  Long-term Government debt markets. Pension liabilities are typically long term and
the natural asset to hedge such liabilities is a long duration instrument such as long term bonds.
Mexico's Government bond markets are poorly developed and provide mostly short-term (less
than one year duration) bonds. Over 95% of all trades - both in the Bolsa and over-the-counter -
are in overnight securities. There is almost no liquidity in long-term instruments. While
historically, the cause of this underdeveloped state may have been the chronic inflation, it is
essential that now the Government considers development of this market segment.
3.76  Corporate debt market. The large presence of the banking sector in Mexico's economy
has traditionally implied that the level of intermediation has been very high. Most corporate
lending was from banks that in turn financed these assets from deposits. The presence of
institutional pension funds provides a natural alternate source of funds for high quality corporates
to raise funds. Development of a sound corporate debt market would provide another investment



MFUCO- SECOND CONTRACTUALSAVINGSDEVELOPMENTPROGRAM(CSDP II)                  43
vehicle for the pension funds. The investment regulations permit investment up to 35% in rated
private debt instruments. However, the actual investment by the SIEFOREs in private
instrumnents is very small (less than 1% up to March 13, 1998). Lack of adequate highly rated
corporate paper and the low risk adjusted returns on private paper are the main reasons for the
low level of investments in private securities.
3.77 Housing mortgage market. Long term securitized housing mortgages are a good
investment vehicle for pension funds, which have long-term liabilities. The availability of long-
term investors should also help to stimulate the housing market. However, the quality of the
investments depends to a large extent on the availability of appropriate instruments and
efficiency of the mortgage market. The Government is taking an active role in restructuring the
existing housing finance market. It is in the process of making the operations of FOVI more
market-oriented and the operations of INFONAVIT more transparent.
3.78    Financial Intermediaries. Credit rating agencies, custodial services, third-party
performance assessment services (similar to Morningstar and Lipper in the US) are some of the
other players in the overall financial infrastructure that are required for maximizing the economic
benefits of a privatized pension system. Mexico currently has three rating agencies, a central
depository that offers partial custodial services, and no independent performance assessment
agencies. The Gcvernment will examine these segments of the financial infrastructure and take
appropriate policy actions to assist in their development as part of the overall development of the
financial sector.
IV. BANK ASSISTANCE STRATEGY
A. Overall Assistance Strategy
4.1   Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). The loan is consistent with the CAS objectives of
growth, stability, and the modernization of the state set forth in the Mexico CAS (Report 16135-
ME) discussed by the Executive Directors in December 1996 and the recent CAS update
discussed by the Executive Directors on March 6, 1998. The proposed loan would directly
address the actions for reforming the pension system identified in the CAS and support several
other CAS objectives.
4.2   Other CAS objectives that will be supported by the proposed loan include growth, which
would be supported by (a) improving the incentives for employment in the formal sector by
lowering the burclen of payroll taxes; (b) increasing the efficiency of the pension system, thereby
reducing its distortionary effects on the economy; and (c) increasing long-term institutional
savings. Economic and social stability would be enhanced by improving the fiscal and financial
sustainability of the pension system, and by its contribution to social equity, a crucial element for
social and political stability. Modernization of the state would be enhanced since the reform
would aid Mexico in following other Latin American and OECD nations in reforming their
pension systems and guaranteeing workers a better retirement income.
4.3   Past Lending. The proposed loan represents the second operation in a series of three
one-tranche adjustment loans requested by the Government of Mexico aimed at supporting the
reform of its pension system and complementary financial sector actions. This is the product of



44                                                                PRESIDENT'S REPORT
several years of continued policy dialogue and sector analysis. Bank lending for pension and
financial sector reform in Mexico initiated in 1995 with the Financial Sector Technical
Assistance Loan (FTAL) and a Supplemental FTAL. These loans helped in the initial stages of
what later on became clear policy considerations to reform the pension system. Pension lending
began with the FY96 CSDP I (US$ 400 million) and, since then preparation of other related
lending operations was undertaken, specifically policy reforms in the health and housing sectors.
4.4   Future Lending. As indicated in the CAS, future Bank lending in the area of pension
reform is expected to incorporate a third Contractual Savings Development Program during
FY99/FYO0.
4.5   Experience with Adjustment Lending in Mexico.  The Bank experience with
adjustment lending in Mexico in the late 1980s and early 1990s has been mixed. Although most
of the development objectives supported by the operations were eventually achieved,
implementation lagged. Implementation delays were the results of the disparity between
expectations of quick adjustment disbursements and the deliberate pace in concluding sensitive
policy reforms. The main lesson from this experience is that adjustment operations should be
designed with broad-based Government commitment to policy reforms agreed with domestic
stakeholders and to carefully link disbursements to clear and significant policy reforms. Based
on the lessons learned, the proposed adjustment loan: (a) has been prepared by Mexican and
Bank teams in true partnership fashion, building on policy reforrns already underway, and (b)
will continue being supported by technical assistance (FTAL and Supplemental FTAL) which
closely track programs under the adjustment operation and provide timely technical input as
needed.
B. Coordination with the IMF
4.6   The policy reforms supported under this operation, and in particular the measures to
strengthen the performance of the private pension system - including the improved performance
of INFONAVIT - are congruent with the IMF's objectives in Mexico. Despite the lack of a
formal agreement involving the use of Fund resources, the IMF and the Government continue to
be in close consultations and are in general agreement over fiscal policy. The IMF has been
appraised of the progress of this operation and the policy reforms contemplated therein, and has
raised no objections.
C. Coordination with the IDB
4.7   Given the current economic situation, the IDB strategy for Mexico is divided into short-
and longer-term components. The IDB's short-term objective is to support Government efforts
to reestablish macroeconomic stability through (i) program lending aimed at assuring the
solvency of the financial sector and (ii) helping finance the basic needs of those most affected by
the crisis. To these ends, the IDB has cofinanced both of the World Bank's large crisis-related
operations: the Financial Sector Restructuring Loan and the Essential Social Services Loan. The
IDB cofinanced the earlier CSDP I with a US$300 million two-tranche adjustment loan.
Discussions relating to the disbursement of the second tranche (US$150 million) are ongoing.
4.8   The IDB's longer-term objectives are to support Government efforts to: (i) achieve
sustained economic growth, via infrastructure investments aimed at private sector development,
agricultural productivity growth, and human resources development; (ii) promote equitable



MEXICO - SECOND CONTRACTUAL SA ViNGSDEVELOPAMENTPROGRAM (CSDP II)               45
growth, through programs to reduce poverty and to improve the provision of social services
(education, nutrition, and health) --relying on and reinforcing the capacity of states and
municipalities and of the private sector; and (iii) achieve environmentally sustainable growth,
through programs geared to protect the environment and natural resources.
V.   THE PROPOSED LOAN
A.   Loan Size and Proposed Tranche Conditionality
5.1   Loan Size. A single tranche loan of US$400 million is proposed to be made available
upon loan effectiveness, anticipated for October 1998. The loan closing date would be June 30,
1999.
5.2   Proposed Tranche Conditionality. The policy actions below have been selected based
on their importance in the implementation of the new pension system and in the setting up of the
conditions for the expansion of the reforms to public sector workers. In addition to the specific
actions listed below, tranche release would be contingent upon: (a) maintenance of an
appropriate macroeconomic framework; and (b) satisfactory progress in the implementation of
the overall Contractual Savings Development Program which is outlined in the Government's
Letter of Sector FPolicy (Annex I).
5.3   The following policy actions were taken prior to Board Presentation:
1) Regulatory framework: CONSAR issued key regulations in the areas of: (a) disclosure

standardized format (para. 3.22);
3) Transfer of SAR92 balances: (a) CONSAR, SHCP, and Banco de Mexico (Central
Bank) have issued detailed guidelines to make operational transfer of SAR92 balances
(para. 3.25); and (b) transfer of at least 20% of accumulated assets in SAR92 accounts at
the Central Bank have been transferred to AFOREs (para 3.26);
4) Investment policies and risk management: (a) CONSAR has issued necessary

performing loans (para. 3.59); and (d) INFONAVIT has provisioned for its non
performing loans as required by CNBV and based on the findings of the external auditing
firm and CNBV's inspections (para. 3.59);
9) Preparatory work for the Public and State Pension systems (a) finalization of
actuarial and financial valuation of ISSSTE and initiation of detailed evaluation of
feasibility and fiscal costs of alternative reform strategies (para 3.66); and (b) finalization
of initial survey of data bases and actuarial and financial situation of 32 pension systems
at the State level and approval of standardized valuation format (para. 3.66).
5.4   The following policy actions on INFONAVIT would be taken prior to effectiveness:
(a) establishment of an appropriate system of external financial controls beginning in
1999 (para 3.62);
(b) submission of a revised table of maximum credit amounts agreed with CNBV and
approved by INFONAVIT's Board of Governors (para 3.62); and
(c) review of credit rules and loan rationing mechanism, and if necessary, submission of
revised rules to INFONAVIT's Board of Governors (para 3.62).
5.5   The third phase of the reform program is expected to focus on reforms in the relevant
institutions, in particular INFONAVIT, CONSAR, and the AFOREs to ensure the long-term
sustainability of the pension reform. Indicative actions are presented in para. 2.8 and Annex II.
The third phase is expected to be supported by a proposed third Contractual Savings
Development Program Loan to be presented to the Board towards mid-2000.
B.    Technical Assistance
5.6   The technical assistance requirements of this operation are being financed through the
Financial Technical Assistance Loan (FTAL) associated with FSRL I. In addition, a Policy and



MExCO - SECOND CONTRACTUAL SA VINGSDEvELOPMENTPROGRAM (CSDP HI)               47
Human Resources Development Fund (PHRD) in the amount of US$975,000 was approved on
July 26, 1996 to support the preparation of the second phase of the Contractual Savings
Development Program. A supplemental PHRD in the amount of US$975,000 was approved in
April 1998. Support through a technical assistance loan for INFONAVIT's restructuring
program is under discussion with the authorities.
C.   Disbursement and Auditing
5.7   Disbursements. The proposed second contractual savings program will be supported by
a World Bank adjustment loan of US$400 million, to be disbursed in one tranche. BANOBRAS
as the Borrower and financial agent for the loan would be responsible for submitting withdrawal
applications and would maintain separate records and accounts for all transactions under the
Loan. The Borrower will open an account in the Central Bank. Upon Bank notification of
tranche release, proceeds of the loans will be deposited by the Bank in this account at the request
of the Government. If after deposit in this account, the proceeds of the loan are used for
ineligible purposes (i.e., to finance items imported from non-member countries, or goods or
services in the standard negative list), the Bank will require the Borrower to either: (a) return
that amount to the account for use for eligible purposes; or (b) refund the amount directly to the
Bank, in which case the Bank will cancel an equivalent undisbursed amount of the loan.
5.8   Auditing. BANOBRAS will maintain separate records for all transactions under the
loan. Upon the Bank's request the Borrower shall have the deposit account audited in
accordance with standard Bank requirements.
D.   Lessons Learned
5.9   The main conclusions and principal lessons learned in the implementation of the first
phase of the CSDP (supported by the Bank's one-tranche CSDP I loan)8 are:
(i) The Importance of Borrower Ownership. As in any adjustment program, Borrower
ownership of conditionality under the loan is critical. Because of the Government's strong
commitment to reform of the pension system, the design, negotiation, and implementation of the
program were carefully carried out in a collaborative environment. Strong technical and political
leadership on the part of the Mexican authorities, complemented by a well qualified technical
team, provided a good context for taking full advantage of the Bank's advice and facilitated the
dissemination of lbest practice. The proactive nature of Borrower participation in the program
contributed to the credibility and the sustainability of the reform
(ii) Need for Sensitivity to Political Economy of Reform. The political economy surrounding
the formulation of labor policy has consistently constrained the reform agenda of even the most
resolute of governments. Social security reform is particularly treacherous, and especially so in
the midst of an election year, and a deep, although short-lived economic crisis. Political factors
and the legislative needs of the client need to be understood at entry, and should be included in
the Bank's dialogue with the client. In the case of the Mexican reform, the Bank's willingness to
lower its profile at the request of the authorities avoided the impact of domestic perceptions of
outside interference in the reform process.
' The ICR rates the outcome of CSDP I as highly satisfactory.



48                                                                  PRESIDENT'S REPORT
(iii) Selection of an Appropriate Instrument. Rather than risk delays and failure in the
achievement of the program's long term aims by locking the client into an overly ambitions and
politically sensitive policy agenda, the implementation team chose to negotiate a medium-term
reforn strategy, and to allocate its reform goals over a series of single-tranche adjustment
operations (STOs) - a lending vehicle design by the Bank specifically to protect the integrity of
lengthy adjustment operations from significant political shifts in borrowing countries. The
Bank's choice of the STO over the traditional multiple-tranche option provided the Bank with
greater agility in the disbursement of the loan, and enhanced efficiency and leverage in the
formulation of policy actions under the proposed second loan. So far the decision to agree on a
medium tern reform strategy supported by well focused STO's appears to be an innovative and
tactically appropriate response, suggesting that new Bank products can make the institution a
more effective partner in the development process.
(iv) Close Cooperation with Cofinanciers. Coordination with the IDB was continuous and
fruitful for both institutions and the client. However, in joint adjustment programs it is essential
to maintain highly compatible if not identical conditionality between the cofinanciers.
Conflicting conditionality can send mixed signals to the Borrower.
(v) Consistency in Objectives and Coordination between Bank Operations. In the course of
preparing and implementing complex sector operations, it is essential to orchestrate the
objectives of related Bank projects in order to ensure consistency and the achievement of
desirable outcomes. In implementing the first phase of the Contractual Savings Development
Program, and the complex financial sector adjustments required under CSDP I, both the Mexican
authorities and staff at the Bank relied on extensive work carried out under the preceding FSRL
and FTAL. Additionally, preparatory work for CSDP II related to reform of INFONAVIT, has
been carefully coordinated with the bank's team working on housing finance.
E.    Monitoring and Reporting
5.10  Monitoring and reporting will be facilitated through the close coordination of activities
and implementation agencies supported by the FTAL and technical assistance from the Bank.
Under the FTAL, technical assistance is being provided to assist the Government in
implementation of the overall program through CONSAR, CNSF, and SHCP.
F.    Benefits and Risks
5.11  Benefits. As with the CSDP I Loan, the implementation of the Government's contractual
savings development program, supported by CSDP II, will result in a number of important benefits:
a.  The change from an actuarially bankrupt defined/benefit system to a fully funded
defined-contribution scheme will increase public savings in the longer term. If the
current system were maintained, eventually the actuarial deficit would have to be met
with a subsidy from the fiscal account, an increase in contributions, or a decrease in
benefits. Analytical work on pension reform for public sector and state employees will
review options and help estimate the costs of moving to a financially sustainable
pension scheme for these workers.
b.  The separation of the pension and health sector schemes will result in greater pressure
to improve efficiency in the delivery of public health services. The efficiency of health
services delivery must improve to avoid an increase in contributions or a cut in
benefits.



MEWGCO - SECOND CONTRACTUAL SA VINGSDEVELOPMENTPROGRAM (CSDP /1)                  49
c. The reform has created a new class of institutional investors (AFORES) and an
increased volume of institutionalized saving. As institutional investors gain expertise
in managing pension funds, the allocative efficiency of domestic savings will increase.
In addition, institutional investor demand for long-term assets permits the possibility
of the development of markets for long-term financial instruments.
d. To the extent that institutional investors hold bank-related financial paper, a likely
outcome in the near term, these investors can play an important role in monitoring and
controlling bank risk by avoiding the paper of risky banks.
5.12  The pension reform is expected to have a positive social impact. Low-income formal sector
workers rely heavily on publicly provided pensions for sustainable post-retirement income
generally due to an insufficient accumulation of other savings. The establishment of SAR accounts
in the first phase of reforms in May 1992 provided many individuals with their first account with a
commercial bank. The Government's reform program is expanding access to financial services to a
broader base of the population and at the same time provides greater incentives for informal
workers to join the formal economy. Specifically, the implementation of the reforns supported by
the proposed operation will allow individuals to accumulate personal wealth, benefiting from
higher real rates of return in a broader range of investment vehicles improving post-retirement
living standards. The public information campaign being carried out has gradually increased
awareness of the benefits of the new pension scheme and change current perception so that
contributions are jperceived to be linked to benefits and an accumulation of wealth rather than as a
tax.
5.13  As workers retire under the reformed system they will buy annuities to convert the assets
accumulated in their pension accounts to yearly income to provide for retirement, which will
require the development of a regulatory framework for a private annuity market. This already
underway in the disability and life insurance areas. The growth of a private insurance industry will
create a broader irLstitutional investor base, which will support development of capital markets.
5.14  Risks. There are several major risks which could limit the effectiveness and impede the
success of the proposed pension reform program:
a.  slippages or inadequate supervision of private pension fund managers;
b.  the weakening of the banking system adversely affecting the reformed pension system;
c.  difficulties in establishing unique identification numbers for contributors and in
reconciling multiple accounts which would delay the implementation of the pension
reform.
d.  inadequate improvements in INFONAVIT's financial performance;
e.  slower-than-expected development of a long-term securities market which would reduce
the investment options of pension funds, potentially constraining their returns; and
f. lack olf sufficient fiscal discipline necessary to maintain a favorable macroeconomic
environment.
5.15  The track record to date on the first risk is very encouraging. CONSAR has been judged
to have effectively carried out its regulatory responsibilities. CONSAR has been and will



50                                                                  PRESIDENT'SREPORT
continue to be conservative in permitting new funds with different risk profiles while to
continuing to build its capacity.
5.16  To prevent the weaknesses of the banking system from adversely affecting the reformed
pension system, the Government's CSDP includes specific safeguards with respect to the
investment by AFORES in commercial bank liabilities. In addition, the Government has initiated a
second stage of banking reforms to ensure the restoration of the health of the banking system.
5.17  To preserve competition and reduce extreme reliance on financial conglomerates, the
Government has tried to facilitate broad entry and limit regulatory barriers in the establishment of
pension fund operators to stimulate competition. Limits included on foreign participation in
pension fund operators are only partial. In addition, these limits do not apply to a number of
countries with whom Mexico has reached agreements, including the U.S. and Canada under North
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Of particular importance have been Government
actions to permit each investment fund account administrator to sub-contract services freely in such
areas as collections and account processing.
5.18  Progress to date has been satisfactory in instituting a unique identification number for each
account holder and reconciling accounts for approximately 12 million contributors.
5.19 The Government recognizes the importance of improving INFONAVIT's performance to
ensure better retums for workers and minimize fiscal costs resulting from the minimum pension
guarantee. A strengthened supervisory presence by CNBV under the recently signed Convenio is
expected to help set the stage for a serious restructuring of INFONAVIT's operations and finances.
5.20  The risk of a slower-than-expected supply response for a variety of long-term securities is
being mitigated by: (i) reasonable prospects for macro-economic and monetary stability; and (ii)
improvements in the legal/regulatory framework for securities markets and mutual funds.
5.21   Finally, the potential for weakening of fiscal discipline will persist but is mitigated by both
Mexico's growth potential over the medium term and the significant amount of time remaining in
the term of the current administration which is strongly committed to these reforms. In addition,
the cost of the pension reform at between 1 and 2 percent of GDP has been adequately estimated
and is manageable. The low overall level of pensions and the favorable demographic structure in
Mexico are important factors which are helping to minimize the fiscal costs of the transition
compared with other countries in the region. Sensitivity studies using different rates of return and
actuarial estimates indicate that the range of costs fall within the scope of recent fiscal efforts and
are achievable both in the short and long term.
G.   Program Objective Categories
5.22 The loan belongs to the category of Economic Management by helping the Government
develop policy and tools to limit the fiscal impact of pension reform and stimulate growth in the
formal employment sector. The loan will also have long-term effects in Private Sector
Development by opening avenues for true private sector competition in the management of



MWCO - SECOND CONTRRACTUAL SA vINGSDEVELOPMENTPROGRAM (CSDP 11)                   51
retirement savings. Poverty Alleviation would also be supported through the extension of social
security coverage to informal sector workers and the self-employed.
5.23  Environmental Aspects. The program is not expected to have any environmental
impact; it has been thus rated C.
VI. RECOMMENDATION
6.1    I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the
Bank, and recommiend that the Executive Directors approve it.

SECOND CONTRACTUAL SAVINGS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM LOAN (CSDP II)
GOVERNMENT LETTER OF SECTOR POLICY
FOR
THE SECOND PHASE OF THE CONTRACTUAL SAVINGS DEVELOPMENTPROGRAM1
Mexico City, May 13, 1998
Mr. James D. Wolfensohn
President
World Bank
1818 H Street, N.W.
Washington, D.C. 20433
EXC 85120 Room E 1227
Dear Mr. Wolfensohn:
With regard to the loan requested from the World Bank in support of the Second
Contractual Savings Development Program, I would like to draw your attention to a number of
relevant developments in the Mexican economy and the Government's macroeconomic policy,
and in particular to steps taken and to be taken to reform the country's pension system.
In 1997, the Government's economic policy objective was to consolidate the recovery
process begun in 1996 while maintaining the decline in inflation, and to do so in a context of
market stability conducive to the mobilization and increase of savings and investment flows.
The year saw clear progress in consolidation of the country's openness to trade, in the strength of
its public finances, in the prudent management of its monetary policy, and in the sound financing
of its current account deficit.
Against this background, gross domestic product (GDP) grew by a real 7% in 1997, a
figure not seen in the previous 16 years. This expansion led to the creation of new sources of
employment, with the result that open unemployment fell to 3.2%, or almost half the level
recorded at the high point of the crisis. Great strides have also been made in bringing down
inflation to 15.7% for the year, or to less than a third of the figure for the previous two years.
The external debt strategy that was followed resulted in a reduction of US$10.4 billion compared
to 1996.
In 1997, public finances were managed with strict fiscal discipline. Government
expenditure increased by 6.7% in real terms, and was financed chiefly from increased taxation,
both oil and non-oil. The public sector primary balance showed a surplus of P$ 110.1 billion,
equivalent to 3.42%/o of GDP. This resulted in a general balance deficit of P$24.5 billion,
equivalent to 0.76% of GDP. The current account showed a deficit of 1.8% of GDP, amply
covered by unprecedented inflows of foreign direct investment, totaling close to US$12.1 billion.

ANNEXI
Page 2 of 4
It is important to mention that as a result of its open trade policy instituted several years
ago, Mexico today possesses a dynamic external sector, which has been a crucial element in its
recovery. The total value of the country's foreign trade was approximately US$220 billion,
equivalent to over half its GDP, making it the tenth-ranked exporter in the world and the first-
ranked in Latin America.
On the basis of its progress in 1997, Mexico has set the following primary economic
policy objectives for 1998: (a) to create the conditions which will ensure that the expansion in
productive activity and employment is reflected in higher income levels and living standards for
the population at large; and (b) to continue laying firm foundations to support sustainable growth
in productive activity and employment over the medium term, in a context of declining inflation.
Success in achieving these goals requires an ample and stable pool of savings from which to
finance the necessary investment, ongoing moves to increase the efficiency of the production
apparatus, and renewed efforts in the campaign against poverty.  Consolidation of the
stabilization process will also be fundamental to that success. Continued sound management of
public sector finances and application of a monetary policy geared to low inflation targets, will
also be essential in promoting stability and reducing the inflation rate permanently.
Despite the less favorable character of the international environment owing to the
anticipated decline in the US economic growth rate, the adverse effects of the crisis in Southeast
Asia, and the fall in oil prices, Mexico's expectations for 1998 are close to 5% real economic
growth, and achievement of a 12% inflation target.
The public sector deficit is expected to be equivalent to 1.2% of GDP, and the current
account deficit to be in the approximate range 2.5-3% of GDP. Projections indicate that the latter
will be covered by long-term external savings, including resources drawn from international
financial agencies like the World Bank.
In order to ensure that the goals set for the 1998 economic program are achieved, the
national budget has been cut back on two occasions to bring it into line with the reduction in
projected revenue from oil exports following the drop in oil prices. As part of the process
Mexico is currently going through, and in order to create the conditions that will help generate
the domestic savings required to finance national development, the Government has instituted a
series of reforms to the pension system.
Besides giving workers the certainty of having adequate savings for their retirement
years, these reforms will create a broad base of domestic long-term savings that the country can
draw on to finance a range of productive activities that require long maturation periods, develop
its own capital market, and promote cost-effective projects.
The first phase of the Contractual Savings Development Program (CSDP), together with
the technical and financial support provided by the international financial institutions, especially
the World Bank, contributed materially to the implementation of major reforms in this sector.
The primary objectives of CSDP were to increase the equity, efficiency, and long-term
sustainability of the pension system, gradually expand its effective coverage, and limit the fiscal
impact of the reforn process.

In December 1995, the Mexican Congress enacted legislation that replaced the former
pay-as-you-go system with a new system of individually funded investment accounts.
Subsequently, the April 1996 Retirement Savings Systems Act established the structure and
delineated the powers of CONSAR, the National Retirement Savings Commission. In December
1996, the legislation establishing INFONAVIT was amended to adjust that agency's operations
to those of the pension system and to lay the foundations for joint collection arrangements with
the Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS). In addition, provisions were introduced for a
mechanism to facilitate cofinancing with banks and limited-purpose financial corporations
(SOFOLEs).
CONSAR oversees the proper functioning of the pension system, and issues general
guidelines governing the operation and supervision of AFOREs and SIEFOREs. Its general
mandate is to ensure that workers' resources are invested safely and generate adequate returns.
On June 30, 1997, CONSAR issued rules prescribing in clear terms the investment
regime with which all SIEFOREs must comply. Their portfolios are required to consist
essentially of securities that maintain the purchasing power of workers' savings.
In addition, CONSAR requires that workers receive regular disclosure on such important
aspects of the new system as SIEFORE investment returns, commissions and fees, and the
balances in their individual accounts.
The data obtained so far from indicators of the performance of the new system warrant a
conclusion that the initial objectives set have been accomplished fully, and in some cases
exceeded. At the present time, a total of 17 AFOREs participate in the market; they receive
worker and employer contributions for over 12 million workers and have close to P$25 billion
under management. These resources consist only of funds deposited in the old-age and
severance insurance sub-account. The efforts made have produced results, and have laid the right
foundations for generating domestic long-term savings.
The Government will continue its efforts to broaden, deepen, and consolidate reform of
the pension system, to strengthen CONSAR's supervisory capacity and to obtain better returns
on funds deposited in the housing sub-account managed by INFONAVIT. It is against this
background that Mexico is seeking World Bank financial support to advance the second phase of
the Contractual Savings Development Program (CSDP II), the objectives of which are to
guarantee more comprehensive social security.
One of the major aims of CSDP II is to strengthen the capacity of INFONAVIT to
produce positive real returns on the worker resources deposited in the housing sub-account. To
that end, CNBV, the National Banking and Securities Commission, exercising its powers under
the law and acting on the best available estimates of INFONAVIT's past-due portfolio,
recommended in March 1998 that the institute set aside additional contingency reserves in excess
of its net worth. After reviewing INFONAVIT's financial situation, CNBV granted it regulatory
facilities to enable it to establish the required reserves over time, providing it put in place
remedial measures that would guarantee its financial viability.



ANNEX I
Page 4 of 4
At its meeting on March 30, 1998, the board of directors of INFONAVIT ratified an
agreement (the "Convenio") between itself, the Finance Ministry (SHCP), and CNBV, that spells
out in detail the measures indicated above and specifies the dates by which they are to be put into
effect. The General Meeting of INFONAVIT, its highest governing body, ratified all clauses of
this agreement at its session of April 29, 1998, instructing the institute's management to report to
it at regular intervals on progress with the implementation process.
SHCP and CNBV will be in charge of ensuring strict compliance with the Convenio. The
restructuring program includes reforms in INFONAVIT's administrative structure, operations,
and credit policies.
Another key aim of CSDP II is to consolidate the powers that enable CONSAR to carry
out its mandate as the regulatory authority over the pension system. In the next few years the
Government's primary interest is in seeing CONSAR exercise absolute oversight authority not
only over the AFOREs and SIEFOREs, but also over all other actors in the system.
The main components of the second phase of the Contractual Savings Development
Program will be:
*     implementation and consolidation of reforms to the new pension system covering
private sector workers;
*     updating of estimates of the fiscal cost of the reform;
*     support for INFONAVIT's reform efforts to improve its operating efficiency and
thereby raise the yields workers earn on their housing sub-accounts;
*     progress with preparations for reforms to strengthen the pension systems covering
workers in the public sector;
*     continuing information and education campaigns to increase the public's
knowledge and understanding of the pension system;
*     implementation of complementary financial market reforms.
Implementation of these measures is expected to have a favorable impact on the
operations and functioning of the new pension system, and thus to contribute to Mexico's social
and economic development. Consolidation of reform of the pension system is a major priority in
the Federal Government's development strategy, and support from the World Bank in reaching
that objective will be invaluable.
Please allow me to take this opportunity to express our appreciation to the World Bank,
and to thank you as its President for the organization's willingness to support the advance of the
second phase of Contractual Savings Development Program in Mexico.
Yours truly,
Angel Gurria
Secretary

b. Plus the accumulated balances in the retirement sub-account (from 1993 to 8/1997) if the worker so wishes.
c. Government contribution of 5.5% of one minimum wage (MW) - in July 1997 - per day is indexed to the consumer price level. On average,
this quota will be equivalent to 2.0 % of wages (considering that the average wage is approximately 2.6 times the minimum wage).
d. Lump withdrawal at retirement permitted only for balances in excess of 130 % of the cost of an annuity equal to the MPG.
e. Gradual withdrawals will consider insurance to cover probability that they live longer than expected and outlast savings.
f. Currently average wage for IMSS affiliates is 2.6 minimum wages, thus MPG is approximately 38 % of average wage.

Notes:
a. Contributions to the old system cease on August 31, 1997. Transition workers can choose at retirement the higher of the benefits available under the old PAYG scheme or the new defined
contribution plan.
b. "Compensatory pension" is paid upon retirement, not as a bond. The value is based on years of contribution and last ten years' eamings.
c. Workers with fewer than 150 weeks of contributions are not eligible for a recognition bond.
d. Only workers who have contributed for at least 48 months in the last 10 years and have at least 6 months prior to entering the new system.
e. Disclosure of expected current and future fiscal costs would be made on an annual basis.
L MPG introduced with second round of reforms in 1995, but regulations have not yet been issued.
g. This is paid by the employer.
h. Social Quota indexed to the CPI and estimated between I and 5.5 percent depending on worker's income and on average equivalent to 2.2 % of wages.
i. The rate shown is for both private and public sector and for 1996 and following years. Contribution rate increased gradually during 1994-96.
j. Different methodologies used. Source for Colombia and Chile is Schmidt-Hebbel, 1995 (page 58); for Peru is Kane and Palacios, 1996 (page 38).
Sources: World Bank, 1994 (page 277); Diaz Ortega, 1996; and World Bank intemal documents.
k. Current pensioners continue to receive benefits from the National Treasury as defined under the old system
1. Except those workers eligible for retirement under the rules of the old system by April 30, 1997. The AFPs began operating on May 1, 1997.
m. Affiliates who have contributed to the old system will receive compensatory pensions, paid monthly upon retirement, and calculated for those having contributed at least 5 years according to an
actuarial formula, von Gersdorf 1997 p. 9.
n. Law 1732 does not provide for a govemment guaranteed minimum pension. However, revenue from Bolivia's privatization (capitalization) of state enterprises is managed by the new system's AFPs
and has been earmarked for the 'Bonool" program ,by which every citizen over 65 is eligible to receive an annuity of US$248 in addition to the required annuity of at least 70% of the minimum wage,
from their accumulated pension assets. Citizens will continue to receive the Bonosol annuity after the savings in the individual accounts have run out.
o. An additional 13% of wages are withheld: 10% contribution for health insurance, and 3% contribution to the housing fund.
p. Of the 12.5% of workers wages withheld by the employer, 2.0% is an insurance premium covering physical impairment or death from common causes, 0.5% pays for the AFP services, and
employers contribute an additional premium of 2.0% for work-related injury or death.
q. Before the reform, most formal sector workers in Bolivia, private and public, belonged to practically obligatory employer-arranged plans, complementary to the PAYG plan. Contribution rates
under these plans varied from 3.5% to 12%.
r. Pension law specifies that the maximum limit on investment in foreign securities will be no less than 10% and no more than 50%, and only in instruments traded on the NYSE and the LSE. For the
first 15 years of the system, the AFPs are required to invest up to US$180/year in treasury bonds, to help finance the fiscal costs of transition.
s. Only those eligible for retirement at the end of 1996 will continue to receive benefits according to the old PAYG actuarial formula, paid out by the Banco de Previsi6n Social. A transition PAYG
system is set up to ease shift to the new two-pillar, PAYG/Capitalized system. See President's Report No. P7190-UR, for details.
t. At the present stage of the reform process in Uruguay, the total contribution rate to the pension system remains at 27.5%, however, employee/employer share of contribution has changed, and earned-
income ceilings have been put in place, based on May 1995 pesos. For details on the reformed contribution structure, see Table 1. I in Annex II of PR No. P7 190-UR.
u. The salary on which the public pension is calculated, under the new system, will be subject to a ceiling of 5,000 pesos/month (May 1995 pesos). The formula for calculating the public pension is
500/o of the average salary of the last 10 years.
v. Domestic equity is allowed for AFAP investment in Uruguay, but because of political difficulties in privatizing parastatals, equity instruments are scarce and capital markets are thin. AFAPs are
barred from investment in foreign equity.

[b] AFORE Inbursa's pre-operational costs, as reported here, were paid entirely by its parent
Inbursa Financial Group, and, therefore, technically the AFORE incurred no pre-operational costs.
[c] CONSAR is currently working with the AFOREs to set an industry-wide closing date for the end
of the fiscal year. Until a common closing date is agreed upon, data on the pre-operational costs
of the AFOREs to the end of 1997 will be used.

MEXICO
SECOND CONTRACTUAL SAVINGS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
INVESTMENTAND RISK MANAGEMENTIN THE REFORMED SYSTEM
1.    Introduction
This Annex focuses on three aspects of the reformed pension system in Mexico - (i) the investment regime
and its evolution; (ii) the financial and market risks of the system and their management; and (iii) systemic
problems that could impact sound management of assets. The discussion in Section 2 on the investment
regime covers past regulations that have been issued by CONSAR, analysis of problems arising thereof and
subsequent corrective steps taken by CONSAR. This discussion deals with the evolution of the regulatory
environment. Section 3 addresses the role of CONSAR in managing risks in the new system. It discusses
issues in the identification, measuring, monitoring, and management of market and systemic risks, credit
risks, and liquidity risks. The section also highlights the importance of an integrated approach to risk
management by CONSAR. Section 4 deals with broader systemic issues such as valuation, market
benchmarks, performance reporting, diversification into new asset classes and institutional strengthening
and their implications for system efficiency. In all these areas, the initial performance of the system in its
first few months in operation is assessed and recommendations for future actions based on international
best practices in order to put the new system on a sustainable basis are presented. It should be noted that
the sustainability of the reformed pension system as a whole depends crucially on the financial performance
of INFONAVIT. A large share (about 40% for a worker earning the average wage, which is about 2.8
times the minimum wage) of social security contributions go to INFONAVIT.
2.     The investment regime
The Ley de los Sistemas de Ahorro para el Retiro - the governing legislation for the reformed system
enacted in April 1996 - provides general principles relating to the investment management regime. Article
43 of the law authorizes CONSAR to establish and enforce rules of general application for the composition
and portfolios of the SIEFOREs. Article 47 of the law authorizes CONSAR to permit each AFORE to
manage and offer to its clients a variety of SIEFOREs with different portfolio compositions, provided that
each AFORE offers at least one SIEFORE whose portfolio is comprised "fundamentally" of securities
whose returns are indexed to the Mexican CPI.
2.1    Phase I - Introduction of the investment regime
On the basis of the above legal provisions, CONSAR issued a detailed set of regulations governing the
investments of the SIEFOREs in June 1997. The regulations governing portfolios of the first SIEFORE to
be offered by the AFOREs are summarized in Table 1 below.
These guidelines governing SIEFORE investments are quite restrictive from an asset manager's
perspective. At the broadest level, since only domestic peso denominated fixed-income (debt) instruments
are allowed, the regulations do not permit the contributors to the SIEFOREs to benefit from diversification
across different asset classes such as domestic and international equities, international bonds, and private
equity. The strong restrictions on investment in non-government debt instruments essentially imply that
most SIEFORE investment will occur in government bonds. In addition, the low level of development of the
government bond markets have the effect that the investments of most SIEFOREs are likely to be invested
in identical government securities. Most of these instruments have very short maturities, which causes a
duration mismatch between assets and liabilities.

(1) Short-term obligations (less than one year maturity) must be rated in the top three rating categories by an authorized rating agency, long-term
obligations must be rated in the top two categories. CONSAR's Risk Analysis Committee will establish criteria for when a rating from a single agency
is inadequate and when commercial banks would be required to secure a rating from an additional agency.
(2) The securities of banks that have undergone intervention by the authorities are ineligible for investment by SIEFORES.
The rationale for the restrictive guidelines was the government's sensitivity to ensuring that the new system
got off to a sound slart and that any unexpected economic developments did not create a loss of credibility
for the system. The situation of the financial markets where the SIEFORE investments would be made was
(and to a large extent continues to be) less than fully satisfactory. One of the key sensitivities was to
disassociate the AFOREs from the mutual fund industry in Mexico, which has had a mixed reputation. The
restriction on investments in bank instruments was driven by the perceived fragility of the banking system,
especially as regards the capital adequacy of certain banks. The concentrated nature of the Mexican
financial sector also led to the strong restrictions on investments in related companies or entities. CONSAR
was also conscious of the need to simplify its own supervision during the transition to a new system, when
great demands were being made on all of its resources. Overall, in the early stages of operations of the new
system, ensuring the safety of the workers' savings and securing a reasonable rate of return was a greater
priority than pursuing an optimal asset allocation strategy.

2.2    Phase II - Evolution of the investment regime
The experience of Mexico in actually operating under the investment regime outlined above highlighted
certain problems and constraints. As these have been identified, CONSAR has displayed considerable
ability and agility to respond to the needs of the evolving market. The main issues that have arisen
subsequent to implementation of the new system and CONSAR's attempts to fine tune the system by
addressing some of these issues through new regulations are discussed below. CONSAR has taken into
account the view points of the various market participants in formulating these regulations and their
modifications. A list of notifications issued and aspects dealt with by each notification is provided in Annex
III.
*   Investments in inflation-indexed bonds. A waiver has been granted temporarily to the
SIEFOREs on the earlier requirement that at least 51% of the SIEFORE investments be made
in inflation indexed securities (the requirement that at least 65% of all investments be in
government bonds continues). The reason for the waiver is that there were not enough
inflation-indexed instruments for the SIEFOREs to invest in. It is expected that the
government's own borrowing program from the market will provide these instruments over
time.
* Casht holdings. Earlier the SIEFOREs were not allowed to hold any cash balances. This
blanket ban on cash holdings created many operational problems for the SIEFOREs,
especially when there were any errors and omissions during the cash transfer process. In order
to simplify the process, the SIEFOREs are now allowed to hold up to P$250,000 in cash
balances.
*   Repurchase agreements. The requirement that SIEFOREs hold no cash also implied that all
the money received through contributions had to be invested immediately. Given the limited
number of securities that are allowed for investment and the fact all the cash came in on the
same day, the prices of the eligible securities were bid-up on the day that the cash was
received due to demand-supply imbalances. In order to allow SIEFOREs to better manage
their cash positions and time their investments, CONSAR has issued regulations allowing the
SIEFOREs to invest in repurchase agreements or repos. The amounts invested by a SIEFORE
in repos is restricted to the lower of: (i) the amount received in the most recent bimonthly
contributions; and (ii) 10% of the overall assets under management. For the next several
months, the second constraint will be binding. While the benefit of this regulation to the
SIEFOREs in liquidity management is significant. this regulation carries with it its own risks
and these are discussed in Section 3.4 below.
*  Asset valuation. CONSAR earlier issued guidelines that the valuation of the asset holdings of
the SIEFOREs should be done on a daily basis using a vector of prices published by the Bolsa
de Valores - the Mexican Stock Exchange. It was soon discovered that the prices received by
the SIEFOREs and CONSAR were sometimes erroneous (and amended later by the Bolsa on
the following day) or sometimes simply were not available. In this situation, fresh regulations
were issued to clarify that the SIEFOREs were authorized to use the most recent and accurate
price vector available to report valuations.
*   Performance reporting. Transparent reporting to the workers in the reformed system is critical
to ensure public support for the reforms and to establish credibility in the system. The law
goveming the new system commits the government to report both the returns on the



Annex IV
Page 4 of 10
investrnents by workers in the AFOREs and their contributions to INFONAVIT. In line with
this legislation, CONSAR issued regulations specifying the format in which the AFOREs will
report on the returns to the investors. The proposed reporting format has been provided in
Annex III.
* Others. CONSAR has clarified the earlier investment regulations so that the limits on various
investmnents should be adhered to at the time of investment. Changes in valuations due to
market movements do not constitute regulatory violations. This clarification is line with
international industry practice.
2.3    Current investments by AFOREs
Annex III provides details of the actual investments by AFOREs as of March 13, 98 based on the
investment regime discussed above. The AFOREs are largely investing in government bonds (CETES,
BONDES, and UDIBONOS) and the limit on private bonds (issued both by banks and corporates) is
currently not binding. Due to requirement that inflation-indexed bonds form a large part of the portfolio, the
AFOREs are investing proportionately more than the share of instruments available in the market in
UDIBONOS. Less than 0.25% of the aggregate investments are in bank securities and less than 1% of the
aggregate investments are in other private debt instruments. The average nominal annual rate of return
obtained by the AFOREs thus far is 21.5%, implying a real annualized rate of return of 6.2%.
3.    Compliance and risk management in the reformed system
In addition to providing the framework for the overall investment regime, CONSAR also has responsibility
to ensure compliarnce of the investment guidelines by the AFOREs. CONSAR also needs to ensure the
sustainability of the new system by getting a measure of, and then requiring the AFOREs to manage, the
risks to which the investors' funds are exposed. Once the fu.nds have been transferred to the AFOREs for
investment, the investors face several sources of risk. This section discusses various sources of risks and
methods to measure, monitor, and manage the risks.
At present, there is a significant overlap between the compliance and risk management functions of
CONSAR. As a regulator, it is essential that CONSAR perform the compliance function and provide
regulatory procedures to resolve violations with guidelines. As regards risk management, different
participants in the system have responsibilities to manage different risks. CONSAR should ideally focus on
system-wide risks and the AFOREs should be held accountable for portfolio and security level risks.
However, this is an area in which few market participants in Mexico have any extensive experience.
CONSAR's own experience is evolving and the Bank has played an active role in strengthening
CONSAR's capabilities by providing for system development and training through a Japanese PHRD
grant. At the present time, CONSAR is perforning most of the risk management functions (including those
that could potentially be performed by the AFOREs). Once the system is well established, CONSAR
should ideally take on a supervisory role and focus on monitoring the institutional risks of the system and
mandate minimum standards of performance from the AFOREs for the operational risks that each AFORE
faces. CONSAR should ensure compliance with guidelines by the AFOREs. These aspects are dealt with
in the recommendations set out below.
CONSAR has constituted two committees - the Comite de Analisis de Riesgos (the Risk Analysis
Conmmittee) and Comite de Valuacion (the Valuation Conunittee) at the time the new pensions law was
passed to oversee its operations in the risk management area. In order to achieve its compliance function,
CONSAR has put in place an extensive reporting system that obtains data from all the AFOREs. The
systems currently in place provide information to CONSAR about the specific investments being made by



Annex IV
Page S of 10
the AFOREs. CONSAR is also developing systems that would allow it to assess system-wide risks and
allow it to identify potential trouble spots.
3.1   Institutional risk
The primary risk is the institutional risk of the viability of the AFOREs themselves. The AFOREs have a
fiduciary responsibility to manage the funds in the best interests of the investors. The important issue of
safety of funds and protection from mismanagement by AFOREs has been addressed through various
regulations. The AFOREs have been established as single purpose companies capitalized separately from
any other members of any financial groups. The assets are held in the SIEFOREs - a separate legal entity -
whose assets are not available to meet the obligations of the sponsors of the AFOREs. CONSAR's role in
addressing institutional risks is part of its supervisory function. CONSAR has established an extensive
system of compliance monitoring in which AFOREs provide detailed reporting on their activities, financial
status, management etc. on a regular basis.
One issue of special concern at the institutional level is the potential consolidation of the industry. Strong
competition to attract affiliates has meant that all AFOREs incurred significant expenditures up-front on
advertising and sales forces. However, some AFOREs have not succeeded in attracting a sufficient number
of affiliates (see Annex III) and hence their financial viability is in question. This implies that a natural
consolidation may happen soon in the industry wherein smaller, less profitable AFOREs merge with others
AFOREs or are taken over by new groups interested in entering the business. CONSAR needs to ensure
that such a process is smoothly managed with the public adequately informed that their assets are safe
despite the consolidation. This would require both a public information campaign as well as strengthening
of CONSAR's own capacities to handle these issues.
3.2    Market Risk
CONSAR obtains information from all AFOREs on a daily basis on their positions in the individual
securities, the characteristics of the individual securities in terms of coupon, maturity, etc. and the
commissions paid by the AFOREs for these securities. Appropriate regulations to ensure such information
provision have been issued. CONSAR also collects extensive market information from on-line sources such
as Infosel, BBE and Bloomberg (on-line data providers). The data obtained through these sources cover
aspects such as government bond rates, details of new issues, ratings of private sector issuers etc.
Using the above information on the actual positions of the SIEFOREs and the market-wide information,
CONSAR is in the process of finalizing the use of two risk management software systems - RiskWatch
(developed by Algorithmics) and SIMAR ( Sistema para Manejar Riesgos- developed by JP Morgan) to
assess the risks implied by the positions of the SIEFOREs. The process of assessing the risk implied by the
positions of the various SIEFOREs involves assessing the sensitivity of the price of the securities (taking
into account correlations between various securities in the portfolio) to different market scenarios.
Weighting the sensitivity of the price of the instruments with the probability distribution of the occurrence
of the scenarios gives a measure of the value at risk. CONSAR would then be able to obtain risk reports on
each SIEFORE. CONSAR will also be able to obtain an idea of the aggregate risks across all AFOREs
since it has all the data.



Annex IV
Page 6 of 10
3.3    Credit risk
In addition to the above analysis that focuses on market risk, CONSAR is also engaged in monitoring the
credit risk of private sector instruments that have been allowed for investment by the investment
regulations. Currentlly, the guidelines allow the AFOREs to invest up to a total of 35% of their assets in
private debt instruments (such as certificates of deposit arnd corporate bonds) issued by banks and
corporates. Of this amount, AFOREs are allowed to invest no more than 10% of their assets in debt issued
by banks. All private instruments have to be rated a high investment grade(A or higher for short term and
AA or higher for medium/long term instruments) by one of the three approved rating agencies. At present
only four private banks (two domestic and two foreign) have outstanding short term debt with this high
rating. The number of corporates with highly rated debt instruments is also small. As of 13 March, 98 the
AFOREs had invested less that 1.25% of their aggregate portfolios in private debt instruments.
These private instruments carry with them credit risk which arises from the possibility that either the banks
or the corporates may default on their debt obligations. While, in theory, such default risk should be
factored into the price of the instrument, the lack of well developed capital markets implies that this may
not be the case. Hence, in order to ensure that the securities that the AFOREs invest in are adequately
secure, CONSAR monitors the credit risk of private instruments. CONSAR has done work on estimating
transition probabilities of private debt instruments moving from one credit rating to another. These
transition matrices are designed to assist CONSAR in assessing the credit risk of these instruments which
can then combined with the market risk factors to obtain an assessment of the overall risk of these
instruments. It must be noted that this is a function better performed by rating agencies as part of their
credit risk monitoring process and the AFOREs as part of their investment process. CONSAR should
therefore consider a gradual exit from such activities to more regulatory and supervisory activities.
3.4    Liquidity Risk
Managing liquidity risk is one of the major concerns of the SI]EFOREs in the current Mexican investment
environment and the structure of the cash flows in the reformed pension system. Cash comes in to the
AFOREs once every two months and essentially all of it (save some minor errors and omissions) comes in
on one day. Given the prevailing high real interest rates, the opportunity cost of holding cash is very high.
The investment regulations are quite restrictive and allow investment of the cash in a few instruments.
Finally, there simply are not enough instruments in some of the approved categories of investments for the
SIEFOREs to invest in. As a result SIEFOREs have already faced the problem of the market in the
approved instruments being tight (or cornered) by the brokers on the day in which the cash comes in.
Given these problems, CONSAR has recently issued new guidelines that allow SIEFOREs to enter into
repurchase agreements with banks using government securities as collateral. In this manner, the expectation
is that SIEFOREs can better manage their liquidity and have flexibility on their timing of entering into the
market while not having to sit on uninvested cash. In principle, this is a sound piece of regulation addressed
at managing liquidity risk. However, given the current state of the Mexican market it poses its own
dilemma.
In entering into a repo transaction, the SIEFOREs are essentially taking on bank credit risk, even though
the collateral is a government security. Given the fragile state of some of the Mexican banks, this issue is
critical. In any repo transaction, there is always an interest ralte risk. In the Mexican environment the credit
risk is likely to increase significantly at the sanie time as the interest rate risk rises. For e.g.: if a SIEFORE
enters into a repo agreement for 14 days (the maximum allowed now is 28 days) and in that time interest
rates rise significantly due to a systemic problem (interest rate swings of up to 200 basis points in a single
day are not uncommon), the SIEFORE ends up carrying high bank credit risk just as the incentives for the



Annex IV
Page 7 of 10
bank to return the cash it has obtained are significantly lower (the value of the collateral it has provided has
just fallen with the rise in interest rates). In the context of a fragile banking system, this issue needs to be
addressed. One option could be for the Central Bank to provide a repo window directly to the SIEFOREs
without going through the banks.
3.5    Recommendations
The main recommendations for future action by CONSAR in this area are:
*   Clearly separate the compliance function for the investment process from the risk management
function.
*   Institutionalize procedures to address systemic risks - especially procedures to resolve
AFORE mergers and bankruptcies.
*   Ensure that AFOREs have the capacity to take on the risk management function at SIEFORE
and security level.
*   Establish uniform standards of risk reporting by AFOREs.
*   Move to a supervisory role - ensuring compliance with guidelines and inspection of risk
reports from AFOREs.
* .Strengthen internal capacity to oversee risk management function and provide institutional
strengthening to AFOREs, if necessary.
*   Study the issue of the credit risk of repos and institute alternate mechanisms to provide a
liquidity window for the AFOREs.
4.     Systemic issues - interactions with the rest of the financial sector
The reformed pension system has extensive linkages with the rest of the Mexican financial sector (Annex
V) and these linkages introduce problems and issues that affect the entire system. These solutions to these
issues are more medium-long term in nature and involve coordinated action by CONSAR with other
financial sector regulators and participants in the financial sector. It is important to highlight these issues
and consider specific courses of action to address them in order to ensure that the investment of the pension
fund assets occurs in the best interest of the contributors.
4.1    Processing delays from point of payment to receipt by AFOREs
In the current system, there is a significant delay between the time at which the payments are made by the
employers, on behalf of the workers, to the collection agencies and the time at which the AFOREs actually
receive the money so that it can be invested. Currently, this time is about 9-10 business days. This implies
that for a significant amount of time, the payments of the workers are not invested and hence, are not
eaming any retums. While the cost of not being invested is high in almost any environment it is especially
so in an environment where the real interest rates on government instruments are about 5%1.
At a 5% real rate of interest, a worker loses approximately 4.8% of her real annual returns due to processing
delays of 10 days per contribution.



Annex IV
Page 8 of 10
It is critical that all the parties involved - CONSAR, IMSS, PROCESAR, the AFOREs, the banks through
the payments are made and Banco de Mexico all coordinate to reduce this time in which the cash is in
transit and hence idle to the minimum. This would improve the rates of return on the investments
significantly. The cost of not being invested is an opportunity cost in addition to any explicit transactions
costs that are charged by various participants.
4.2    Valiuation issues
All SIEFOREs are required to report the value of their asset holdings on a daily basis to CONSAR. On a
weekly basis, the value of the asset holdings is reported in the popular press by all SIEFOREs. All
SIEFOREs are required to mark their asset holdings to market daily i.e. the holdings are valued at the
prevailing market price (as opposed to other valuation bases such as cost price or book value) for the
respective instrument on the valuation day. A Valuation Committee has been set up with representatives of
CNBV, Hacienda, Banco de Mexico, CNSF, and CONSAR which establishes the guidelines for valuation
of various instruments. The brokerage houses, banks, mutual ifunds, and SIEFOREs are all required to use
the guidelines established by the Valuation Committee to imark-to-market their assets. The Valuation
Committee has established different guidelines for valuation of different securities - equities, fixed income
instruments, and repurchase agreements (repos). While the logic behind these guidelines is sound, there are
practical constraints in the application of these guidelines.
For fixed income instrument, while the concept of marking-to-market is well established, the main
complication that arises in the Mexican market is the lack of liquidity, and hence the absence of a clearly
market determined price, for several instruments. For e.g.: the greatest liquidity exists in instruments which
have maturities of 1, 7, 28, 90, etc. days. For any intermedliate date, the liquidity is extremely low and
hence market prices are essentially non-existent. In order to address this issue, the Valuation Committee
has authorized the use a price vector as a homogenous basis for pricing financial instruments by all market
participants.
The price vector is a polynomial function that is fitted to the market prices at the maturities that are traded
and available and extrapolated so that prices across all maturities are available (including those maturities
where there has been no trading and hence no market prices). Separate price functions are constructed for
different instruments such as CETES, BONDES, AJUSTABONOS etc. The price vector therefore uses as
inputs the traded market prices of securities at the most popular maturities and produces as outputs the
prices of securities with maturities at all intermediate dates. The Boisa Mexicana de Valores publishes
daily bulletins with the prices of various instruments for different maturities.
The SIEFOREs are required to use the daily outputs of the price vector in valuing their debt instrument
holdings. The advauntage of the price vector is that it provi,des a good measure of relative performance
across SIEFOREs (and other market participants with similar assets such as mutual funds) since all the
SIEFOREs use the same prices for valuing their holdings. The pricing function also solves the problem of
illiquid markets and lack of trades in many instruments. The disadvantage of the pricing function though is
that since the prices of instruments with "intermediate" maturities are not market determined and are the
outputs of a fitted model, prices of instruments with maturities very close to a traded instruments
sometimes are far from the market prices. The degree of "goodness of fit" of the model determines the
closeness of model prices to market prices. Hence the return volatility of the SIEFORE portfolios can be
significantly different from the market volatility.
Summarizing, the pricing function is a good basis for relative performance evaluation across SIEFOREs,
but is not fully satisfactory when the requirement is to cormpare performance relative to market. While
further refinements on certain technical aspects of the pricing vector may improve its performance, the



Annex IV
Page 9 of 10
underlying lack of liquidity in the market continues to be the core of the problem and needs to be addressed
in the long term. In the context of the SIEFOREs, this issue is tied into the issue of a market determined
benchmark for performance evaluation and this issue is addressed next.
4.3    Performance reporting and attribution - creating a benchmark
A critical issue related to several others such as risk management, performance reporting, and performance
attribution is that of having an appropriate performance benchmark. A benchmark is especially important
in the context of the Mexican system which does not provide any return guarantees to its participants.
Ensuring adequate performance is a prime responsibility of the government as the fiduciary of assets of the
workers. The lifetime switch option given to the workers in the old system further strengthens the case for
establishing a sound benchmark.
An objective, market determined benchmark is essential in assessing performance and in attributing
performance to specific manager decisions which add or detract value. A benchmark also provides the
ability to create a passive portfolio - one which assures the "market" return - similar to the widely known
stock market benchmarks in the US such as the S&P 500 index. At present, there is no market determined
benchmark for fixed income instruments in Mexico. In the present scenario, CONSAR calculates for
internal purposes, the performance of all the SIEFOREs and is able to rank them only in terms of relative
performance. However, this information has limited relevance in the absence of an absolute benchmark.
A benchmark is also integral for the purposes of assessing investment risk. Risk of a SIEFORE portfolio is
a measure of how different the returns of the SIEFORE are relative to the benchmark (measured by the
standard deviation of the excess returns of the portfolio relative to the benchmark). Since the benchmark,
by construction, removes market risk, any risk beyond the benchmark needs to measured and the excess
returns of SIEFORE portfolios should be assessed relative to this risk.
4.4    Establishing custodial services
Mexico currently has a central depository for its securities - the INDEVAL. However, it has no legal
provisions for a custodial system. The development of a custodial system would truly insulate the assets of
the workers from the AFOREs and provide significantly greater protection to the investors. While the legal
separation of the AFOREs from the SIEFOREs is a step in the right direction, the logical conclusion of this
process is the institutionalization of a custodial system in the country. Mexico already offers local custodial
services for its international investors, but does not have a provision for a similar system domestically. The
introduction of a custodial system would ensure safety of financial assets and has benefits for the capital
market development in general, much beyond its importance for the AFORE system. CONSAR could play
a useful role in assisting in the development of a custodial system by requiring the assets of AFOREs to be
custodied with independent custodians.
4.5    Portfolio diversification - one SIEFORE vs. multiple SIEFOREs
The pension law allows for the possibility that each AFORE may manage multiple SIEFOREs, while not
permitting more than one SIEFORE before July 1998. CONSAR and the private market participants have
discussed at length the issues in the expansion of workers' choice of SIEFOREs. The benefit of permitting
additional SIEFOREs - likely having a different asset allocation to that currently permitted and investing in
stocks and other securities - is to allow workers the maximum flexibility in tailoring their investrnents to
their desired risk-return profile. However, there are some important considerations that could place
constraints on the pace with which regulations are introduced to allow multiple SIEFOREs. The most
important problem is that of creating confusion among the workers with multiple SIEFOREs in a newly



Annex IV
Page 10 of 10
introduced system. It is not clear that adequate financial sophistication exists for correct choices to be
made. The government also needs to take into account the life-time switch option that it has given the
workers in the old system and the moral hazard associated with it for workers - especially those not
expecting a pension beyond the minimum guaranteed by the Government. Additional SIEFOREs will also
place additional demands on CONSAR, whose own capabilities are quite stretched at present. CONSAR is
presently studying the possibility of allowing multiple SIEFOREs and the financial as well as the
operational implications of such a decision.
4.6    Recommendations
*   Reduce the time taken between the payment of contributions by workers and receipt by
AFOREs. A study of the entire cash collection and transfer process, sources of delay and
methods to reduce the idle time of the cash should be conducted and recommendations
implemented.
*   Improve the secondary markets for trading of government debt which will improve the
enviroinment for investment by AFOREs. Such an improvement is a long term issue, but one
which the government should focus on to improve the entire financial system, part of which
are the AFOREs. The valuation issue will be a much smaller problem once secondary markets
develop.
   Establish a market determined benchmark for performance evaluation and risk assessment of
AFORE performance. This would involve CONSAR interacting with private market
participants to develop and maintain a benchmark on an ongoing basis. Existing measures of
returns on Mexican fixed-income markets (such as J.P. Morgan's ELBI index) should be
examined for applicability.
*   Address development of the corporate bond market, strengthen rating agencies. These are long
term issues and the presence of the AFOREs could provide a Jemand driven solution to this
problem. This issue is related to many other financial market development issues such as
corporate governance, bankruptcy legislation, legal rights of bondholders, etc.
*   Implement a custodial system for AFORE and mutual fund assets. The custody issue has
important legal dimensions that need to be addressed. CONSAR would finalize a study on the
issue. On the basis of the study, necessary legislation may need to be drafted and/or CONSAR
shoulcd issue guidelines ensuring that SIEFORE assets are custodied safely.
*   Conduct a study on the introduction of multiple SIEFOREs and take a decision based on the
recommendations.
5.     Conclusion
As an overall assessment, the process of introduction of the regulations to govem investments of the
AFOREs has got off to a good start. While CONSAR agrees that the present investment regime is too
restrictive, it is in line with the regulatory structure of most new privately managed pension systems. As
expected, there are many issues that need to be addressed in order to put the system on a more sustainable
basis and to address the various risks in the system. It is important to appreciate that the system is very
new - it is less than a year old in terms of full operations. It is hence an evolving system.

SECOND CONTRACTUAL SAVINGS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
COM:PLEMENTARY FINANCL4L SECTOR REFORMS
The sustainability of the Mexican pension reform hinges on implementation of complementary financial
sector reform. A funded, privatized pension system needs adequate securities to invest in and appropriate
institutional structures to ensure the safety of those securities. The pension system is an integral part of the
overall financial sector and hence the performance of the pension system is linked to the health of the
overall financial sector. Success of the pension reform is therefore linked to reforms in the rest of the
financial sector. The Government recognizes this link and is undertaking a series of steps aimed at
strengthening various institutions in the financial sector.
1. The Banking Sector
Mexico's financial system continues to be dominated by commercial banks and their financial holding
companies. These banks were hard hit by the devaluation of the peso in late 1994. The ensuing crisis in
1995 revealed and deepened the already poor asset quality in banks' balance sheets. The Government has
taken steps to restructure the banking system and increase public confidence in the banking system, though
at high fiscal costs (estimated at over 14% of 1997 GDP). The sector has been opened up to foreign
investments, supervision and regulation have been improved and universal deposit insurance
(FOBAPROA) is now available. In addition, several systemic issues are being addressed including the
fiscal recognition of the costs of the banking crisis.
Table 1 shows the evolution of the Mexican financial system since the crisis in 1994. It is clear that the
domestic banking sector has suffered a sharp contraction, while foreign banks have increased their presence
in the market. The non-bank financial institution sector including leasing and factoring intermediaries and
foreign exchange trading houses has also contracted. Mutual funds have declined dramatically both in
numbers and in size of operations (see section 2).
In designing the new pension system, the Government took various steps to insulate the AFOREs from the
fragile banking system:
* The influence of the banks on the management of the AFOREs was minimized through the
requirement that all AFOREs be established as single-purpose separately capitalized companies. The
capital of an AFORE that is a subsidiary of a financial group is not available to meet the obligations of
other subsidiaries of the group.
* As an additional safeguard Article 22 of the Pension Systems Law provides that financial
intermediaries (including banks) or financial groups that are not in full compliance with applicable
capital standards may not be shareholders of an AFORE'.
* Under the Pension Systems Law, a shareholder that at any time wishes to acquire more than 10% of the
capital stock of an AFORE is required to make detailed financial disclosures to the CONSAR revealing
their sources of capital for the preceding five years.
Mexican Capital Adequacy Requirement (CAR) rules differ from those of the Bank for International Settlements
(BIS) in important ways, including the treatment of subordinated and mandatorily convertible debt into equity and
the revaluation of assets.



Annex V
Page 2 of 8
*  The extent of pension fund investment in the bankinrg sector was also limited by requiring that
SIEFOREs be permitted to hold a maximum of 10% of their assets in bank securities.
*  A further regulation requiring that this 10% investment be made only in bank instruments with a high
credit rating (AA or higher (or equivalent) for long-term debt and A or higher (or equivalent) for short-
term debt by any of the three approved rating agencies) ensures that the pension assets will be invested
only in high quality instruments. As pension funds increase in size and become significant institutional
investors, it can be expected that the competition amongt banks for AFORE investments will increase.
As the banking sector becomes stronger, more avenues for investment by AFOREs will open up.

As of March 13, 1]998, the AFOREs had invested an extremely small portion of their aggregate portfolios
(less than 0.25%) in bank instruments. This exposure is due: to the investment of about 3.8% of the assets
of one AFORE (Santander Mexicano) in bank instruments. The instruments invested in are high quality
short term commercial papers. Hence, the limit of 10% of assets of each AFORE's assets is not binding at
the moment. The main reason for the low level of investments, in addition to tight regulation, is that on a
risk-adjusted basis; Govemment bonds are currently the highest yielding instruments in Mexico.
2. Mutual funds
The Mexican mutual fund industry began operations in an environment of extremely high effective reserve
requirements (over 90%) imposed by the central bank in the early eighties. Since almost no cash was
available for regular bank lending operations funded by deposits, mutual funds were used as a source of
funding to circumvent the high reserve requirements. Hence, mutual funds in Mexico have traditionally
invested in illiquidl loan assets which, under normal circumstances, would have been funded with deposits.
In addition, the supervision of these funds was poor and disclosure and investor protection norms were lax.
The privatization of the banking sector in 1992 accompanied by the sharp drop in real interest rates ensured
that the market vaLlue of the funds appreciated sharply and hence the size of the industry increased. In the
wake of the 1994 peso crisis and sharply higher real interest rates, the value of these funds dramatically
declined and individual investors were hard hit. Lower resenre requirements meant that the banks could



Annex V
Page 3 of 8
fund loan operations from deposits and hence the importance of mutual funds as funding sources declined.
The industry has contracted sharply since 1994. In terms of real value of assets under management, it is
currently one-third of its size in 1994.
Mutual funds in Mexico are currently governed by the Ley de Sociedades de Inversion enacted in 1987.
There are four types of mutual funds in operation in Mexico - equity funds, debt funds for institutional
investors, debt funds for individual investors, and venture capital or private equity funds. The assets are
managed largely by banks and subsidiaries of financial groups. Supervision of mutual funds and mutual
fund operating companies are entrusted to CNBV, and all relevant information must be submitted to its
review. CNBV's supervisory responsibilities include registration of mutual funds, establishing disclosure
guidelines and on-site and off-site monitoring of compliance. If, as a result of inspection, a mutual fund or
an operating company is found not to be in compliance with CNBV's rules, CNBV has the right to
intervene or sanction the institution.
As of January 31, 1998 the Mexican mutual fund industry consisted of 345 mutual funds and 39 mutual
fund operating companies, with total assets under management of $13.8 billion with an investor base of
about 321,000 investors. Almost $11 billion of assets are invested in debt instruments and the balance in
equities. The industry has been characterized by volatility in both the number of investors and assets under
management. The trend has been that individual small investors have been declining and the funds have
become more institutional. The size of the industry, measured by the aggregate amount of assets under
management as a percentage of GDP, has been in the range of 3.2-3.4% since 1995. Mutual fund
shareholders in Mexican population is currently 0.3%, a fifth of the population with bank accounts. This
percentage has been gradually declining since the early 1990's. Performance data on an industry wide-basis
along with an appropriate comparative benchmark is unavailable.
The Ley de los Sistemas de Ahorro para el Retiro pointedly did not adopt the governance and supervisory
framework applicable to Mexico's mutual fund industry. The Government felt that since a handful of
financial groups control the bulk of the Mexican banking, securities and mutual funds industries, the
legal/regulatory framework for a mandatory contribution system should impose stricter rules for
independent decision-making and avoidance of conflicts of interest.
The introduction of the private pension system has had a salutary effect on the regulation of the mutual
fund sector in Mexico. Recognizing the weaknesses in the regulatory structure for mutual funds, the CNBV
is currently considering reforms which would bring the mutual fund regulation more in line with the
pension fund regulation. As part of the reforms, the CNBV is considering the introduction of a mutual fund
rating system along the lines of those published by Morningstar in the US. These ratings are proposed to be
done by the rating agencies (a discussion of the rating industry in Mexico is provided below). There is also
an active ongoing debate in Mexico among the regulators and the mutual fund industry about other reforms
that may be needed to encourage mutual funds as a viable savings vehicle. Deregulation of fee structures,
increased portfolio disclosure, standardized reporting norms, and stricter fiduciary standards such as
imposition of prudent man/prudent investor rules are some of the issues under discussion.

3. Voluntary pension plans
Several Mexican corporations have established voluntary pension plans for their workers over and above
the mandatory social security programs. These schemes involve employee contributions of between 2-6%
with the plan assets managed by a bank or a brokerage firm. These plans are essentially unregulated,
although they are subject certain broad portfolio requirement by the SHCP. These plans have been
established mostly by large private sector firms as well as Mexican subsidiaries of multinational firms.
As the supervisor of the new mandatory pension system, CONSAR is exploring the possibility of bringing
the voluntary pension plans under its supervision. CONSAR plans to issue regulations by which a
voluntary pension lplan can be registered with CONSAR. Such registration will, at least initially, be
voluntary. Pension plans choosing to be registered need to be certified as actuarially sound and maintain
that status on an ongoing basis. Participants of plans that register with CONSAR and subject themselves to
its supervision have: significant advantages such as the ability to transfer their retirement accounts' at the
AFOREs to their private plan upon retirement and receive pensions under the terms of the voluntary plan.
As many voluntary plans provide pensions at an earlier age than the mandatory system, such flexibility is
attractive to the workers. The AFOREs are also permitted to establish a separate sub-account for the
workers for voluntary contributions in addition to the mandatory portion. Table 3 shows the voluntary
contributions by AFORE received till March 1998.



Annex V
Page S of 8
The response to CONSAR's initial efforts at registering voluntary pension plans has not been enthusiastic.
Out of the estimated 1000 private pension funds in operation only three have registered with CONSAR as
of March 13, 1998. The most plausible reason for the lack of interest is that many are actuarially
underfunded and the firms would require to first fund the plans before being eligible for registration. The
Government needs to take a serious view of this situation and take appropriate action to ensure safety of the
workers funds in voluntary pension plans. As a first step it would be useful to conduct a study to get an
assessment of the size of the voluntary pension plans, their actuarial funded status, and investment patterns.
Suitable policy actions can be taken on the basis of such a study. CONSAR has also undertaken a drive to
register all the practicing actuaries in Mexico under the assumption that greater knowledge of the state of
the voluntary pension fund industry can be obtained by having a formal relationship with the actuaries.
Thus far, 26 of the 40 qualified actuaries have voluntarily registered themselves with CONSAR. The type
of information that they will provide CONSAR is being discussed.
4. Development of Long-Term Instruments and Financial Services
Long-term government debt markets. With the reform of the social security system, there is a pool of
funds available for the first time that needs to be invested in order to provide a stream of pension payments
to the workers upon their retirement. Pension liabilities are typically long term and the natural asset to
hedge such liabilities is a long duration instrument such as long term bonds or equities. Mexico's
Govermnent bond markets are poorly developed and provide mostly short-term (less than one year
duration) bonds. The composition of trading in the secondary markets also provides an indication of the
short-term nature of the market. Over 95% of all trades - both in the Bolsa and over-the-counter - are in
overnight securities. There is almost no liquidity in long-term instruments. While historically the cause of
this underdeveloped state may have been the chronic inflation, it is essential that now the Government
considers development of this market segment.
Corporate debt market. The heavy presence of the banking sector in Mexico's economy has traditionally
implied that the level of intermediation has been very high. Most corporate lending was from banks, that in
turn financed these assets from deposits. The presence of institutional pension funds provides a natural
alternate source of funds for high quality corporates to raise funds. Development of a sound corporate debt
market would provide another investment vehicle for the pension funds. The investment regulations permit
investment up to 35% in rated private debt instruments. However, the actual investment by the SIEFOREs
in private instruments is very small (less than 1% up to March 13, 1998). There are several reasons for the
low level of investments in private sector instruments.
One of the major problems is the lack of adequate highly-rated corporate paper that qualifies for AFORE
investment. Table 4 provides details of the corporate debt market. CNBV's internal analysis shows the
extent of problems in timely payment of principal and interest for many of the corporate debt issues. In
general, the instruments range in maturity from 5-10 years, with an average maturity of 7 years.
The secondary market for most issues is very illiquid (or non-existent). A very small number of issues are
rated investment grade (out of a small universe of rated securities) and hence the market in high quality
private debt instruments is small, relative to the market for Government paper. A second - though smaller -
problem is the differential fiscal treatment given to private debt issuers vs. Government debt issues. The
withholding tax of 2% on private debt issues often makes the after-tax rate of return on private, more risky
issues less than Government paper. Yet another problem is that the debt market does not provide an
adequate compensation for risk in terms of differing level of interest rates for different credit risks. There
are currently several low rated corporate securities in the market that yield a lower return that higher rated
securities. The market is driven more by the name of the issuer rather than the structure of the specific

issue. This lack of appropriate risk-return relationship further discourages investments in debt issues. There
are also some doubts in the market on the objectivity of the raLtings.

Housing mortgage market. Long term securitized housing mortgages are a good investment vehicle for
pension funds which have long-term liabilities. The availabil:ity of long term investors should also help to
stimulate the housing market. However, the quality of the investments depends to a large extent on the
availability of appropriate instruments and efficiency of the mortgage market. The Governm. ent is taking an
active role in restructuring the existing housing finance market. It is in the process of making the operations
of FOVI more marlcet-oriented and the operations of INFONAVIT more transparent. The Bank is working
closely with the Government on both these institutions. One of the major hurdles to securitization in
Mexico is the presence of instruments whose returns are not market determined. For example, the interest
rates on some mortgage instruments are a function of the minimum wage in the economy, which is a
Government detemiined policy variable. Development of an efficient housing mortgage market requires the
introduction of new market-based mortgage instruments, transparent and consistent origination standards,
presence of a mortgage insurer, and a strong rating industry whose ratings are viewed as objective and
reliable.

While these problems are not unique to Mexico and are widespread across many developing financial
markets, there is a need to address these issues in Mexico as part of the financial and capital market
reforms complementary to the pension reforms. A sound debt market is critical to long term capital
mobilization and assessment of corporate risk and hence sound allocation of capital.
Financial intermediaries. Credit rating agencies, custodial services, third-party performance assessment
services (similar to Morningstar and Lipper in the US) are some of the other players in the overall financial
infrastructure that are required for maximizing the economic benefits of a privatized pension system.
Mexico currently has three rating agencies, a central depository that offers partial custodial services, and
no independent perfornance assessment agencies. The Government should examine these segments of the
financial infrastructure and take appropriate policy actions to assist in their development as part of the
overall development of the financial sector.
Rating agencies. There are currently three credit rating agencies in Mexico - all subsidiaries of US-based
credit rating agencies. These are (i) Standard & Poor's, (ii) Duff & Phelps, and (iii) Fitch2. The rating
methodology and systems have been adapted for the Mexican market from those in the US. the rating
industry began in 1989 and has developed slowly, given the volatility in the debt markets in Mexico. At
present, the rating agencies rate mainly short term commnercial paper issued by corporates and banks. Other
2 Fitch is in the process of acquiring 100% control of a domestic credit rating agency - Fitch-Clase - in which it
currently has a minority shareholding. This acquisition is expected to be completed by June 1998.

market segments covered include corporate debt issues, structured instruments such as mortgage backed
securities, securitizations of assets such as credit card receivables, and debt issues of insurance companies.
As of March 1998, albout 180 debt issues (out of a market of about 475 issues) had been rated in Mexico.
Since January 1, 1998 CNBV requires all debt mutual funds to be rated and this has provided another
source of business for the rating agencies. They are rating both the portfolios of the mutual funds and the
mutual fund companies3. Multiple ratings of the same issue is becoming more popular in Mexico and
should help investors obtain a better perspective of the risks of the instrument. However, the practice of
"rating shopping" - an issuer looking for the best ratings at the lowest price - is prevalent and hence colors
the perceptions of the market on the objectivity of the ratings. CNBV is also considering further regulation
of the rating agencies, although the nature and extent of the regulation is still unclear. The Government
should be aware that substituting ratings in place of regulations requiring greater corporate transparency
and disclosure is likely to politicize ratings and hence reduce their effectiveness as a tool for greater market
efficiency. Rating agencies should be allowed to comment freely on credit risks and provide a credible and
objective source of risk analysis. The investment guidelines for the new pension system require the
AFOREs to invest only in rated private debt instruments (subject to a cap of 25% of assets). The
performance of the pension system therefore depends on the sound development and credibility of the rating
agencies.
Custodial services. A system of custody provides safety for the financial assets including cash of
investors and legally and physically separates the entity making the investment decision from the control
over actual financial assets. In a private pension system such as that in Mexico, a custodial arrangement
would ensure that the AFOREs only make the decision on where to invest the worker's contributions but
would otherwise have no legal control over either the cash contributions or the financial instruments at any
time. Mexico currently does not have a domestic custody industry4. INDEVAL - the central depository -
provides certain services similar to a custodian. However, the financial intermediaries still retain legal
control of both the cash contributions and financial assets. Regulations governing the AFOREs separate
their assets from all other members of the same financial group. While these regulations are sound, a
formal custody arrangement would enhance the safety of the assets. Development of custodial services
would assist many other segments of the financial sector such as mutual funds, insurance companies, and
voluntary pension funds.
3 It is important to note that in the US none of the three agencies are involved in rating mutual funds - whether the
funds invest in debt or other asset classes. Hence, it is not clear that the rating agencies have either a comparative
advantage or the technical expertise in this particular line of operations.
4 International investors in Mexican securities can obtain on-shore custodial services through branches of some
large multinational banks.
