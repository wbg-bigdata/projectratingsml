INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO TIHE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT
TO TEE EMPIRE OF ETHIOPIA
FOR A
FIFTH TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Empire of Ethiopia for the equivalent of US$21.4
million on standard IDA terms to help finance a fifth project for tele-
communications. The proceeds of the credit would be relent to the Imperial
Board of Telecommunications of Ethiopia for 20 years, including 5 years of
grace, with interest at 7-1/4 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A renort "iRecent Economic Performance and Future Prospects in
Ethiopia" (in four volumes, Report No. 9a-ET, R73-162) was circulated on
June 15, 1973. A Country Data Sheet is attached as Annex I.
3.        Located in the Horn of Africa and almost twice the size of Kenya,
Ethiopia has a total land area of about 1.2 million k1m2, consisting of a
central highland mass with rugged mountains and precipitous ravines sur-
rounded by lowlands, some of which are barren deserts. The extremely dif-
ficult topography which in former times provided a natural barrier to in-
vasion is today an obstacle to internal transportation, communication and
economic development. Only some 9 percent of the land area is crop land
while over half is in permanent pasture. The remainder is forest land or
is unsuitable for agricultural development. An estimated 85 percent of the
people are subsistence farmers living in isolated villages in the rural
areas. Although some large commercial farms do exist, most farming units
are small in size. A recent survey in one province showed that 92 percent
of the cultivated holdings were of less than one hectare. Productivity is
in general very low. Methods of cultivation have been unchanging over many
centuries, the soil in many highland areas is seriously depleted because
of overgrazing and prolonged cropping, and the prevailing systems of land
tenure generally do not provide adequate incentives for investments which
wouild raise farmers' productivitv. As a consequence, there has been little
or no improvement in average rural living standards in recent years. The
development of the agricultural sector is also inhibited by the lack of
transportation. The country has only some 23,000 km of roads of which only
8,000 km are of the all-weather type and less than 3,000 km are paved. There
are at present few secondary and rural feeder roads and perhaps three-quarters
of Ethiopia's farms are more than one-half day's walking distance from a
road. This means that transport costs are often too high to make it



- 2 -
profitable for subsistence farmers to expand production for the market.
Despite the underdeveloped status of the agricultural sector, the country's
limited natural resources, insofar as they are known, suggest that progress
for the forseeable future is inextricably tied with agriculture.
4.         Ethiopia is recognized as one of the 25 least developed countries
of the world. The per capita income was only US$80 in 1970 and income has
been growing slowly in recent years. As indicated above, the population is
predominantly rural and depends on agriculture for its income. The agri-
cultural sector has contributed 50 to 60 percent of GDP and over 90 percent
of exports in recent years. The leading exports are coffee, which accounts
for over 50 percent of the total, hides and skins, cereals and oilseeds.
Manufacturing, including handicrafts and small industries, contributes only
10 percent of GDP, and the output of the mining sector is negligible.
5.         The population of Ethiopia is approximately 26.5 million (mid-1973
estimate). The population is a very young one with over 45 percent under
the age of 15. Average life expectancy at birth is still very low, perhaps
only 35 years. Because of the large numbers in the younger ages the depend-
ency ratio is very high; only 35-36 percent of the population is economically
active as compared with 40-45 percent in Europe and North America. Less
than 10 percent of the population is urban but there is today a high rate
of migration to the towns. The urban population is expanding at an estimated
6.5 to 7 percent a year, and its share of the total is expected to rise to
14 percent by 1980. While there are no available data on employment and
unemployment, it is clear that opportunities in the towns have not kept
pace with the supply of workers with the result that urban unemployment is
growing. There is also significant underemployment in ,oth the rural and
urban areas.
6.         During the period 1961-69 the GDP grew at an average rate of 4.8
percent per year in real terms. However, there was a slight downward trend
in the growth rate, from an average of 5.0 percent in 1961-65 to 4.6 per-
cent in 1965-69. These two growth periods in the 1960s reflect the behavior
of export receipts and in particular the secular movements of coffee export
prices and earnings. The dominant role of exports in influencing the level
of Ethiopia's GDP continues to be evident, as is discussed below. In 1970
and 1971 the rate of growth declined further to 3.5 and 4.0 percent respec-
tively. Thus the growth of the economy during the first four years of the
Third Five Year Plan (1968-69 to 1972-73) has been below the Plan target of
6 percenc per year. It was against this background of sluggish growth that
in 1971 the government extended the Third Five Year Plan by one year to
July 1974.   The financial dinmensions were revised and the annual growth
target for the remaining three years was reduced to between 5.4 percent and
5.7 percent.
7.        The population is growing at an estimated rate of 2.5 percent per
year. Thus it is apparent that the rate of growth in per capita incomes has



been moderate, perhaps 2.5 percent per year in the early 1960s but only 2 per-
cent or less in more recent years. This is significantly below the original
Third Five Year Plan target of 3.5 percent.
8.        During the last two decades the government has made efforts to
accelerate the pace of development, for example by controlling expenditures
on defence, increasing expenditures on education, introducing some tax in-
creases, and improving the effectiveness of the public service. However,
these efforts represent only a beginning in dealing with enormous problems.
For example, while enrollment in government primary schools has risen at
an average of 11 percent annually over the past 15 years, only 16 percent
of the 7-12 age group were in primary schools in 1971. The First and Second
Development Plans gave priority to the development of infrastructure and
the establishment of manufacturing industries (mainly government financed)
based on import substitution. The Third Five Year Plan emphasizes the
development of agriculture and of activities such as feeder road develop-
ment which will directly support agricultural development. However, pro-
gress to date has generally fallen below plan targets. Institutions are
changing gradually and the slow pace of institutional change has inhibited
economic growth. Additional constraining factors have been the balance of
payments (slow growth of export earnings and limited foreign capital in-
flows), inadequate levels of domestic savings and low absorptive capacity.
9.        The main cause of the slow growth during the first four years of
the Third Five Year Plan has been the slow rate of expansion of export earn-
ings, particularly export earnings from coffee. During 1968-71 total export
earnings increased at a rate of 5.6 percent per year, compared to the Plan
target of 8 percent. Moreover, since export prices were rising at 3.7 per-
cent per year, export volume was expanding at only 2 percent per annum. In
1972 the picture was much brighter; export earnings increased by almost 23
percent, due to rising prices and quantities of both coffee and non-coffee
exports. Hlowever, the longer-run prospects for exports are not so favorable.
The Bank's analysis has shown that export earnings are likely to rise by
only 4 percent per year during 1972-75 and by only 3 percent per year from
1976 to 1985. Real growth in export earnings from coffee is unlikely to
exceed 2 percent a year, particularly after 1975, because of slow growth
in demand. Further analysis shows that an export growth rate of 8 percent
is required to sustain growth of the GDP of 6 percent a year. If this is
to be achieved, non-coffee exports will have to carry the burden; the rate
of increase required of non-coffee exports is of the order of 12 percent
per annum. In this regard, the Agriculture Sector report (Report
No. PA-143a, January 15, 1973) which was provided to the Executive Directors
(R73-37) concludes that unlike many less developed countries, Ethiopia's
potential to diversify away from coffee and increase agricultural exports
such as livestock, pulses and oilseeds is favorable. There are also pos-
sibilities for selected exports of manufactures if adequate incentives are
created.
10.       Savings and investment increased during the late 1960s until the
shares of domestic savings and gross fixed capital formation in GDP reached



-4-
12.5 and 14.5 percent respectively in 1968. However, since that time these
ratios have fallen slightly. As a result the growth rates of savings and
investment during the first four years of the Third Five Year Plan have
been below Plan targets.
11.       Central Government capital expenditures have been rising steadily
in each year of the Third Five Year Plan. In 1968/69 they were $64.7
million. They rose sharply to $92.1 million in the following year and then
less steeply to a budgeted figure of $149.7 for 1972/73. However, the Third
Five Year Plan estimated average capital expenditures of $190 million a year
while the actual average over the first four years was only $98 million.
Even so the government has made a cormmendable effort to increase current
budget savings, which have risen from $30 million in 1968/69 to $55-60 million
in 1970/71 and 1971/72. However, the government's investment program has
been expanding more rapidly than have budget savings, with the result that the
proportion of capital expenditures financed by this source has been declining
slightly, and the dependence of the Central Government on foreign borrowing
has been increasing. Net foreign savings accounted for 35 percent of capital
expenditures in 1970/71 and 1971/72 and were expected to finance 42 percent
of the capital budget in 1972/73. The sources of public capital inflows to
Ethiopia during the past decade are shown on page 4 of Annex I. These data
indicate that the Bank/IDA share of this flow has increased, from 29.9
percent in 1962/67 to 33.3 percent in 1968/71.
12.       Although Ethiopia has not reached its economic targets during
tne current Development Plan, economic performance has been good consider-
ing the constraints which the country faces. Particularly noteworthy have
been the increased levels of budgetary savings and of developmental expendi-
tures which have been achieved in spite of a slowly growing GDP. At the same
time, Ethiopia needs and deserves as much external financial support as can
be provided. The country has attracted only modest amounts of private
capital and thus depends mainly on public capital inflows. However, unlike
many other African countries which were formerly dependent, Ethiopia has no
traditional source of technical and financial help. Annual gross public
capital inflows have been only about US$1.25 per capita in the past five years,
an amount clearly inadequate to achieve a reasonably high growth rate. Very
few developing countries receive less aid per capita.
13.       The present debt service ratio is about 11.5 percent.   However, if
the external capital needed to support a modest growth rate of only 4.5 per-
cent were to be obtained on conventional terms, and if exports continue to
grow at a low rate (3 percent per year or less), the debt service ratio would
probably exceed 20 percent before 1980. Given this prospect, and considering
Ethiopia's poverty and the low per capita capital inflow, future external
capital should be provided to the greatest extent possible on concessionary
terms.



-5-
14.       Currently, an extremely serious famine situation exists in North-
eastern Ethiopia. For three years, since the beginning of 1971, the major
parts of Wollo and Tigre provinces, with an estimated total population of
4.2 million (1970 CSO Estimate), have been suffering from sub-normal rainfall,
leading to a depletion of food reserves maintained by subsistence farming
families (constituting 90% of the population) in the region. As a result
famine conditions began to appear in early 1973. The 1973 "short rains",
which normally occur from February to April, were virtually a total failure
and intensified the famine conditions and related disease problems directly
affecting two million persons. Recognizing that the dimensions and depth of
the drought and related problems were constituting an emergency of grave
proportions, the Imperial Ethiopian Government established in April 1973 a
National Relief Committee and mounted a campaign to mobilize funds and material
supplies from internal and external resources to provide emergency assistance
to the victims of the drought. Persons who received relief aid probably
total some 1.2 million (670,000 in Wollo and 500,000 in Tigre Province). On
September 29, 1973, there were 63,000 people existing in 12 relief camps in
Wollo Province. External aid is presently being coordinated by the United
Nations Disaster Relief Coordinator. Due to lack of transportation facilities
and communications in the drought stricken areas, the dimensions of the
disaster are not known precisely; however, it is estimated that at least
50,000 people have died and that the toll may reach 100,000. Livestock herds
have been decimated. Work oxen are dead or seriously weakened, and planting
seed has been consumed. Tnus the prospects for planting and harvesting a
crop, even if rains are normal, are bleak. Rehabilitation of the people and
their economy promises to be slow and painful.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN ETHIOPIA
15.       From 1950 to the present, Bank Group lending in Ethiopia has total-
led $245 million, comprised of fourteen IDA credits of $136 million and
twelve Bank loans of $109 million. Additionally, the IFC has made five
commitments in Ethiopia totalling $15.8 million. Well over one-third of the
Bank loans and credits ($102.5 million) was committed in the last two years.
In addition to the substantial increase in the size of its operations in the
last two years, the Bank Group has softened its terms to Ethiopia; all but
$10.8 million of FY 72's $49.5 million program and all of FY 73's $53 mil-
lion program were IDA credits.
16.       Through 1969, the lending program concentrated primarily on assis-
ting the construction of trunk roads, power and telecommunication facilities.
In the late 1960's, the Bank Lending Program shifted in emphasis to agri-
culture and education, and in the past four years, the Bank Group has made
seven credits for agricultural development totalling $60.2 million ($43
million in FY 73) and two credits for education totalling $26.7 million. In



- 6 -
addition, the Bank approved in 1972, a $17 million credit for transportation
with emphasis on the construction of agricultural feeder roads. This program
of lending reflects the increased opportunity for agricultural lending brought
about by improved sectoral knowledge, and the heavier emphasis on agriculture
and education in the Government's priorities. This shift has been greatly
assisted by the Bank's Permanent Mission in Eastern Africa (PMEA), which has
played a major role in project identification and preparation in the agri-
culture sector.
17.       While the necessity for Parliamentary ratiEication tends to cause
delays in meeting the conditions of effectiveness, implementation is general-
ly good and there are no major implementation problems. Annex II contains
a summary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC investments as of
September 30, 1973, and notes on the execution of on--going projects.
18.       In addition to its lending program, the Bank is pursuing a number
of activities to support the Government's development strategy. As already
mentioned a mission visited Ethiopia to make a comprehensive study of the
agriculture sector. The Ethiopian Government, with IDA assistance,
undertook a review of the education sector to enable it to design a strategy
for the development of that sector. The Bank is executing agency for the
UNDP project which is providing a team of experts to help the Government in
improving its planning. Additionally the Bank has sponsored a Consultative
Group for Ethiopia, the second meeting of which was held in July 1973.
19.       Because Ethiopia has no traditional sources; of development assis-
tance, a relatively high level of per capita assistarnce from the Bank Group
is justified. This higher level of assistance was reflected in our FY72 and
FY 73 lending program, and will be reflected in the future by an increasing
level of lending. Because of Ethiopia's poverty and debt profile, these
future increases will have to come predominantly from IDA, and thus will
depend on the availability of IDA resources. Since the economy is essentially
agricultural and because agriculture offers the greatest opportunities for
development and for achieving improved income distribution and employment,
the main thrust of our lending program will be in that sector. A second
sector of priority is the education sector where, as a result of the IDA
assisted sector review, the Government is planning maLjor investment as part
of a program to change the structure of the system to make education more
relevant to development and provide more equitable distribution of education.
Given the inadequate infrastructure of the country, and the low level of
foreign and domestic capital available for investment, we shall also continue
to provide assistance to the development of other sectors, and to investment
in the infrastructure which is necessary to support development. In order
to relieve the constraint caused by Ethiopia's limited capacity to prepare
and implement projects, especially in the education and agricultural sectors,
we intend to continue providing assistance in project preparation, and,
through technical assistance, to help strengthen the administrative capacity
in the beneficiary institutions so that they will be able to utilize larger
inflows of assistance. In our lending for infrastructure we plan to continue
lending to such institutions as the Imperial Highway Authority (IHA), the



- 7 -
Imperial Board of Telecommunications of Ethiopia (IBTE), and the Ethiopian
Electric Light and Power Authority (EELPA). These are institutions with
which the Bank has worked for some years and which now have substantial
capacity for channelling resources into development programs.
20.       There is a sizeable pipeline of projects at various stages of prepara-
tion. Several of these will be follow-ups to ongoing projects and others
will be breaking new ground. Included in the first category will be a third
livestock project, a sixth highway project, follow-up credits for the Wolamo,
Humera, and Coffee projects and for the Agricultural and Industrial Development
Bank (AIDB)and for the second tranche of the fifth Telecommunications Project.
Included in the second category are proposals for a land settlement project
in the Adiabo Lowlands in Tigre province, a grain storage and marketing
project, and several regional agricultural projects which will provide a base
for eventual expansion into other areas of the program for financing
minimum agricultural inputs for large numbers of small farmers, the so-called
Minimum Package Program. The education sector is another priority for Bank
lending and we hope to present a fourth education project for your considera-
tion in the next 6 to 8 months; this will be based on an Education Sector
Review recently completed by the Government. In addition, we plan to present
a project in aviation which is linked to the promotion of tourism.
21.       A summary of recent external assistance to Ethiopia by source and
by sector can be seen on page 4 of Annex I. During 1968-71 the Bank and IDA
contributed 33 percent of gross inflows of official loans. This share is
expected to increase substantially during the next few years as amounts dis-
bursed under Bank loans and IDA credits rise.     As of December 31, 1972, the
Bank/IDA shares of total public debt outstanding and of total public debt
service were 38 percent and 27 percent respectively. Because of the low level
of assistance expected from bilateral donors, Bank Group debt outstanding as
a percent of total is expected to exceed 50 percent by the end of the next
five years, and even assuming reliance on IDA for lending operations, debt
service payments to the Bank Group will increase to approximately 45 percent
of total debt service by the end of that same period.
PART III - TELECOMMUNICATIONS IN ETHIOPIA
22.       Ethiopia is a large country with rugged topography, and a large
population. Presently Ethiopia has a telephone density of 0.2 per 100 popula-
tion; only five of the other 38 African countries for which statistics are
available have lower densities. Given the large distances involved and the
sparse road network, economic integration and improvement in administration
are dependent to a large degree on expansion of telecommtnmications. The dif-
ficult topography, the wide area over which agriculture is distributed and
the scarcity of good all-weather roads make telecommunications particularly
important for coordinating the movement, distribution and marketing of agri-
cultural products.    Also manufacturing, industry, tourism, and commerce
are making increasing demands on national and international telecommunica-
tions facilities.



- 8 -
23.       The ImDerial Board of Telecommunications of Ethiopia (IBTE) was
established in 1952. It is solely responsible for all public telecommuni-
cations services in Ethiopia and between Ethiopia and other countries. IBTE
is organized as a Government owned commercial corporation under overall di-
rection of the Ministry of Communications and has considerable autonomy to
administer its day-to-day operations. While there is a need for further
improvement, all services - urban, inter-urban, and international - have
grown and improved significantly since IBTE's estab]lishment. The expansion
and improvement have been assisted by external loans and technical assistance.
Local Telephone Service
24.       At the end of 1972, Ethiopia had 17 automatic telephone exchanges,
two of which were in Addis Ababa. The installed capacity was 52,790 lines,
35,500 of them in Addis Ababa. Most of the equipment is modern, is well
maintained and should provide good service for many years. There are 255
manual exchanges, with an installed capacity of 10,840 lines, serving small
towns and rural areas. Service is usually provided only in the daytime. The
increase in telephones installed in these small exchanges over the period
1968-71 averaged about 12 percent per annum. Based on past growth trends
and detailed development studies of subscriber and traffic demands in each
exchange area, IBTE has forecast an average rate of growth during the project
period of about the same level as during 1968-71.
Long Distance Service
25.       The long distance network consists of the recently inaugurated
microwave system linking Addis Ababa and Asmara, a number of VHF systems
and open-wire lines, which are supplemented by carrier systems on main
routes. The network comprised 137,670 trunk-circuit kilometers.
26.       The microwave system, Addis Ababa to Asmara, provides good service
between the two largest cities in the country.   Three other microwave systems
will be put in service in August 1974 and will improve service between Addis
Ababa and Dire Dawa/Harar, Jima and Shashamane. The four microwave systems
are all part of IBTE's Fourth Development Program (1968-1972) financed by a
previous Bank loan.
27.       Three automatic trunk exchanges were put in service in May 1973.
Along with the microwave svstems, they made possible subscriber trunk dialing
(STD) between the most important cities in Ethiopia. The completion of these
works will also facilitate future provision of good quality long distance
service to new areas.
28.       IBTE has proposed an increase in the number of long distance
circuits based on traffic projections on each route taking into consideration
all the circuits which would be available on completion of microwave communi-
cation systems provided in the fourth project.   The additional circuits would
remove congestiorn on various routes, reduce delays in obtaining service and
generally improve service and meet the growth of demand during the period.



-9-
Telegraph and Telex Service
29.       Telegraph service is provided over the telephone network and high
frequency radio. Installation of a public telegraph system with terminals
in 14 cities is almost completed. The expansion of telegraph service will
provide access, often the only one, to remote areas of the country.
30.       Telex service Is offered from one automatic exchange in Addis Ababa
and from manual exchanges in Asmara, Assab and Dire Dava. The number of
telex subscribers at the end of 1972 was 220. An order has been placed for
extension of the Addis Ababa exchange by 200 lines. The service offered to
the subscribers connected to the manual exchanges is poor, partly due to con-
gestion in the long distance telex network. The number of telex subscribers
has increased by 14 percent annually during the last four years. Since the
backlog of demands has already been met, IBTE has now forecast a 12 percent
annual growth for telex subscribers for the project period based on demands
and applications for this service largely in Addis Ababa.
International Services
31.       International telephone, telegraph and telex service is offered
via high frequency (HF) radio to 19 destinations abroad. The present facili-
ties do not meet the demand and booked calls are frequently cancelled due to
unacceptably long waiting times. Despite several limitations in the quality
of international service provided currently through HF radio, international
telephone traffic increased 16 percent and telex traffic 24 percent annually,
during 1967-71. The existing plant has not been able to meet the demand.
This has resulted in long waiting periods, sometimes more than 24 hours, and
a generally unacceptable quality of service.
Bank Group Assistance to the Sector
32.       The Bank has made four loans for telecommunications development
in Ethiopia.  The first loan, for $1.5 million, was made in 1951 to the
Empire of Ethiopia to help finance a project which was completed in 1956.
The next three loans were made directly to IBTE. The second loan, 314-ET
for $2.9 million, was made in 1962 and was related to a project which was
completed in 1965. The third loan, 441-ET for $4.8 million, was made in 1965
and was related to a project completed in 1969. The fourth loan, 605-ET for
$4.5 million with participation from the Swedish International Development
Authority (SIDA) which provided an equal amount, was made in 1969 to cover
part of the foreign cost of the 1968-72 expansion progran. Progress on the
project has been satisfactory; however, certain items originally scheduled
for completion in 1973 have been delayed by about one year and are not
expected to be completed until late 1974.

PART IV - THE PROGRANM )ND THE PROJECT
The Program
33.       The IBTE Fifth Development Program covers the five year period
1974-78, and is designed to meet the growth of demand in the areas now
being served and to extend service to some of the areas of the interior
where telecommunications services are sparse or non-existent. The program
consists of:
(a) installation of telephone exchange equipment, associated cable
distribution network and subscribers' equipment (telephone,
switchboards, etc.) in order to add approximately 44,000
telephone lines to the system. This will incIude the addition
of (i) about 39,800 telephone lines connected to automatic ex-
changes; 26,000 of these will be in Addis Ababa, with the
remainder in Asmara and the larger cities, and (ii) about
4,500 local telephone lines on manual exchanges in small
towns and rural areas.
(b) installation of long distance microwave systems from Shashamane
in the Central South to remote Moyale on the Kenya border,
from Asmara in the North to Tessenei on the Sudan border, from
Addis Ababa to Ghimbi in the isolated West, and another con-
necting Dese to Assab on the Red Sea plus extension and
reconstruction of long distance open wire, lines in various
parts of the country (see attached maps for existing and
planned long distance routes);
(c) installation of an automatic telex exchange for Asmara, together
with teleprinters, telegraph and telex extension equipment;

34.       The estimated cost of the program is $54.9 million equivalent, of
which approximately $35.2 million equivalent is foreign exchange.
35.       The Imperial Ethiopian Government requested that the Association
finance the foreign exchange costs of the IBTE Fifth Development Program
for the five year period 1974-1978. However, due to the shortage of IDA
resources in FY 74, IDA financing has been divided into two phases (i) a first
tranche of US$21.4 million now being presented and (ii) a second tranche, to
cover the balance of the foreign exchange requirements, to be put forward to
the Executive Directors in FY 75, subject to confirmation of continued priority
and the availability of IDA Lunds.   The program has been divided into two
overlapping projects whose timing and composition were largely determined by
procurement lead times and service priorities, and which should permit the
execution of the program in accordance with the original schedule.



The Project
36.       A report entitled "Imperial Board of Telecommunications of
Ethiopia, Appraisal of a Telecomrm unications Project" (Report No. 163-ET)
is being circulated separately. A Credit and Project Summary is provided
in Annex III.
37.       The Project forming the basis for the first of the two IDA credits
contemplated was appraised in the field in January and July 1973. Negotia-
tions for the proposed IDA credit were held in Washington in August 1973.
The Ethiopian Government was represented by H.E. Ato Ashenafi Shifferaw,
Vice Minister of Finance and Ato Betru Admassie, General Manager of the
Imperial Board of Telecommunications of Ethiopia.
38.       The Project consists of the first phase (1974-1976) of the IBTE's
Fifth Development Program and includes the following components:
(a) installation of automatic telephone exchange equipment for
29,300 lines and manual switchboards for about 4,500 local
lines;
(b) extension of local cable distribution networks, cable pres-
surization equipment and subscribers plant for about 27,000
new subscribers stations;
(c)  installation of microwave systems for the Asmara-Tessenei and
Dese-Assab routes; multiplex equipment for about 720 channel
ends on microwave systems; line carrier equipment for about
200 system channels; extensions and reconstruction of the
open-wire network, and installation of automatic trunk switching
equipment for Shashamane;
(d)  teleprinters, telex and telegraph extension equipment; and
(e) installation of an earth satellite station, including a SPADE
terminal 1/, an international telephone exchange for semi-
automatic operation, an interconnecting microwave system,
and consultants' assistance.
1/   Satellite communication provides two types of facilities.   For destina-
tions with high traffic the economic method is to use a block of circuits
whole time. More recently a special facility, SPADE, permits economic
traffic routing to other destinations by which circuits are made avail-
able on demand only for the duration of the calls providing for time
sharing of circuits with other satellite users.

Cost of Project and Financing Plan
39.       The estimated cost of the Project is $37.1 million equivalent of
which approximately $22.9 million (approximately 62 percent) are foreign
exchange costs.  The IDA credit of $21.4 million will finance all foreign
exchange costs of the first phase with the exception of $l.4 million of
equipment which has already Deen contracted by IBTE. The sources and appli-
cation of funds for the Project are summarized below:

Total Sources                      76.8     37.1         100
40.       The above financing plan assumes that 42 percent of the require-
ments would be provided from internal sources. The remaining 58 percent of
the requirement would be provided from the proposed credit.
41.       The relending terms for the proceeds of the proposed credit
would be 20 years, including a 5-year grace period, with an interest rate of
7-1/4 percent; the Government will bear the exchange risk.
Earnings and Tariffs
42.       Tariffs are on the high side as compared with most developing
countries. The annual income per telephone connection is $226, which is
significantly higher than that of most European countries despite a con-
siderably lower income in Ethiopia as compared with Europe, and the fact
that long distance service now in the early stages of development has not
yet made a full contribution to revenue. The most recent tariff revision
took place in 1971 when local call charges were increased by 33 percent.
43.       The level of tariffs in the period of 1968 to 1972 allowed IBTE
to earn a rate of return (the ratio of net operating income to the value
of net plant in service) varying from 10.7 percent to 12.3 percent annually;
this exceeded the 9 percent rate of return covenanted under the Bank loan



- 13 -
for the Fourth Telecommunication project. Internally generated funds during
this period were sufficient after servicing of debt to provide 60 percent
of the funds required for investment. Commencing in calendar year 1973,
however, the Government withdrew IBTE's tax exemptions and IBTE must now
pay income, excise and property taxes. These taxes will have a substantial
impact on IBTE earnings. Despite the fact that operating revenues during
the program period are estimated to increase at an average annual rate of
12.9 percent, the rate of return will decline from 12.3 percent in 1972 to
less than 6 percent in 1978, and net earnings at currently projected levels
of tariffs and costs while adequate to finance the IBTE investment in the
fifth program, will not be sufficient to finance a reasonable proportion of
subsequent development expansion.
44.       During negotiations, therefore, agreement was reached that IBTE
will take such actions as necessary to achieve an annual net rate of return
of 7 percent now and of 8 percent by the time the project is completed, and
to maintain it at that level thereafter. While there will be some opportunities
once the project is completed to lower operating costs and to increase
revenues through increasing system utilization, it is expected that achieve-
ment of this rate of return will require a telephone tariff increase of from
6 percent to 8 percent in 1976 and an additional increase of from 8 percent
to 10 percent in 1978. The time given for the achievement of the 8 percent
rate of return will however, allow the IBTE to review tariffs when the rate
of utilization of the larger capacity of the system and the lower costs
resulting from the introduction of the microwave system and subscriber trunk
dialing are definitely known.
Fiscal Impact
45.       As a result of the change of its tax liabilities, IBTE will pay
taxes to the Government in the amount of Eth.$59 million during the period
the program is being implemented, (1974-1978). Profit taxes alone will
equal about Eth.$4.0 million per year in 1978 and will be increasing at
about 10 percent per year.   In addition, IBTE will pay Eth.$27.9 million of
interest to the Government on the onlending of the proposed IDA credit, and
the subsequent phase II financing.
Collection Performance
46.       There has been substantial improvement in IBTE's collection practices
since the fourth project. Current billings are being collected on time or
the service of the delinquent subscriber is being terminated thus limiting
the amount of uncollectable accounts.
47.       The collections of Government accounts have improved significantly
since the fourth program. The Finance Ministry now makes direct payment to
IBTE for telecommunications services provided to all agencies supported by
the national budget. The Government agreed during negotiations to include a
covenant in the onlending agreement that it would continue to take the
necessary steps to ensure the payment of current government accounts on time
and assist in the settlement of arrears.

Financial Position
48.       Before December 31, 1967, IBTE's share capital was Eth$7.7 million.
The corporate charter restricts the amount of indebtedness to not more than
three times the amount of authorized and subscribed share capital. The share
capital was increased at December 31, 1967, to Eth$20 million by capitalizing
part of the Renewals and Expansion Reserve accumulated from earnings retained
by IBTE in order to enable IBTE to incur additional debt. The share capital
will again have to be increased to allow for the lending proposed for the
Fifth Development Program. IBTE plans to increase its share capital to
Eth$40 million during 1973 by again capitalizing part of the Renewals and
Expansion Reserve. The Government will provide IDA with copies of legisla-
tion authorizing the increase in share capital, as a condition of effectiveness.
49.       The debt/equity ratio during the execution of the program will
vary from 38/62 at December 31, 1974, to 52/48 at December 31, 1978. This
is satisfactory. Internal cash generation will cover annual debt service
at least 2.4 times during each year of the period. The debt service covenant
of the Joint Financing Agreement for Loan 605-ET requires IBTE to obtain the
Bank's agreement before contracting new debt unless the debt service coverage
as usually defined exceeds 1.5. The new credit agreement will contain a
similar covenant.
Return on Investment and Economic Rate of Return
50.       The internal rate of return on the project, defined as the discount
rate which equalizes the stream of expected financial revenue attributable to
the project with the capital and operating costs excluding taxes, is 18 per-
cent. If the foreign exchange component is shadow-priced at a value of
33 percent above the estimated cost, the rate of return would be 15 percent.
Sensitivity analyses reflecting a one year project delay and a 10 percent
variation in revenues were made which produced a rate of return of not less
than 13 percent. Although this rate of return is not in itself a test of
the economic merit of the project, it does provide a guide as to the justifi-
cation for the investment as indicated by subscribers' willingness to pay for
the services provided.
51.       The economic rate of return on the project is, however, undoubtedly
higher than the foregoing rate suggests, since the prices charged for telecom-
munications services are not considered an adequate measure of the full
benefits to the subscribers themselves. Moreover, the costs include the full
cost of extending service to new areas even though the full benefits will be
obtained only in the future as additional lines are connected in these areas.
52.       There are additional benefits within the system, and there are
benefits external to the system which accrue to parties other than those
who pay directly for the use of facilities, neither of which are wholly
reflected ifn the prices paid by subscribers. An example of additional
benefits within the system is the benefit extended to existing subscribers
through the increased opportunities for utilizing the system which occur



- 15 -
when new subscribers are added. Examples of external benefits are: (i)
reductions in the cost of perishable produce through arrangements for trans-
portation made by teleconmunications, thus increasing the supply and lowering
the price, (ii) lowering of inventory costs on the part of repair shops who
can telephone to central warehouses for spare parts, thus lowering the cost
of repairs to customers, (iii) availability of marketing information in rural
areas which allows farmers or marketing agents to transport products when they
are informed that prices are satisfactory, rather than transporting such goods
when there is no market or when the price is too low.
53.       Investment in agriculture and education and the necessary infra-
structure to support them have the highest priority in Ethiopia's overall
development strategy and in IDA lending policy to Ethiopia. However, lending
to these sectors cannot be increased beyond the ability of the economy to
develop the institutions and policy framework which enable resources to be
effectively utilized. This investment is in fact increasing as rapidly as the
absorptive capacity of the country will permit and no economically justified
project in these sectors is being held back for lack of finance. At the same
time the development of telecommunications is important to the development of
agriculture, commerce, industry and government.
54.       IBTE's program would assist in the economic development of the pro-
vinces through improved long distance services and extension of services to
about 100 rural areas which have no telephones now. The program provides for
new microwave links and additions to the micrmoave network now being provided
in the fourth program, and will give for the first time reliable communica-
tions between the provinces and the capital. The installation of the earth
satellite station would provide economical 24 hour high quality, reliable
international telecommunications to existing and new destinations in other
countries and would help in the promotion of exports and tourism.
Organization and Management
55.       IBTEts organization is generally satisfactory and effective.   IBTE
has recently taken steps to appoint a Manager of Planning and to implement
measures to strengthen the Accounting Organization. While the changes have
enabled IBTE to handle current work reasonably well, additional measures are
required to consolidate the organization to make it fully effective in these
two areas.  IBTE has confirmed its intention to carry out the necessary
organizational improvements and is consulting with the Association on the
steps to be taken to institutionalize the planning functions.
56.       Competent staff is available within IBTE for the preparation of
bidding documents, bid evaluation and detailed engineering of the project
with the exception of the earth satellite station, for which assistance by
a consultant is foreseen as necessary. The routes for the microwave systems
have already been surveyed by international consulting teams.



- 16 -
Procurement
57.       All goods financed by the IDA credit would be procured through
international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank Group's
Guidelines for Procurement, with the exception of extension equipment for
existing telephone exchanges and transmission systems and for special test
equipment and instruments. These items, which are estimated to cost US$1.4
million or about 6% of the IDA credit, will be procured through negotiation
from the original suppliers. Negotiated procurement is justified by the fact
that the initial installations, while designed to meet ultimate capacity
requirements, provided only for initial needs and economies will therefore
result from the use of existing common equipment, power supplies, rack space
and other plant items.
58.       In order to expedite the procurement process for the second phase
of the program and to allow the IBTE to standardize equipment, IBTE will
follow international competitive bidding procedures for equipment to be fi-
nanced under the project (the First Phase of the Program) and at the same
time obtain options for purchase of equipment to be financed under the
Second Phase, thereby eliminating the need for a second round of interna-
tional competitive bidding when financing is arranged for the second phase.
Disbursement
59.       Credit proceeds will be disbursed against the CIF costs of imported
equipment and the foreign exchange cost of consultants services.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
60.       The drafts of a Development Credit Agreement between the Empire of
Ethiopia and the Association and of a Project Agreement between the Associa-
tion and Imperial Board of Telecommunications of Ethiopia (IBTE), the Report
of the Committee provided for under Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles
of Agreement, and the text of a Resolution approving the proposed Development
Credit are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately. The
draft Agreements conform to the normal pattern for credits for projects of
this type.
61.       I am satisfied that the proposed Development Credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION - ETHIOPIA 1/
Ln No. 523     Fourth Highway Project; US$13.5 million Loan and US$7.7
Cr No. 111     million Credit of January 15, 1968; Original Closing Date:
December 31, 1973, revised to June 30, 1974.
The project was late in starting because initial bids were
high requiring changes in specifications and new bid invitations. Subsequent
progress has, however, been good. Of the three civil works contracts, two
have been completed - one a year ahead of schedule and the other about fifteen
months ahead of schedule: the third contract is expected to be completed
at the end of 1973, about three months behind schedule.
Ln No. 596     Power II, Finchaa Hydroelectric Project; US$23.1 million
Loan of May 9, 1969; Closing Date: December 31, 1973.
The project is nearing completion and the power station com-
menced commercial operations with two of the three sets commissioned in early
January 1973; about six months behind schedule. Tne third unit was damaged
in transit and commissioning may be delayed by up to six months pending
completion of repairs. Some minor works are still outstanding but all, of these
should be completed and the loan fully disbursed by June 30, 1974. The cost
of the project has escalated by about 20% over the original estimate, mainly
in local costs which xwill be met by the Borrower.
Ln No. 605      Telecommunications IV Project; US$4.5 million Loan of
June 3, 1969; Closing Date: December 31, 1973.
SIDA is providing joint financing of $4.5 million equivalent
to finance part of the foreign exchange cost.     Overall progress has been
reasonably on target. However, installation of five microwave routes has
been delayed until August 1974. The delays were due to difficulty in
obtaining suitable consultants to work on the survey of three routes and the
need to review the capacity, feasibility and other requirements of the other
two routes to assure conformity with the Pan-African Regional Telecommunica-
tions Recommendations.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.



ANNEX II
Page 4 of 6
Cr No. 169     Wolamo Agriculture Development Project; US83.5 million
Credit of November 16, 1969; Closing Date: June 30, 1976.
Overall progress is good. Participation of farmers in the
program to increase productivity through the provision of extension services,
inputs and credit is in advance of expectations as is participation in the
soil conservation program. Construction of feeder roads is behind schedule
and will reach only 50 percent of target because of a financial shortfall.
Land settlement will achieve only about 90 percent of the project target
because of unavailability of suitable land. With respect to the livestock
component, the vaccination campaign is proceeding well, but other aspects
are behind schedule.
Cr No. 188     Humera Agriculture Project: US$3.1 mil:Lion Credit of
May 28, 1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1973.
The project is progressing well, but is behind appraisal
schedule by about one year, due mainly to delays in procurement of heavy
road construction equipment and delays in installation of the Humera water
system, which had to be taken by force account construction due to non-
availability of contractors. Construction of facilities on the project farm
is satisfactory. Progress on consultant's study on the second phase project
is behind schedule.
Cr No. 243     Education II Project; US$9.5 million Credit of May 6, 1971;
Closing Date: June 30, 1976.
Project implementation is six to twelve months behind appraisal
schedule for certain project items. However, implementation is accelerating
and the project is expected to be completed by June 30, 1975, as originally
scheduled.  The Education Sector Survey has already been completed.
Cr No. 269     Addis Ababa Dairy Development Prolect; US$4.4 million
Credit of August 30, 1971; Closing Date: December 31, 1977.
Credit was slow in becoming effective because of recruitment
problems.  Overall progress is satisfactory but behind schedule.    Project
costs have risen substantially since appraisal and devaluation of the
dollar has reduced the value of IDA financing. An estimate of what can be
accomplished within the financial constraints must await receipt of firm
quotations on equipment for expansion of the dairy plant component.
Cr No. 290     Coffee Processing Project; US$6.3 million Credit of
March 20, 1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1977.
There were delays in obtaining Parliamentary approval (now
obtained) and recruiting key staff, and the credit was declared effective
only on December 15, 1972. Project implementation is gaining momentum.

Ln No. 818     Addis Ababa Water Supply and Sewerage Project; US$10.8
million Loan of May 1, 1972; Closing Date: September 30, 1977.
Necessary land for the water supply component of the project
has been acquired and work on the preparation of detailed designs and contract
documents is proceeding reasonably well. However, due to a delay in deciding
on the site of the sewage treatment works (now finalized), there has been a
delay in the preparatory work for the sewage system.
Cr No. 304     Agricultural and Industrial Development Bank Project;  US$11.0
million Credit of May 10, 1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1976
The credit became effective on October 25, 1972. Five indus-
trial projects for a total of $1.6 million have been authorized so far.
Authorizations for agricultural projects are proceeding more slowly with less
than $1.0 million comunitted to date.
Cr No. 332     Fifth Highway Project: US$17.0 million Credit of September 29,
1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1976
The United States Agency for International Development is
providing $9.3 million of parallel financing for construction, supervision
and purchase of maintenance equipment. The credit did not become effective
until July 24, 1973 due to delays in Parliamentary ratification and in the
submission to the Association of the required legal opinions. The engineering
consultants have been selected, contractor prequalification has been complet-
ed, and tendering for civil works is now underway. Road construction is
expected to start in January 1974, about nine months behind appraisal report
schedule. This is due to delay in credit effectiveness and consequent delay
in the selection of consultants, as well as the requirement for additional
site investigations to eliminate the use of expensive crushed stone material.
Cr No. 365     Second Livestock Project; US$5.0 million Credit of
April 2, 1973; Closing Date: July 15, 1977.
This credit became effective on August 24, 1973.
Cr No. 416     Agricultural Minimum Package Project; US$21.0 million
Credit of July 5, 1973; Closing Date: September 30, 1977.
The Credit is not yet effective; the terminal date for
effectiveness is November 30, 1973.

The Credit is not yet effective; the terminal date for
effectiveness is February 1, 1974.
Cr No. 418     Amibara Irrigation Project; US$17.0 million Credit
of July 5, 1973; Closing Date: March 31, 1979.
The Credit is not yet effective; the terminal date for
effectiveness is January 4, 1974.

The cost estimates are based largely on prices IBTE
has obtained for similar equipment under inter-
national competitive bidding during the ongoing
project and have been adjusted to reflect the
effects of currency parity changes up to the end
of July 1973. For new types of equipment, the
estimates have been based on prelininary price
quotations from possible suppliers.
Financing Plan:          The financing of the project would be distributed in ac-
cordance with the following source and application of funds:

Procuremnt
Arrangements           AU1 goods financed by the IDh credit would be pro-
eured through international competitive bidding,
with the exception of extension equipment for
existing telephone exchanges and transmission
systems and for special test equipment and
instruments. These items, which are estimated
to cost $1.4 million or about 6 percent of
the IDA credit, will be procured through
negotiation from the original suppliers
for reasons of compatibility and econoW,
subject to the prices payable for these
items being reasonable. Tenders for
equipment for both this project and the
second phase of the program would be
invited during the execution of the project.
Under this procedure, options would be
obtained for the equipment to be financed
under the second phase of the program.
