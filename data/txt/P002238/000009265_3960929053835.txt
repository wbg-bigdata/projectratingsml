MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE RWANDESE REPUBLIC
FOR A TRANSPORT SECTOR PROJECT
1.            The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Rwandese Republic for SDR 31.1 million (US$ 40.0
million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit would be
on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years and would help support the
transport sector in Rwanda. The project would be cofinanced with EDP
(US$32.6 million equivalent), OPEC (US$4.0 million equivalent), Swiss
Development Cooperation (US$9.4 million equivalent), and KfW (US$4.7 million
equivalent).
2.            Background.  Rwanda is a landlocked country with a hilly to
mountainous topography and densely settled population.   In this setting,
transport infrastructure helps reduce the isolaticn of the country from its
neighbors, and that of one region of the country from another.
Infrastructure has been given a high priority in Rwandese development
planning. Transport investments and policies as stated in these plans have
aimed in particular at: (a) improving international transport connections;
(b) upgrading to paved standard of the network of mein roads (some 970 km)
to facilitate the country's development and its social and administrative
integration; (c) ensuring better maintenance of the road network in general
(which totals some 12,500 km); and (d) improving transport services and
lowering transport costs in the rural areani. Since the main road network is
well developed, the Government, in its preparation of four-year road
programs, is now giving more emphasis to maintenance and rehabilitation.
This has been strongly encouraged by IDA, in concert with other donors. For
international transport, the most important objective is to strike the right
balance between the cost of access to and from Rwanda and its reliability.
In the past, imbalances in cost and reliability have resulted from
restrictive regulatory policies, which will be revised and streamlined under
the project.
3.            Rationale for IDA Involvement.  IDA has played an important
role in the transport sector in Rwanda, including the rebuilding of the most
important external road link, and in refocusing the road program towards
improved road maintenance. The involvement in neighboring countries and in
regional studies, the Great Lakes Corridor Study being the latest, has
provided a good opportunity for IDA to lead donor and regional coordination
for the sector. Development of rural transport in support of agriculture is
another main IDA concern that would be continued under the project.
4.            Prolect Oblectives.  As a sector-wide operation, the project
aims to address requirements for roads and other needs of the transport
sector. The most important policy dimensions include actions to streamline
the regulatory environment, ensure regular financing of sector expenditures,
reclassify the road network, and improve institutional arrangements and
responsibilities in the sector. Policy directions for the sector are



- 2 -
outlined in a Letter of Sectoral Development Policy which the Government has
transmitted to IDA. Specific measures in support of the policies are
contained in an Action Plan accompanying the Letter of Policy. The
principal public enterprises In the sector will be assisted through a
performance contract between the Government and the bus company ONATRACOM,
and through assistance in the privatization of the trucking company STIR.
Responsibilities in the sector between central and local authorities would
be clarified. Specific objectives of this sectoral approach are tot
(a) consolidate the achievements of the program begun under the Highway VI
project (Cr. 1641-RW), particularly with regard to cost recovery for road
maintenance; (b) improve the organization of road maintenance; (c) expand
maintenance to include a pilot project for communal roads; (d) relieve
constraints imposed by unnecessary regulation; and (e) in consultation with
concerned donors, ensure support for essential training needs and
institutional development of the transport sector.
5.            Project Description.  The project focuses on road maintenance,
implementation of a pilot project of about 600 km of rural (communal) roads,
and support for improved international access, including deregulation of
international transport. IDA would participate with other donors in the
reconstruction of a 75-km section of two of the main roads remaini-ig to be
upgraded under the overall roads program. For the transport sector, the
project includes a small shipyard on Lake Kivu and support to improved
vehicle safety inspection. Institutional strengthening, assistance and
professional training are included for the ministries concerned (MINITRAPE
and MINITRANSCO), as well as to improve road safety and develop local road
contractors. The project, to be carried out over four years, would provide
funds for civil works, equipment, supplies, training and technical
assistance.
6.            Project cost.  The total cost of the project is estimated at
US$ 148.85 million. Of this amount, the foreign exchange cost is US$96.61
million (65%). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursements, and the
disbursement schedule, are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Rwanda are
given in Schedules C and D, respectively. Staff Appraisal Report No. 8386-
RW, dated April 30, 1990, is being distributed separately.
7.            Agreed Actions.  The main policy measures promoted by the
project concern the regulatory framework (including participation in public
enterprise reform), financing of the sector, donor coordination and
international access. In accordance with the Action Plan accompanying the
Letter of Sectoral Development Policy, the Government would (i) remove an
obligation to move certain products by air transport; (ii) draft new
legislation for international transport; (iii) reduce present road transport
tariffs; (iv) remove the requirement for consular clearance for truck
transport from Kenya; and (v) review freight handling at Kigali airport.
TIe Action Plan would be reviewed on an annual basis and modified as
necessary. Annual preparation of three-year expenditure programs for roads,



- 3 -
begun under Highway VI, would be continued and extended to the whole
transport sector. IDA would review the three-year program, on an annual
basis. The manpower development programs of M4INITRAPE and MINITRANSCO would
also be strengthened. Conditions of disbursements are a conclusion of
agreements with co-donors for the Gitarama-Kibuye road and a plan for
resettlement and expropriation for this road; a contract for operation of
the Lake Kivu shipyard; and operating agreements between communes and
MINITRAPE for the communal road program.
8.            The financing of sectoral expenditures would be placed on a
sounder footing.  The Road Fund, which receives the proceeds from special
taxes and road tolls, is expected to meet at least half, but not all, of
road maintenance requirements. Collection of charges for the Road Fund from
road users has already begun. A new law and decree on implementation
procedures concerning the Road Fund has been passed. The rest of road
maintenance requirements would be provided by the national Development
Budget.
9.            Local governments (communes) would carry out the communal
roads pilot project under the technical guidance from MINITRAPE.
Promulgation of a decree on road reclassification would be a condition of
effectiveness.
10.           Justification.  Improvement of road maintenance, and selective
road upgrading, would reduce vehicle operating costs and lessen the need for
costly future rehabilitation, especially for the paved network. Improvement
of the rural roads would support food production and exports of coffee and
tea. Less costly international access would promote exports and reduce the
cost of imports. The project would also support the development of local
contractors for road works and further privatization of transport services.
11.           Environmental Assessment.  An environmental assessment of the
proposed Gitarama-Kibuye road paving was undertaken during - oject
preparation. It recommended that further attention be given to the disposal
of fill from road works, the relocation of any families displaced by the
works, the impact on tourism in the Kibuye area, and road safety. The
Government has responded on each of these points. Survey teams are
determining the number of families affected, and a study of tourism
requirements and potential in Kibuye is underway. Assurances that the
environmental aspects identified would be satisfactorily addressed during
implementation have been obtained.
12.           Risks.  Cost overruns on the Gitarama-Kibuye road, delays in
the road maintenance program, and cost increases and/or delays with the
communal roads pilot program are the main risks of the project. The
likelihood of cost overruns for the Kibuye road has been minimized through
detailed design, based on recent cost data from ongoing construction works
in similar terrain. Delays in the road maintenance program would be
minimized through the timely funding of expenditures from the strengthened
Road Fund, as well as through training of MINITRAPE staff. The main



response to the institutional risks of the communal roads pilot project Is
through intensive project monitoring, and supporting tecbnLacl assistance,
through spreading the participation geographically and by different means of
implementation (i.e., works partly by administration, partly by
contractors).
13.           Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.

(1) USS amounts are computed at rate of negotiations dates for Original Principals,
whereas the current rate is applied to the Undisbursed Amounts.
(2) Because of the depreciation of the $US w.r.t. the SDR (i) it is possible that the
Undisbursed amount is higher than the Original amount, and (ii) the sum of Total
now held by IDA and Bank and Total Undisbursed, is higher than Total outstanding.
