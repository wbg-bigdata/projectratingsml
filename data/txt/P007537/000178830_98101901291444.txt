MEXICO
APPRAISAL OF FERTILIZER PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report deals with the appraisal of a fertilizer project in
Mexico comprising two plants with a total capacity of 2,500 tons per day
(TPD) of urea and the expansion of an insecticide (parathion) plant from
7,500 to 10,000 tons per year (TPY). One of the urea plants (1,000 TPD)
and the insecticide plant to be expanded are located at or near Salamanca,
in the State of Guanajuato, and the other urea plant (1,500 TPD) at Coatza-
coalcos, in the State of Veracruz. The plants will be owned by Guanos y
Fertilizantes de Mexico (Guanomex), a fully-owned Government corporation,
with major responsibility in the manufacture and distribution of fertilizer.
The feedstock will be ammonia produced from natural gas by Petroleos Mexicanos
(Pemex), the government agency which has exclusive rights to extract, refine
and distribute petroleum and natural gas, and operate basic petrochemical
industries. Total financing required for the project is estimated at US$150
million, US$53 million of which is in foreign exchange (including US$7
million in interest during construction). A Bank loan of US$50 million
equivalent is proposed, to be made to Nafinsa and Guanomex, and guaranteed
by the Government.
ii.       Chemical fertilizer consumption grew in Mexico at an average rate
of 10.4% annually in the last decade reaching in 1973 a total of 750,000
nutrient tons, of which 75% is nitrogen (N), 21% phosphate (P205) and 4%
potassium (K20). The present average rate of fertilizer application in
Mexico (29 nutrient kg/ha)--although nearly twice that for all developing
countries combined-- is below the world's average of 50 kg/ha. Furthermore,
the Mexican average masks a wide range of fertilization levels from nearly
optimum dosages in flat irrigated land in the northwest to none in many rain-
fed highland areas (it is estimated that fertilized land--now about 5.7
million ha--can be doubled). Nitrogenous fertilizer consumption is expected
to grow at 8.7% annually through 1985 consistent witlh the findings of a model
for Mexican agriculture developed jointly by the Government and the Bank.
iii.      Mexico has a well developed fertilizer industry based on extensive
resources of natural gas and sulfur. At present, production and consumption
of finished fertilizer are roughly balanced, but practically all the phos-
phate rock and more than one third of the ammonia required has to be imported.
During the 80s, however, Mexico is expected to become substantially self-
sufficient in fertilizer raw materials. Recent finds of phosphate deposits
in Baja California and an aggressive program to further prospect for and
develop natural gas resources and to build additional capacity for the pro-
duction of ammonia and petrochemicals coupled with adequate infrastructure,
experienced manpower, and competent technical and managerial personnel
should provide the basis for Mexico to become independent of imports and
possibly a net exporter of fertilizers.



iv.       Production and distribution of fertilizer in Mexico is mainly
carried out by three enterprises, two of which are fully Government-owned
(Pemex and Guanomex) and a third which is a joint public and private sector
enterprise: Fosfatados Mexicanos S.A. (FFM). Guanomex now operates 16
fertilizer plants with a combined capacity of 437,300 TPY of N. The Company
is efficiently run, has a good record for plant construction and in 1973-74
operated available nitrogen capacity at 80%, less than it would most likely
have achieved had it not been constrained by a shortage of ammonia in the
world market. Guanomex has a sound financial structure. The Government is
aware of the importance of pesticides in agricultural production and has
given Guanomex an important, but non-exclusive role in their manufacture
and distribution.
v.        The project envisages the utilization of modern, proven technology
for the manufacture of urea and parathion, using the assistance of experienced
engineering firms. In agreement with the Bank two of the firms--Foster
Wheeler Energy Corp. (US) and Atlas Foster Wheeler Mexicana--have already
been contracted for the 1,000 TPD urea plant. Furthermore Guanomex has set
up a Project Execution Team to implement the project with similar responsi-
bilities as in earlier projects and the Bank considers this arrangement to be
satisfactory. The insecticide plant expansion involves little new in process
or equipment and, with the advice of the licensor--Stauffer of the US--no
difficulties are expected.
vi.       The proposed Bank loan would be made for 14 years, including
3-1/2 years of grace. Guanomex would pay 12% per annum interest with the
difference of 3-1/2% over the assumed Bank interest rate of 8-1/2% accruing
to the Government. The loan will finance equipment procured through inter-
national competitive bidding; long-lead imported equipment which, because of
being critical to the completion of the project, will be procured from a
limited list of suppliers; items under US$50,000 procured by international
shopping; and fees for process licensing and engineering services. To main-
tain the schedule of the Bajio II urea plant, the Bank has agreed to the
advanced contracting of engineering services and long-lead equipment and
Guanomex has been advised that, subject to approval of the loan by the
Executive Directors, up to US$3.6 million will be reimbursed to Guanomex for
down payments on these contracts. The balance of the financing required will
be met by raising Guanomex's equity by Mex$750 (US$60.0) million and long-term
borrowing of Mex$502 (US$40.2) million from Mexican and foreign financial insti-
tutions.
vii.      During the initial years of operations of the two new urea plants
up to 36% of their output may have to be exported. Based on expected urea
prices of US$122 per ton delivered to retailers in Mexico and US$93 per ton
f.o.b. for sales abroad in those years when exports have been projected to
occur, the project is forecast to yield a financial rate of return of 14.5%
after income taxes (20.3% before taxes). The financial position of Guanomex
is projected to remain sound; it will be safeguarded by a number of financial
covenants and further improve as loans are repaid, reserves are built up, new
efficient plants are built to replace some of the obsolete units and new
policies now being developed on fertilizer distribution, transportation and
inventories are implemented.



- iii -
viii.     Long-term international prices per ton of urea and ammonia are
projected to be US$130 CIF Mexican port and US$88 delivered at factory site
respectively. For the part of urea projected to be exported between 1979
and 1982, estimated FOB US Gulf prices have been used in the calculation of
the project benefits. On this basis, the project's economic rate of return
is 24.0%. A drop of 10% in the urea price would depress the return by 6.2
percentage points. Lower capacity utilization (at 80%) would result in a
return of 20.3% and a capital cost overrun of 15%, would still leave a satis-
factory rate of return of 21.2%.
ix.       Guanomex has agreed that a study of fertilizer distribution systems,
including the optimization of inventory levels, coupled to a survey of the
measures required to promote the proper use of fertilizer by small farmers,
should be carried out under terms of reference agreed upon by the Bank and
the recommendations of such a study be implemented after having been reviewed
by the Bank.
x.        The project would result in substantial benefits to the Mexican
economy and faces no important technical or financial risks. Based on
recommendations summarized at the end of this report, the project is suitable
for a Bank loan of US$50 million equivalent.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Mexican Government development bank, Nacional Financiera S.A.
(Nafinsa) and Guanos y Fertilizantes de Mexico S.A. (Guanomex or the Company),
a firm fully owned by Nafinsa, have requested a Bank loan of US$50 million
equivalent for a project comprising two urea plants and the expansion of an
insecticide (parathion) plant to be located in the States of Guanajuato and
Veracruz (Map: IBRD 11494). The proposed urea plants will have capacities
of 1,000 and 1,500 tons per day (TPD) or a total of 825,000 tons per year
(TPY), equivalent to 379,500 TPY of nitrogen (N). 1/ They will increase the
country's existing N capacity by 79% to 858,400 TPY of nitrogen. The para-
thion plant's capacity will be increased by 33% to 10,000 TPY.
1.02      The fertilizer sector in Mexico was first reviewed by the Bank in
June 1974, at which time the project's scope was outlined. The appraisal
of the project was carried out in Mexico in September 1974 by Messrs.
Tarnawiecki (Chief), Brown and de la Balze of the Industrial Projects Depart-
ment. This would be the first Bank Group operation in the fertilizer sector
in Mexico.
II. THE FERTILIZER INDUSTRY AND GUANOMEX
A.   The Mexican Fertilizer Industry
2.01      Mexico has a well established fertilizer industry based mainly on
domestic natural gas and sulfur but so far requiring large ammonia and phos-
phate rock imports. The manufacture of nitrogenous fertilizer is for all
practical purposes in the hands of two organizations, both of them in the
public sector: Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) produces virtually all the
ammonia made locally, and Guanomex produces all other nitrogenous fertili-
zers, with the exception of by-product ammonium sulfate (para. 3.07).
Pemex is the Government agency which, in Mexico, is in exclusive charge of
petroleum extraction and refining and the distribution of petroleum products
as well as the manufacture of petrochemicals, including ammonia. 2/ As a
consequence of this organizational set-up, ammonia and urea are manufactured
by two different enterprises; this arrangement, although not in widespread
use, does not interfere with efficient and economical integration of the
manufacturing operations as long as the ammonia and urea plants are located
close to each other; this is the case in the proposed project.
1/   A glossary of terms used in the report is contained in Annex 1-1
and frequentlv used units and conversion factors are shown in Annex 1-2.
2/   Domestic distribution of all fertilizers, including imported products,
is the exclusive responsibility of Guanomex (para. 3.12).



-2-
2.02      Phosphate fertilizers are manufactured by Guanomex and Fertili-
zantes Fosfatados Mexicanos (FFM), a company which is also one of the largest
phosphoric acid exporters in the world; though majority-owned by Banco de
Mexico, FFM is generally considered as a private enterprise. Until now
practically all phosphate rock has been imported (96% of requirements). How-
ever, last year, deposits of phospPate nodules were found in the Baja California
territory. Drilling over a 300 km area and evaluation of reserves will not be
completed until late in 1975, but preliminary indications are that these de-
posits will probably permit Mexico to satisfy its own phosphate needs and possi-
bly leave an exportable surplus.
2.03      Feedstock for the production of ammonia in Mexico is natural gas
from deposits developed by Pemex, mainly in the States of Tamaulipas and
Tabasco. Production of ammonia has not increased significantly since 1969
(para. 3.08) but Pemex intends to utilize its rapidly growing reserves of
natural gas (estimated at 11 trillion SCF at the end of 1973) 1/ to further
develop its petrochemical industries, including trebling ammonia production
by 1985 (para. 3.10).
B.   Description of Guanomex
2.04      Guanomex, created in July 1943, was originally charged with the
responsibility of promoting the exploitation of Mexico's guano deposits and
the use of fertilizers in general (Annex 2-1). Subsequently, small instal-
lations for the manufacture of simple superphosphate (SSP) and bone meal
were added and, in 1951, the first Mexican chemical nitrogenous fertilizer
plant came into operation with the manufacture of ammonium sulfate in
Cuautitlan, in the State of Mexico.
2.05      Rapidly expanding demand favored the establishment of several
fertilizer plants in the private sector. In 1965, the Government decided
that orderly growth of the industry, savings in transportation costs and
the realization of economies of scale could be obtained by consolidation
of most of the fertilizer activities. Between 1965 and 1969, Guanomex,
through negotiations, bought out Fertilizantes de Monclova S.A. (ammonium
nitrate), Fertilizantes del Istmo S.A. (ammonium sulfate), Fertilizantes
del Bajio S.A. (urea) and Fertilizantes Delta as well as Montrose Mexicana
S.A. and Lerma Industrial S.A. (chlorinated insecticides). The Government
also transferred to Guanomex the assets of Industria Petroquimica Nacional,
a small private company then in process of liquidation and, in 1970, Guanomex
acquired a controlling interest in Fertica S.A., a holding company owning
fertilizer plants in Costa Rica, El Salvador and Guatemala.
1/   The Government has budgeted US$248 million for the development of
additional gas reserves (mainly in the States of Chiapas and Tabasco)
in the 3-year period ending in December 1976.



-3-
2.06      At present Guanomex has 36 plants of which 16 are fertilizer
plants 1/ with a total capacity of 437,300 TPY of N, 122,000 TPY of P205 and
27,000 TPY of K20 2/ as well as two plants for the manufacture of chlorinated
and phosphorated insecticides (7,700 and 7,500 TPY respectively) and small
plants for various chemicals.  The average age 3/ of the Company's fertilizer
plants is now about 10 years and four plants are more than 15 years old.
The location of the manufacturing facilities as well as the Company's sales
areas are shown in Map: IBRD 11494.
C.   Organization and Management
2.07      The organization chart for the Company is shown in Annex 2-2.
Guanomex's Board of Directors consists of nine members appointed by the
President of Mexico, including the Secretary of National Patrimony, and
President of Pemex, Mr. Francisco J. Alejo, who is the Chairman, the Secre-
taries of Agriculture, Finances, and Industry and Trade, and representatives
of Nafinsa. The day-to-day operations are carried out by six decentralized
departments under the General Director, Mr. Luciano Barraza Allande. Manu-
facturing plants are grouped in 11 units (Annex 2-3) under the general direc-
tion of the Production Manager, Mr. Adolfo Sisto Velasco, an experienced
engineer of international reputation. The Company's agricultural extension,
fertilizer promotion and sales activities are coordinated under Mr. Francisco
Castillo Creus.
2.08      Construction of new plants is the responsibility of the Development
Department presently managed by Mr. Ernesto Badillo, a competent executive
with a background in agricultural economics. Three divisions report to him:
Research, Projects and Construction Supervision. With the collaboration of
foreign and local engineering firms, Guanomex has gained considerable experi-
ence during the implementation of more than a dozen plants, including four
large scale fertilizer plants, which have been built in the last six years.
D.   Past Production and Financial Position
2.09      The production performance of Guanomex has been satisfactory.
Manufacturing units are well run and quality of the engineering and techni-
cal plant staff is high. In the last two years average capacity utilization
(in terms of nutrient tons) was 80% for nitrogenous and 93% for phosphatic
fertilizers. Operating data for the more important plants are summarized
below and detailed data for all plants are given in Annex 2-3.

The above table indicates that with the exception of one SSP and one
ammonium sulfate plant and the recently completed insecticides plant all
other production units have been operating at a rather high capacity utili-
zation. The urea plants suffered over the last two years from scarcity of
ammonia supplies which, however, will be alleviated by the output of new

2.11      The Government controls the price of fertilizer and that of the
Company's principal raw material, ammonia, through a pricing policy which
is directed towards avoiding great fluctuations in fertilizer prices and
which largely determines the Company's profitability. The other major
input, phosphate rock, is dependent on international prices. The effect
of world market price fluctuations for raw materials on the Company's prof-
itability will decline as Pemex's ammonia capacity is expanded and domestic
phosphate rock production on a large scale commences and thus replaces
imports. Domestic fertilizer prices were increased between 1971 and the end
of 1974 (i.e. from US$108 to 122 per ton of urea placed at main distribution
points), but they are still substantially below those presently prevailing
in the international market, which for urea are now between US$300 and 350
per ton. It is expected that this gap between domestic and international
pr4ces will narrow as the latter recede from their current exceptionally
high level.



-6-
2.12      The Government has appropriated Mex$500 million to compensate the
Company for losses incurred through the importation of ammonia at the present
high prices and its sale for direct application as fertilizer at the lower
domestic price as well as for those losses resulting from higher cost of some
imported raw materials which are not reflected in the finished product price.
During FY1974, the Company had received Mex$82.8 million for this purpose.

2.14      The Company's low current ratio in the last three years results
from Guanomex acting, in a way, as a financing agent for fertilizer sales.
Even "cash" sales are frequently not paid for 60 days or more. Receivables
are interest-free for sixty days and earn an interest of about 1-1/4% monthly
afterwards. Furthermore, Guanomex also extends direct credits to dealers
covering the payment terms that they in turn accept from the buyers. Begin-
ning in FY 1973, the Company accumulated sizable inventories of finished
goods 1/ (over 70% of total inventories) in line with a Government policy to
avoid lack of fertilizer at a time of worldwide shortages. In addition,
Guanomex is undertaking a study of the optimum level of its inventories
taking into account freight, storage and capital costs as well as the maximum
admissible risk of crop losses due to lack of fertilizers in different areas.
2.15      Guanomex has established good vertical reporting procedures
and horizontal communications, particularly among the Production, Financial,
Sales and Development Departments, are being improved. The Finance Department
is mainly geared to the accounting aspects of financial control. Guanomex
will strengthen this department and provide it with the capacity for better
control of current assets and prepare adequate financial projections as
required by the Bank. Guanomex has also agreed to provide the Bank with
quarterly financial statements and annual audited reports submitted by inde-
pendent auditors acceptable to the Bank.
III. THE MARKET
A.   A riculture in Mexico and the Need for Fertilizers
3.01      Of the total area of Mexico, less than 12% (about 22 million ha.)
is arable land (i.e. excluding permanent pastures, forests and arid land).
A relatively large proportion is left fallow each year so that actually
cultivated land was estimated in 1974 at 16 million ha., of which approximately
24% is irrigated. Double-cropping in some areas, especially in the Northwest,
increases cropped area by about 0.6 million ha.
3.02      The main food crops are corn, wheat, sorghum, beans and soya and
the main industrial crops are cotton, sugarcane and coffee (Annex 3-1).
The following table compares the agricultural yields for several crops in
Mexico with those of a number of other selected countries:
1/   Including fertilizer held by dealers on consignment.

It can be seen that Mexican yields for wheat 1/, sorghum and cotton are
considerably higher than the world averages although the yield for corn is
lower than in all other major producing areas. It is expected that yields
for beans, sugarcane and coffee, although also higher than the world averages,
can be improved. Agricultural production in Mexico during the last 10 years
has not kept pace with population. The availability of new land is limited
and water is a scarce resource in large areas. Under these conditions,
future growth of agricultural output will be based, to a large degree, on
better utilization of existing resources and improved farming practices,
including intensified and proper use of fertilizers and pesticides, irriga-
tion, multiple cropping and development of new--and perhaps more versatile--
varieties of the most important crops.
3.03      At present, the average fertilizer application rate in Mexico--
although 1.9 times higher than for all developing countries taken together--
is below the world average (Annex 3-1, Table 2). Averages, however, mask
the wide variety of agricultural practices in Mexico ranging from very modern
farming on flat irrigated land in Northwestern states, in which fertilizer
dosages approach (and may occasionally surpass) optimum economic rates, to
no fertilization in many rain-fed highland areas. Guanomex estimates that
the area now being fertilized--estimated at 5.7 million ha.--can be doubled.
1/   With the help of the Rockefeller Foundation, high yielding varieties
(HYVs) of wheat were developed in Mexico from Norin 10, a Japanese
dwarf variety introduced in the US after the Second World War. In 1964
they were exported to the Indian sub-continent where they have contri-
buted largely to the increase in yields attained in the last decade.

/3   Preliminary estimates by Guanomex.
3.05      After a very rapid growth in the decade from 1953 to 1963, fertilizer
consumption has continued growing at a fairly steady annual rate of 10.4%
from 1963 through 1973. Domestic production substantially balanced consump-
tion with a small, though growing surplus of phosphatic fertilizer and a
deficit in nitrogen fertilizer. All potassium fertilizer is imported. The
average N:P 0 :K0 ratio was 17:4.8:1 in 1973, slightly lower in N than in
1969, when it was 20:6.2:1. This nutrient ratio compares to a world average
of 1.9:1.2:1 in 1972, and stems from the preponderant use of fertilizer on
soils rich in phosphate and potassium, mainly in the Northwest (Annex 3-2,
Table 9). As fertilizer application in other areas increases and nutrients
in new cultivated land are depleted, the relative demand for phosphate and
potassic fertilizers should increase.



- 10 -
3.06      The three principal nitrogenous fertilizers consumed in Mexico
are ammonia (32%), urea (24%) and ammonium sulfate (26%). While the pro-
portion of direct ammonia application has remained at more than 30% of
total N since 1953, the consumption share of urea has more than trebled and
that of ammonium sulfate, which in 1953 accounted for two-thirds of consump-
tion, has declined substantially.
3.07      The main nitrogenous fertilizers produced in Mexico are liquid
ammonia (see following para.), urea, whose output gtew from 19,000 tons in
1963 to 167,000 tons in 1973, and ammonium sulfate, which, although relatively
less important than 10 years ago, still accounts for 19% of all N production
in Mexico. In addition to the ammonium sulfate produced by Guanomex, this
fertilizer is also a by-product in the manufacture of caprolactam (by Univex),
steel (Altos Hornos de Mexico), and coke (Compania Mexicana de Coke).
3.08      In the last three years (1971-1973), about 27% of Mexico's total
ammonia consumption--for direct application as fertilizer as well as an
intermediate material for other fertilizers and industrial uses--was
imported as shown in the following table:

To substitute for the current Mexican import requirements of ammonia and
utilize its significant resources of natural gas economically, Pemex has
embarked on an expansion program which is described further below.
2.   Future
3.09      Guanomex has made projections for the consumption of nitrogen
through 1985 based on regression curves fitted to actual 1950-1973 consump-
tion and the implicit projected average growth rate of 8.7% annually is
consistent with results derived from a model for the Mexican agricultural
sector that was developed jointly by the Government of Mexico and the Bank's
Development Research Center (Annex 3-3). Guanomex projects consumption of
urea and complex fertilizers to grow more rapidly than in the past because
of their suitability for most crops and soils, ease of handling and lower



transportat.ion costs. Furthermore, Guanomex and the Bank agree that growth
in the direct application of ammonia as fertilizer will slow down since
application rates in many areas of the northwest are already high. Urea
consumption, however, even after such accelerated increase, would provide
only 45% of the total N consumption in 1985, which is a lower proportion than
in many other countries (Annex 3-4). Urea is presently applied to and most of
the projected growth in consumption wll take place in irrigated land and dry
farming areas which have adequate rainfall and where modern farming techni-
ques are widespread, such as Sonora, Sinaloa, Baja California, Chihuahua,
Jalisco and Guanajuato. The projections for individual products through 1985
are contained in Annex 3-5.
3.10      Production projections for N fertilizers through 1984 are based on
known projects for which definite construction schedules and financing plans
exist, i.e. the two urea plants included in the present project, three ammonium
sulfate and nitrate plants, and four ammonia plants which Pemex plans to com-
plete by 1980 (Annex 3-5, Table 3), as well as a 200,000 TPY DAP and complex
fertilizer plant, whose site will be finally decided after a long-term source
of supply of phosphate rock is secured and the corresponding feasibility study
is prepared. The production and consumption projections contained in Annex 3-5
are summarized below:

and for other industrial uses

3.11      It can be seen in the table above that in the first four full years
of operation of the project (1979-82), urea production from the existing and
proposed nlants would be higher than the consumption projections used. Since
the need for other solid fertilizers, on the other hand, exceeds their pro-
jected production, it is probable that some of the urea could be diverted to



-I2-
manufacture mixed fertilizers. Nevertheless, in the financial projections it
has been conservatively assumed that about 120,000 tons annually of N as urea
will be exported, between 1979 and 1982, mainly to the Central American Common
Market and South America. Imports of urea in the Western Hemisphere are shown
in Annex 3-6. Guanomex has already had experience in exporting urea in the
last 10 years 1/.
C.   Fertilizer Distribution
3.12      Guanomex is the only agency for the wholesale distribution of
fertilizer for domestic consumption (including ammonia for direct applica-
tion); exports are handled by both Guanomex and FFM. Guanomex has avoided,
as a matter of policy, being tied to only one distribution channel. In 1973,
it sold more than half (57%) of its fertilizer through some 200 dealers, 95%
of which were private enterprises and 5% cooperative organizations and three
were small public sector agencies. The balance of the Company's sales (43%)
were handled through agricultural banks which have become increasingly more
important (having been responsible for 15% of sales in 1970 and 21% in 1973),
5% was exported, 8% sold directly to sugar mills, and the residual 9% went to
"direct" clients, i.e. mainly agricultural "uniones" or non-profit private
credit and input distributing associations of farmers.
3.13      In spite of this extensive network of sales outlets, adequate
availability of fertilizer throughout the country is apparently not assured--
especially not for small farmers in the isolated highland areas. Guanomex
has agreed to carry out, in coordination with an independent agency, a ferti-
lizer marketing and distribution study which is to be completed not later than
one year after approval of the Bank loan.  The study will include consideration
of availability of credit and the need for agricultural extension services
and other agricultural inputs particularly as they are required by the poorer
segment of farmers 2/, as well as the optimum rates of fertilizer application
for various crops in each State, taking into account not only the specific
requirements of each crop but also soil characteristics and rainfall and other
climate conditions. The study will be carried out under terms of reference
agreed upon with the Bank and the study's recommendations will be implemented
after consultation with the Bank.
3.14      One of the channels that can be used for the sale of small amounts
of fertilizer in small villages is the Compania Nacional de Subsistencias
Populares (CONASUPO), a public sector agency in charge of distributing common
staples in the poorer urban and rural areas, and the warehousing and selling
organizations affiliated with it (Annex 3-7). While in 1974/75 Guanomex
expects to sell only some 85,000 tons of fertilizer (or about 3.4% of the
total) through Conasupo's network, it intends to subsequently increase
Conasupo's participation in the distribution of fertilizer.
1/   Exports increased from 6,800 tons in 1964 to 58,000 tons in 1972 and
dropped to 35,800 tons in 1973 as a result of a narrowing of the surplus
of production over consumption.
2/   50% of all the farmers produce less than Mex$1,000 (US$80) per capita and
account for only 4% of output and 3% of sales (Annex 3-7). Another 34%,
earning between Mex$1,000 and Mex$5,000 (US$400), produce 17% of agri-
cultural output but sell only 9%.

D.   Fertilizer Prices
3.15      As mentioned previously, all fertilizer prices are controlled by
the Government both at the factory gate and at farm level. Since 1965
efforts have been made to equalize freight costs, but only in 1973 were
fertilizer prices made uniform for most destinations. Historical prices for
ammonia and bagged urea delivered at any train station in the country are
shown below. In the case of urea, these prices include a weighted average
freight and loading charge of Mex$105 per ton:

1971        992             79.4          1,350               108.0
1972        892            71.4           1,350               108.0
1973      1,273           101.8           1,350               108.0
1974 May  1,644            131.5          1,450               116.0
1974 Oct. 1,644           131.5           1,520               121.6
As a result of Government policy, present fertilizer prices in Mexico are
much lower than those prevailing in international trade (para. 2.11). In
the last three months of 1974 export prices for urea have ranged between
US$300 and 350 (Mex$3,940/4,375) per ton fob Western Europe and between US$358
and 370 (Mex$4,475/4,625) per ton fob US Gulf ports. In the case of urea,
Guanomex is able to sell considerably below the international price because
of the low price at which it buys ammonia (para. 6.03) from Pemex. As men-
tioned in para. 2.12, the Government protects Guanomex in the re-sale of
high-cost imported ammonia through a compensatory fund.
E.   The Market for Insecticides
3.16      The Government expanded Guanomex's operations in 1968 through an
authorization to manufacture insecticides (para. 2.05) and in 1973, Guanomex
installed an organo-phosphoric (parathion) insecticide plant. At present,
approximately one half of Mexican consumption of insecticides is covered by
the Company's production which, in the last two years, averaged about 3,000
tons of 100% DDT, 775 tons of BHC, 2,000 tons of toxaphene and 4,300 tons of
parathion. The proposed 33% expansion of the parathion plant is aimed at
substituting cuts in DDT consumption because of ecological considerations
(Annex 3-8) and therefore no difficulties are foreseen in marketing the
expanded output of parathion.

IV. THE PROJECT
A.   Project Scope
4.01      The project which is described in more detail in Annex 4-1
comprises three sub-projects:
-    A 1,000 TPD (330,000 TPY) urea plant (the "Bajio II" plant),
which will be an expansion of the existing Bajio Unit, located
near Salamanca, State of Guanajuato;
-    A 1,500 TPD (495,000 TPY) urea plant (the "Istmno" plant), which
will constitute a new unit, to be located at Coatzacoalcos,
State of Veracruz;
-    A 10 TPD (2,500 TPY) expansion of an existing parathion plant
(the "Salamanca" plant expansion) which will form part of the
existing Salamanca Unit, located at the city of the same name.
4.02      The existing Bajio Unit produces urea and ammonium sulfate (Annex
2-3).  Pemex has a 250 TPD ammonia plant near the Guanomex facilities and
is building a 900 TPD plant side by side to be completed by the end of 1977
(i.e. three months ahead of the Bajio II urea plant) to jointly provide the
feedstock for the two urea plants.  This is expected to be a reliable source
of ammonia since only 25% of the ammonia capacity would be required to supply
the two urea plants at full capacity. 1/ Both ammonia plants are based on
natural gas drawn from extensive fields (Annex 4-2) centered at Tierra Blanca,
State of Veracruz, and Villahermosa and Cactus, State of Tabasco, at a
distance of about 600 and 1,000 km respectively. The needed land for the
Bajio urea expansion has already been acquired and most of the infrastructure
exists. Salamanca, 3 km away, is an important railway and highway junction
and has a population of about 100,000. The size for the Bajio II plant has
been geared to the expected capacity of the inland market served by it.
4.03      For the Istmo urea sub-project, several sites were studied, and
one next to a well-dredged basin in the Pajaritos inlet, close to Coatza-
coalcos on the Gulf of Mexico (Map: IBRD 11494) and adjacent to existing
facilities of Pemex and FFM, was chosen. The site is also served by rail-
road and paved road. The project will have some additional facilities (and
therefore higher costs) such as a jetty for shipping urea, office buildings
and a large polyethylene bag manufacturing unit (60 million bags/year capacity)
that will also supply the Bajio sub-project and the existing Guanomex plants.
Polyethylene chips will be purchased from Pemex.
1/   The balance of ammonia will be used for the production of ammonium
sulfate in the Bajio Unit, direct application to crops or transported
to other Guanomex plants.



- 15 -
4.04      The ammonia for the Istmo plant will be supplied by Pemex from one
of two plants, of 1,500 TPD capacity each, based on natural gas drawr. from
fields located about 150 km away (Annex 4-2), being built at Cosaleacaque,
near the city of Minatitlan, about 25 km away, at a major petrochemical
installation of Pemex. In addition, Pemex has in operation, at Cosal2acaque,
two other plants with a capacity of 180 and 1,000 TPD, which supply ammonia
to the existing Guanomex plants in the Minatitlan Unit (Annex 2-3). 1/ Pemex
will also build at its own expense the ammonia and carbon dioxide pipelines
from its factory to the Istmo urea site. One of the Pemex ammonia plants was
completed in January 1975 and the other is about six to twelve months ahead
of Guanomex. There is therefore no difficulty foreseen in obtaining adequate
and timely supplies of ammonia for the urea project. Because Pemex and Guano-
mex are both state-owned, there have been no long-term ammonia supply contracts
between the two companies and judging from the close cooperation between the
two firms and their coordinated investment programs none appear necessary.
Furthermore, the Government has given general assurances that ammonia and
other inputs will be made available to Guanomex as required for the efficient
operation of the project as well as of the existing plants.
4.05      The Salamanca Unit comprises a 60 TPD Krebs electrolytic plant to
produce caustic soda and chlorine, a 30 TPD DDT plant using the Montrose
Chemical Corp. process, small BHC and toxaphene plants and a 25 TPD parathion
plant. As mentioned in para. 3.16 the proposed expansion of this plant,
besides improving the present production process, will allow to phase out
DDT production over the next 5 to 10 years in line with a planned decrease in
the consumption of this type of pesticides in Mexico.
B.   Technology
4.06      Processes for urea synthesis are widely available.  Guanomex has
chosen the Stamicarbon process (Holland) for the two proposed plants. A
prilling tower will be used for the finishing operation in the Bajio sub-
project but whether the same system or a pan granulator developed by TVA
(US) will be selected for the Istmo sub-project has not yet been decided.
Parathion manufacture is described in Annex 4-3. The process for the manu-
facture of parathion is supplied by Stauffer (US).
C.   Utilities
4.07      Utilities required for each of the three sub-projects are described
in Annex 4-1. Electricity will be purchased from the Government-owned
Comision Federal de Electricidad (CFE). In addition to drinking water from
public systems, water will be obtained from wells for all the needs of the
Bajio and Salamanca plants as well as for processes in the Istmo plant, and
from the river for cooling purposes in the latter plant. There have been no
constraints in the availability of utilities and none are expected in the
1/   The surplus ammonia not needed for the Guanomex plants will be used
for direct application as fertilizer, shipped to other plants or
exported.



- 16 -
future. Nevertheless, general assurances have been obtained from the Govern-
ment that electric power for the project as well as for Guanomex's existing
facilities will be made available as required by Guanomex to operate efficiently.
D.   Employment and Training
4.08      Guanomex's total employment will increase by 11% to a total of
about 4,800 as a result of the operation of the proposed project. Guanomex
is already a large company with 11 operating units and most skilled and high
level positions will be staffed from internal sources and existing training
programs. Therefore, additional training requirements are small; some staff
will be trained by Guanomex, along with the process licensor and the engin-
eering firms, in the specific technology and operating systems utilized in
the three proposed plants. The cost of this training is included in the
project's costs.
E.   Ecology and Safety
4.09      The urea plants will be designed and operated with emission levels
of effluents following standards acceptable to the Bank. Gaseous and liquid
effluents present virtually no problem in a well designed and operated urea
plant, particularly because of the benefits derived from the recovery of
valuable raw materials and chemicals used. Dust dispersion has become a major
concern in many US plants and some of them have recently switched to granula-
tion rather than prilling to minimize this problem. With regard to the Istmo
plant Guanomex will investigate the viability of this approach during the
early design stage and for the Bajio plant will seek measures to diminish
pollution--and losses-- from the prilling operation. The safety record of
Guanomex is comparable to those in modern fertilizer factories in developed
countries.
4.10      The dangers in the manufacture and use of parathion are primarily
related to safety during handling rather than environmental impact because
parathion, although highly toxic, is rapidly degradable. Guanomex has
already implemented stringent safety regulations in the existing parathion
plant (the one being expanded) regarding such factors as employee education
and good housekeeping practices in minimizing spills, and distributors and
farmers are informed about the proper techniques for the pesticide's use.
No accident has occurred since the factory began production at the end of
1972. However, taking into account the hazards in the manufacture, trans-
portation, warehousing and use of this product (Annex 3-8), the Bank has
obtained assurances from Guanomex that monitoring of safety measures will be
continuously implemented.
F.   Project Execution
4.11      The urea plants will be built under a contract with an experienced
international engineering company, selected by following Bank guidelines, in
association with a qualified local engineering firm. The contract will pro-
vide for a guarantee on timely completion and plant performance levels.



- 17 -
Civil works, construction and erection will be carried out by local firms.
The parathion expansion will be executed by a local engineering firm based
on the process design and the guidance of the licensor, Stauffer (US) in the
same manner as was done for the original plant. Guanomex has an experienced
project team that will oversee the execution of the project and since it
has used the same approach to project implementation in its existing units
and its record of completing projects successfully is good the Bank does
not think that an outside technical advisor is needed.
4.12      Guanomex, in agreement with the Bank, initiated steps to select
the urea engineering firms shortly after the mission visited Mexico and,
following procedures for evaluation and selection agreed between Guanomex
and the Bank, has contracted the services of Foster Wheeler Energy Co. (US)
and Atlas Foster Wheeler Mexicana for the Bajio sub-project. The selection
of engineering firms for the Istmo sub-project is expected to be made in
May 1975. A preliminary project execution schedule has been submitted by
Guanomex and the Government has given assurances that the required import
licenses required by the project will be promptly made available to Guanomex
as needed.
V. CAPITAL COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN
A. Capital Cost
5.01      Total financing required for the project is estimated at US$150.2
million equivalent, of which US$53.5 million is in foreign exchange (Annex 5-1).

pieces cf equipment and current unit costs for civil works, and hence are
based on prices prevailing during the last quarter of 1974. The estimates
are consistent with other fertilizer projects currently being financed by
the Bank Group.  Physical contingencies have been taken at 11% of the base
cost estimate (BCE) which is an ample margin for standard urea plants.
Contingencies for price escalation have been calculated on the basis of
projected price increases of 12% for 1975, 10% for 1976 and 8% thereafter
for foreign exchange and internationally bid local equipment costs, and 16%,
14% and 12% respectively for civil works and other local currency costs.
The expected schedule of capital expenditures and the escalation factors
are shown in Annex 5-3. The required working capital is estimated in
Annex 5-4. Interest during construction was calculated at rates of 12% on
the IBRD loan and 13.5% on other loans (para. 5.05 below).
B.   Financing Plan
5.04      The proposed financing plan for the project is as follows:
In Mex$ Million ----   ---- In US$ Million ----
Foreign    Local              Foreign   Local
Exchange  Currency    Total  Exchange Currency   Total

Long-Term Debt
IBRD                      625         -          625     50.0       -        50.0
Foreign & Local Banks      43        459         502      3.5      36.7      40.2
Total:                 668      1,209      1,877      53.5      96.7     150.2
Guanomex shall increase its share capital (US$60.0 million equivalent) in
accordance with such a schedule as required by Guanomex to carry out the
project and comply with the financial covenants (para. 6.12). The proposed
Bank loan (US$50 million) would cover a little less (93%) than the foreign
exchange or 33% of the total financing required by the Proiect.
5.05      The proposed loan would be extended to Guanomex and Nafinsa
at an interest rate of 8-1/% for a term of 14 years starting in July 1975
and including 3-1/2 years of grace. The Government would guarantee the
loan and Nafinsa would charge Guanomex a fee of 3-1/2% thus bringing the
total rate paid by Guanomex on the loan proceeds to 12% annually.
5.06      The Government has agreed to provide, or have provided, to Guanomex
any funds, in a form satisfactory to the Bank that might be required to cover
any cost overrun on the project in accordance with the agreed implementation



- 20 -
schedule (para. 4.12) and reach a satisfactory working capital level. For
purposes of this covenant the project will be considered completed when each
of the sub-projects will have been tested and proven to be satisfactory in
accordance with established engineering procedures and practices, have been
operated for at least 30 days at production rates of not less than 80% of
rated capacities and the Company will have a current ratio of at least 1.3:1.0.
C.   Procurement
5.07      International competitive bidding (ICB) according to Bank guidelines
will be used for equipment and spares estimated to cost about US$27.6 million
(excluding physical contingencies but including price escalation). Proprietary
equipment essential to the process and items in limited supply, which are
critical to the timely completion of the project, and estimated to cost US$4.4
million equivalent, may be procured after bidding from short lists of qualified
suppliers, both the lists of this equipment and their potential suppliers re-
quiring the prior approval of the Bank. Small items, costing less than
US$50,000 equivalent each and US$1 million in total may be purchased directly
from foreign suppliers on the basis of suitability, availability and price
considerations following the Company's procurement procedures. The list of
these small-cost items will also be subject to prior Bank approval. A pref-
erence of 15% or the applicable customs duties, whichever is lower, will be
allowed to Mexican manufacturers for the purpose of evaluating international
competitive bids. The engineering firms contracted or to be contracted
(paras. 4.11/4.12) will handle procurement under the direct control of
Guanomex and assist the Company in bid evaluations. Procedures to expedite
deliveries will be worked out between Guanomex and the engineering firms,
including the assignment, if required, of Guanomex procurement officers to
work closely with the engineering firms and some of the suppliers.
D.   Allocation and Disbursement of Bank Loan
5.08      The proceeds of the Bank loan would cover:  a) the estimated CIF
cost of equipment imported after ICB (US$18.4 million); b) the estimated
cost (US$1.0 million) of small-cost items costing less than US$50,000 procured
from abroad through normal commercial channels; c) the estimated cost of
imported proprietory or long-lead items (US$4.4 million); d) the ex-factory
cost of equipment expected to be won by local suppliers through ICB procedures
(estimated at US$9.2 million net of sales taxes); e) licenses, engineering and
other technical services; and f) interest during construction on the Bank
loan, as summarized below. In order to maintain the schedule of the Bajio II
plant, advanced contracting of an engineering firm and orders for equipment
have been placed in January for critical long-delivery items of equipment
from a geographically widely distributed list of qualified suppliers. Guanomex
has been advised of the Bank's willingness to reimburse retroactively from
January 1, 1975, up to US$3.6 million equivalent for goods and services as
described in items (c) and (e) above to meet down payments for these goods
and services, subject to the approval of the loan by the Executive Directors.

VI. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A.   Analysis of the Project
6.01      Although the project implementation schedule as envisaged now fore-
sees that commercial operations of the Bajio II urea plant will begin before
January 1978 and the other plants, three months later, the proforma finan-
cial statements have conservatively assumed that commercial operations of
the three sub-projects will start only on April 1, 1978, and the project's
assumed life time is 12 years from that date. Production is forecast to
commence at 70% of rated capacity and increase to 75% in 1979, 85% in 1980
and 90% thereafter. Assumptions for the financial analysis are given in
Annex 6-1. Operating costs and product prices have been assumed to remain
in constant terms at their level of the last quarter of 1974, except for
small changes in the prices of ammonia and parathion discussed below.
6.02      The production of the Bajio II and Salamanca plants are all expected
to be sold in the domestic market at prices in constant December 1974 terms of
respectively Mex$1,520 (US$121.6) per ton of bagged urea and Mex$17,370
(US$1,390) per ton of parathion delivered at railroad stations throughout the
country. Over the first four years of operations the Istmo plant will export
on average about 60% of its forecast urea production, gradually diverting
sales to the local market as domestic consumption increases (Annex 6-1). FOB
ulrea export prices are based on projections made by the Bank's Commodity
Division 1/.  Parathion currently sells in the domestic market for Mex$16,000
per ton, considerably below the price for imported parathion of Mex$28,000 per
1/   Bank Report No. 467 (June 19, 1974) and updating memorandum of
November 6, 1974.

ton. Guanomex intends to improve the profitability of parathion production
by increasing the price to Mex$17,370 in constant December 1974 terms before
FY 78 and this has been anticipated in the financial projections. Finally,
the projections for the Istmo plant include nominal revenues from the supply
of 37 million bags to the Company's other plants at an assumed transfer price
of Mex$2.73 per bag, which is the price now paid to outside suppliers.
6.03      Past production costs for urea and parathion and estimated future
costs in the proposed new plants are shown in Annex 6-2. Total factory costs 1/
(excluding depreciation) in the new plants are expected to be about Mex$540
(US$43.20) per ton of bulk urea; this compares to about Mex$609 (US$48.90)
per ton in the existing Minatitlan II plant in FY 73. Total cost for bulk
urea (including depreciation) in the Istmo plant is estimated at Mex$966
(US$77.28) per ton delivered to distributors, slightly higher than in the
Bajio II plant (Mex$918 or US$73.44 per ton) due to extra depreciation
charges for infrastructure and bag-making equipment, and also higher average
freight costs. The cost of ammonia used in the projections--Mex$600 (US$48)
per ton--anticipates an increase in real terms in the current price of
Mex$520 (US$41.6) charged by Pemex but is still not only considerably below
the current exceptionally high ammonia prices of about Mex$4,500 (US$360)
prevailing in the international market but also those expected for the late
1970s (para. 7.02).
6.04      The project will be part of different production units of Guanomex
and will not be operated as an independent profit center. However, Guanomex
has agreed to maintain and submit to the Bank quarterly production reports,
including operating costs, in sufficient detail to monitor the performance
of each of the three plants included in the project.
6.05      For the projected financial statements, December 1974 prices have
been escalated year by year through 1978 using the expected general inflation
rates (Annex 5-3). The proforma income statement for the project is shown
in Annex 6-3 and summarized below for the first four years of operation.
Other income represents interest charged by Guanomex on accounts receivable
outstanding for more than 60 days. Income tax has been conservatively taken
as 42% although it can be partially waived for projects like this deemed to
be in the national interest. 2/ Workers' participation in profits is a legal
requirement and has been estimated at 11% of net income after tax.

6.06      The income projections show the project's attractive profitability
that results from the expected operating efficiency of the new plants and
the favorable ratio between the ammonia and urea prices (para. 6.03). Con-
sequently, the level of capacity utilization at which the two urea plants
break even is low, namely 46% on a profit basis and 40% on a cash basis in
1979. A break-even chart is shown in Annex 6-4. Since profitability of the
project as well as of the Company depends so decisively on ammonia and solid
fertilizer prices controlled by the Government, the Bank has obtained from the
Government assurances that it will take all action required to enable Guanomex,
operating efficiently, to meet at all times its operating costs, maintain,
after completion of the project, a long-term debt service coverage of at least
1.4 times and earn a reasonable return on invested capital. The proforma cash
flow statement and balance sheet for the project (in current Mex$ until 1978
and constant 1978 Mex$ afterwards) is contained in Annex 6-5.

B.   Financial Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analysis
6.07      For the calculation of the project's financial rate of return
nominal capital costs (excluding interest during construction) and operating
costs and revenues were deflated by the expected annual rate of general
inflation (Annex 5-3) and expressed in December 1974 Mex$. The resulting
capital cost stream in real terms and the financial costs and benefits (taken
from the proforma income statement for the project) are shown in Annex 6-6.
The project's financial rate of return is 14.5% after income tax and 20.3%
before income tax.
6.08      Sensitivity tests are also shown in Annex 6-6, and summarized
below:
Sensitivity Tests on Financial Rate of Return (After Tax)
Base Case                                       14.5%
Urea Price decreased by 10%                     10.7%
Urea Price increased by 10%                     18.0%
Capital Cost increased by 30%                   10.0%
Capacity Utilization 80%                        10.1%
Ammonia price increased by 30%                  11.9%
Variations in the price of urea and/or ammonia have a considerable effect
on the return, and a 30% increase in the ammonia cost (from US$48 per ton to
US$62.4) would lower the return after taxes by 2.6 percentage points. A capital
cost overrun of as much as 30% would leave a rate of return of 10.0%, and even
at only 80% capacity utilization the return would still be satisfactory.
C.   Financial Forecasts for Guanomex
6.09      The financial forecasts for Guanomex, excluding the project, are
shown in Annex 6-7. Capacity utilization--now averaging 83%--is expected to
reach 90% by the time the project is operating commercially. This improve-
ment will be brought about by the increased availability of ammonia for the
urea plants, the rehabilitation (or substitution) of some facilities and other
measures currently being undertaken to improve operations. Prices for urea
and parathion have been discussed above. Other product prices and production
costs have been escalated from their levels in the last quarter of 1974 by
using general inflation rates-until 1978 and kept constant thereafter.
6.10      Annual gross revenues from the re-sale of products not manufactured
by Guanomex (primarily imported ammonia and solid fertilizers) have been
realistically assumed to remain, in constant December 1974 terms, at their
1973/74 level of about Mex$660 million. The assumed margin on these sales
is 10% which is assured for the FYs 1975 and 1976 by the compensatory fund
of Mex$500 million established by the Government (para. 2.12).

The project will bring substantial improvement in the Company's overall
profitability through more efficient operations, economies of scale in the
larger or enlarged plants and proportionally lower overhead. No provision
has been made in the projections for major investments besides the project,
other than for normal renewals and replacements. Debt service coverage and
debt/equity ratio will be satisfactory, but the current ratio will be low
because of the rapid expansion of the Company's operations and its continued
reliance on short-term debt to cover high fertilizer inventory levels and
credits to distributors.
D.   Financial Covenants
6.12      To ensure sound financial management, assurances have been obtained
from Guanomex that it will: (i) at all times maintain a debt/equity ratio of
not more than 60/40; (ii) not incur any new debt if by doing so a debt service
coverage of at least 1.4 cannot be maintained; (iii) after completion of the



- 26 -
project, maintain a current ratio of not less than 1.3:1; (iv) not undertake any
additional investments, which may impair its ability to carry out and operate
the project and meet all its obligations; (v) in any given year, not pay dividends
or pre-pay debt other than to the Bank unless after such payment or cash outlay,
its current ratio would remain above 1.5:1.0, except that prepayment of debt
will be allowed if such prepayment is part of a refinancing agreement under
terms more favorable than the loan being prepaid.
E.   Major Risks
6.13      No major risks are expected.  The capital cost estimates for the
project include a provision of US$26.5 million equivalent to cover price
escalation and the project completion schedule is considered realistic. In
view of the Company's past experience and the assistance of qualified inter-
national engineering firms, risks in the execution and operation of the pro-
ject are considered to be minimal. On the basis of the consumption estimates
urea production may temporarily exceed domestic consumption. However, total
projected production of solid nitrogenous fertilizer does not cover all the
expected consumption of nitrogen; therefore it is probable that part of the
potential surplus urea will be absorbed to manufacture mixed fertilizers.
Nevertheless, the possibility that part of Guanomex's output of urea in 1979/82
may need to be exported at lower than the assumed price for domestic sales has
been conservatively taken into consideration in the financial projections
(para. 6.02). Finally, although the assumed volumes of urea to be exported
in those years (averaging 120,000 tons of N annually) are higher than quanti-
ties previously exported by Guanomex (para. 3.11) they would amount to only
about 15% of total Guanomex's N production between 1979 and 1982.
VII. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A.   World Fertilizer Prices
7.01      Fertilizer prices in the international market are subject to
surplus/scarcity cycles resulting from fluctuations in demand coupled to
the large investments and long lead time required for the construction of
new manufacturing capacity. The present worldwide fertilizer shortage and
high prices have been aggravated by simultaneous shortages of foodgrain and
higher prices for fertilizer feedstocks (mainly petroleum, natural gas and
phosphate rock). Current plans to expand productive capacity are expected
to lead to a downturn of fertilizer prices. Projected urea prices 1/ are as

B.   Economic Rate of Return
7.02      For the economic analysis of the project, capital and production
costs, and urea prices, have been converted to real 1974 terms. Duties and
interest during construction were deducted from the capital costs. Except
for ammonia, the economic costs of inputs have been taken as being equivalent
to their financial costs. 1/ The economic cost for ammonia is estimated at
US$88 per ton in line with recent estimates of the Bank's Commodities Division
and TVA. 2/ Estimated ocean freight and port handling charges of US$25/ton
were added to the projected FOB 1978 urea price of US$105 to arrive at an
equivalent price for urea landed at a Mexican port. For the years 1979-82
the projected export price of urea (averaging US$93/ton) has been used to
value the conservatively estimated volume of exports in those years. For
parathion, gross sales at Mexican prices have been used for economic benefit
calculation even though its international price is about 40% higher; this has,
however, only a relatively small effect on the project's economic rate of return.
7.03      The economic cost and benefit streams are shown in Annex 7.    The
economic rate of return of the project is 24.0%. Sensitivity tests are also
shown in Annex 7 and summarized below. Separate rates of return for the
two urea plants were also calculated and found not to differ significantly
from the overall return for the project.
Sensitivity Tests for the Economic Rate of Return (%)
Base Case                                 24.0%
Economic Price of Urea up 10%             29.5%
Economic Price of Urea down 10%           17.8%
Ammonia Cost up 220                       19.1%
Capital Cost up 15%                       21.2%
Capacity Utilization at 80%               20.3%
1/   Duties on the few chemicals and maintenance materials required to be
imported are about 5% of their CIF value and have been disregarded.
2/ Unpublished December 1974 draft report on fertilizer costs in developed
and developing countries.



- 28 -
The economic rate of return is very sensitive to variations in the economic
price of urea, a 10% decrease in the price resulting in an economic rate of
return of 17.8%. A 20% increase in the economic cost of ammonia has a smaller
impact. A 15% capital cost overrun would still result in a satisfactory rate
of return. At 80% capacity utilization, the return would be 20.3%. Thus,
except for a combination of a substantial cost overrun and extraordinary long-
term depressed urea prices--an unlikely event--the economic rate of return is
satisfactory.
C.   Direct Foreign Exchange Savings
7.05      The project will make it possible for Mexico to save on the importa-
tion of urea (and in initial years export urea) improving her balance of
payments. Gross foreign exchange savings after the initial five years of
operation, will be about US$96 million annually in constant December 1974 terms.
D.   Other Benefits
7.06      The project will help to make Mexico independent of imported
fertilizer eliminating the risk of loss of agricultural production in times
of scarcity in the world fertilizer market and insulating farmers from violent
fertilizer price fluctuations. During construction, the project will provide
direct employment to about 1,000 people and contribute to the improvement and
consolidation of the technical competence of the staff of Guanomex and Mexican
engineering firms. Finally, about US$64 million of equipment and services is
expected to be provided from Mexican sources.
VIII. AGREEMENTS
8.01      Prior to or during negotiations, agreements were obtained on the
following main issues:
A.   From the Government, that it will:
i)   Make available, to Guanomex or cause to make available by Pemex
or other agencies of the public sector, the ammonia and other
inputs required for the efficient operation of its plants
(paras. 4.04 and 4.07);
ii)   Provide all the import licenses required for the execution of
the project according to schedule and its efficient operation
after completion (para. 4.12);
iii)   Guarantee the loan and charge Guanomex a fee payable to Nafinsa of
3-1/2% on the Bank loan, so that the effective interest rate
paid by the Company is 12% per annum (para. 5.05);



- 29 -
iv)   Provide the financing of cost overruns of the project in a manner
satisfactory to the Bank (para. 5.06);

made, according to terms of reference agreed upon with the Bank,
on fertilizer markets, transportation, distribution and marketing,
optimum levels of inventories and accounts receivable and their
control, and the promotion of proper fertilizer use by small
farmers (para. 3.13);
iii)   Establish pollution control measures acceptable to the Bank
and monitor them adequately (paras. 4.09 and 4.10);
iv)   Maintain and submit to the Bank quarterly production and
cost reports for each sub-project (para. 6.04);
v)   Agree to the financial covenants listed in para. 6.12 including
maintaining a debt:equity ratio of no more than 60:40 and,
after completion of the project, a debt service coverage of at
least 1.4 and a current ratio of no less than 1.3:1.0.
8.02      Based on the above agreements, the project is suitable for a Bank
loan of US$50 million equivalent.

ANNEX 1-1
MEXICO - FERTILIZER PROJECT
GLOSSARY OF TERMS USED IN THE REPORT
1.        Aqua Ammonia:  Solution of ammonia in water.  Solubility of
ammonia in water depends greatly on temperature. At 00C (320F), solubility
is about 900 grams per liter and only 7.4 g/lt at 1000C (2120F). Aqua
ammonia is also used as fertilizer by dissolving anhydrous ammonia in
irrigation water.
2.        Ammonia or Anhydrous Ammonia:  A compound of nitrogen and hydrogen
(NH3) obtained by synthesis of nitrogen and hydrogen. It is a gas at normal
atmospheric temperature and pressure. It can be liquefied at -330C (-280F)
at atmospheric pressure but it can also be liquefied at ordinary temperatures
by application of pressure. For instance at 600F (15.50C) a pressure of 107.6
lbs per sq. in. (7.3 kg/cm2) or about 7 atmospheres would be required. Ammonia
is applied as a fertilizer because of its high nutrient content (82% N) but it
requires special expensive equipment for storage, transportation and applica-
tion and soils having high temperatures may produce prohibitive losses.
3.        Ammonium Carbamate:  An intermediate product--NH4-C02-NH2--formed
by reaction of ammonia and carbon dioxide during the synthesis of urea.
4.        Ammonia Feedstocks are the sources of hydrogen used for ammonia
production. Except for the minor use of hydrogen produced by electrolysing
water, the principal feedstocks are hydrocarbons such as natural gas, naphtha,
heavy fuel oil and coal.
5.        Ammonium Nitrate (AN) or chemically NH4NO3 is produced by reacting
ammonia with nitric acid. Nitric acid (HN03), in turn, is made from ammonia
(NH3). AN contains 34.5% nitrogen, half in the ammonium form and half in the
nitrate form, and is very hygroscopic. It also is a commercial explosive.
In many countries, a diluent--e.g. limestone--is added to lower the analysis
and negate the explosive properties as well as to minimize the hygroscopic
properties. Mixed with small amounts of fuel oil it is known as ANFO explo-
sives used in open pit mining.
6.        Ammonium Sulfate (AS):  Reaction product of ammonia and sulfuric
acid (NH4)2 S04. It should contain not less than 20.5% N.
7.        Bagged Fertilizer:  Solid fertilizers delivered to the user in bags.
Net weight of the bagged fertilizer is commonly 100 lbs, 50 kg and 100 kg.
Smaller bags are available in some countries for use on lawns, gardens, etc.
Bags are usually made of jute, polyethylene, jute lined with polyethylene,
woven polypropylene and multiple-ply paper.
8.        Biuret:  Carbamylurea--NH2CONH2CONH2H20--is an impurity contained
in small amounts in synthetic urea.  It is generally kept to a low level
because of its damaging effects on maturing seeds and plant leaves.



ANNEX 1-1
Page 2
9.        Bulk Fertilizer:  Solid or liquid fertilizer sold loosely in tankers,
ship holds, train wagons, trucks or large containers. Anhydrous ammonia is
sometimes transported in refrigerated barges or railroad tanks.
10.       Chemical Fertilizers:  Manufactured chemical compounds suitable as
fertilizers should be high enough in nutrient content; stable to avoid hazards
and handling problems; water soluble and available to plant root systems. It
is the common practice to report the nutrient content of materials in terms of
percentages of N (nitrogen), P205 (phosphorus pentoxide)j and K20 (potassium
oxide)2/. Commercially available materials meeting these requirements to a

Ammonium Sulfate      21%   Dianmmonium Phosphate     46%
Diammonium Phosphate 18%
Because of the high nutrient content of urea, diammonium phosphate and potassium
chloride (KCl), they are some of the most popular fertilizer materials in the
world today.
11.       Complex or NPK Fertilizers:  All three primary nutrients (N, P205,
K20) are frequently applied to the soil at the same time in ratios varying
with the nutrient requirements of different crops. Complex fertilizers con-
tain at least two chemically combined nutrients. To facilitate handling, the
several required chemicals are usually agglomerated into uniform granules for
distribution. The analysis of each nutrient is given as a ratio to describe
the NPK product. Thus 15-15-15 complex fertilizer contains 15% each of N,
P205, and K20; and 12-24-12 complex fertilizer contains 12% N, 24% P205 and
12% K20.
12.       Crop Yield:  Output of crop in kg or tons per ha. or lbs/acre.
13.       Diammonium Phosphate (DAP) or chemically (NH4) 2HPO , is produced
by reacting NH3 with phosphoric acid (H3PO0) followed by granulation and drying.
14.       Dosage:  Intensity of fertilizer application generally measured in
kg/ha or lbs acre (nutrient content).
15.       Fertilizer:  The vehicle through which plant nutrients--with the
exception of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen--are added to the soil. It is usual
to distinguish between natural fertilizers (such as compost) and manufactured
or chemical fertilizers. Very often when the term fertilizer is used alone it
refers to the latter.
/ Normally but incorrectly referred to as phosphoric acid or phosphate.
2   Or potash.



ANNEX 1-1
Page 3
16.       Granular Fertilizer:  Fertilizer in a granular form, as distinct
from powdered fertilizer which has a tendency to 'bridge' in hoppers and
generally to make bagging and application more difficult.
17.       Guano:  Excrement deposited by birds (mainly sea birds) and bats
on areas where it is not washed away by rain.  Peruvian guano averages 14% N.
18.       HYV: High yielding variety.
19.       Lint:  Cotton fibre after ginning.
20.       Mixed Fertilizer:  A fertilizer made by the physical mixing or
blending of two or more fertilizers and generally containing more than one
plant nutrient.
21.       Plant Nutrients:  Essential to plant growth are some 17 elements,
six in large and the remainder in small or micro quantities. Carbon, hydrogen,
oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium comprise the first six; the others
of lesser significance include calcium, magnesium, sulfur, silicon, zinc, iron,
aluminum, manganese, boron, sodium, and copper. Chlorine and cobalt are also
thought essential. Carbon, hydrogen and oxygen are readily available from
the atmosphere and water. Nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium--three main
nutrients--and the other elements are drawn from the soil systems. Unless
supplemented by regular additions of materials containing the three main
nutrients, soil becomes depleted of fertility by repeated cropping. Use of
natural organic materials such as animal and vegetable wastes can be utilized
but the scale and intensity of modern agriculture have far exceeded the avail-
ability of natural 'fertilizers'. Consequently, the majority of the world's
primary plant nutrient needs are now supplied in the form of manufactured or
'chemical' fertilizers. To an increasing degree, secondary nutrients such as
calcium, magnesium, sulfur, and micro nutrients such as boron, zinc, copper
and manganese are also added to soils along with the primary nutrients in
ratios prescribed by agronomists according to specific crop and soil needs.
22.       Phosphate Rock:  Rock containing phosphates mainly of calcium in
generally comprex forms. Some deposits contain the phosphates as nodules
scattered in sterile gangue. It is used to produce phosphoric acid (H3POO)
as well as superphosphates.
23.       Prilled Fertilizer:  Fertilizer in spheroidal particles generally
between 1 and 4 mm in diameter.
24.       Sin le Sup   hos hate:  A product obtained by treating phosphate
rock with sulfuric acid and consisting of a mixture of monocalcium phosphate
CaH4(PO4)2, dicalcium phosphate CaHPO0, tricalcium phosphate Ca3 (P0)2,
calcium sulfate and other impurities. Tricalcium phosphate is botally
insoluble and is not included in the P205 content of the superphosphate (16%
to 18%).



ANNEX 1-1
Page 4
25.       Triple Superphosphate:  Obtained by reaction of phosphate rock
and phosphoric acid. Since it contains no calcium sulfate, its P205 content
(about 46%) is much higher than in single superphosphate.
26.       Urea is known chemically as carbamide or NH CONH2--the normal
amide of carbonic acid; this compound contains about L6% N, all in the
ammonium form. It is considerably less hygroscopic than ammonium nitrate
and it is the most widely used straight nitrogen fertilizer today.
27.       Urea Synthesis:  Urea is made by reacting ammonia with carbon
dioxide. Since both of the materials are produced during the ammonia syn-
thesis, urea production is usually undertaken alongside an ammonia plant.
Unfortunately, the corresponding acid of carbon dioxide (carbonic acid) does
not form stable ammonium salts as do nitric, sulfuric or phosphoric acids.
Therefore, simple neutralization as used in making ammonium nitrate and
sulfate fertilizers is not possible. Instead, ammonia and carbon dioxide
are combined under heat and pressure to make ammonium carbonate which,
although unstable, can be dehydrated under pressure to form urea, a stable
compound. Again, unfortunately, the overall reaction is reversible and even
at 300 atmospheres pressure and 200 C, the conversion to urea in a single
pass through the reactor is under 70%. This introduces several complications:
high pressure must be used to maximize conversion; unconverted reactants must
be separated and recycled; increased corrosion under the high temperatures and
pressures used must be overcome, and urea decomposition into undesirable
products must be minimized.  In recent years, several engineering and producing
companies have developed ways of surmounting these problems, and large plants
capable of producing a thousand tons per day, or more, of urea to rigid
chemical and physical specifications have now been operating successfully for
long periods throughout the world.

Density
Petroleum and gas are often sold by volume but material balances
require calculation by weight. Specific gravities are the ratios of the weight
of the substance to the weight of the same volume of water, both measured
generally at either 00C or 600F. Densities (weights per unit volume) are
generally given in metric or US units. A specific gravity of 1 is equivalent
to a density of 1 MT/im3 or 62.43 lbs/cu.ft. In the case of gases, densities
are usually in kg/m3. Since the volume of gases change considerably with
temperature and pressure, they must be specified. Normal conditions are 00C
and 1 atmosphere (1.033 kg/cm2) pressure. Standard conditions are 60°F
(15.5°C) and 1 atmosphere (14.7 lbs/square inch). The density of air is
1.293 kg/m3 or 0.0808 lbs/cu.ft. under normal conditions.

ANNEX 2-1
MEXICO - FERTILIZER PROJECT
DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPANY
History
1.        Guanomex was created and organized by presidential decree of June
1943 as a decentralized Government-owned enterprise. Originally, it was
charged with the responsibility of promoting the use of organic fertilizer,
exploiting the "guano" deposits on the Pacific coast and distributing the
products to the farmer.  In October 1948 a second decree broadened the
scope of Guanomex activities into the field of production and distribution
of chemical fertilizers. In 1949, installations for the production of
single superphosphate (San Luis Potosi) and bone meal were added, and in
1950, the first Mexican chemical nitrogenous fertilizer plant started
production of ammonium sulphate at Cautitlan, in the State of Mexico.
2.        During the late 1950's the Mexican government promoted private
investment in the sector as a complement to Guanomex activities.  In
particular, Fertilizantes de Monclova SA. (ammonium nitrate, NPK and
phosphoric and nitric acids), Fertilizantes del Istmo SA. (ammonium
nitrate, urea, NPK, and phosphoric acid), and Fertilizantes del Bajio
SA. (urea) became important producers of fertilizers.
3.        During the 1960's Guanomex expansion and growth took place in
three different directions. Firstly, in 1965 the Government of Mexico
decided to consolidate into a larger and stronger Guanomex all the
enterprises which had been created under private auspices in the late
1950's. A better coordination between the function of producing and
distributing fertilizer and the government institutions in charge of plan-
ning and implementing decisions in the agricultural sector was expected.
Also, the growth of the fertilizer sector in the late 1950's had not been
properly planned, and decisions with regard to location and use of raw
materials were far from optimal. As a result, profits were very low.
Integration was expected to reduce the administrative overhead, rationalize
and thus reduce the costs of distribution, and permit a more adequate plan-
ning of future expansion.
4.        Secondly, Guanomex constructed and began operating new plants:
for the production of urea at Camargo (250 TPD) and Minatitlan (920 TPD);
single superphosphate at Guadalajara; diammonium phosphate at Coatzacoalcos;
and ammonium sulphate at Torreon, Coatzacoalcos, Bajio and Guadalajara.
By the end of 1967 the production and distribution of fertilizer in Mexico
had been fully centralized by Guanomex, except for most of the ammonia
production which is controlled by Pemex (which then sells practically all
its output to Guanomex), and phosphoric acid, which is produced by
Fertilizants Fosfatados Mexicanos (FFM) and sold abroad or to Guanomex.
5.        Thirdly, in 1968, Guanomex by-laws were reformed once more to
enable the company to produce and distribute insecticides and other chemical



ANNEX 2-1
Page 2
products. In 1968 Montrose Mexicana SA. and its subsidiary, Lerma S.A.,
which produced chlorinated insecticides, were bought by Guanomex. In
1972 a parathion plant (phosphoric insecticide) was added to the recently
acquired Salamanca unit.
6.        The GOM also transferred to Guanomex the assets of Industrias
Petroquimica Nacional (niow the Ecatepec Unit), a private company in process
of liquidation; it manufactures in small scale various chemical products,
such as sulfuric acid, caustic soda, chlorine, sodium hypochlorite, sulfide
and hyposulfite, bone meal, etc. Finally, in 1970, Guanomex acquired a
controlling equity participation in Fertica S.A., a holding company incor-
porated in Panama which owns small fertilizer plants in Costa Rica (Unit
Punta Arenas), El Salvador (Unit Acajutlu,) and Guatemala (Unit Tecun Uman).
Guanomex also owns a minority participation in Azutrera Panamericana, the
company in charge of exploiting Mexican sulfur deposits.
Organization
7.        Guanomex is a fully state-owned but financially autonomous public
enterprise. All the shares are in Natiusa's name but the Company is legally
regulated by the Mexican Commercial Code and by its bylaws and in this regard
it does not differ from any other private Mexican enterprise. The bylaws
of the company stress both its economic and social roles. Guanomex is
defined to be not only a producer and distributor of fertilizers but also an
important policy instrument of the Government of Mexico in the agricultural
sector. The company is also expected to assume a special responsibility
towards the small and medium farmers. Guanomex is also responsible, together
with other government institutions, for the promotion and extension of
fertilizer usage, research and testing of soils and the regulation and
stabilization of the fertilizer market.
8.        The organization chart for the company is shown in Annex 2-2.
The members of the Board of Directors are appointed by the President of
Mexico. The Chairman is Mr. Francisco Javier Alejo, who is also President
of Penex and Minister for National Patrimony. Other members of the Board
represent Nafinsa and other government institutions, and, in particular
the Secretaries of Agriculture, Industry and Trade, and Finances, PEMEX,
CONASUPO, and the public sector agricultural banks. From an overall
perspective, the present organizational set-up can be considered effective.
Management has full responsibility for day-to-day operations and decisions
within the company seem in general to be satisfactorily decentralized but
there is room for some improvement. With regards to investment projects,
long term borrowing and pricing policies, they are in principle decided
by the Board of Directors in coordination with Secretaria de la Presidencia,
Nafinsa and Secretaria de Hacienda.
Staffing and Industrial Relations
9.        Industrial relations are regulated by eleven collective contracts
and have been satisfactory in the past. Workers participate in profits
through a bonus cash payment which the Mexican Government introduced by

Page 3
law in 1966i/  This bonus has been paid out regularly every year and it
has renresented, on the mvernge. about 11% of net profits after taxes.
Employment in the ComDany has grown from 1,535 in 1965, just before the
consolidation process began, to 4,322 in October 1974.  The breakdown
by type of occupation is the following:
Working Force

Total              3,337         4,322
The Company does not seem overstaffed by Mexican private enterprise
standards and the production/non-production workers ratio (67/33) is not
out of line with other large enterprises in Mexico.
10.       The proposed project would employ about 492 persons, of which
452 are at the plant sites and 40 in the selling force.  Distribution of
these staff by rank and function for the various project units are as follows:

1/ Sale of goods produced by Guanomex and of goods imported or purchased from other local firms
but sold in the market by Guanomex.
2/ All factory costs and depreciation.
3/  In principle 4% of net sales (Federal Government 2.2, State Government 1.8).  Guanomex has
received exemptions on both federal and state taxes for products like urea, ammonium
nitrate and ammonium sulfate which have resulted in a lower percentage tax payment.
4/ Companies with profits above Mex$1.5 million pay a straight 42% on taxable income. Guanomex
has been able to take advantage of different industrial promotion regulations, in particular
accelerated depreciation and full or partial exemption from income taxes for new units for
periods of 5-10 years on the grounds of improving the balance of payments (import substitution)
or of contributing to regional decentralization programs.
5/ Decrease in net profits in 1973/74 can be attributed to the higher prices paid for imported
ammonia while the company re-sells it to the farmers at a lower and fixed price.
Note: Small differences in last digits are due to rounding.

ANNEX 3-1
MEXICO - FERTILIZER PROJECT
CROPS AND THE NEED FOR FERTILIZERS IN MEXICO
1.       The agricultural sector] employs around 40% of the country's labor
force but it contributed only an estimated Mex$37.5 (US$3) billion or less
than 10% to GDP in 1973. Agriculture in Mexico, however, comprises several
technological levels. In the States of Sonora and Sinaloa, in the NW, as
well as in some other smaller areas, crops are grown mainly in irrigated
land, multiple-cropping is widespread and very modern technologies are used,
including the use of high yielding varieties (HYVs) and high rates of
fertilizer application. In the Eastern part of the country, mainly in the
State of Veracruz, there is a well developed exploitation of sugarcane. In
the State of Chiapas, in the South, land is generally covered by jungle and
shifting cultivation is prevalent. Finally, throughout the Central Highlands,
the predominant type of agriculture is the subsistence-level crops, mainly of
corn, grown in small patches in land whose topography does not favor economic
transportation to consuming urban centers.
2.        Various e timates of cultivable land in Mexico range between 20
and 24 million ha.T/  Large areas in the highlands are left fallow; actual
sown area is placed at between 15 and 16 million ha. However, some land
mainly in the NW, is multiple-cropped.2/  Corn is by far the most widespread
crop covering about one half of the total (Table 1). Other important crops
from the standpoint of area are beans, sorghum, wheat, sugarcane, cotton,
oilseeds and fruit (mainly orange and banana).
3.        Calculations based on depletion of nutrients by crops have been
carried out in Mexico as in many other countries; however, the amounts
available in the soil; incoming nutrients contained in the rain or irrigation
water and fixed by symbiotic micro organisms, and losses oy decomposition,
evaporation, leaching or insolubilization are not well known; therefore, they
cannot be used as a basis for fertilizer dosages.  Mexico has a network of
research stations coordinated by the Instituto Nacional de Investigaciones
Agricolas in the Ministry of Agriculture; some of the stations have a large
input, including financing, received from the farmers. Such is the case, for
instance, of the Centro de Investigaciones Agricolas del Noroeste (CIANG)
which receives economic aid from a Foundation for Agricultural Research and
Experimentation formed by farmers in the State of Sonora, Guanomex's Agrcnomic
j   Including livestock raising, hunting, forestry and fishing.
/  The current country economic report (No. 547-ME dated September 27,
1974) states: "the cultivable area is estimated to exceed 20 million
ha."; FAO places arable land at 22.5 million ha. in 1960; 23.8
million ha. in Anuario EFtadistico 1970.
j   Cropped area is estimated at as much as 17.4 million ha. (Banco
Nacional de Mexico, Review of the Economic Situation of Mexico,
Vol. L, No. 583: June 1974).



ANNEX 3-1
Page 2
Department has also started technical-economic investigations on iso-
fertilization curves for corn crops in various states. They are based on
benefit cost studies for crop responses in the types of soils found in
different parts of the State studied; they include information on the
average availability of water and also on the risk element--mainly in rain-
fed areas--obtained from an examination of variability of the water supply
over a period of not less than 10 yearsi/. This work has been carried out
only in a few States in Central Mexico; it has been found that in some areas
application of fertilizer cannot be recommended unless the farmer could have
extensive insurance or some other mechanism of income maintenance.
4.        Fertilizer dosages are recommended for various crops and areas by
State Coordinating Boards composed of representatives of the Ministry of
Agriculture's Divisions of Agricultural and Livestock Economics, and of
Extension Services, the Agricultural Research Centers, Guanomex and other
organizations. In irrigated areas, Irrigation District Boards substitute for
the State Boards. Comparative fertilizer dosages and yields for several crops
in some areas--both irrigated and rain-fed are contained in Annex 3-5. Average
dosages in various countries are shown in Table 2.
3/ The needs of water by corn and the rainfall are computed on a
weekly basis to avoid "averaging" months with surplus rainfall
with dry months at a time when water has a decisive effect on
yields.

ANNEX 3-2
MEXICO - FERTILIZER PROJECT
HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF FERTILIZER SUPPLY AND CONSUMPTION
A.   Consumption of Fertilizer
1.        Consumption of fertilizer grew rapidly in the last 20 years (at an
average rate of 17.4% annually). The trend, however, slowed down to 11% in
the last decade. Consumption of phosphatic and potassic fertilizers grew a
little less rapidly (Table 1).
2.        Consumption of ammonia, urea and complex fertilizers has grown at
a faster rate than other nitrogenous fertilizers (Table 2). As a result,
ammonia and urea account for 32% and 23% respectively of total Mexican N
consumption. However, ammonium sulfate, with 26% of the total, is still an
important source of N.
3.        Distribution of fertilizer consumption by regions is shown in
Table 9.  Most of the ammonia (62%) is used in the two States of Sonora and
Sinaloa.  These two States plus Guanajuato and Jalisco are the main consumers
of urea (53% of the total). Ammonium sulfate is sold preponderantly in the
States of Jalisco, Mexico, Guanajuato and Michoacan (60%).
B.   Production of Fertilizer
4.        The production of solid nitrogenous fertilizer grew at an average
rate of 15.4% annually from 1953 through 1973 as shown in Tables 4-8 summarized
below:

Urea and ammonia are products whose production has grown most rapidly. N in
urea was only 18.6% of total N produced in Mexico in 1963 as compared to
45.7% in 1973.
5.        In the period from 1968 to 1973, N fertilizer production averaging
443,000 TPY, has nearly balanced consumption (456,00O TPY). Produc ion, how-
ever, was indirectly based, to a large extent, on imported ammonia* . In the
last five years, Mexico exported, on the average, 38,800 tons annually of N
in urea and imported 157,000 tons of N in ammonia (Tables 3 and 4). All the
production of solid N fertilizers is made by Guanomex, with the exception of
about 20,000 tons of N in ammonium sulfate made as a by-product by the
following private enterprises: UNIVEX, Altos Hornos de Mexico S.A. and
Industrias Quimicas de Mexico.
6.        Potassic fertilizers are not produced in Mexico. Phosphatic ferti-
lizers are produced by Guanomex and FFM. Guanomex has been making simple
superphosphate since 1947 and DAP since 1970; it also manufactured triple
superphosphate in the Coatzacoalcos unit from 1962 through 1969, at which
time, the phosphoric acid made in this plant was diverted to the manufacture
of DAP. At present, FFM is the main producer of phosphoric acid (capacity:
380,000 TPY) and the only one of triple superphosphate (330,000 TPY). Guanomex
has a productive capacity of 76,000 TPY of phosphoric acid. Total capacity of
phosphoric acid exceeds demand for the manufacture of DAP and NPK and, in 1972,
Mexico exported 184,372 tons of phosphoric acid to the US, Brazil, The Nether-
lands, India and Guatemala. Although Mexico produces some phosphate rockj,
the phosphoric acid industry is substantially bas, d on phosphate rock imported
mainly from the US, and lately also from Morocco       In 1972, phosphate rock
imports amounted to 1,147,000 tons; about 300,000 tons were required by the
Guanomex plants and the balance was used by FFM, save small volumes used by
Fosforitas Mexicanas for the production of other chemicals.
7.        Production of phosphatic fertilizers developed in the last years
as shown below. Mexico is practically self-sufficient overall.
3/ In practice imported ammonia is largely used for direct application
as fertilizer due to the storage and handling facilities located at
ports near areas where direct application of ammonia is widespread,
while domestically produced ammonia is used mainly (but not exclu-
sively) for industrial transformation.
j   Estimated at 58,000 MT in 1972.
j   On the other hand, Mexico has the needed resources of sulfur, and
enough productive capacity of sulfuric and nitric acids.

C.   Fertilizer Distribution and Prices
8.        Guanomex, the only authorized distributor for the internal market,
has divided the country into five sales regions (Table 9) and handles sales
through four channels: dealers (mostly private), official banks in coordina-
tion with cooperatives and agricultural associations, sugar mills, and direct
clients (generally farmers' associations). Geographical distribution of
fertilizer sales is shown in Table 9 and distribution by channels, below:

MEXICO - FERTILIZER PROJECT
AGRO-CHEMICAL INPUTS ACCORDING TO AN AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
MODEL FOR MEXIC0
1.        A research project undertaken jointly by the Government of
Mexico and the Bank's Development Research Center (DRC) resulted in a highly
disaggregated model of the Mexican agricultural sector,17 which describes
supply and demand for 33 crops and inputs associated with them in 20 different
types of land. The model permits to simulate alternative paths for the sector
in terms of macro variables (output, prices, employment, etc.) and estimates
short and long-term sectoral elasticities of supplies. It can also incorporate
alternative measurements of capital/labor substitution, changes in sectoral
income distribution, estimates of seasonal employment patterns and allows for
the calculation of demands for key inputs. For capital-labor substitution,
the value of agricultural machinery was isolated from other forms of capital
because it is thought that irrigation and other long-term capital investments
are not substitutes for labor. The model does not include data on forestry,
livestock and long-cycle crops.
2.        The model estimates that with agricultural sector growth rates of
4.7% and 5.-% (corresponding to 7% and 8% GNP growth rates respectively),
elasticities of agrochemical consumption to sectoral output range between
1.74 and 1.77 and fertilizer consumption growth rates (assumed to be propor-
tional to total agrochemical consumption) will range from 8.2% to 9.5%
annually.
3.        The model assumes that farmers will increase fertilizer consumption
only when it pays them to do so and that there is a time lag in the spread of
information. It does not take into account the possible role of stepped-up
extension services and other promotional measures which could result in hi4er
fertilizer consumption, mainly by small farmers in isolated rainfed areas..!/
A well designed and dynamic research and extension program could
increase fertilizer consumption at an annual rate of as much as 11%.
v A Quantitative Agricultural Planning Methodology (May 1974),
by Roger D. Norton (DRC) and Luz N. Bassoco(Office of the President,
Government of Mexico)
2/ The model shows that without these promotional measures, 27.5% of the
agrochemicals used in Mexico by 1976 will be used in irrigated lana
in the NW, 42.h% in other irrigated land, 29.2% in rain-fed non-tropical
land and 0.9% in tropical areas.

ANNEX 3-5
MEXICO - FERTILIZER PROJECT
FERTILIZER SUPPLY AND CONSUMPTION PROJECTIONS
1.        Guanomex has projected a consumption of 1.0 million tons of N and
0.25 million tons of P205 by 1980, and 1.5 million tons of N by 1985. The
methodology used has been based on fitting regression equations to the
historical data and applying them to assumed 1974 base consumption figures.
Total projected N consumption levels for 1985 is compatible with the Chac/
model for agriculture in Mexico (Annex 3-3) and it could be even higher if
strong promotional measures were taken to improve fertilizer application
rates in some (but not all) rain-fed areas not fertilized up to now, and
if, as announced, irrigation works benefiting 1.14 million ha. were built
through 1980. A slowdown in the growth of ammonia consumption in irrigated
lands in the NW--where there are limitations both in area and in dosages,
which are now practically reaching optimum levels--and the shift from
ammoniuum sulfate and nitrate to urea because of lower freight costs has been
taken into account in the projections for individual products (Table 1).
Furthermore, consumption of ammonium sulfate and nitrate is assumed to be
essentially the same as production and therefore they are derived from known
manufacturing capacity plans.
2.        Consumption of P205 has also been modified to result in more balanced
N:P205:K20 ratios. The proportion of P2O5 and K20 application rates to that
ofNWis iiimuch lower than in otherFcountri'es 7riefIe&tng preence of those
nutrients in the soil of several important agricultural regions. However,
as intensity of fertilization with N increases, depletion of other nutrients
becomes more of a possibility and to counteract their deficiency--Which is
not generally as quickly visible as N deficiency--promotion of consumption
of complex fertilizers is expected to result in higher levels of P20o  and K2O
consumption than those found by simple extrapolation of historical d?ata.
Consideration must also be given to the need for micro nutrients. No speci-
fic projections for consumption of potassic fertilizer have been made but in
the estimate that follows, it has been assumed that the trend for K2O will
follow that for P205.

The deficit will be met by net imports.  The view at present is that the
proposed Istmo plant will export part of its production between 1979 and 1982
but there will be continued importation of complex fertilizers until a new
project for the establishment of a plant (possibly on the Pacific) is developed.
However, it is also possible that some of the urea surplus will be used to
manufacture mixed fertilizers cutting down on the need to import complex
fertilizers. Capacity for the manufacture of complex fertilizers will be
required very soon, mainly if demand for P205 develops at a somewhat faster
rate than that for N. By 1985, there would be, in all likelihood, need for
additional N fertilizer capacity. The nature of the product to be manufactured
and the plant location should be carefully studied.
5.        The ammonia requirements and availability on the basis of known
projects are projected to be as shown in Table 4.

DESCRIOTION 0F CONASUPO
ObJectives
1.        Conasupo has the following basic objectives:
i. regulate the market for basic staples;
ii. increase the income of poor farmers;
iii. increase the ability of low income consumers to acquire
basic goods.
2.        More specifically, the target groups are producers with annual
incomes below Mex$12,000 (US$960) and families with monthly incomes of less
than Mex$2,000 (US$160). A profile of the structure of Mexican agriculture
in terms of farm numbers and output is shown in the following table.

1/ The source of this and other information given in this Annex is
"An Analysis of Conasupo's Rural Development Program"t, prepared by
Dr. James E. Austin for the Bank in March, 1974.
Approximately 9h% of the farms have annual sales of less than M$12,000,
and they account for only about 33% of the total agricultural output.
3.        In effect, Conasupo is targeting its programs toward the
subsistence and small farmer segments. The low income consumer group
includes both urban and rural poor and is composed mainly of those with
annual incomes of less than Mex$12,000; in 1972 this group constituted 57%
of the population.

Characteristics of the Farming Sector Targetted for Conasupo's Action
4.        The primary target groups on the production side are the subsis-
tence and traditional small farmers, especially members of the ejidos.
Preliminary data based on a national sample of 3,670 interviews by
Conasupo of small, traditional farmers, provided guiding data in the
formulation of the new strategy for Conasupo's rural development effort.
The study revealed that in this tra4itional segment of the agricultural
sector 68% of the land is rrejidal t, 22% privately owned, and 10%
communally owned. This constitutes 87% of the traditional segment with
the other 13% being rented land or sharecropped. Modern inputs are used
on a limited basis. Only 13% used herbicides, 16% improved seeds, 23%
insecticides, 26% fertilizers. This sector is also relatively neglected
by government agencies: only 19% receive formal credit and a mere 4%
receive technical assistance. The bulk of the farmers primarily grown
CornI_/(approximately 45% of the land is dedicated to this crop). Of the
corn produced, 70% is for human consumption, 20% for animal feed, 8% for
industrialization, and 2% for seed. The small farmers retain about 69%
of their crop for their own consumption. Forty percent of the farmers
sell some or all of their crop. Approximately 17% of the corn they sell
goes to Conasupo. Most farmers (79%) said the reason for selling to
Conasupo was better prices.  The main reasons given by these not selling
1/ Ejidal land ceded to individual campesinos in the agrarian reform
cannot be sold.
2/ 77% also own animals of some kind.

Conasupo's Strategy
5.        Conasupo's rural development strategy has been designed on the
basis of the rural economy structure and the problems shown by the above
statistics and corroborated in other studies by Conasupo. Structural
factors in the economic interaction of the campesinos with external
groups is the primary cause of stagnation in the development of the rural
sectors. More specif'ically the relationship between the price paid by
campesinos for the good they buy and what they receive for the produce
they sell is unfavorable. Besides possible structural imbalances in the
terms of trade for agricultural and manufactured goods, supplies and
buyers serving small farmers, mainly in isolated areas may be exploitative
or inefficient. Very often the supply and marketing functions may be
performed by inefficient middlemen filling a void in the economic system
and trying to earn a living. The local store owner or corn buyer may well
be a fellow campesino with an entrepreneurial flair simply trying to eke
out a meager income by means other than tilling the soil. When the
campesinos are able to increase their production, this potential economic
gain is drained off by unfavorable prices from store owners or from corn
buyers or from non-productive expenditures, e.g., fiestas.
6.        Credit plays a key role in the maintenance of these unfavorable
terms of trade. The farmers arc unable to accumulate capital reserves and,
therefore, do not have enough funds to support their families for the
entire period between harvests. Consequently, the campesinos are
frequently obliged to seek credit for the purchase of staples. The two
primary sources are either rural store keepers who sell on credit or
middlemen who lend to the farmers in return for a promise to sell their
crop to the middlemen at a pre-set price lower than the government's
guaranteed price. According to Conasupo studies, approximately half of
the small farmer sales are in exchange for consumer credit and an estimated
40% to 60% of rural purchases are on creditf. Conasupols studies also
indicate that the average prices of goods in rural stores are 20-23% higher
than the prices charged in Conasupo stores-
1/ Studies by the Banco Agropecuario produced similar figures.
2/ This price differential was corroborated by direct observation in the
field by Dr. J.E. Austin in February 1974.



ANNEX  -
Page 4
7.        Credit is not the only mechanism by which middlemen obtain the
campesinos' crop at relatively lower prices. For example, the lack of
transportation, storage, shellers, or bags often push the farmer into
selling to middlemen who have these facilities or service. These economic
relationships represent structural barriers that will not necessarily
be altered by channelling increasing amounts of funds into the traditional
areas of crop financing, production infrastructure, and technical
assistance. The structural weaknesses must be addressed directly if
maximum benefit is to be obtained from the investments in the other areas.
8.        Based on the foregoing analysis, Conasupo has set forth the
follo-wing general strategy for its rural development efforts: enable the
campesino to increase his income, retain it, and invest it in productive
means. A probable short run effect of this strategy would be the direct
welfare benefit accruing through an increase in effective purchasing
power and in consumption. This incremental consumption would most likely
be in food and hence the possibility of enhancing the nutritional level of
the rural populace. Nonetheless, it is important to emphasize that the
thrust of the strategy is toward increasing the productivity of the
campesinos rather than just improving their immediate standard of living.
The concept is to generate sustained self-development rather than simply
adjust income distribution.
9.        Conasupo has designed an integrated strategy aimed at altering
the structural relationships in the rural economies by combining various
related services and activities in a specific area; the idea is to produce
a synergistic effect among resources and services of sufficient magnitude
to break some of the key vicious circles constraining rural development.
The major components of the Conasupo rural development strategy are the
following:
i. selU basic consumer goods (primarily foodstuffs) in rural
areas at prices lower than those currently prevailing;
ii. provide consumer credit to rural consumers;
iii. buy farmers' produce at guaranteed prices;
iv. provide auxiliary services needed to alter the unfavorable
structural economic relationships;
v. help market campesinos' nonagricultural products,e.g.
handicrafts;
vi. provide productive investauent opportunities for the
incremental income gains achieved by the campesinos;
vii.  involve the campesinos in decision-making and operational
aspects of the programs.

ANNEX 3-8
MEXICO - FERTILIZER PROJECT
THE ROLE OF ORGANO - PHOSPHORUS INSECTICIDES
General Consideration
1.       When contemplating the production and use of an insecticide (or other
pesticide), major considerations are:
1) Effectiveness against the target insect(s).
2) Effect on benign insects and other living creatures
in the local environment and elsewhere.
3) Raw material availability and cost.
4) Access to appropriate production, formulation and
application technology.
Effectiveness Against the Target Insect(s)
2.       The key factor determining effectiveness is the resistance pattern
of the target species towards a specific insecticide. Many insects, especially
those with short life cycles, are remarkably adept at rapidly developing
tolerances towards chemicals that initially had proved highly lethal. Hence,
the practical effectiveness of an insecticide can only be properly evaluated
after several years of field application on a commercial scale.
Effect on the Local Environment and Elsewhere
3.       Even if a chemical compound is a powerful agent against a specific
species, its commercial use will be greatly diminished if it also slays a
wide variety of benign insects and perhaps plant life and animals too.
Should this toxicity be persistent, and be carried over in the soil or crop,
the commercial use of such a compound may well be banned.
Raw Material Availability and Cost
4.       Many insecticides, especially organo-phosphorus compounds, are
produced from complex intermediate chemicals or basic raw materials
(e.g., phosphorus and ethyl or methyl alcohol). Such "chemical building
blocks"are made in large-scale plants involving huge investments, and their
small-scale production only for pesticide purposes would be uneconomic.
Therefore, the ready availability of such raw or intermediate materials
at reasonable cost is essential.
Access to Appropriate Technology
5.       Technical and commercial development of a pesticide can cost
$10 million, or more, today and the risk of subsequent failure due to
insect resistance, new legislation or competition is always present.
Therefore, in a developing country it is usually prudent to license
proven production, formulation and application technology from an
experienced overseas company, perhaps under some Joint operation or
par3i,ership arrangement.  Such policies have an additional advantage
in that potential toxicity hazards arising during manufacture, distri-
bution and use can be prevented by appropriate instruction and training
by the licensor.



ANNEX 3-8
Page 2
Principal Features of Organo-Phosphorus Insecticides
6.       The organic phosphorus compounds  owe much of their efficacy to
the nerve-gas research of World War II. They are rapidly absorbed by
insects and warm-blooded mammals, including man, and upset vital mechanisms
such as the nervous system, by inhibiting the impulse-controlling enzyme
cholinesterase and results in uncoordinated spasms and death. Some, like
malathion, may be initially safer because the liver or other mammalian
organs act as detoxifiers. Consequently, only lower forms of life without
such protective mechanisms are killed. Nevertheless, some combinations of
these materials with other organic phosphates or other types of chemicals
may prove much more toxic than when absorbed alone, which intensifies the
precautions needed. One advantage, however, of many organic-phosphates is
their short persistence time, which can often be tailored to last throughout
a critical field period of a few days or weeks before rapid disintegration
into virtually harmless residues. Another is that immunity build-up in
target insects may be much slower than with chlorinated organics.
Parathion Characteristics
7.       Parathion is one of the most toxic compounds used in agriculture.
The poison can enter the body by any route. Serious and even fatal poisoning
may occur while eating or smoking, but parathion can also be ingested by
inhaling contaminated air or absorbed through the skin. The ability of
parathion to penetrate the skin in fatal doses without prior irritation,
warning the person of the exposure to poison, make this insecticide
especially difficult to handle. However, parathion hydrolyses rapidly;
analysis of spray residues show only minor remaining amounts within days
after its application. Parathion is not highly flammable. In the factories
where it is manufactured, the processes should be conducted as far as possible
in totally enclosed equipment.
Production of Parathion in Mexico
8.       The proposal of Guanomex to expand its production of parathion
satisfies the criteria listed in the previous paragraphs. This insecticide
has proved highly effective in many countries, including Mexico, mainly
against cotton crop predators (a major target). Although it is, as mentioned
above, highly toxic it rapidly decomposes into non-lethal products and
therefore, build-up of harmful toxicity is prevented. At the same time,
continued exposure of target pests to parathion and the corresponding
likelihood of increasing insect tolerance levels are avoided.
Parathion must be handled taking the greatest precautions because
of its high toxicity and its capacity to penetrate the skin without causing
a warning irritation. During transportation, drums containing this compound



ANNEX 3-8
Page 3
should be checked for possible defects and should be loaded into wagons or
trucks in such a way that damage to the drums is practically impossible.
No other merchandise should be allowed next to the drums and they, as well
as the railway car or truck used, should be examined thoroughly at the
destination to detect possible leakages. The warehousing of parathion
may also be hazardous as shown by a fatal incident in Tijuana. Goods
that have been contaminated by parathion obviously should not be released
and should be handled only by trained personnel.

The main gas fields are near the northeastern border with the US, in the State of
Tabasco in the South (mainly in the area surrounding Pemex City) and in the
poza Rica district in the State of Veracruz. The Government has announced
that it will spend in three years (1974-76), US$248 million in exploratory
drilling for gas. Exploration costs in the State of Chiapas (for gas and
petroleum) amounted to about us$56 million in 1973/74 and have paid out
handsomely in the finding of new deposits that will change the balance of
payments in fuels for Mexico.
2.        Natural gas production was 660 billion SCF in 1972 and 677 billion
SCF in 1973.  In the first seven months of 1974, output was estimated at 540
billion SCF (i.e. an increase of 20% over the previous year's daily average
output). The main producing districts are the NE district in the Northern
Zone, Ciudad Pemex in the Southern Zone and Poza Rica in the State of Veracruz:

near the border with the US, to Celulosa de Chihuahua, more than 1,000 km
away. The second one extends from Ciudad Pemex to Guadalajara (at a distance
of 1,287 km) and has a total length of 2,714 km, mostly in diameters between
14" and 24". Many segments of the networks, such as Reynosa, Monterrey and
Ciudad Pemex-Salamanca, are double pipelines. New pipelines are being built,
especially a 24" pipe from Cactus to Pajaritos (Coatzacoalcos) and a 30" one
from Poza Rica to Pajaritos. (Pajaritos is the site of the largest petro-
chemical complex planned by Pemex.) Except for the small Camargo ammonia
plant, which is served by one 12" pipeline, all the ammonia plants can be
supplied from two different gas pipelines and therefore the risk of their
being shutdown by lack of feedstock is negligible.

MEXICO - FERTILIZER PROJECT
PARATHION MANUFACTURE
1.       The proposed parathion process to be used by Guanomex at Salamanca
under license from Stauffer will begin with the production of phosphorous
pentasulfide from elemental Mexican sulfur and phosphorous imported from
the US:
10 S + P4 --* 2 P2 S5
The reaction is carried out in inert atmosphere. The pentasulfide is then
reacted with methyl or ethyl alcohol (according to whether methyl or ethyl
parathion is desired) to yield dimethyl (or diethyl) ditiophosphoric acid:
P2S5 + 4CH30H  -.0 2(CH30)2  P(S)SH + H2S
2S5 + 4C2H5OH -iO 2(C2H50)2   P(S)SH + H2S
These products are then filtered and fed to a reactor where sulfur chloride
is added. The sulfur chloride is also made by Guanomex from Mexican sulfur
(Azufrera Panamericana) and chlorine made by Guanomex in the same plant. In
the case of ethyl parathion, gaseous chlorine is also fed to the reactor.
(CH O)   P(S)SH + SC12 - (CH O)2 PS Cl + 2S + H Cl
(Co25o32 P(S)SH + SC12 -. (C2 5O)2 PS C1 + 2S + H Cl
The last reaction is the combination of these products with sodium paranitro-
phenolate in the presence of sodium carbonate:
(CH30)2 P C1 + N20 C6 H4 NO2 -.# (CH30)2 PSOC6HhNO2 + NaCl
The product obtained is methyl parathion which is washed and then the solvents
used in several of the steps removed. The process for ethyl parathion is
similar. In the case of methyl parathion, xylene is added to obtain 80%
concentration.
2.       The proposal to expand parathion production at Salamanca in conjunc-
tion with Stauffer Chemical Co. of USA has many advantages. For example, it
will ensure the availability of elemental phosphorus which is easily transported
from USA, until its eventual production in Mexico. This liaison also provides
for the use of latest Stauffer technology. The proposed expansion embodies an
improved process for the obtention of sodium paranitrophenolate.
In addition, the production, distribution and application experience
already acquired by the Guanomex pesticide group can be supplemented, as required,
by their counterparts in Stauffer Chemical Company.

ESTIMATION OF PERMANENT WORKING CAPITAL
A distribution has been made between the Company's operational
working capital requirements, and additional requirements imposed upon it
by a Government policy to hold large inventories and grant long payment
terms. Only operational working capital requirements are included in the
project cost to be covered by long-term finance, while it is assumed that
the additional working capital requirements would be covered by short-term
financing from the banking system.

ANNEX 6-1
MEXICO - FERTILIZER PROJECT
ASSUMPTIONS USED FOR FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS
All prices and their respective changes discussed in this Annex,
except where indicated otherwise, are expressed in December 1974 terms. How-
ever, proforma financial statements (Annexes 6-3, 6-5, 6-7 and 6-8) have been
made in current terms, reflecting expected changes in relative prices until
mid-1978, and no further changes thereafter. Projected prices in the
financial statements are inflated using the expected general rate of inflation
as shown in Annex 5-3.
1. Start of Operations and Capacity Utilization
Plants built under the project are assumed to start commercial operations
in April 1978. During the first three months of operations, corresponding to
the last three months of FY78, the project will operate at 70% capacity.
Capacity utilization will increase to 75%, 85%, and 90%, in the second, third,
and fourth year, remaining constant thereafter. Capacity utilization of
existing plants is expected to improve from the present level of about 83%
to about 90% at the time of commercial start-up of the project.

The domestic price of parathion stood at Mex$16,ooo/ton (delivered to
any train station in the country) at the end of 1974. To enhance the profit-
ability of parathion production, a price increase to Mex$16,500 has been

of the project and of all other units of Guanomex. For purposes of analyz-
ing the project by itself, it has been assumed that all bags not used in
the project are sold to other units at a transfer price of Mex$2,732 per
thousand bags (the present market price).

anticipated for 1975 through 1977, and to Mex$17,370 for 1978 onwards.
3. Output Prices (export market f.o.b.)
The Istmo plant (urea) will be the only plant to export a part of its
production until local demand fully absorbs the new production capacity:

4. Commercial Activities of Guanomex
Commercial activities (sale of products not manufactured by Guanomex)
change from year to year and depend on prices in international markets,
availability of foreign and local supplies, level of activity in the
agricultural sector, availability of foreign exchange, credit policies,
etc.   In the financial forecasts, gross revenues from commercial activities
have been assumed to be as follows:
1,000 tons   Mex$/ton      Gross Revenues
(Mex$ million)
Ammonia                      720         1,680           369.6

Cost of purchase by Guanomex have been assumed as 90% of gross revenues.
The subsidy received by the Company in FY1975 and FY1976 from the special
fund of Mex$500 million will enable Guanomex to maintain this margin.
5. Sales Tax
Sales tax is normally 4% of revenues. However, in the past, Guanomex
has occasionally been granted certain sales tax reductions. The current
reduction for existing plants to 3.5% will end in 1977. It has been assumed
that it will not be renewed, i.e. that sales tax will be 4% after 1977.
6. Production Costs
Historical production cost per ton of product and projected costs for
the new plants are shown in Annex 6-2.
7. Depreciation
Existing plants are being depreciated over 14 years, but the new plants
will be depreciated over 12 years. The annual depreciation charge for the
project is calculated below:

8. Selling and Distribution Costs
Sellirng expenses for the project have been assumed at Mex$ 1.82 million
plus 5.5% of revenues, and for the existing facilities at Mex$ 20.0 million
plus 5.5% of revenues.  Average freight costs have been assumed at Mex$ 110
per tori of fertilizer, 14e$ 370 per ton of insecticide and Mex$ 140 per ton
of other chemicals.
9. Other Income
Other income represents 12% p.a. interest charged by Guanomex for
receivables outstanding in excess of 60 days.
10. Income Tax and Workers' Participation
Income tax has been assumed as 39% for 1975 through 1977, and 42%
thereafter. 11% of income after tax is for workers' participation.
11. Terms of Long-term Debt for the Project

12. Accounts Receivable
It is estimated that the Company will hold an average of 5 months of
sales as accounts receivable.
13. Inventory
It, is estimated that at the end of FY1975 the finished goods inventory
will be as follows:
Mex$ Million
Inventory of goods produced by Guanomex                      275.0
Inventory of goods for merchandising activities              364.5
Total                                          639.5
71  including 3s  on-lending fee for NAFINSA



A1VEX 6-1
Page 5
For 1976 and later, the inventory of goods produced by Guanomex is
assumed to remain constant at a level of about 2 months of production.
Inventory of finished goods for merchandising activities are expected
still to be rather high at the end of 1975 (about 7 months of activities).
This reflects a deliberate policy to insure steady availability of ferti-
lizers under present conditions of uncertain world markets. Guanomex intends
to revise this policy from 1976 onwards when it expects a stabilization of
world markets. In the long run, it has been assumed that Guanomex will hold
finished goods inventory for its merchandising activities of about 3 months.
