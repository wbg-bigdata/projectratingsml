DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO NACIONAL FINANCIERA, S.A.
AND GUANOS Y FERTILIZANTES DE MEXICO, S.A. W4ITH
TIIE GUARANTEE OF UNITED MEXICAN STATES FOR
A FERTILIZER PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
in various currencies equivalent to US$50 million jointly to Nacional
Financiera, S.A. (NAFINSA) and Guanos y Fertilizantes de Mexico, S.A.
(Guanomex) to assist in financing two new urea plants and the expansion of
an existing insecticide plant. The loan would be guaranteed by United Mexican
States and would have a term of 14 years, including 3-1/2 years of grace, with
interest at 8-1/2 percent per annum. NAFINSA would charge Guanomex a fee of
3-1/2 percent per annum on the outstanding amount of the loan, bringing the
cost of the loan to Guanomex to 12 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        Some of the major structural features of the Mexican economy -
past, present and future - were analyzed in "The Economy of lexico:    A Basic
Report" (192-ME), distributed to the Executive Directors on June 26, 1973.
Short-run trends in 1973-74 were covered in "Mexico: Current Economic Posi-
tion and Prospects," distributed to the Executive Directors on September 27,
1974. Another updating report on the economy will be prepared by a mission
which is scheduled to visit Mlexico in July this year. Country data sheets
are contained in Annex I.
3.        For the three most recent of the six decades since the Revolution
of 1910, the Mexican economic system, measured in terms of GDP growth, has
been outstandingly successful. Since 1940, the annual average growth rate
has exceeded 6 percent. And from the mid-1950s to 1972 Mexico was among the
few countries in the developing world to combine sustained and rapid growth
with monetary and balance of payments stability. Inflation averaged less
than 5 percent a year and the dollar value of the peso was maintained at the
level fixed in 1954.
4.        Rapid and sustained growth was the product of successful policies
affecting the mobilization and use of both private and public sector re-
sources. The role of government in promoting economic growth was expressed
on the one hand in the development of strategic infrastructure and major
utility industries and on the other in policies which featured price support,
import control and agrarian reform measures in the agricultural sector and
external protection and the provision of fiscal incentives in the industrial
sector.



5.        The relative emphasis of public and private investment was however
reflected in changes in the structure of output and employment and the expan-
sion of manufacturing industry. Agriculture nevertheless continued to be the
chief source of employment and in 1970 accounted for 39 percent of the eco-
nomically active population.
6.        In spite of rapid and sustained economic growth over the last two
decades, the combination of a high demographic growth rate - about 3.4 per-
cent per year - and, until fairly recently, primarily import substituting
industrial policies, have prevented an adequate absorption of the labor force
in productive emplovment. Industrial growth has been quite substantial -
about 8 percent annually over the past twqo decades - but could have been even
faster if industrial and trade policies had been primarily focused to exploit-
ing 'Mexico's unique export opportunities originating in Its contiguity to a
large industrial market in which labor costs are a multiple of those in
Mexico. It was only in the early 'seventies that some major steps were taken
to develop manufacturing exports on a large scale -- the system of drawbacks
on domestic taxes paid on exports and the "border industries" regime were
introduced at that time, and these have been so highly successful as to sug-
gest that a lot more could still be done. As it is, 40 percent of the labor
force is estimated in either marginal occupations - relatively unproductive
and hence poorly paid - or openly unemployed.
7.        The Mexican strategy for development has, in the past, relied on
a combination of public action and private profit. The government has played
a highly important role in this process, both as a promoter of key sectors
and as the setter of a regulatory and institutional framework within which
private and social groups could compete and contend, but which was both firm
enough and flexible enough to ensure overall continuity and stability. As a
formula for growqth this sytem has served Mlexico well, but it has also led to
a sharpening of contrasts in income and wealth between people and among regions.
This was not an entirely incidental by-product of the process of growtth; the
share of the government in the economy was kept down quite deliberately for
many years, and evidently the scope of redistributive policies was limited as
long as tax ratios as low as 8 - 10 percent - among the lowest in the world -
were maintained. The government played a crucial role in the development of
private commercial agriculture through its irrigation and credit policies and
of industry through the provision of infrastructure, education, social legis-
lation and financial policies, but it did not concern itself primarily with
the problems of the poorest sections of the population. While the land re-
form of 1917 - widely spread in the 'thirties - was adhered to, the absence
of abundant fiscal resources prevented major programs to improve the economic
status of the beneficiaries of the land reform. The present government, how-
ever, came to power on a program of combining past growth policies with much
greater efforts in favor of the rural poor, and has launched a number of ambi-
tious initiatives in this direction.   Their continuity and viability will de-
pend, inter alia, on the government's continued willingness to mobilize fiscal
resources to support these programs.   So far the record is impressive: the
ratio of public revenues to GNIP which in 1970 stood at 11.2 percent, for 1975
is estimated at 15.7 percent.



- 3 -
8.        The attempts which have been made by the present administration
(1970-76) to alleviate the poverty of the countryside and to redress some of
the imbalances between rural and urban Mexico have several dimensions. They
include a revised Agrarian Reform Law (1971) and a new Federal Water Law
(1972), both of which are intended to promote a more equitable distribution
of basic agricultural resources. These measures have been complemented by
changes in the sectoral allocation of available agricultural credit in order
to increase the share of low Income farmers and ejidatarios (members of ejidos,
which are a form of collective land tenure based on usufruct), the introduction
of higher support prices for basic foodcrops and increased government outlavs
for agricultural research, training and extension services, with particular
regard to the needs of peasant farmers. Perhaps one of the most significant
innovations has been a new program for integrated rural development with
which the World Bank has been associated from an early stage.
9.        The social and economic needs of the rural sector have not however
monopolized government attention; those of urban-industrial development have
also been stressed in the form of heavy public investment in basic industries -
delayed during the 1960s - and an innovative low-income housing program which
has been financed with a five percent payroll tax.    Productive investment has
thus been complemented, in the urban as well as the rural economy, by insti-
tutional changes and public expenditures designed to improve the living
conditions of the poor. This parallel effort has however generated several
problems of short-run economic management.
10.       In 1971, after monetary and balance of payments pressures had emerged
during the previous year, the (then new) government took stringent action to
control demand with the effect that the CDP growth rate fell to 3.4 percent by
comparision with a decade average of 7.1 percent in the 1960s. In 1972, renewed
expansion was stimulated by public expenditure and the GDP growth rate rose to
7.4 percent. There was another year of rapid growth (7.6 percent) in 1973 -
but this time associated with an increase of 21 percent in prices (CDP deflator).
Inflation was not the only novelty; private savings, which in the recent past
had helped finance sustained growth, increased by only 11 percent, compared
with an average rate of 18 percent in 1965-71; the inflow of private capital
was replaced by a net outflow, and vrivate investment, particularly in the
industrial sectors, slackened, reflecting some uncertainty on the part of the
business community. In the public sector there was a record fiscal deficit -
amounting to 5.6 percent of GDP by comparision with an average of 2.7 percent
in 1965-71. A major share of the limited volume of real savings was preempted
to finance part of this deficit while net external borrowing of US$1.2 billion
(2.4 percent of GCTP) was deployed to finance the rest.   These trends were
inevitably reflected in the balance of payments where the current account
deficit rose to 3.0 percent of GDP (by comparison with an average of 2.0
percent in 1965-71).
11.       Noting these trends, the authorities had, by mid 1973, put a re-
strictive monetary and credit policy into effect and complemented this with
what was originally intended to be an austere public finance program for FY
1974. Taken together, these measures were expected to restrict demand and to



- 4 -
reduce both inflation and the size of the Government's current account deficit.
The provisional results for 1974 indicate that whereas the former objective was
achieved, the latter was not. Monetary and credit policies were, on the whole,
carried out as planned. The rate of increase of prices thus decelerated from
April onwards, and a positive differential between Mexican and foreign interest
rates was re-established by the end of the year although credit was not allo-
cated as originally intended because the public sector again pre-empted a
large part of the available quantity. Higher than planned public expenditures
and lower than expected revenues meant moreover that the fiscal deficit was
larger than foreseen as were the growth rates of aggregate demand and real
imports. The deficit in the balance of payments on current account thus
amounted to 4.2 percent of GDP rather than the intended 2.8 percent. Net
public borrowing rose to US$2.9 billion of which US$1.8 billion was required
to finance the fiscal deficit, the remainder being needed for balance of pay-
ments purposes including coverage of large capital outflows.
12.       The government's economic program for 1975 incorporates a major
effort to mobilize additional public sector resources, the increase in reve-
nues being estimated at more than 3.0 percent of GDP. Monetary and credit
policies will continue to be restrictive although, given attractive interest
rates, domestic savings are expected to rise. Public expenditures - both
capital and current are expected to increase significantly in real terms
and the planned fiscal deficit amounts to 4.3 percent of GDP, three quarters
of which will be externally financed. Planned internal public borrowing thus
is modest, which means that the private sector will receive a major share of
available credit and private investment is likely to increase. The resource
gap is expected to decline from 2.1 percent to 1.3 percent of GDP - an improve-
ment which reflects the growth of petroleum exports (projected at around
US$450 million for 1975). The current account deficit is estimated at 3.5
percent of GDP. The 1975 program is thus designed to increase public and
private investment and public consumption whilst reducing private consumption
by means of taxation and a voluntary increase in private savings. From an
equity standpoint the recent tax measures are progressive. The 1975 program
is thus consistent with the government's overall economic objectives, and if
successfully implemented, should increase the productive capacity of the eco-
nomy whilst furthering the cause of distributive justice.
13.       On December 31, 1973, Mexico's outstanding disbursed public debt of
more than one year was US$5.2 billion. Net medium and long term public bor-
rowing in 1974 of US$2.3 billion reflects heavy reliance on external as well
as internal capital to finance the fiscal deficit and some borrowing - as in
1973 - to offset private capital movements.
14.       Annex I, Page 4, shows that 41.3 percent of public external capital
contracted in 1968-72 was borrowed from private banks and that international
organizations accounted for the next largest share (22.2 percent). The World
Bank accounted for 14.7 percent of all commitments. New debt contracted in
1974 however was obtained at higher interest rates and on shorter maturities
than in the recent past, in the light of a severe contraction in international
capital markets.



-5-
15.       During 1975 it is expected that net public external borrowing of
more than one year will be of the order of US$2.4 billion, which would amount
to 3.1 percent of estimated GDP compared with 3.6 percent in 1974. This
level of indebtedness is consistent with Mexico's projected future capacity
to service the interest and amortization payments, taking account of the ex-
pected growth of real exports in the medium term. The behavior of petroleum
production and exports is an important element in these projections. The
size of Mexico's oil reserves has not yet been determined and published
estimates differ widely from the official ones. However, taking account of
the range of available reserve estimates, as well as of prospective avail-
abilities of financial and physical investments in the sector, the outlook
for production and exports in 1975-80 appears to be good. After allowing for
increases in domestic consumption, exportable surpluses can be expected to rise
each year. On present expectations, by 1980, the net export surplus of crude
and petroleum products could be around US$1,000 million equivalent. Mexico's
debt service ratio was 24.5 percent in 1973. The estimate for 1974 is 18.0
percent. Assuming that the average terms of future debt improve slightly by
comparison with those recently obtained, the debt service ratio is expected
to be lower than 25 percent through 1980. The Bank's share in public debt
outstanding and disbursed at the end of 1973 was approximately 15.3 percent
and its share in debt service payments was about 7.7 percent. These shares
are not expected to change significantly in the remainder of the decade.
16.       Mexico is thus creditworthy for borrowing on conventional terms
provided the government exercises due restraint in monetary, credit and fiscal
policies; its recent actions in designing the 1975 economic program suggest
it intends to do so.
17.       In order to meet its financing needs to assure continued growth with
equity in the future, Mexico will have to strengthen its fiscal effort and to
supplement that effort with substantial external borrowing. Given that the
country's diversified industrial structure is capable of supplying a good
part of its capital goods requirements, some local cost financing by external
agencies is necessary.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN MEXICO
18.       With the US$50 million loan for Integrated Rural Development Project
I signed on November 15, 1974, the Bank has made 38 loans to Mexico for a
total of US$1888 million net of cancellations. At the end of March 1975 the
Bank held US$1540 million, including US$561 million not yet disbursed. Two
more loans, both in agriculture and totalling US$260 million, were approved by
the Executive Directors earlier this month. Most of the Bank loans have been
made for power, industry, transport, water supply, roads and agriculture.
The execution of Bank financed projects has, on the whole, been satisfactory.



- 6 -
However, financial performance criteria have not been met under the Fourth
Power Sector loan. The matter is being discussed with the Government and
remedial measures are expected shortly.
19.       IFC has made twelve investment commitments in Mexico, amounting to
US$54.3 million, of which as of March 31, 1975, US$36.3 million had been
sold, repaid or cancelled. The balance, US$18.0 million held bv the Corpora-
tion, consists of US$15.9 million in loans and US$2.1 million in equity.
Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans and IFC commitments as of
March 31, 1975 and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
20.       The main objectives of Bank lending in Mexico are:    (i) to support
policies and programs leading to a wider distribution of the benefits of
economic growth; (ii) strengthen policies and programs leading to continued
economic growth, both by investing in projects that directly or indirectly
make significant contributions to output and employment and by supporting
changes that will make institutions function more effectively; (iii) help
resolve critical adjustment problems that emerge from Mexico's continued
growth; and (iv) transfer sufficient resources to complement Mexico's quite
appreciable domestic savings and provide the necessary funds for economic
and social investments in a framework of internal and external financial
stability.
21.       The composition of recent and prospective Bank lending to Mexico
follows the evolution of the Government's and the Bank's perception of Mexico's
development needs, both in terms of their sectoral mix and in terms of policy
emphasis. Thus, the Las Truchas steel mill, for which the Bank made a loan in
FY74, is expected not only to further Mexico's industrial growth in an effi-
cient manner but also to support the government's program of industrial de-
centralization. Similarly, the Airports Development Project (FY74) is designed
to promote rapid and reliable domestic long-distance passenger transportation
and to contribute to the government's policy of regional integration. The
earlier (FY73) Mexico City Water Supply Project also pursues multiple objec-
tives. Responding to the need for expanding urban infrastructure, particularly
in low income areas, it has helped create a specialized institution for effi-
cient management of scarce water resources that cuts across existing functional
and administrative boundaries.
22.       In view of the difficult structural problems of Mexico's agricul-
ture and the sector's crucial importance to the country's further development,
the Bank has substantially expanded and diversified its support for agricul-
ture. Consistent with the overall framework of country and sector objectives,
a three-tier approach is being followed. First, Bank support is aimed at
expanding and strengthening irrigation and agricultural credit programs so as
to meet the demands of a rapidly growing population more adequately and to
generate foreign exchange for rising import requirements. Second, to assist
the government in its efforts to raise the incomes of the rural poor and improve
their standard of living through a combination of directly productive, productive
support and social infrastructure investment. Third, to strengthen Mexico's
institutional capability to use scarce agricultural resources more efficiently.



- 7 -
23.       The Bajo Rio Bravo/Bajo San Juan Irrigation Project presented to
the Executive Directors on Mtay 8, 1975 is one of the most important under-
takings of the present administration to bring agricultural production back
in line with domestic and foreign demand. It will also serve to improve the
incomes of a substantial number of poor farmers. At the same time, the
Papaloapan Integrated Rural Develonment Project approved last fall, and the
Second Integrated Rural Development Project (PIDER) presented along with the
Bajo Rio Bravo/Bajo San Juan Project, both have their primary focus on improv-
ing the living standards of the rural poor through integrated, multi-sectoral
development. 1We are also exploring the possibilities of assisting the govern-
ment in expanding agricultural education and in developing Mexico's lagoon
fisheries. In addition, we plan to support the formulation and imnlementation
of an applied research program for the tropical Gulf zone, an operation that
would lay the foundation for the future development of tropical agriculture
for which a substantial potential exists. The Bank is also helping to strengthen
MIexico's resource management through the National Water Study which will provide
the basis for a rational water development policy. Finally, we are exploring
the possibilities of reinforcing the government's efforts to foster regional
development and industrial deconcentration.
24.       The present fertilizer project will be a valuable addition to Mlexico's
manufacturing sector. Through import-substitution and its potential for ex-
ports it will contribute to reducing the country's trade gap; it will, at the
same time, supplement the Bank's involvement in the agricultural sector by
helping to assure the availability of a vital input at stable prices. The
proposed locations of the project plants, away from the major industrial
centers, would further support the government's policy of regional industrial
decentralization.
PART III - THE FERTILIZER SECTOR IN MEXICO
General
25.       Since assumption of office in 1970, the present administration in
Mlexico has demonstrated its commitment to a new policy of agricultural and
rural development. The more important aspects of its comprehensive and
generally wrell-designed strategy are: (i) promulgation of new legislation
aiming at a more rational and equitable resource utilization: (ii) reform
and strengthening of the agricultural support services, technical and organ-
izational assistance, credit and marketing; (iii) expansion of irrigation
and irrigation rehabilitation investment programs; (iv) creation of the
National Water Plan to formulate comprehensive water management policies;
(v) implementation of integrated rural development program; and (vi) institu-
tionalization of the coordinating mechanisms among government agencies to
facilitate such programs.



- 8 -
26.       These new directions in the government policy have been in response
to its awareness of the increasing gap in living standards between the urban
and rural population and the disturbing trend in agricultural production dur-
ing the last decade. The agricultural sector had a growth record of more than
5 percent per annum over the period 1940 - 1965. In that period it managed to
satisfy the demand of a rapidly growing population and to contribute to Mexico's
exports. Since 1965, however, the average annual rate of growth has only been
2.5 percent, one percentage point less than the population growth rate and only
half the rate of growth of effective demand for foodstuffs. Given the limita-
tions on Mexico's physical resource endowment, growth in agricultural produc-
tion in the short- and medium-term will primarily be a function of progress in
utilizing more effectively resources already under exploitation. Adequate use
of fertilizers will necessarily play an important role in this process.
Fertilizer Demand and Production
27.       At current levels of fertilizer consumption, Mexico, with 29 kilo-
grams per hectare (ha.), has an average rate of application well below the
world average (50 kilograms per ha.), even if twice the average of the devel-
oping countries.   The average for Mexico, however, masls a wide variation in
rates of fertilizer application, which range from near optimum levels in flat
irrigated areas in the northwest to none in large rain-fed areas, and points
to substantial untapped sources of consumption. Thus, out of the total cropped
area of 15 - 16 million ha. in Mlexico, onlv 5.7 million ha. currently receive
fertilizers while it is estimated that 57 percent of the rest, another 5.7
million ha., should also be fertilized. Consumption of fertilizer has been
increasing at an average annual rate of 10 percent between 1963 - 1973, rising
from a level of 279,000 nutrient tons in 1963 to 751,000 nutrient tons in
1973. The 1973 consumption level consisted of 75 percent nitrogen, 21 percent
phosphate and 4 percent potash. Consumption of nitrogen in that year is
broken down into 32 percent ammonia for direct application as fertilizer,
26 percent ammonium sulfate and 23 percent urea. The balance represents
amonium nitrate and complex fertilizers.
28.       The effective demand for solid fertilizers in Mexico has been
almost wholly satisfied by its well developed fertilizer industry underpinned
by substantial indigenous reserves of natural gas. At the end of 1973 Mexico
had proven reserves of natural gas estimated at 11 trillion standard cubic
feet, which have been further augmented by new discoveries in Chiapas and
Tabasco in 1974. The Government has budgeted US$248 million equivalent to
develop these finds by 1976.    Based on the availability of natural gas,
domestic production of finished fertilizer has grown at an average rate of
13.2 percent in 1963 - 1973 and the 1973 production level of 748,000 nutrient
tons practically equalled the consumption in that year. Nevertheless, in terms
of finished products, Mexico still imports some supplies of nitrogenous ferti-
lizers and its entire requirements of potash, which are partially offset by
its urea exports averaging 24,500 nutrient tons annually since 1968. The
country's principal imports supporting its fertilizer industry, however,
remain phosphate rock as a raw, material for phosphate, and ammonia for direct
application as fertilizer and as an intermediate product for further processing.



-9-
29.       Manufacture of ammonia, considered a basic petrochemical, is the
exclusive right of Petroleos Mexicanos (PEMEX), a publicly owned agency with
a legal monopoly for the exploration and exploitation of the country's hydro-
carbon resources and the production of basic petrochemicals. Pemex is cur-
rently operating 4 ammonia plants with a rated capacity of 472,000 nutrient
tons per year (TPY) and is achieving a satisfactory capacity utilization of
over 90 percent. Since the mid-60s, as a result of Government policy to
rationalize and consolidate the fertilizer sector, manufacture of fertilizer
end-products is the responsibility of another publicly owned agency, Guanos
y Fertilizantes de Mexico (GUANOMEX). The only exceptions to this arrangement
are supplies of ammonium sulphate obtained as a by-product in the domestic
production of caprolactam and steel and triple superphosphate produced by
Fertilizantes Fosfatados Mexicanos (FFM), a private sector enterprise, which
is also the country's principal producer of phosphoric acid based mainly on
imported phosphate rock.
30.       Guanomex currently operates several small chemical plants producing
a range of insecticides and other chemicals and 16 fertilizer plants with
a total installed capacity of 437,300 TPY of nitrogen and 122,200 TPY of phos-
phate. The manufacturing units are well run, giving an average capacity
utilization in 1973 of 93 percent in terms of phosphate and 80 percent in
terms of nitrogen. The lower average for nitrogen units is symptomatic of
aging equipment in some of the earlier plants and shortage of ammonia supplies
and obscures the satisfactory operating results achieved by the four large
scale fertilizer units commissioned by Guanomex in the last six years.
31.       Consumption projections of nitrogen through 1985 prepared by
Guanomex suggest an average annual growth of around 9 percent. This estimate
is based on a set of regression equations fitted to data for fertilizer con-
sumption in the last twenty years and approximates the demand forecast derived
from the model on Mexican agriculture jointly developed by the Bank and the
Government of Mexico. The model does not, however, take into account the im-
proved role of extension services and other promotional measures which could
result in higher fertilizer consumption, mainly by small farmers (see para-
graph 32 below). A well designed credit and extension program could raise
fertilizer consumption to an annual rate of 11 percent. However, even dis-
regarding such changes likely to result in more extensive fertilizer use, the
consumption of nitrogen is expected to rise from 560,000 tons in 1973 to about
one million tons in 1980, going up to 1.5 million tons in 1985. The 1980 proj-
ected level of nitrogen consumption includes 355,000 tons of urea and 261,000
tons of ammonia for direct application as fertilizer. The overall forecast
requirement of 1.3 million tons of nitrogen in ammonia in 1980, including 1.0
million tons required for processing into solid fertilizers, will be met by
the existing and the three new Pemex plants either currently under construction
or in an advanced stage of planning. The two urea plants included in the
project will, by 1978, increase the existing urea capacity of 205,000 tons of
nitrogen by another 379,500 tons. On the basis of this production capacity,
the estimated production in 1980 will be around 507,000 nutrient tons. This
output, in addition to satisfying the country's conservatively estimated



- 10 -
urea requirements, may generate an exportable surplus averaging about 120,000
tons of nitrogen per annum between 1979-1982.    The surplus is likely to be
marketed in Central and South America and most of it will go to El Salvador,
Costa Rica and Guatemala for distribution in those countries through Guanomex's
subsidiaries. Urea and ammonia fertilizer production and consumption, in the
past and as projected in the future, appear below:

Fertilizer Distribution
32.       A Government Decree in 1965 gave Guanomex exclusive rights to import
and market all fertilizers in the domestic market. Exports are handled both
by Guanomex and FFM, although the latter enterprise is restricted to exporting
its own surplus of phosphoric acid. To achieve countrywide distribution of
its products and flexibility in its sales strategy, Guanomex relies on four
main marketing channels ranging from dealerships at one end to direct involve-
ment of the official agricultural banking system at the other. Around 57 per-
cent of all fertilizer is sold through more than 200 dealerships, mainly pri-
vate enterprises but including cooperative organizations and three public
sector agencies. By 1972 the official banks were distributing as much as 21
percent of the product, 9 percent went to agricultural "uniones" or non-profit
private credit and input distributing associations of farmers, 8 percent was
sold directly to sugar mills and the balance, 5 percent, was exported. Amongst
its dealers, Guanomex proposes to make increasing use of the Compania Nacional
de Subsistencias Populares (CONASUPO), a public sector agency organized,
inter alia, to provide crucial agricultural inputs to low income farmers in
backward rural communities through its growing net-work of sales outlets.
Notwithstanding the present extensive arrangements, adequate and timely avail-
ability of fertilizers, particularly among low income farmers and ejidatarios,
remains a problem, a conclusion strengthened by a recent Mexican study which
indicates that not more than 22 percent of the farmers in the country actually
use fertilizers.



33.       To rectify the situation, Guanomex has agreed to undertake a dis-
tribution study to be completed within a year of the signing of the proposed
loan, which will specially focus on the requirements and availability of
fertilizers to low-income farmers as well as their credit needs and provision
of related extension services. The scope of this study will also include the
investigation of the optimum levels of fertilizer application in each region
related to soil conditions and cropping patterns, particularly in the rain-fed
areas, which mostly support the rural poor. The terms of reference of this
study as well as its conclusions and the timing for their implementation will
be agreed with the Bank. A second study, to be carried out in parallel, will
investigate the optimum level of finished product inventory Guanomex should
carry to ensure the timely availability of fertilizer in relation to its
working capital requirements, including freight and storage costs (Section
3.05, Loan Agreement).
PART IV - THE PROJECT
34.       The proposed loan will be the Bank's first to finance a fertilizer
project in Mexico. The project was appraised in September 1974 and the
appraisal report (No. 734-ME, dated May 5, 1975) is being distributed to
the Executive Directors separately. Negotiations were held in Wasnington in
April 1975. The Government of Mexico was represented by Mr. Jesus Rodriquez
of the Ministry of Finance and the Borrowers by Messrs. German Sandoval
(NAFINSA) and Ernesto Badillo Navarrete (Guanomex). Annex III contains a
loan and project summary.
Project Description
35.       The project, to be implemented by Guanomex and consisting of three
sub-projects, is expected to add 379,500 tons per year (TPY) of urea in nutri-
ent terms, raising the total capacity of nitrogen fertilizers in Mexico to
858,400 TPY of nutrient. It will also increase the country's production capac-
ity of parathion, an insecticide, by 2,500 TPY. The project will have the fol-
lowing components:
1.   A 1,000 tons per day (TPD) urea plant (151,800 TPY of nutrient),
which will be an addition to the existing fertilizer complex at
Bajio, 3 kilometers from Salamanca in the State of Guanajuato and
is referred to as Bajio II plant;
2.   A 1,500 TPD urea plant (227,700 TPY of nutrient) to be located at
Coatzacoalcos in the State of Veracruz and to be known as the Istmo
plant;
3.   Expansion of an existing insecticide plant, forming part of a chemi-
cal unit in Salamanca, by adding a further 10 TPD (2,500 TPY) of
manufacturing capacity of parathion to the existing capacity of
7,500 TPY.



- 12 -
36.       The existing plants of the Bajio unit produce urea and ammonium
sulphate, drawing their requirements of feedstock from an adjacent 250 TPD
ammonia plant owned by Pemex. To meet the ammonia requirements of the Bajio
II, Pemex has another 900 T}'D ammonia plant under construction in the vicinity.
Land and infrastructure to cater for the needs of Bajio II are available at
the Bajio unit.
37.       The chosen location for the Istmo plant on the Pajaritos inlet, near
the Coatzacoalcos port on the Gulf of Mexico and adjacent to existing facili-
ties of Pemex and FFl, already has good road and rail communications serving
it.  Ammonia as feedstock for the proposed plant will be supplied by Pemex
from two 1500 TPD plants in the neighbourhood, one of which has recently
been completed while the other one is in an advanced stage of construction.
W4ith these plants, Guanomex should have no problem in receiving its require-
ment of ammonia for its Istmo unit.   Assurances have nevertheless been obtained
from the Government to provide Guanomex with its feedstocl. and raw material
requirements for the project as well as for its existing plants (Section 3.03(b)
of the Cuarantee Agreement).
38.       The Salamanca unit comprises a 60 TPD caustic soda and chlorine
plant, a 25 TPD DDT plant, small BHC and toxaphene plants and a 25 TPD para-
thion plant. The proposed expansion of the parathion plant will coincide
with a phased reduction in the production of DDT. Although parathion is more
toxic than DDT, unlike DDT it is rapidly degradable and is therefore in grow-
ing demand for ecological considerations. As parathion is expected to substi-
tute for DDT in Mexico, its imarketability is assured.
Project Implementation
39.       The Project will be executed and operated by Guanomex, a public sec-
tor corporation established in 1943 and in virtual control of all solid fertil-
lizer production in Mexico.   A reference has already been made to Guanomex's
current ownership of chemical and fertilizer plants, total fertilizer produc-
tion capacity and its recent experience in implementing and operating large-
scale fertilizer units (see paragraph 30). The proposed urea plants will be
based on modern, commercially proven technology. Experienced international
engineering companies in association with local engineering firms will be
responsible for design and detailed engineering of these plants and will pro-
vide guarantees on project completion schedules and plant performance levels.
Guanomex has already submitted to the Bank an implementation plan and a proj-
ect execution schedule, which have been found satisfactory. Civil works and
construction of the urea plants will be carried out by local firms.    The para-
thion expansion will be executed by a local engineering firm and will be based
on the process design and guidance of the licensor, Stauffer, U.S.A. The pro-
ject plants, including the insecticide plant expansion, are expected to be
completed by July 1978.
40.        Guanomex, in conformity with Bank procedures, has already contracted
the services of Foster WTheeler Energgy Company (US) and Atlas Foster Wheeler
ITexicana to undertake the design and engineering of Bajio II. The engineering



- 13 -
firms for the Istmo plant will be appointed soon. Guanomex's established re-
cord of project implementation is based upon the high quality of its managerial
resources and technical expertise and the company's project team is considered
fully competent to supervise the implementation of the project.
41.       There are no constraints on the availability of utilities at any of
the plant locations. Water is freely available and electricity will be sup-
plied by the Government-owned Comision Federal de Electricidad.    As the IstTw
plant will be at a new site, it will require added facilities such as a jetty
for shipping urea, a polyethylene bag manufacturing unit and new office build-
ings. Provision for these facilities has been made in the capital costs of the
project. In view of its considerable operating experience, Guanomex already
possesses competent and technically skilled staff and operators who, together
with the contracted engineering firms, will provide training for new staff as
required, to onerate the project plants.
42.       The urea plants will be designed with minimum emission levels of
effluents followning standards acceptable to the Bank. In well designed plants
gaseous and liquid effluents present virtually no problem. Dust dispersion
is, however, a source of concern in plants using a prilling toxwer and conse-
quently many U.S. plants have switched from prilling to granulation to mini-
mize this problem. Guanomex will investigate the viability of this approach
in the designing of the Istmo plant, and is considering measures to reduce
pollution from the operation of a prilling tower in Bajio II under the direc-
tion of its engineering consultants.
43.       The dangers in the manufacture and use of parathion are primarily
related to safety rather than evironmental impact. Guanomex has already im-
plemented stringent safety regulations in its existing parathion plant (which
will he expanded under this project) and its safety record to date is unblem-
ished. Guanonex has, however, undertaken to continue monitoring its safetv
measures regularly and to improve them where necessary. The assurances
obtained on pollution control and safety are incorporated in Sections 3.04(b)
and 4.04 of the Loan Agreement.
Capital Costs and Financing Plan
44.       Total project cost, including interest during construction, is
estimated at US$150.2 million equivalent of which US$53.5 million is in
foreign exchange. A breakdown of the total capital cost as well as the
cost of the three sub-projects appears at Annex III. Physical contingencies
are provided for at 11 percent of the base cost estimates. Provision for
price escalation on total cost, including physical contingencies, is based
on escalation rates of 12 percent for 1975, 10 percent for 1976 and 8 percent
thereafter for foreign and internationally bid equipment costs. Similarly,
local currency costs are escalated by 16 percent for 1975, 14 percent for
1976 and 12 percent per annum for the subsequent years.
45.       In addition to the proposed Bank loan of US$50 million, the
financing plan for the project provides for an equity contribution of US$60.0
million equivalent (Section 2.02(a) - Guarantee Agreement), and US$40.2



- 14 -
million equivalent in long-term loans from foreign and local banks. The
proposed Bank loan of US$50 million to Guanomex would finance 33 percent of
the total project cost.   In addition to the 8-1/2 percent per annum interest
payable to the Bank, the company would pay NAFINSA a fee of 3-1/2 percent
per annum on the outstanding amount, thereby raising the total cost of Bank
funds to Guanomex to 12 percent per annum. The Government of Mexico, for
its part, has undertaken to provide finances covering any cost overrun and
shortfalls in project funds to allow completion of the project in accordance
with the agreed schedule (Section 2.02(b) of the Guarantee Agreement).
Disbursement and Procurement.
46.       The proceeds of the proposed loan would be disbursed against the
cost of imported equipment, materials and spare parts (US$23.8 million),
the ex-factory cost of equipment and spares expected to be won by Mexican
suppliers through international competitive bidding (US$9.2 million, of which
the local cost component will be around US$5.0 million), and the bulk of the
foreign exchange costs of license fees, design engineering, erection and
supervision (US$7.5 million). Interest during construction on the Bank loan
would be US$5.6 million, and US$3.9 million would be unallocated primarily to
meet the foreign exchange portion of physical contingencies. The Bank loan
would be less than the estimated total foreign exchange financing requirements
of the project and the Government will defray US$8.5 million of foreign
exchange costs from its own resources.
47.       Of the US$33 million equivalent to be disbursed for equipment, inter-
national competitive bidding would be applied for the procurement of equip-
ment estimated to cost US$27.6 million equivalent. The usual 15 percent
domestic preference or the prevailing import duty in Mexico, whichever is
lower, would be granted to Mexican manufacturers for the purpose of evaluat-
ing international bids. The balance of US$5.4 million equivalent includes,
(i) small items, costing less than US$50,000, up to an aggregate value of
US$1.0 million, which would be purchased directly from manufacturers and
local representatives of foreign suppliers on the basis of suitability,
availability and price considerations following approval by the Bank of the
list of such items, and (ii) essential proprietary equipment and critical
items in limited supply - costing approximately US$4.4 million - to be pro-
cured after bidding from a geographically representative list of qualified
suppliers. Procurement under the latter procedure has already been approved
by the Bank in order to maintain the schedule for Bajio II. As a result,
orders for proprietary equipment and critical items were placed last January
and an engineering firm, selected in accordance with Bank Guidelines, was
contracted at the same time. To cover expenditures on these items likely to
have been incurred between January and the time of loan signing, retroactive
financing up to US$3.6 million is proposed.
Fertilizer Prices
48.       As part of its policy to stimulate agricultural production, ferti-
lizer prices in Mexico - including that of ammonia. both as feedstock and



- 15 -
as a direct fertilizer - are controlled by the Government and are pegged
at levels much below those currently prevailing in the world market. Towards
the end of 1974, urea and ammonia were selling at US$122 per ton and US$131
per ton respectively in Mexico against international prices ranging between
US$300 and US$370 per ton. The substantially lower than international price
of urea is based on a relatively low transfer price (US$42 per ton) of its
principal feedstock (ammonia) that Guanomex pays Pemex, which in turn reflects
the low cost of natural gas and Pemex's technical efficiency in producing
ammonia. Further, to insulate Guanomex from the high costs of imported ammo-
nia, which is mostly used for direct application, the Government has appro-
priated US$40 million equivalent to make good to the company the "loss"
between the imported price and the domestic sale price. Guanomex is not
expected to apply for such compensatory funds from 1978 when Mexico is likely
to become self-sufficient in the production of ammonia. By that time the
world prices of fertilizers are also projected to be in line with the prices
in Mexico. However, in the meantime, an understanding has been reached with
the Government to take all necessary action to allow Guanomex, operating
efficiently, to obtain revenues sufficient to cover, at all times, its operat-
ing costs and debt service commitments as well as to enable it to earn a
reasonable return on its invested capital (Section 3.03(a) of the Guarantee
Agreement).
Financial Covenants
49.       To ensure the financial viability of the company, in addition to
the safeguard referred to in the preceding paragraph, it has, inter alia,
been agreed that the company would not exceed a debt/equity ratio of 60:40;
that it would at all times, after the completion of the project, maintain a
current ratio of 1.3:1; that it would not make any cash dividend payment or
pre-pay any debt other than the Bank's, unless after such payments it can
maintain a minimum current ratio of 1.5:1; and that it would incur term-debts
only if it can maintain a minimum debt service coverage of 1.4 (Sections
5.06(a), 5.06(b) and 5.06(c) of the Loan Agreement).
Economic Benefits
50.       The financial projections for the project anticipate increase in the
cost of ammonia to Guanomex from US$42 to US$48 per ton in 1974 dollars and
assume the domestic price of urea and parathion at US$122 and US$1,390 per ton
respectively, again in 1974 dollars. The prices assumed for the export of
urea are those recently projected by the Bank. On this basis, the financial
rate of return on the project is estimated at 20.3 percent before tax and 14.5
percent after tax. A sensitivity analysis has been made which takes different
variables into account; the rate of return remains acceptable under all reason-
able assumptions. The project is also expected to have a beneficial impact on
the overall profitability of the company, raising the return on equity from 4
percent in 1973/1974 to 9.1 percent in constant 1974 dollars in 1980/1981 - the
year in which the project should achieve its maximum level of production.



- 16 -
51.       Long-term international prices per ton of urea and ammonia are pro-
jected to be US$130 c.i.f. Mexican port and US$88 delivered at factory site
respectively. For urea projected to be exported between 1979 - 1982, esti-
mated f.o.b. US Gulf Prices have been used in the calculation of the project
benefits. On this basis, the project's economic rate of return is 24 percent.
This rate is highly sensitive to variations in the price of urea, but even
a 10 percent decline in that price still leaves an acceptable return of 17.8
percent. A 20 percent increase in the cost of ammonia has a lesser impact,
lowering the return to 19.2 percent. Even with a 15 percent capital cost
overrun the project would achieve a return of 21.2 percent. Thus, the
sensitivity analysis indicates that except for an unlikely combination of
substantial cost overruns and depressed urea prices over long periods, the
economic rate of return will be satisfactory.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
52.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and Guanos y Fertilizantes
de Mexico, S. A. and Nacional Financiera, S. A.; the draft Guarantee Agreement
between United Mexican States and the Bank; the Report of the Committee pro-
vided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the
text of a Resolution approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately.
53.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
54.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECJTION 1/
Ln. No. 527    Fourth Irrigation Project:   $25 Million Loan of January 26,
1968; Closing Date: June 30, 1975.
Estimated project costs have risen by about 36 percent. Pro-
ject benefits will be higher than estimated at appraisal, but
probably not enough to fully offset the cost increases. The
economic rate of return from the project is however expected
to remain acceptable. The original Closing Date (June 30, 1975)
has been extended by one year to enable completion of works.
Ln. No. 695     Fourth Road Prolect:  $21.8 Million Loan of June 26, 1970;
Closing Date: June 30, 1975.
Five roads included in the project have been completed and
opened to traffic. The remaining six roads are expected to be
completed by mid-1976, or about one-and-a-half years behind
schedule because of initial delays in budgetary allocations.
There have been cost increases in four of the project roads,
mainly because of design revisions and inflation. The
resulting cost overruns will be fully met by the Government.
Ln. No. 793     Zihuatanejo Tourism Project:   $22 Million Loan of
January 22, 1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1975.
All project-related construction in the Ixtapa tourism zone is
expected to be completed by mid-1975, which should coincide with
the completion of the international airport at Zihuatanejo and
the first hotel in Ixtapa. A Trust Fund was recently organized
for the provision of urban infrastructure in the town of
Zihuatanejo and the necessary works have been undertaken since
December 1974. It is now estimated that all works related to
this project will be completed by end-1975, by which time 526
hotel rooms should also be available in the tourism area.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution and,in particular, to report any
problems which are being encountered and the action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read in that sense, and with the understanding that
they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and
weaknesses in project execution.



ANNEX II
Page 4 of 6
Ln. No. 820     Ports Project:  $20 Million Loan of May 17, 1972; Closing
Date: June 30, 1976.
Despite some initial delays in the preparation of tender docu-
ments and processing of disbursement applications the execution
of this project: is on the whole proceeding satisfactorily.
Studies for new port tariffs have been completed and revised
tariffs introduced on March 7, 1975. These revised tariffs
and other ancillary measures proposed, will substantially meet
the loan requirements.
Ln. No. 824     Industrial Equipment Fund (FONEI) Project:   $85 Million
Loan of June 2, 1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1975.
The loan became effective on October 12, 1972. After a slow
start due to organizational problems, FONEI estimates to com-
mit the Bank funds by the second quarter of 1975 and has
recently been appraised for a possible second loan by the Bank.
Ln. No. 825     Second Railway Project:  $75 Million Loan of June 2, 1972;
Closing Date: December 31, 1975.
Due to increased costs and delays in implementing recommended
tariff increase, the financial position of the railways did not
meet the agreed targets established in the loan documents. New
tariffs were introduced on January 1, 1975. Execution of this
project is now proceeding satisfactorily.
Ln. No. 834     Fourth Power Sector Program:   $125 Million Loan of June 23,
1972; Closing Date: June 30, 1975.
The construction program has been delayed by over a year except
for frequency unification, which is ahead of schedule. Recently
the borrower has tried to improve its overall construction per-
formance by strengthening its construction management and the
results in the last six months have been encouraging. The sec-
tor's financial performance was unsatisfactory in 1974 and the
Government is considering remedial measures to improve it.
Ln. No. 909    Mexico City Water Supply Project:    $90 Million Loan of
June 18, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1977.
Physical execution of the project is progressing satisfactorily.
However, disbursements from the loan account have been delayed
due to unresolved administrative arrangements between the
Mexico Valley Water Commission (the executing agency) and the
Federal Government. It is expected that disbursements from the
loan account will soon increase substantially reflecting the
progress of the project. A sales contract between the Water



ANNEX II
Page 5 of 6
Commission and the State of Mexico, which is a condition for
disbursement of funds aggregating over $40 million, continues
to be under negotiation. Meanwhile, interim arrangements have
been worked out for the sale of water in a limited number of
communities within the State of Mexico.
Ln. No. 910     Fourth Livestock and Agriculture Project:   $110 Million
Loan of June 18, 1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1978.
Commitments and disbursements of sub-loans are progressing
satisfactorily and are ahead of schedule. The amount under the
Low Income Producers Sub-Project is almost fully committed and
under the General Sub-Project is expected to be fully committed
by March 1975. Increased discount rates to the participating
banks and higher on-lending rates to borrowers under the Gen-
eral Sub-Project are being proposed to meet rising costs of
loan administration.
Ln. No. 934    Las Truchas Steel Project:   $70 Million Loan of
September 12, 1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1977.
Execution of the project and procurement of the equipment
financed by the loan are progressing as scheduled. Cost in-
creases are, however, expected due to world-wide inflation,
which will be fully met by the Government.
Ln. No. 968     Seventh Highway Project:  $90 Million Loan of March 1,
1974; Closing Date: December 31, 1978.
This loan became effective on May 29, 1974. The engineering
for the six roads included in the project, for which detailed
engineering had not been completed at the time of Board pre-
sentation, has now been completed. The economic justification
of the roads concerned has been confirmed on the basis of final
cost estimates. Construction works on two road sectors have
recently started.
Ln. No. 969     Rio Panuco Irrigation Project:   $77 Million Loan of March 1_
1974; Closing Date: December 31, 1980.
The loan became effective on May 29, 1974. Execution of the
project is progressing satisfactorily.
Ln. No. 970     Rio Sinaloa Irrigation Project:   $47 Million Loan of
March 1, 1974; Closing Date: December 31, 1980.
The loan became effective on May 29, 1974. Execution of the
project is progressing satisfactorily.

ject is at an early stage of exectution. The first grcup of con-
tracts for this project was awarded in lovember-December 1974,
