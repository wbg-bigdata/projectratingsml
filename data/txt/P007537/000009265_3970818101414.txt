PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
MEXICO - FERTILIZER I PROJECT
(LOAXN 1112-ME)
PREFACE
1.        This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) on the Mexico-
Fertilizer I Project for which a Bank loan in the amount of USS50.0 million
was approved on May 22, 1975 to Nacional Financiera S.A. (NAFINSA) and
Guanos y Fertilizantes de Mexico S.A. (GUANOMEX).  Later on in January
1978, Fertilizantes Mexicanos S.A. (FERTIMEX) was formed through a merger
of GUANOMEX and another fertilizer company Fertilizantes Fusfatados
Mexicanos.
2.        Following the closing of the loan in June 30, 1982, IND staff
visited Mexico for preparation of the PCR and had discussions with the
Government, NAFINSA and FERTIMEX, the company responsible for project
implementation.   The report reflects findings of this mission as well as a
review of project files and related documents. An English translation of
Government comments on the dr3ft PCR is attached as Annex 7.
3.        This project has not been audited by the Operations Evaluation
Department.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
MEXICO - FERTILIZER I PROJECT
(LOAN 1112-ME)
HIGHLIGHTS
1.        Mexico has promoted agriculture production through better
irrigation, research and extension work and by making agricultural credits
and modern inputs including fertilizers available to farmers. In this
context the Government has encouraged domestic production of fertilizers to
ensure reliable (and at reasonable price) supply of fertilizer to
farmers. (para 1.01)
2.        In pursuit of this policy GUANOMEX, a state owned company, was
formed in 1942, to handle fertilizer production and distribution. In 1978
GUANOMEX was later merged with other fertilizer company to form FERTIMEX
which today operates 13 fertilizer plants in Mexico and owns all of
Mexico's fertilizer capacity except for ammonia which is produced by PEMEX,
another state corporation. The Fertilizer I Project was appraised in
September 1974 following a request from NAFINSA, a state development
finance institution. The Board approved a loan of US$50 million to NAFINSA
and GUANOMEX (later FERTIMEX) guaranteed by the Government at an interest
rate of 8.5% p.a. with a maturity of 14 years, including a grace period of
3.5 years. NAFINSA charges FERTIMEX a 3.5% p.a. fee on the outstanding
amount. The loan became effective on July 30, 1975. (para 1.02)
3.        The project comprises the following three sub-projects:
(para 2.04)
(i) The Bajio sub-project 330,000 ton per year (tpy) urea plant
at Bajio;
(ii) The Istmo sub-project of 495,000 tpy urea plant at
Pajaritos; and
(iii) The Salamanca sub-project of a 2,500 tpy expansion and
modernization of an existing 7,500 tpy parathion insecticide
plant at Salamanca.
4.        Project facilities were mechanically completed and started-up in
June 1982, 37 months behind schedule. Commissioning and start-up of the
sub-projects w!ere carried out smoothly, although the Istmo plant has not
undergone a formal acceptance test. However, since the Istmo plant has
operated for more than 30 days at a capacity above 80%, it can be
considered as completed. All plants have demonstrated their ability to
reach and sustain production at design capacity. The main change in
Project scope resulted from FERTIMEX decision to build a twin 1,500 tpd
urea plant at the Istmo site which in turn required modification of
off-site arrangements causing delay in project completion. Frequent
management and organization changes in FERTIMEX also caused unnecessary
delays in project implementation. Bank advice to form a "Project task
force" was not followed due to variou axternal and internal reasons.
(paras 3.01 - 3.04 and 4.01)



-v-
5.        The Project required about 480 staff of which 171 was trained by
FERTIMEX the remaining transferred from other plants. FERTIMEX staff had
overall responsibility for general design and supervision of the Project.
however, because of organizational inadequacy, the project lacked effective
control of scheduling and costing. With some exceptions, performance of
fore;gn firms which were associated with local engineering firms, was
ge.;erally satisfactory. The local firm, which provided engineeriug
services for the Istmo sub-project faced serious problems. (paras 3.05 -
3.08)
6.        In procurement FERTIMEX followed generally acceptable procedures
for construction, equipment, erection and civil works. Equipment and
materials were mostly procured through International Competitive Bidding
(ICB) in accordance with Bank guidelines. Some problems encountered in
procurement were due to overall country conditions. (paras 3.09 - 3.11)
7.        Total cost of the project at appraisal was US$150.2 million.  At
project completion the actual cost was US$318.8 million representing a 112%
cost over-run mainly due to: (i) project implementation delays, (ii)
changes in project scope, (iii) underestimated civil works in the Istmo
sub-project, and (iv) currency realignments. Total financing required of
US$318.8 million was met with equity provided by the Government through
NAFINSA (46%), Bank loan (16%) and other long-term borrowings (38%).
(para 3.20)
8.        FERTIMEX projects an annual urea capacity of about 0.8 million
ton of nitrogen by 1985 which will be adequate to satisfy domestic demand.
Anv excess urea as a result of high capacity usage could be easily exported
to neighboring countries. The financial rate of return for the project is
calculated at 6.8% compared to the appraisal estimate of 14.5%. FERTIMEX
has satisfactory debt/equity ratio at 40/60, but the current ratio of 0.7
and debt service coverage ratio of 1.0 were below the requirements of
agreed financial convenants. The economic rate of return is computed at
16%' compared to the appraisal estimate of 24%. The ERR is still at an
acceptable level despite substantial cost over-run and completion delays
since the Project converts excess ammonia to urea which substitutes
imports. T:he net annual foreign exchange savings from the Project are
estimated to be about USs70 million. In addition, the Project has resulted
in substantial technology transfer for Mexican firms. (paras 4.10 - 6.04)
9.        Durina early phases of the Project the Bank played a significant
role in helping FERTIMEX improve project scope, implementation
arrangements, cost accounting system, etc. However, weakness in
organizational m;i management arrangements of FERTIMEX persisted during
project implementation and the Bark was unsuccessful in its efforts to
induce FERTIMEX to carry out institutional improvements aimed at more
effective project management and coordination during the planning and
execution stages. Conseqtuently, critical managerial lapses have
siznificantly reduced the Project's returns. (paras 7.01 - 7.04)



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
MEXICO - FERTILIZER I PROJ Er
(LOAN 1112-ME)
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      An important feature of the long-term policies of the Government
of Mexico has been to promote agricultural production through the
development of irrigation projects, agricultural research and extension
work, and by making agricultural credits and fertilizers available to
farmers under favorable conditions. In particular, the Government has
sought to maximize local production of fertilizers, protect farmers from
price fluctuations, incurred often on the international market, and promote
agricultural production through controlled fertilizer prices.
1.02      In pursuit of this policy, a Government-owned company, Guanos y
Fertilizantes de Mexico S.A. (GUANOMEX), was formed in 1943 to exploit
guano deposits. The Company's functions were enlarged in 1948 to include
production and distribution of all fertilizers. In 1965-67, GUANOMEX
absorbed three private companies in compliance with a Government decision
to consolidate the responsibility for the fertilizer supply into one
public-sector enterprise to streamline the planning and execution of
additional fertilizer capacity. In addition, GUANOMEX took over the
national supply of insecticides and the exclusive responsibility for
domestic distribution of fertilizers. On January 1, 1978, Fertilizantes
Mexicanos S.A. (FERTIMEX) was formed through a merger of GUANOMEX and
Fertilizantes Fosfatados Mexicanos (FFM). The latter was the only producer
of phosphoric actd in the country of which it exported large quantities.
As of 1978, FERTIMEX1/ owned all of Mexico's fertilizer capacity except
for ammonia, which is produced by Petroleos Mexicanos S.A. (PEMEX) and
ammonium sulfate produced as a by-product of Caprolactam in the private
sector. At present FERTIMEX operates 13 fertilizer plants in Mexico and
one in Guatemala (Annexes 1-1 and 1-2).
1.04      Mexico's overall fertilizer consumption increased very rapidly at
an average annual rate of 16% between 1953 and 1973. Thereafter, growth
slowed down somewhat, but consumption continued to grow at a healthy annual
rate of about 11% through today2/.
1.05      The Fertilizer I Project (the Project) is part of the
Government's and FERTIMEX's effort to maximize local production of
fertilizers and other agrochemicals by: (a) taking advantage of low-cost
1/   The name 'FERTIMEX  or the  Company  will be used in this report as
being also applicable to GUANOMEX.
2/   According to the Government the Project Completion Report does not
reflect adequately the impact of the economic environment that
prevailed in Mexico during project implementation and the constraints
imposed by the situation. While the Bank recognises the impact of the
economic situation in Mexico during the project implementation period,
it is the Bank's view that this factor has been adequately taken into
account in preparing the report.

ammonia produced by PEMEX; (b) rationalizing the geographical distribution
of production units in Mexico, ,nd (c) coordinating and expediting
fertilizer imports.
II. PROJECT BACKGROUND
A. Project Preparation, Appraisal, Loan Approval and Effectiveness.
2.01      Following a request from Nacional Financiera S.A. (NAFINSA), a
Bank mission reviewed Mexico's fertilizer sector in June 1974 and
identified three sub-projects as being suitable for Bank financing.3/
These sub-projects were based on studies carried out by FERTIMEX in late
1973 and early 1974. FERTIMEX had competent technical staff who designed
the project scope and prepared the feasibility report which was
subsequently approved by the Company's Board of Directors.
2.02      The Project was appraised in September 1974 based on preparatory
work carried out by FERTIMEX. The process technology, engineering features
and procurement procedures were, however, extensively and frequently
discussed with the Bank during and after appraisal. The appraisal mission
also discussed with various Government agencies and FERTIMEX the need to
prepare detailed fertilizer demand projections and studies on fertilizer
distribution, transportation and inventory control.
2.03      On May 22, 1975, the Bank Board approved a loan of US$50 million
to NAFINSA and GUANOMEX (later FERTIMEX) at an interest rate of 8-1/2%
p.a. and a maturity of 14 years, including a grace period of 3-1/2 years.
The Government guaranteed the loan and agreed that NAFINSA would charge
FERTIMEX a 3-1/2% p.a. fee on the borrowed amount in order to raise the
effective interest rate to 12% p.a., reflecting the then prevailing cost of
borrowing from commercial sources. The loan became effective on July 30,
1975.
B. Project Description
2.04      The FERTIMEX I Project comprises the following sub-projects:
(a)  The Bajio sub-project is a 1,000 tons per day (tpd) or
330,000 tons per year (tpy) urea plant located next to an
existing 56,000 tpy FERTIMEX urea unit at Bajio in the State
of Guanajuato. Ammonia and carbon dioxide are supplied from
the second of two nearby PEMEX plants with capacities of 250
and 900 tpd of ammonia commissioned in 1967 and 1977,
respectively. The process technology selected for this
sub-project is Stamicarbon's total recycle and carbon
dioxide stripping process.
3/   The Bank's Fertilizer I Project (the Project) consists of these 3
sub-proJects (para 2.04).



-3-
b)   The Istmo sub-project consists of a 1,500 tpd (495,000 tpy)
urea plant at Pajaritas in the State of Veracruz. The plant
is designed to use ammonia and carbon dioxide piped from the
nearby PEMEX Cosoleacaque plants. The technology used is
the Snamprogetti ammonia stripping process. The sub-project
also includes compressors and pipelines for ammonia and
carbon dioxide, water and power supplies, materials
handling, port installations, and administrative
facilities.
c)   The Salamanca sub-project consists of a 2,500 tpy expansion
and modernization of an existing 7,500 tpy parathion
insecticide plant located at Salamanca, State of Guanajuato,
based on the Stauffer Chemical Co. (USA) technology. The
sub-project was designed to substitute for DDT production.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. Achievement of Project Objectives
3.01      The Project was mechanically completed by June 1982, 37 months
behind schedule. Preliminary production figures for 1982, the first year
in which all the Project components operated, are as follows:
Fertilizer I Project - 1982 Production
Tons    % Capacity Utilization
Urea - Bajio sub-project              238,000                72
Urea - Istmo sub-project              232,000                70 4/
Parathion - Salamanca sub-project       1,300                13
Actual capacity utilization of the Bajio and Istmo plants in 1982 is
consistent with the 70% figure anticipated in the Appraisal Report for the
first year of operation. Capacity utilization was limited by supply
interruptions of ammonia and mechanical failures in auxiliary equipment
(paras 4.05 and 4.07). In the case of the insecticide plant, low capacity
utilization was due to market constraints (para 4.09). While operating
performance has suffered partly due to reasons beyond the control of the
project entity, the plants have demonstrated their ability to reach and
sustain production at design capacity.
B.   Project Scope Changes
3.02      The main change in Project scope resulted from a later FERTIMEX
decision to build a twin 1,500 tpd urea plant at the Istmo sub-project
site. The decision to double urea capacity at Istmo was made on the basis
4/   Based on period after stz  -up.



-4-
of the availability of low-cost ammonia from the multiple production units
being built by PEMEX at Cosoleacaque (which have reached total annual
capaciEy of 2.44 million tons by 1983) and to export a product with a
higher value-added than ammonia. This decision in turn required
modification of off-site arrangements: (a) larger pumps and compressors
capacities to ensure sufficient supply of ammonia and carbon dioxide; (b)
enlarged solid handling and storage facilities; and (c) an increased
electric po.er supply.  In addition, a formaldehyde spraying system was
included in the Project to coat the urea prills, to avoid agglomeration.
On the other hand, the bag manufacturing plant, originally envisaged to
supply not only the Istmo plant but other FERTIMEX plants, was deleted from
the Project scope. The evolving changes in auxiliary services and offsite
facilities naturally caused considerable delay in project completion.
C. Project Management
3.03      The Project implementation responsibility rested entirely with
FERTIMEX. Until 1977, FERTIMEX projects were prepared and executed under
the responsibility of FERTIMEX's General Manager of Development, who was
assisted by an Assistant General Manager for supervision and construction
and an Assistant General Manager for project coordination. Project units
or task forces reporting to the latter were formed for each sub-project.
Each project unit was headed by a project manager and comprised a
construction engineer, a chief design engineer, several procurement
officers, other engineering and technical specialists, and administrative
oersonneL.
3.04,     Execution of the Bajio sub-project was initiated under the
project unit svstem described above. However, following a change in
senior management in December 1976 when a new team took over, the organiza-
tion -went through several phases of restructuring. Under this svstem,
statf  ascigned to perform specific project tasks did not report to a
pr.jeztL manager  but to the head of their respective division and did not
permit an effective functioning of a planning and monitoring system for the
sub-proiects. In other words, the "project manager" did not have anv
direct amthoritv over the divisional staff working on the Project.
--t:t ther r; requent management changes of the departments caused
inni. :r-: dielays during project implementation. During supervision

rrom other FERTIMEX plants.  Therefore, the Bank agreed to a recruitment

3.06      The personnel recruited for the urea plants received training
for six months; about one half of the process engineers recruited for the
Bajio sub-project also received one month training at the Stamicarbon
installations in Holland while the engineering and technical staff assigned
to the Istmo sub-project were trained on site by Snamprogetti staff.
FERTIMEX encountered some difficulties in recruiting and retaining quali-
fied staff for the Istmo plant due to the large development activity in
progress in the surrounding '4inatitlan and Pajaritos industrial area and
the resulting limited availability of housing and other ammenities.
E. Use and Performance of Engineering Firms and Consultants
3.07      FERTIMEX staff had overall responsibility for general design and
supervision of the Project. However, because of the organizational in-
adequacies described abo-7e (para 3.04), the Project lacked effective
control of scheduling and costing (paras 3.10, 3.12 to 3.14). Licensed
process technology and basic engineering were provided by reputable foreign
firms which were associated wiLh local engineering firms responsible for
detailed engineering and expediting deliverv of locally-made equipment.
With some exceptions (para 3.10) the performance of these companies was
generally satisfactory. The local firm, which provided engineering
services for the Istmo sub-project on the other hand, faced serious
problems, partly due to the 1978/79 boom in construction work in Mexico,
which caused delays in the delivery of equipment designs and other
information by the suppliers, but mainly due to lack of experience with
large projects, lack of qualified personnel and frequent changes of the
technical and managerial staff. Local firms were also unable to design the
materials handling facilities downstream of the urea prilling tower and a
USA firm was contracted in 1978 to carry out this task.
3.08      The Salamanca sub-project is based on an improvement of the
Stauffer Chemical Co. (USA) process used in the original plant (para 2.04
c). The performance of the selected Mexican engineering firm was, in
general, satisfactory.
F. Procurement and Performance of Suppliers
3.09      FERTIMEX followed generally acceptable procedures for contracting
for equipment, erection and civil works. Equipment and materials were
mostly procured through international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures



-6-
in accordance with Bark guidelines and equipment were therefore obtained
from competent suppliers at reasonable prices.
3.10      Some problems encountered in procurement were due to overall
countrr conditions (para 3.17). These difficulties were however compounded
which were not closely monitored by FERTIMEX.6/ The main problems
encountered in this respect were (a) frequent design changes made by local
engineering firms; (b) insufficient inspection of materials and equipment
prior to shipment; (c) inadequate system to expedite delivery of orders,
till frequent delays in delivery of equipment forced FERTIMEX to appoint
its own expediters; and (d) delays in contracting for erection and civil
works because of limited response to tenders due to the 1978/79 boom in
construction work in Mexico.
3.11      In the Appraisal Report, it was anricipated that 35% of the
ecuipment wrould be imported and 54% of the ltcensing and engineering costs
would be pavable in foreign exchange.  The actual cost of the imported
equipment and spares (USS4O.3 million) and of licensing and engineering
(';SS9.7 million) amounted to 4i5% and 52% respectively of the total for
those categories. 'Mexican manufacturers supplied through international
competitive bidding procedures 25% of the Bank-financed goods and
ser-:ices.  Among foreign suppliers the most important countries of origin
-zere Italy. Federal Republic of Germany, the Netherlands, Japan and the
'S; (Annex 3-1).
C.  Perf ormance of Erection and Civil Work Contractors.
3.12      Construction of the Bajio sub-project was entrusted to a local
.irm in 1976 w-hich subsequentlv was unable to secure the necessary
technical staff and equipment. The work stopped completely during five
-3onths in 1977 and early in 1978 and had to be recontracted to a new firm
who narried out approximately 40% of the total construction work.  Another
-roblom was that the steel structure required for the above-ground
positioning of the urea reactor was built before full load details and
specifications had been submitted by the equipment supplier and required
s,b- ccuent strengthening. Further delavs resulted from difficulties in
pr: curi-g structural steel from local suppliers.
3.13      The construction of the Istmo sub-project was originallv
contracted to a local flrm but several work areas had later to be
reassigned to other contractors.  Furthermore, the work encountered
_dditional problems due to the serious concentration of construction
activitv _n the area, where ?'-tEX, FERTIMEK, and other firms were carrying
*,ut simultaneouslv a number of large projects. Living quarters, other
in-,rastructure and amenities for the working force were lacking in the
Minatitian area and taLis made it verv difficult to recruit and retain
qualified DersonneL.  As a result of delays in completing the materials
,/   According to the Government the Bank was aware of the lechnical
caDacities of rhese firms and it therefore shares responsibility with
FERTIMEX.



-7-
handling system,7/ it was necessary to design and build temporary
facilities and install three bagging machines at Pajaritos.
3.14      The civil works and erection contract for the Salamanca
sub-project was issued in 1977 to a local contractor which, as in the case
of the Bajio sub-project, could not fulfill its task due to lack of
cechnical expertise ai,d staff. The new contractor was aiso unable to make
adequate progress and the work was completed by a third firm. FERTIMEX had
to support with additional technical staff both the local engineering firm
and the civil works contractor to avoid further delays. In this and in the
other sub-projects the capabilities of the firms being engaged were not
fully evaluated and their shortcomings were not corrected early enough in
the execution of the sub-projects.8/
H. Implementation Schedule
3.15      Estimazed and actual implementation schedules for the Project are
shown in Annex 3-2 and summarized in the table on the next page.
7/   Due to the change in scope to include the requirements of a second
urea plant as well as of the F-F phosphoric acid plant and a new
ammonium nitrate plant.
8/   According to tl.' Government these were not the real reasons why the
contractors were unable to fulfill the initial specification:
properly. Presumably, the reasons should be sought in the conditions
caused by the 1978/79 construction boom and the overall economic
situation in Mexico during the implementation period.

T-e overall delay in completion of the Project was 37 months, although two
o' the sub-projects--Bajio and Salamanca--were completed earlier, 21 and 33
months behind schedule. The delays were mainly due to: (a) the changes in
the organization and administrative procedures o'f FERTIMEX;90  (b) fund
shortage caused b. the September 1976 devaluation of the MexS: (c) late
placement of orders and advance payments on contracts; and (d) insufficient
technical expertise and experience on the part of local engineering firms
and erection contractors. One other reason pointed out by FERTIMEX was the
excessive disaggregation of bid packages--more than one thousand tenders
.or the t-o urea plants, as a result of Government regulations.
9!   Since questions of institutional policy regarding FERTIMEX fall within
the competence of the appropriate government authorities, the
Government suggests that FERTIMEX's institutional and administrative
policies cannot be used as an explanation for the unsatisfactory
execution of the Project.



-9 -
3.16      Changes in FERTIMEX management which followed tne 1976 national
elections and modifications o^ the :rTpwtrv organization for its project
development and construction acc.--i-ies  para 3.04) resulted in some key
decision-making staff leaving the :ompany and therefore in delays until the
new organizational set-up was functioning with new staff familiar with
Project requirements.
3.17      The 1976 devaluation of the MexS was largely unforeseen.  Mexico
had enjoyed relative exchange rate stability for many years and FERTIXEX as
well as many manufacturers and contractors had not taken precautions to
avoid heavy exposure t. foreign exchange fluctuation risks. The 1976
devaluation restricted severely FERTIMEX's financial capabilities and
held-up the placing or signing of some important orders and contracts.
Since suppliers and contractors had also experienced liquidity problems,
they were often unable to live up to their obligations. To face this
situation, FERTIMEX formed a Procurement Control Group to expedite the
re-negotiation of orders and contracts, where this was still possible, or
else to invite new tenders. The changes introduced in the contracts and
the subsequent approval requirements often resulted in additional delays
and commissioning problems.
3.18      Some of the reasons for delays were beyond the control of
FERTIMEX officials (e.g. devaluation of the MexS and senior management
changes following national elections), but FERTIMEX could have reduced the
delays by: (a) setting-up an adequately-staffed project cask force
organization; (b) appointing fully responsible sub-project managers: (c)
minimizing re-deployment of managerial staff before completion of assigned
tasks; (d) evaluating more adequately experience and capabilities of local
construction and erection contractors prior to awiarding contracts; I0/ and
(e) strengthening system to monitor and control the progress in project
implementation.

3.19      Capital cost estimates at the time of appraisal and actual
figures are shown in Annex 3-3 and summarized in the table on the following

The main reasons for the cost overruns have been identified as the
following: (a) Project implementation delays; (b) changes in Project scope;
(c) underestimated civil works in the Istmo sub-project; and (d) currency
realignments which forced re-negotiation of contracts or rebidding for
equipment resulting in price increases above appraisal estimates.
3.21      FERTIMEX did not have a monitoring system of capital cost
providing up-to-date information on Project expenditures and commitments.
The main problem areas have been: (a) no separate accounting for foreign
exchange and local currency expenditures and commitments; (b) confusion in
cost allocation due to construction of a second urea plant at Istmo
(particularly in regard to infrastructure, material handling and offsites);
and (c) no clear guidelines on allocating administrative expenses to the
sub-projects. 1!/
3.22      The total financing required of US$318.8 million was met with
equity provided by the Government through NAFINSA (46%), Bank loan (16%)
and other long-term borrowing (38%). A summary is given below in the table
on the following page.
11/ For example, in the Bajio sub-project, in 1979 only USS58,000 out of
an investment of USS18.6 million (0.4%) were charged to administrative
expenses while in 1980, the proportion was 38.5% (USS4.0 million out
of a US$10.4 million total).

pattern projected at the time of appraisal as a result of the completion
delays.

A. Commissioning and Start-up
4.01      As mentioned earlier (para 3.15), Project facilities were
mechanically completed and started-up in June 1982, 37 months behind
schpdule-12/ Commissioning and acceptance te.;ts of the Bajio sub-project
wcrre carried out smoothly, while the Istmo plant has not undergone formal
acceptance tests. However, since the plant has operated for more than 30
da,s at a capacity above 80%, it can be considered as completed according
to the tcrms of Schedule 2 of the Loan Agreement.
4.02      The Bajio sub-project started operations on July 26. 1980,
at 43.5% of capacity. During the following five months difficulties were
encountered due to: (a) boiler flue leakages; (b) failure of rotor and
valves of the carbon dioxide turbo compressor; (c) split in high pressure
12/ In case of the Istmo sub-project mechanical completion and start-up
operations overlapped, therefore both dates coincide.

condenser tubes, (d) defective design of the prilling system evaporator
resulting in high final product temperature; and (e) low water table levels
which led to lack of water pumped from wells.
4.03      The Istmo sub-project initiated production on April 17, 1982, and
its output in May reached 50% of nominal capacity. The main problems
during start-up were: (a) incorrect programming of the electric supply
system; (b) delaved installation of power sub-station, forcing the Istmo
chlorinated product plant; (c) delay in construction of the water supply
system; (d) delayed completion of water pre-treatment plant: (e) incomplete
ammonia storage tanks forcing FERTIMEX to use ammonia as delivered directly
from the PEMEX plants; and (f) unfinished materials handling, storage and
maintenance facilities (temporary facilities have been installed).
4.04      The start-up of the Salamanca expansion sub-project took place in
December 1980 and faced only minor problems such as: (a) insufficient
water recycling pipe capacity; (b) defective specifications for the
electric control panel; and (c) some mechanical failures. No acceptance
test has been carried out because guarantee terms had already expired by
the time the equipment were installed. However, for an expansion of an
existing plant, this is not considered a serious shortcoming.
B. Normalization and Build-up of Production
4.05      Actual Project output through November 1982 is shown in Annex
4-1. The Bajio urea plant reached and maintained for five days a level of
output of 105% capacity. During 1981, production, however, was only
206,290 tons (62.5% of capacity) mainly due to interruptions of feedstock
supply from PEMEX and the problems encountered during commissioning (para
4.02).
4.06      To counter these problems FERTIMEX (a) discussed with PEMEX
officials the need for priority in ammonia and carbon dioxide supplies to
the plant over other users; (b) installed a new boiler; (c) changed the
turbo compressor rotor; (d) arranged for Stamicarbon review of possible
causes of condenser tube failures. Preliminary 1982 figures show that the
Bajio sub-project averaged 72.1% of capacity utilization with a production
of 238,000 tons. Actual performance could have been better--the plant
operated at or near full capacity for weeks at a time--were it not for
losses caused by lack of feedstock. This factor was particularly
noticeable in June 1982 (Annex 4-1), when production was only 6,428 tons
during extensive repair work as the result of an explosion in one of PEMEX
ammonia plants. No serious problems are expected in attaining the
envisaged 100% capacity utilization by. 1986.
4.07      Istmo sub-project averaged about 74% capacity utilization for the
remaining year after start-up in June 1982, (Annex 4-1). The main problems
in stabilizing production and their relative importance measured in terms
of lost production have been estimated by plant management as follows:
leakages from piping and equipment (24%), mechanical failures (172),
defective instrumentation (11%), failures of the Minatitlan booster
compressor (17%), delays in the supply of water (10%), lack of ammonia and



- 14-
outside power (12%) and unavailabilitv of a machine shop for important
repairs (9%).
4.08      To solve the problems mentioned above, FERTIMEX has arranged for
(a) temporary wells for supply of water; (b) contracted an outside machine
shop for the required mechanical maintenance work; and (c) special training
in instrumentation.
4.09      During 1981 and 1982, operation of the Salamanca sub-project has
been normal except for some maintenance problems. However, production was
limited by market constraints to about 40% of expanded capacity in 1981 and
as a consequence of inventory build-up to about 13% in 1982 (Annex 4-1).
The market constraints were caused by the following factors which could not
be anticipated in the early 1970s: (a) lower demand due tu shrunken cotton
plantation; (b) increased price competition; and (c) oversupply of new
insecticides with improved qualities.
C. FERTIMEX Market Growth
4.10      Actual fertilizer consumption figures through 1981 and new
projections made recently by FERTIMEX compare fairly with the SAR projec-
tions as shown in Annex 4-2, summarized below:

* Projected.
FERTIMEX projects an annual urea capacity of about 0.8 million tons of
nitrogen by 1985 (Annex 1-2).   Anv excess urea as a result of high
capacity utilization rates could be easily exported to neighboring
countries. Total solid fertilizer capacity (including ammonium nitrate and
ammonium sulfate) is expected to reach 1.17 million tons of N in 1985,
approximately meeting anticipated demand.

V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
A. Volume and Value of Sales
5.01      Output projections for the Project have been made assuming that
the Istmo and the Bajio sub-projects will at:ain capacity utilization of
about 90% by 1983 and 1985, respectively. After 1986 both plants are
assumed to work at 100% capacity.  On the other hand, because of market
constraints already mentioned, the Salamanca parathion sub-project is
expected to reach only 35% of expanded capacity by 1986. However, since
the capital cost of this sub-project is only 3.3% of the total Project
cost, the Project rate of return will not be affected significantly.
5.02      Historical changes in urea prices paid by farmers and the higher
ex-factory price of FERTIMEX are shown in Annex 5-1. The difference
between the two prices is a subsidy to farmers paid directly by the
Government to FEP.TIMEX. The October 1982 ex-factory price was Mex$8,511
per ton of urea or 26% above retail level. This price corresponds to
US$122 per ton of urea at the then prevailing exchange rate of USSI=Mex$70,
substantially below the international level of US$150. Although the
Government's long-term intentions are to keep local fertilizer prices close
to international levels, continued slide in the MexS exchange rate has not
permitted the needed rapid price adjustments in the short term.13/
B. Financial Rate of Return
5.03      The financial rate of return has been calculated at prices
prevailing in October 1982 for products and inputs of the sub-projects.
Estimated operating costs at projected rates of capacity utilization are
contained in Annex 5-2, and cost and benefit streams under these
assumptions in Annex 5-3. The financial rate of return is calculated at
6.8% for the Project (including the capital costs of the Salamanca
sub-project but excluding the latter's operating costs and benefits)141
compared to the appraisal estimate of 14.5%.
Financial Statements
5.04      Summarized audited FERTIMEX income and balance sheet statements
for the period 1976-81 are shown in Annex 5-4.   In 1981 the company had a
net income of Mex$528 million or US$20 million, equivalent to 3.2% of
equity. While the debt/equity ratio was satisfactory at 40/60, the current
ratio of 0.67 and debt service coverage ratio of 1.0 were below the
requirements of agreed financial covenants.15/
13/ The Government stresses the point that the Mexican Government
determines the price policy while FERTIMEX only undertakes its
execution.
14/ Were the capital cost of the Salamanca sub-project excluded and
regarded as sunk costs, the financial rate of return would increase to
7.2%.
15/ The Government states that this was due to devaluation of the Mexican
currency.



- 16 -
VI. ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE
A. Economic Rate of Return
6.01      The Project's economic rate of return (ERR) has been calculated
using the price assumptions shown in Annex 6-1. Tradeable cost items have
been priced on the basis of international prices allowing for transporta-
tion and handling charges. Prices for non-traded items have been assumed
to be the same as the financial prices. Project costs and benefits are
shown in Annex 6-2.   The ERR computed for the total Project is 16.0% or
8.0 percentage points lower than the appraisal estimate, based on the cost
and benefit streams shown in Annex 6-3. 16/ The Project economic rate of
return is still at an acceptable level in spite of substantial cost
overruns and completion delays since the Project converts ammonia which
would otherwise have been exported, to urea which substitutes imports.
B. Foreign Exchange Savings
6.03      The annual foreign exchange value of the Project's production
with the urea plants operating at 90% of rated capacity is about US$91
million. Since most of the materials and services used in the Project are
of domestic origin, except for spares and some maintenance work (the cost
of which is estimated at US$1 million) and debt service payments averaging
about US$20 million in the Eirst 10 years, the net foreign exchange savings
will be about US$70 million.
C. Transfer of Technology
6.04      The Project has been built and started with substantial
oarticipation of Mexican engineering firms and manufacturers and, in the
process--although with some serious setbacks and delays discussed in
Section 3 of this report--technological transfers from licensors and
foreign engineering firms to Mexican institutions and professionals have
been significant.
VII. BANK ROLE, CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED
7.01      During the early phases of the Project, the Bank worked closely
with FERTIMEX. During Project appraisal, the Bank not only reviewed the
Project scope and implementation arrangements but also worked with FERTIMEX
in preparing TOR for a detailed fertilizer market and marketing study in
161 Ifn regard to paragraph 7 of the Government's response the details of
the economic analysis are given in the Annexes 6-1 through 6-3. As
already mentioned in footnote 14, the financial and economic analysis
has heen carried out on a combined basis, treating US$12 million
capital expenditure for the expansion of the parathion plant at
Salamanca (3.8' of total investments) as sunk cost since the relate.
capacity increase is not effectively utilized due to demand constraints.
The Bank does not see the need for a separate analysis regarding the
two urea plants in view of the similarities of their estimated economic
benefits.

Mexico. The Bank conducted in 1977 a one-week seminar on corporate
financial planning. Subsequently in 1980. at the suggestion of the Bank,
FERTIMEX employed consultant assistance to develop and implement a system
of standard cost accounting and a financial management reporting system.
7.02      Generally speaking, however, weakness in the organizational,
corporate and project management arrangements of FERTIMEX persisted
throughout proiect implementation. Even during early supervision missions
the Bank was unsuccessful in its efforts to induce FERTIMEX to carry out
institutional improvements. The weak institutional basis of FERTIMEX was
compounded by the following factors: (a) impact of Mex$ devaluation in
September 1976; (b) complete changes in the organizational, corporate and
project managemenc of FERTIMEX in 1976; (c) overestimation of local
implementation capabilities; and (d) lack of management's receptiveness to
outside advice, even when it came from the Bank.1 I Against these
developments, the Bank found itself fighting a losing battle, being limited
only to pointing out to the Government and FERTIMEX the need to strengthen
project implementation capabilities. To a large degree, FERTIMEX was even
beyond guidance from the monitoring Government agencies, who appreciated
the Bank assessments, but did not have sufficient influence to enforce
them.
7.03      In retrospect, the market potential of Parathion as an important
insecticide was not correctly assessed. However, the involved investment
was relatively small which did not appear to justify extensive market
research efforts.  The wisdom to attach-for reasons of convenierce--a
small out-of-line project component to a major project entity is
questionable. For future projects this may be avoided, especially if the
Bank does not have the needed and specialized in-house expertise.
7.04      In regard to potential problems of supplying the project with
sufficient quantities of ammonia and carbon dioxide-given tne fact that
ammonia and urea production would be carried out by separate entities-the
Bank team has had a critical view right from the beginning. However, the
decision of a divided production responsibility for ammonia and urea was a
political one and irreversible at the appraisal stage. Due to the linkages
of both production processes, the separation of the two operations is not
an ideal arrangement, but acceptable under exceptional circumstances. In
the final analysis the "division of labor has caused some problems during
the start-up phase but were relatively fast overcome.
7.05      The case history of this project has important lessons for the
Government, NAFINSA (the shareholder) and FERTIMEX. Mexico has excellent
resource endowment and a pool of technical experts and as such could become
a key manufacturer of fertilizers for meeting a rapidly expanding domestic
demand as well as exports. An indication of this potential was the 24% and
14.5% economic and financial rate of return, respectively, for the Project
as estimated during appraisal.
7.06      However, critical managerial lapses have significantly reduced
the Project's returns. Effective project management and coordination
during planning and execution stages were lacking (paras 3.03, 3.04 and
17/ Additional factors, according to the Government were: (a) overestima-
tion of some local contractors due to the construction boom in that
period; and (b) excessive disaggregation of bidding packages.

3.18) 8/ and as a result the consultants and contractors did not perform
up to the expectation (paras. 3.07 and 3.12-3.14). The combination of
these factors resulted in completion delays, cost overruns and consequently
affected the economic benefit to the country. Although the Project's ERR
at 16.0% is still satisfactory, future FERTIMEX projects can benefit from
greater attention to managerial aspects of project planning and execution.
181 According to the Borrower, the economic conditions at the time
adversely affected management performance.

TRANSLATION OF INCOMING TELEX DATED OCTOBER 23, 1984
FROM MR. JOSE LUIS FLORES HERNANDEZ,
DIRECTOR OF INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL
ORGANIZATIONS, SECRETARIAT OF
FINANCE AND PUBLIC CREDIT. MEXICO CITY
October 23, 1984
Our ref: TCP MET
Mr. Yukinori Watanabe
Director
Operations Evaluation Department,
World Bank
Washington, D.C.
With ro-ference to your communication of August 13,
1984 enclosing a copy of the Draft Project Completion Report on
the Mexico Fertilizer I Project (Loan No. 1112-ME) and
requesting our comments for consideration during preparation of
the definitive Evaluation Report for the Bank's Executive
Directors, we consider that, in general, the document deals
with all the relevant aspects of the Project. However, in
order to help make it more complete, we wish to submit the
following general and specific observations so that they can be
incorporated into the final version of the Evaluation Report.
These points have been prepared jointly by Fertilizantes
Mexicanos, S.A. (executing agent), Nacional Financiera, S.A.
(financial agent and borrower), and the Secretariat of Finance
and Public Credit (guarantor on behalf of the Federal
Government).
A.        GENERAL
1.        The Bank Report persistently represents FERTIMEX as
an organization incapable of executing the various project
Revised text       components efficiently, and as lacking personnel capable of
of para. 1.04      solving the problems that arose.  Similarly, it asserts
Added footnote 2  emphatically that the Company did not properly carry out the
recommendations made by the Bank's supervision missions for



Annex 7
- 40 -                            Page 2 of 6
dealing with shortcomings identified during project
implementation. In light of the above, we believe that the
final Evaluation Report should attribute greater importance to
the economic environment prevailing in Mexico during project
implementation, and to the constraints imposed by the situation
that prevented adoption of the Bank's recomnendations.
2.        Before project implementation, FERTIMEX and the Bank
carried out an appraisal in order to determine the necessary
technical specifications and financial requirements. The
Bank's management found the project acceptable, and therefore
decided to participate in its financing. Consequently, we
believe that the World Bank as well as the Mexican Government
must take responsibility for not properly assessing the various
factors affecting the outcome.
3.        The Report states that the delays in the civil and
engineering works were largely due to changes in the
specifications and to technical shortcomings failures on the
part of the contractors. We do not believe that these-failures
should be attributed to the supposed inexperience of the
contractors. In fact, the enterprises responsible for the
civil works and the supply of technical equipment to the
sub-projects were the first to suffer the effects of the
devaluation of the MexS in 1976. The level of professional
experience of their staffs was considered satisfactory and
approved by FERTIMEX, and so the references in various parts of
the Report to inefficiency and inexperience on the part of the
Mexican enterprises must be considered inappropriate.
4.        The Mexican Government agrees with the comment
contained in the Report that there should be a more efficient
flow of information between the organizations involved. It
also accepts the suggestion that they should be encouraged to
cooperate at all times in attempts to overcome problems
hindering the progress future projects.
5.        The Report states that the Project could have
operated satisfactorily if FERTIMEX had established a task
force devoted exclusively to it. We believe that had the
Report given due consideration to FERTIMEX's organizational
structure, this connent would have been perceived to be
irrelevant.
6.        We find it difficult to follow the thinking behind
the assumption that the IRR should be reduced so substantially
(from 25S to 162). We therefore recommend that the final
version of the Report include the methodology used for
calculating this rate.

7.        The Report does not present a balanced analysis of
Added footnote 16   the various Project components, since it disregards the
individual characteristics of each. Thus, the studies of
economic and financial performance lump the three sub-projects
together and take no account of their differences. As a
result. these sections of the Report confine themselves to
generalizations, and the conclusions drawn are consequently
distorted.
8.        The Report lays great emphasis on the financial
aspects of the Project. These are, of course, extremely
important; nevertheless, we suggest that the social benefits
also be referred to in the final version of the Evaluation
Report, so as to provide a more detailed account of the impact
on social and regional developmenE.
B.        SPECIFIC
1.        We agree with the assessment made in paragraph 3.04
of the Report that the lack of trained personnel devoted
.Revised Text         exclusively to the projects was a decisive factor in the
problems arising during execution.  Similarly, we believe
Added footnote 5     that reference should be made to the administrative reasons
(both internal and external) why FERTIMEX was prevented from
implementing the Bank's recommendations. In addition, we
suggest that the paragraph be totally modified to read as
follows:
"Execution of the Bajio sub-project was initiated
under the project unit system described above.
However, following a change in senior management in
December 1976 when a new team took over, the
organization went through several phases of
restructuring. During supervision missions, the Bank
advised FERTIMEX of the need to form a 'project task
force' [T.N.: This line is illegible in the
original, but has been assumed to be a direct
quotation from the Report] under which the
sub-project managers would have full authority on
project implementation and control. However, this
recommendation -- presumably due to external and
internal political administrative reasons of FERTIMEX
-- was never fully implemented [T.N.: so spelled in
the Report], since questions of institutional policy
regarding FERTIMEX fall within the competence of the
appropriate government authorities." [T.N.: Final
phrase in Spanish in the originall



Annex 7
-42 -                         Page 4 ot 6
2.        It is proposed that paragraph 3.07 be revised to read
as follows:
*FERTIMEX staff had responsibility for general design
and supervision of the Project. Licensed process
technology and basic engineering were provided by
Revised text                   reputable foreign firms which were associated with
local engineering firms responsible for detailed
engineering and expediting delivery of locally-made
equipment. With some exceptions (para 3.10) the
performance of these companies was generally
satisfactory. Due to the 1978/79 boom in
construction work in Mexico, the local firm faced
serious problems, partly due to delays in the
delivery of locally-aade equipment designs and other
information by the suppliers. lack of qualified
personnel and frequent changes of the technical and
managerial staff."
The section in parentheses following the last
sentence should be removed, and the next sentence should
begin:  "Some local firms ... ." with the rest of the sentence
remaining unchanged.
3.        We suggest that the following be omitted from
paragraph 3.10: "These difficulties were however compounded by
additional failings on the part of the suppliers and
Added footnote 6    engineering firms which were not closely monitored by
FERTIMEX.' As indicated above. the Bank was aware of the
technical capacity of these firms, and the Bank therefore
shares responsibility with FERTIMEX. In addition, the last
part of the paragraph, reading "... due to the 1978179 boom in
construction work in Mexico," should be omitted.
4.        The beginning of paragraph 3.12 reads:  "Construction
of the Bajio sub-project was entrusted to a Mexican firm in
Revised text        1976 which subsequently was unable ..."  We believe that there
is no justification at all in rating contractors according to
their nationality, and it is completely unacceptable that a
firm should be considered incapable of fulfilling its
responsibilities because it is Mexican. For this reason we
propose replacing substituting the word "Mexican" by "local."
5.        Paragraph 3.13 should be modified to read as follows:
"The construction of the Istmo sub-project also
Revised text                   encountered additional problems due to the serious
concentration of construction activity in the area,
Added footnote 7               where PEMEX, FERTIMEX, and other firms were carrying
out simultaneously a number of large projects so that
several work are3s had to be reassigned to other
contractors. Living quarters, other infrastructure
and amenities for the working force were limited in
the Minatitlan area.  As a result of .  machines at
Pajaritos."

1.wg' 5 of 6
6.        In paragraph 3.14 we propose substituting the word
Revised text           "local" for "Mexican."  In addition, we suggest that the
Revised text      following sentence be omitted:  "In this and in other
Added footnote 8       sub-projects the capabilities of the firms being engaged were
t                               not fully evaluated and their shortcomings were not corrected
early enough in the execution of the sub-projects." since these
were not, in fact, the reasons why the contractors were unable
to fulfill the initial specifications properly.
7.        Paragraph 3.15 reads:  "The delays were mainly due
to: (a) the changes in the organization and administrative
procedures of FERTIMEX." As mentioned before, the Bank should
Revised text           not use FERTIMEX's institutional and administrative policies as
Added footnote 9       an explanation for the unsatisfactory execution of the
project. We therefore suggest that the words "the changes in
the ... " be omitted and that the final phrasc in the
paragraph, "as a result of Government regulations," be removed,
-   since this issue was beyond FERTIMEX's control.
8.        Paragraph 3.16 reads:  "Extensive cbanges in  .
There is no need to indicate that the changes in FERTIMEX's
Revised text           management were "extensive," and therefore we suggest that this
word be omitted.
9.        Paragraph 3.17 reads:  "The changes introduced in the
contracts often resulted in additional delays and commissioning
problems." We wish to point out that changing contracts
Revised text           involves negotiating with the Bank for its approval, and these
procedures extended the delays.  We suggest that this final
sentence be changed to read as follows: "The changes
introduced in the contract to comply with the Bank requirements
resulted in additional delays.'
10.       The opening of paragraph 3.18 is as follows:
Although some of the reasons for delays were .. ." We suggest
that the word "although" be removed, since we believe that
Revised text           these were the main reasons for the delays.  The end of the
same paragraph reads:  "...(d) evaluating more adequately
Added footnote 10      experience and capabilities of local construction and erection
contractors prior to awarding contracts; and (e) putting in
place a more effective system to monitor and control the
progress in project implementation." For the sake of greater
objectivity, we suggest the following changes:
C...(d) evaluating more adequately experience and capabilities
of local construction and erection contractors in the light of
a country risk model; and (e) strengthening the system to
monitor and control the progress in project implementation."
II.       As regards paragraph 3.23, we suggest eliminating
point (c) and its corresponding footnote, since we believe that
Revised text           the statistical Annexes do not furnish grounds for the
assertions contained in them. The number of the paragraph
should also be changed to 3.21.

Page 6 of 6
12.       Paragraph number 3.24 should be changed to 3.22.
13.       In paragraph 3.23, we suggest "as a result of delays
in completion" instead of "as a result of the long completion
delays."
14.       We suggest that the following be added to the end of
Revised text         paragraph 5.02:  "Besides, the Government of Mexico
Added footnote 13   determinates (sic) the price policy and FERTIMEX only executes
it."
15.       The following should be added to the end of para-
Added footnote 15   graph 5.04:  " ... due to devaluation of the Mexican currency."
16.       We suggest that paragraph 7.02 be changed to read as
follows:
"Generally speaking weakness in the project
implementaton was due to the following factors:
(a) impact of Mexican currency devaluation in
September, 1976; (b) complete changes in the
organizational, corporate and project management of
Revised text                    FERTIMEX in 1976; (c) overestimation of some local
contractors due to the construction boom in that
Added footnote 17               period; and (d) excessive disaggregation of bidding
packages." These changes are suggested because we
believe that the main factors impacting on project
implementation were beyond the control of both
FERTIMEX and the Bank itself.
17.       In paragraph 7.06. we suggest replacing the word
"lacking" with "imperfect due to the events [TIN.: next
word(s) illegible] at that time." The rest of the paragraph
should remain as it is, except that we suggest the sentence
"the combination of these factors ... economic benefit to the
Added footnote 18   country" be removed, since the last part of the paragraph
appears contradictory.
We would be very grateful if our comments and
opinions could be reflected in the Evaluation Report for
distribution to the Executive Directors.
