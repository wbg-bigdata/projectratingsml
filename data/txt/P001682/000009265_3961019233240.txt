REPUBLIC OF MALI
HOUSEHOLD ENERGY PROJECT
1.    Background. Mali is a vast, land-locked, resource-poor country located in the
Sahelian zone of Western Africa. Only about a quarter of its 1.2 million square kilometers
is arable. Nearly 90% of the population, estimated at 8.5 million in 1990, is dependent on
the agricultural sector. In 1992, per capita income was estimated at US$310. Social
indicators, such as life expectancy (48 years) and literacy rate (60%), are among the
lowest in the world. Agriculture will remain the mainstay of the economy for the
foreseeable future, and the Government is taking steps to improve agricultural
productivity and diversify production. Directly linked to the Government's agricultural
strategy is its objective to improve natural resource management, in particular its objective
to fight environmental degradation. Having prepared a plan for desertification control in
the late 1980's (para. 6), the Government has initiated the development of an integrated
natural resource management program for the agricultural, pastoral and forestry sectors.
This program is further elaborated in the National Environmental Action Program (NEAP)
which is being formulated by the Government and is expected to be completed by mid-
1996, as well as in the Country Environmental Strategy Paper (CESP) which has been
completed and widely discussed with the Government (Report no. 11642-MLI). The
program aims at enabling local communities to better manage their own natural resources,
including fuelwood, and increasing their responsibility for such management. This
program is supported by the Bank and other donors through a Natural Resource
Management Project (Credit 2370-MLI). To reverse the process of degradation,
measures will be needed on many fronts, including the development of new solutions to
land tenure legislation, training on more appropriate farming practices, the development of
economic and technological alternatives to current agricultural and livestock activities,
information and awareness building, and institutional strengthening.
2.    As in most Sahelian countries, fuelwood (used mostly for cooking) comprises
approximately 90% of the energy consumed in Malian households. In urban areas
charcoal is also used (11% in Bamako), and its use is expanding rapidly. Several analyses
have drawn attention to woodfuel deficits in Mali. A detailed inventory taken in 1987
gives the most reliable overview of the standing stock of Mali's forests. According to this
inventory, the current situation is less dramatic in the south than previously thought. The
Sikasso and Koulikoro regions, for example, are heavily forested: 60 to 80 % of the
surface area is covered with old growth timber (about 10 million hectares). Annual
productivity of the accessible portions of these natural forests can supply nearby urban
populations for several decades, although pockets of resource degradation around urban
centers are developing. In sharp contrast, the northern regions (which were hard hit by
the drought) are experiencing increasing woodfuel deficits as the resource base is being
gradually destroyed. The motorized woodfuel entrepreneurs tend to "mine" nearby
forests, particularly for charcoal production, thus creating corridors of deforested areas
along access roads. Also, in the cotton zone, in the south, large quantities of cotton stalks are



2
burnt each year, because they have no economic use, though these could be transformed into
charcoal briquets and replace charcoal. It is important, therefore, to reduce and rationalize
the exploitation of household fuels for the major cities, particularly for the deficit areas in
the north. Transporting fuelwood or charcoal from the south to the north, unfortunately,
is not economically feasible, because of the long distances (1,000 km) and high transport
costs.
3.    The household energy sector has considerable economic importance. The sector's
annual commercial turnover amounts to 10 billion CFAF, or approximately US$18 million
(twice the turnover of the electric power sector) and provides some 15,000 jobs in the
rural areas. The market price for fuelwood and charcoal, however, represents only their
financial, not their economic costs and fuelwood prices are considerably lower than what
they should be. The rural producer, in effect, subsidizes the urban consumer who has little
incentive to use energy efficiently. The economic cost of fuelwood is calculated at being
26-39 FCAF/kg (depending on the region), while the urban consumer pays only 18
FCFA/kg.
4.    Because of the dominant role of biomass fuels in total energy consumption, the
contribution of non-household sectors of the economy to C02 emissions is negligible in
Mali. Currently, C02 emissions in Mali, excluding the household sector, are estimated at
0.01 ton/capita per year. In contrast the estimated amount emitted by the household
sector is 0.3 ton/capita per year, or 30 times higher than the non-household sector. It has
been estimated that Mali adds some 2 million tons C02 to the global C02 balance, mainly
from energy use stemming from non-sustainable biomass harvesting. The dominant role of
the urban household sector as a C02 emitter and the increasing charcoal consumption in
Mali, combined with high urban population growth (7% per year), clearly indicate the
need for the reduction of urban C02 emissions. More efficient stove/fuel combinations
emit smaller quantities of C02 while accomplishing a similar cooking task. Relative to
kerosene and natural gas, charcoal emits 2 to 3 times more C02. From these figures it is
clear that the use of charcoal should be discouraged and the use of less harmful fuels such
as kerosene and charcoal briquets promoted. In a "business as usual" scenario, fuelwood
consumption will rise from a total of 4 million tons in 1987 to 5.2 million tons in the year
2007 as population increases, exerting further pressure on the forest exploitation zones. If
this increasing consumption is not offset by equal increases in wood production, there will
also be a net increase in total C02 emissions in the country.
5.    Presently, there is virtually no control exercised over woodcutters, the production
areas, or the quantities of woodfuels produced. The present level of woodfuels taxation is
of little significance (far too low) and collection is at best only sporadic. This defacto
passive policy of non-intervention in the woodfuel sector has led amongst other things to
the failure of the IDA-financed Second Forestry Project (Credit 1654-MILI) (para. 18).
6.    The responsibility for policy formulation and overall coordination in the household
energy sector is shared between the Ministry of Mines, Energy and Hydraulics (MMIEH)
and the Ministry of Rural Development (MRD). The Government, with assistance from



3
the Energy Sector Management Assistance Program, formulated a comprehensive
household energy sector strategy which was presented to several donors in November
1992. The strategy aims to facilitate access of both the urban and rural population to
modern forms of energy and protect the natural environment against uncontrolled and
damaging exploitation of biomass resources. The strategy is part of the National Plan to
Prevent Desertification (Programme National de Lutte Contre la Desertification, PNLD).
Implementation of the PNLD is being coordinated and supervised by an inter-ministerial
organization headed by the Ministry of Rural Development through the National
Waterways and Forests Department (NWFD). NWFD's main functions include: (i)
monitoring forest exploitations; (ii) managing classified forests; and (iii) monitoring the
flows of forest products. NWFD currently has a staff of 780 forestry agents and some 700
non-foresters and is also headquarters for the National Advisory Committee for Improved
Stoves which coordinates all improved stove projects in the country. The current
institutional framework in Mali is weak and characterized by insufficient resources and
lack of technical expertise.
7.    Project Objectives. The project's long-term development objectives are the
reduction of C02 emissions, the abatement of forest resources depletion, and increased
participation of the private sector in the management of the household energy sector. The
main implementation objectives are to promote popular participation in household energy
activities, rational use of household energy resources, and improved end-use of household
fuels. Specific objectives are to (i) create an enabling regulatory and policy environment for
project implementation; and (ii) provide technical assistance and training to peasants, charcoal
makers, producers and sellers of stoves, and urban consumers to, respectively, efficiently
harvest and carbonize fuelwood, manage the natural forest in a sustainable manner, effectively
market new energy end-use equipment, and rationally use improved biomass and kerosene
stoves. The basic principle underpinning this project is that the Government establishes the
policy environmnent, but commercial decisions are left to private economic agents.
8.    Project Description. The project would consist of two main components
covering demand for and woodfuel supply of household energy. On the demand side, the
focus of the project will consist of enhancing the role of the private sector in marketing a
variety of fuel efficient end-use appliances. To assist poor consumers to overcome market
barriers to energy products that would greatly benefit them, subsidies would be made
available on a temporary basis and in a transparent manner. Reducing the market price of
improved kerosene and charcoal stoves, both unknown products to the Malian consumer,
can help overcome consumer perception that the new product is out of her reach and
expand the market in the long run, which in turn will reduce the cost to the consumer. On
the supply side, the main focus will be to mobilize popular participation in the
management of the natural forest, and restructure the fuelwood trade so that woodfuel
traders increasingly get their supplies from managed, rather than mined, forests.
9.    The demand component. This component consists of (i) identification, design and
assistance to implement a marketing program for the sale of these improved biomass and
kerosene stoves; (ii) provision of institutional support for central government authorities to



4
help with project management and assist private sector entrepreneurs with the production and
sale of improved stoves; (iii) support for a comprehensive Information, Education and
Communication (IEC) program and systematic consumer consultation, executed by private
sector operators, on the importance of the rational use of energy through the purchase and
proper use of the improved stoves.
10.   The woodfuel supply component. This component consists of (i) design of
woodfuel supply master plans for the main towns and determine the maximum annual
sustainable wood supply in the catchment areas of the towns concerned; (ii) preparation of, and
assistance to, implement village forest management plans in about 260 villages in five
administrative regions of Mali, (iii) identification, design and implementation of an improved
carbonization program for existing charcoalers and assistance to interested local private
entrepreneurs to carbonize and compress cotton stalks to replace charcoal, (iv) provision of
institutional support for central and local government authorities to help with project
management and assist rural communities in implementing their forest management plans; and
(v) launching of a comprehensive training, client consultation, and an EEC program on forest
management.
11.   Project Financing. Total project cost is estimated at US$11.2 million equivalent
(including taxes and duties), with a foreign exchange component of 44%. The demand
component cost is estimated at about US$3.2 million, and that of the supply component at
US$7.7 million, both net of taxes and duties. The financing plan is as follows: GEF and the
Netherlands together will cofinance US$5.5 million equivalent (GEF grant: US$2.5 million,
Netherlands: US$3.0 million equivalent), France will finance US$3.2 equivalent on a parallel
basis, and Germany will finance the remaining US$1.2 million equivalent, also in the form of
parallel financing. The Government will contribute approximately US$1.2 million
equivalent to cover local personnel costs and taxes and duties charged to the project.
Project cost estimates and financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
12.   About US$1.0 million of the GEF grant will temporarily subsidize (up to 50%) import
and sale of 17.000 kerosene stoves and the production of about 68,000 charcoal stoves. The
grant will also finance training and information campaigns aimed at consumers, producers and
retailers of improved charcoal and kerosene stoves (US$0.4 million). Finally, the GEF grant
will temporarily subsidize (50%) the cost of 400 locally produced chimneys to modernize kilns
and will also finance demonstrations for and training of charcoalers (US$0.8 million), as well as
equipment and training of operators to carbonize and compress cotton stalks (US$0.3 million).
13.   Project Implementation. Overall project coordination would be the
responsibility of a Project Steering Committee. This Steering Committee will be
composed of MMEH and MIRD senior staff who would meet twice a year to evaluate and
provide direction for the project. In addition, a National Coordination Council for the
household energy sector will be created, in which the Government, all interested donors,
NGOs and private sector representatives will participate to discuss and advise on policy,
technical and coordination issues in the sector. This coordination will also facilitate
collaboration in project implementation through the use of other organizations and their



5
staff. Day-to-day project coordination, administration and financial management of the
project will be the responsibility of the Project Coordination Unit (PCU), established
within MMEEH under the ongoing Power II Project (Cr. 1 998-MLI), and is composed of
members from MMEH and MRD. The execution of the demand component would be
managed by MMEH's Household Energy Unit, and that of the woodfuel supply
component by MRD's Woodfuels Unit. The project will be mainly executed by private
sector actors. However, for critical reasons, in particular the environmental and social
dimensions and weak private sector institutions, the Government's role as a catalyst is
important to stimulate private sector development in the household energy sector.
Consequently, a large part of the project's activities is decentralized to the private sector,
with public sector involvement declining over time.
14.   The project is expected to be completed over a four-year period, and the grant
disbursed over the same period.
15.   Monitoring and Evaluation of the project's activities would be carried out to
assess implementation progress against annual monitoring indicators and to coordinate
actions of the many and diverse participants. Each entity responsible for executing the
project would report on progress of their specific components or activities. Their reports
would be consolidated by the PCU every six months and submitted to the Bank for
review. Specifically, the PCU would submit (a) a project implementation progress report
of the preceding six months against the projected implementation program outlined in the
implementation manual, and (b) a work program and budget for the following six months,
including performance indicators. A Project mid-term review would be carried out midway
through project implementation to evaluate implementation progress against planned
objectives.
16.   Project Sustainability. The project sustainability would be achieved through: (i)
transfer of responsibility for control and management of the natural forests from the State
to the village communities; (ii) existence of a transparent regulatory framework that
penalizes the purchase of mined wood, while promoting the management of trees and
forests; (iii) gradual reduction of Government's role and increased private sector's role in
management of the household energy sector; and (iv) reduced energy expenditures by
households through the purchase and proper use of improved biomass and kerosene
stoves. The Government has already put in place the first two items during project
preparation (para. 19).
17.   Participatory Approach. The project was prepared by the Government with funds
available under Cr. 1 998-MLI. During the preparation phase, a special effort was made to
identify all potential partners and collaborators with whom contact was established and the
project's objectives and methodologies discussed. These preparatory activities included various
field surveys and client consultations, such as a household energy survey, consumer testing and
demonstrations of energy efficient appliances, focus groups of consumers and formal meetings
with NGOs and staff of projects engaged in household energy-related activities. Also, both
project design and its mechanisms for evaluation are based on continuous dialogue between and



6
feedback to the project's executors: consumers and sector professionals (from small peasant
wood choppers to directors of petroleum companies).
18.   Lessons Learnt from Previous Bank Involvement. This is the first Bank-supported
household energy project in Mali. Experience from the IDA-financed Forestry I and 11 Projects
suggests that structural, institutional, and organizational changes need to be adopted before
engaging in other forest management projects in Mali. The proposed project was designed taking
into account lessons learned from these two projects as well as from the household energy project
in Niger, through the enactment of policy reforms related to forest resource pricing and fiscal
policies, the reorganization of the forestry service, and a pro-active policy to realize local
participation in the integrated management of forestry resources. The Government has already
introduced these major structural policy and institutional changes upfront during project
preparation which started in mid- 1992 and has taken considerable time because of the demand
that these reforms be realized up-front. Hence, there are no additional policy conditions in the
proposed project.
19.   Rationale for GEF Funding. The household energy sector in Mali is the most important
source of build-up of greenhouse gases. The capacity of fuelwood to capture C02 (sequestering
capacity), if it stems from a renewable source, is 1.7 kg of C02 per kg of fuelwood. The net
emissions of kerosene are three times less than those of charcoal. It is expected that some 330,000
tons of fuelwood will be saved, which will be equivalent to 560,000 tons of C02 of avoided
emissions. asuming that 50% of the wood would have been harvested in a non-sustainable
manner, this translates into a cost of less than US$10 per ton of C02, which is considerably below
the GEF yardstick of US$25 per ton of C02. Support for the proposed project would not only
contribute to the sustained management of a renewable natural resource in Mali but contribute as
well to reduce C02 emissions. In particular, GEF support for this project will focus on reducing
the first cost and market entry barriers for consumers who wish to start using kerosene or briquets
instead of charcoal. These barriers include high up-front investment cost for appropriate fuel-
efficient cooking appliances, lack of information on the availability of these appliances and how to
use them properly, and lack of an existing marketing structure for modem fuel appliances.
Overcoming these barriers, through training, demonstration and promotional campaigns, and
subsidization of the retail price of kerosene and charcoal stoves, will ensure general access to
substitution fuels for urban dwellers.
20.   The project's objectives are coherent with the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) (Report no. 13746-MLI) reviewed by the Board in January 1995, the completed
Bank's CESP for Mali, and the ongoing formulation of the Government's NEAP, all having
similar goals. In fact, the project focuses on and integrates in its approach three important
elements of the CAS, environment, private sector involvement and popular participation,
to bring about sector efficiency.
21.   Agreed Actions. As conditions of Grant effectiveness, the Government has agreed to:
(a) appoint a Marketing Specialist, a Technologist, an Agro-Economist, a Rural Sociologist, and a
Pastoralist, to be part of the Project staff, and (b) submit a timetable to increase stumpage fees for
charcoal and fuelwood to, respectively, FCFA 6 and FCFA 2 per kg, by December 1996.



7
22.   Environmental Aspects. Implementation of the strategy supported by this grant would
reduce soil degradation, bush fires, deforestation, and C02 emissions by the household sector as:
(i) sustainable natural forest management is achieved; (ii) improved carbonization techniques and
alternative (commercial) fuels are introduced; and (iii) improved wood, charcoal, kerosene, and
LPG stoves are introduced and disseminated throughout the country. The latter will also
significantly reduce indoor environmental pollution, hence foster improved working conditions for
women. Progress in these aspects will be recorded through the monitoring and evaluation system
23.   Project Benefits. The main benefits are the protection of the fragile environment around
urban areas and a reduction in C02 emissions. An attempt has been made to quantify some of the
costs and benefits. The targeted promotion of 160,000 improved wood, 68,000 improved
charcoal stoves, and 17,000 kerosene stoves under the project would result in savings in firewood
consumption that could amount to about 330,000 tons a year by 1999. In addition, the project
aims to bring 720,000 ha of natural forest under management and recover 200,000 tons of dead
wood. Assuming the economic value of wood to be between CFAF 26 -39/kg, and taking into
account only firewood savings, the rate of return on the project is calculated to be over 30%.
This conservative estimate takes into account neither the increase in forest cover yields, nor the
reduction in C02 emissions, or the major long-term ecological benefits, such as the positive
effects on agricultural production, the fodder situation, and soil fertility. The project would
improve living standards of rural populations in affected areas and stabilize employment
opportunities in the firewood trade. Increased and proper use of kerosene and charcoal stoves
would also reduce the cost of cooking for low-income urban consumers and cooking time and
make food preparation easier.
24.   Risks. The project is new and innovative in Mali and will encounter technical and
institutional obstacles. The structural policy and institutional reforms introduced by the
Government would help reduce these obstacles. The major risks are (a) complex coordination
and implementation arrangements; (b) uncertainty whether consumers will accept and buy the new
kerosene and charcoal stoves; and (c) uncertainty whether the villages are willing to participate in
management of the natural forest. The following actions will be taken to minimize these risks: (a)
a national coordination committee will be established to monitor and evaluate coordination and
implementation of all activities in the household energy sector; (b) during project preparation,
detailed market studies were conducted to determine the market profile for the new stoves, while
during project execution systematic consumer consultation, beneficiary assessment and feed-back
from the monitoring and evaluation system will provide information to alert project management
to lack of progress and allow adjustments to be made in the project's approach; and (c) a national
ICE campaign, including visits by extension agents, will ensure the villagers' participation.

Note: Figures in brackets refer to amounts financed by the GEF grant and the Netherlands.
(a)  Refers to procurement through national and international shopping, limited international
bidding, and specialist services.
(b)  Refers to items financed by France and Germany on a parallel basis, as well as Government's contibution
to the financing of incremental operating costs.
(c)   Aerial photographs and satellite imagery to be financed by the Netherlands.
1.     All items financed by the GEF grant would be procured according to the Bank's
procurement Guidelines. Items financed by the Netherlands would be managed by the
Bank and their procurement would also follow Bank's procurement guidelines. Items
financed on a parallel basis by France and Germany would be procured according to the
donors' own procurement guidelines.
2.     Civil works (total cost: US$364,000) would be financed by the Netherlands and
procured through National Competitive Bidding (NCB) using procedures and standard
bidding documents developed by the Executing Agency for Public Works (AGETIPE)
which are acceptable to the Bank, because the amounts of individual contracts would not
likely attract foreign bidders. Goods financed under the Project would include vehicles,
office equipment, audio-visual equipment and materials, and spare parts. Most of the
vehicles would be procured in the first year of the project, except for replacement

vehicles, and could be grouped into packages of at least US$200,000 and procured on the
basis of International Competitive Bidding (ICB) for an estimated total cost of
US$583,000 in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD loans
and IDA credits. Goods procured under contracts estimated to cost less than US$200,000
equivalent each would be suitable for procurement through National Competitive Bidding
under procedures acceptable to the Bank provided the aggregate amount of such
procurement does not exceed US$1.2 million equivalent. The remaining goods, which
cannot be grouped into bid packages of at least US$200,000 equivalent, would be
procured on the basis of price quotations from at least three suppliers, provided the
aggregate amount of such procurement does not exceed US$0.2 million equivalent.
Consultants and other experts (about US$3.1 million) would be selected in accordance
with Bank Guidelines for the Use of Consultants (August 1981) and would be employed
on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Association. Service contractsfor aerial
photographs and satellite imagery of an estimated value of US$100,000 would be
purchased through ICB.
3.    Contracts for works and goods above a threshold of US$200,000 equivalent each,
and contracts for firms and individual consultants, respectively, above a threshold of
US$100,000 and US$50,000 equivalent each would be subject to prior review. However,
for firms and individual consultant contracts below, respectively, the US$100,000 and
US$50,000 threshold, the Bank would review the terms of reference, single source hiring,
assignments of a critical nature as determined by the Bank and amendments of contracts
raising the contract to these thresholds. Procurement information will be collected and
recorded as follows: (a) prompt reporting of contract award information by the Grantee;
(b) comprehensive semi-annual reports to the Bank by the Grantee indicating: (i) revised
cost estimates for individual contracts and the total project, including best estimates of
allowances for physical and price contingency; (ii) revising timing of procurement actions,
including advertising, bidding, contract award; and (iii) completion time for individual
contracts; compliance with aggregate limits on specified methods of procurement; and (iv)
use of standard bidding documents.

3.    Disbursement. The proposed GEF grant of US$2.5 million equivalent would
finance project items based on the following proportions of project total cost: (a)
vehicles, equipment, materials: 100% of foreign expenditures and 90% of local
expenditures; (b) incremental operating costs: 90%; and specialist services: 100%. All of
the above are net of taxes and duties which would be borne by the Government.
4.    Disbursement of the GEF grants will be fully documented except for expenditures
valued at less than US$100,000 equivalent which will be disbursed against Statement of
Expenditures (SOEs). To expedite project implementation, a special account will be
opened in a commercial Bank acceptable to the Bank and maintained and operated on
terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank. All GEF financed expenditures of less than
US$100,000 equivalent will be financed from a Special Account that will be replenished
with appropriate supporting documentation and an up-to-date Bank statement and
reconciliation statement, except for expenditures below US$100,000 which the Grantee
will be permitted to submit on the basis of SOEs. SOE documents will be kept in the
project office for immediate inspection by Bank staff during supervision missions and for
annual audits. No direct payment request under the equivalent of US$100,000 will be
accepted. Purchase of the kerosene and charcoal stoves as well as for the charcoal kiln
chimneys would be done by one or more private sector entrepreneurs who have been selected
based on their financial and technical offers to participate in the project. The temporary GEF
subsidy for these products will be passed on to the consumer through a corresponding lower
retail price.

(f) Planned date of effectiveness:                                                         July 1995

Project preparation was based on the findings of a mission to Mali in June 1992, consisting of Messrs. Willem Floor
(Senior Energy Planner) and Kjell Christoffersen (Consultant) and has been conducted by subsequent missions in
1993 and 1994 in conjunction with supervision missions of Cr. 1 998-MLI led by Mr. Nadjib Sefta (Senior Energy
Specialist). The timelag between project preparation and Board presentation is due to the fact that major structural
policy and institutional reforms had to be implemented up-front; this took two years to materialize. The Peer
Reviewers are Messrs. Claude Heimo (AF3AE) and Robert Clement-Jones (AFTES). Mr. Jean-Louis Sarbib, Ms.
Silvia B. Sagari, and Mr. Emmerich Schebeck are, respectively, Department Director, Managing Division Chief and
Project Advisor, for the operation.

Project preparation has been based on the findings of a mission to Mali in June 1992, consisting of Messrs. Willern Floor (Senior Energy
Planner) and Leif Christoffersen (Consultant) and has been conducted by subsequent missions in 1993 and 1994 in conjunction with
supervision missions of Cr. 1998-MLI led by Mr. Nadjib Sefta (Senior Energy Specialist). The timelag between project preparation and
presentation is due to the fact that major structural policy and institutional reforms were demanded up-front which took two years to
materialize. The Peer Reviewers are Messrs. Claude Heimo (AF3AE) and Robert Clement-Jones (AFTES). Mr. Jean-Louis Sarbib,
Ms. Silvia B. Sagari, and Mr. Emnmerich Schebeck are Department Director, Managing Division Chief and Project Advisor, respectively,
for the operation.

HOUSEHOLD ENERGY PROJECT
PART II: Technical Appendix
BACKGROUND
A.   INTRODUCTION
1.1   Mali is one of the largest countries in Afiica, with a surface area of 1.24 million
km2. The population is estimated at 9 million in 1992. By the year 2000, the population
is expected to exceed 10 million. Mali's population is still fundamentally rural (80 percent
of total population). Population densities throughout the country are quite low: only 1
inhabitant per km2 in the semi-desertified zones of the north and up to 30 inhabitants per
km2 near Segou, the most populated area. Nonetheless, the urban population has grown
much more rapidly than the rural population (annual rates estimated at 5.8 and 2.3 percent
respectively from 1988 to 2000); by the year 2000, the urban population is expected to
represent 30 percent of the total population.
1.2   Of the eight main cities in Mali, only the capital, Bamako is a major urban centre.
Bamako's population of about 800,000 inhabitants (1990) alone accounts for 43 percent of
the urban population. All economic, financial, administrative and political activities are
centralized in the capital, thus stimulating the strong migratory influx which fuels
Bamako's population growth. The urbanization rates in other regions remain modest. The
second largest town, Segou, has only 100,000 inhabitants. By contrast, the growth rate
for most secondary towns is quite high. For example Gao and Koutiala both have
population growth rates of about 10 percent per year. This rapid growth creates pressure
on the infrastructure, which generally is not designed to support concentrated population
influxes.
1.3   Mali can be subdivided into six agricultural and ecological zones. The country's
ecological diversity is reflected in the variety of vegetation types which make up its
wooded areas, from the scrub savannah found in the north (producing less than 10 m3/ha)
to tangled undergrowth covering 25 % of the southern part of the country (production
volumes of 20 to 40 m3/ha) to the forests of the Sudanese-Guinean area (production
volumes of 50 to 80 m3/ha on average, with maximum levels rising to more than 100
m3lha in the great forests of the west).

B.    THE ECONOMY
1.4   Mali is one of Africa's poorest countries, with per capita GDP of US$310 in 1992.
The country is landlocked and has some mineral resources, in particular gold. The
economy is largely dependent on agriculture, which is the primary source of income for
most of the population and accounts for the largest share of product exports (cotton,
especially). Agricultural production levels have suffered during the last two decades due
to droughts, depleted fertility of soils, and traditional farming techniques. To combat
these problems, the Government of Mali has implemented a wide range of economic and
sectoral policy reforms. The underlying objective has been to improve the competitiveness
of the economy, and lay the foundation for the sustained longer term growth needed to
help raise the standards of living and alleviate poverty. These reforms have allowed
greater play of market forces in the determination of economic outcomes and the removal
of some bottlenecks to private sector participation in economic activity. Their impact is
evidenced by improvement in economic performance over the adjustment period. The
overall fiscal deficit declined from 12% of GDP in 1991, to 9.6% in 1993. Despite
declining terms of trade due largely to falling world market cotton prices, the current
account balance improved marginally from 14.1% of GDP in 1991 to 13.8% in 1993.
Inflation has been kept in check (under 3%/year), and real GDP growth rose from an
annual average of less than 2% over the first half of the 1980s, to about 3% between 1988
and 1993. On January 12, 1994 the Government of Mali, in consultation with the other
member countries of the CFA zone, decided to strengthen its adjustment strategy. The
fixed parity of the CFA franc was changed from 50 to 100 FCFA per French Franc.
C.    ENERGY RESOURCES
1.5   Mali is rich in energy resources, especially hydro-electric, forestry and agricultural
biomass, and solar energy. The country possesses a large hydroelectric potential of nearly
1050 MW installable capacity, with guaranteed power of 800 MW. Hydroelectricity
produced by the Selingue, and Sotuba dams meet only part of national electricity demand
(75 percent in 1992). Mali also has substantial wood resources which would allow up to
70 percent of the population (in the Koulikoro, Segou, Kayes and Sikasso regions) to be
self-sufficient in energy supply for several decades. Finally, there also are renewable
energy resources in the country: solar energy, agricultural biomass (some of which is only
marginally usable, such as the rice husks, a by-product from the Office de Niger's rice
processors, peanut shells and cotton stems). However, Mali currently has no fossil fuels,
and petroleum product consumption is entirely dependent on imports. The cost of
petroleum product imports represents a substantial burden for the country, despite the
relatively small volumes which are imported (less than 200,000 tons annually). Because of
the land-locked position of the country, petroleum product imports represented 17 percent
of total imports and absorb 57 percent of export earnings in 1992.



19
D.    ENERGY CONSUMPTION
1.6    Mali's energy consumption is relatively low, despite the abundance of indigenous
energy resources. The energy balance for 1992 (Table 1.1) shows per capita energy
consumption of only 203 kg of oil equivalent (kgoe) per year for all consuming sectors
and fuels, or less than one-third of the per capita energy consumption in Ghana.
Fuelwood is the most widely consumed energy source, even by urban households and by a
non-negligible proportion of the productive sector: it represents 88 percent of total
domestic energy consumption. The predominance of this fuel emphasizes the limited
reach of modern energy (petroleum fuels and electricity) in Mali: consumption of modern
energy is 22 kgoe per capita per year.

1.7    Households comprise the largest energy consuming sector, representing 88 percent
of total final energy demand -- one of the world's highest relative consumption rates for
the household sector. Many factors contribute to the dominance of the household sector
in national energy consumption data: the number of vehicles is small and inter-regional
trade is limited; most modern economic sectors are underdeveloped; and most of the
agricultural sector has very restricted access to petroleum fuels and/or electricity.
E.    HOUSEHOLD ENERGY SECTOR
1.8    As in most Sahelian countries, fuelwood (used mostly for cooking) comprises
approximately 90% of the energy consumed in Malian households. Charcoal is used to
some extent in urban areas (11 % in Bamako), and its use is expanding rapidly. LPG is
used in only I % of households in Bamako. Several analyses have drawn attention to
woodfuel deficiencies in Mali. A detailed inventory taken in 1987 (Project to Inventory
Wood Resources in Mali - PIRL) gives the most reliable overview of the potential of
Mali's forests. According to this inventory, the current situation is less dramatic than
previously thought, particularly in the south. The Sikasso and Koulikoro regions, for
example, are heavily forested: 60 to 80 % of the surface area is covered in old growth
timber (about 10 million hectares). Annual productivity of the accessible portions of these
natural formations can supply nearby urban populations for several decades, although
pockets of resource degradation around urban centers are developing. By comparison,
northern regions (which were hard hit by the drought) are experiencing increasing
woodfuel deficits as the resource base is being mined and gradually destroyed if no actions



20
is taken. The costs of transporting woodfuels from forested regions to towns or under-
served regions are quite expensive. As a result, wood frequently is cut along access routes
by peasants (for their own consumption) and by forestry operators (for marketing in
towns) in order to reduce these costs. This practice invites over exploitation of resources,
further damaging the local forest resource potential.
1.9   Mali's energy situation is closely interconnected with the general socio-economic
situation. Access to modem fuels such as petroleum and electricity in the peri-urban areas
is an indicator of a country's level of development and wealth. Mali's present economic
difficulties are similar to those of other countries in the Sahel, where expanding urban
poverty is reflected in a deterioration in conditions for access to modem energy service.
The electrification rate in Bamako has declined in real terms, even though three-fourths of
all household electric customers are located there. In addition, consumption levels for
household customers remains low. The distribution systems for petroleum products are
satisfactory in the main urban areas and distribution margins for small quantities seem
reasonable, but unit consumption is low.
1.10  Development of alternative energy sources (solar and other) has been attempted,
and has met with some success. However, various institutional and financial barriers,
which the Government wants to reduce, constrain the larger-scale use of these energy
sources. Most rural areas will not have access to petroleum products for a long time to
come, and thus will not have access to the variety of services which could be provided by
using petroleum fuels. Temporary improvements may include greater use of small carts
since it eases transport of wood and water (traditionally done by women), and the
development of hand or foot pumps.
1.11  If current household energy situation persists, low and middle income households
in the urban areas will continue to have little access to energy services because the choices
are limited. For example, households may have a choice between a four-burner cooker
which is expensive and ill-adapted to national dietary habits, or continue to use the three-
stone stove for cooking. For lighting, the choice is between expensive (and sometimes
impossible) connection to the national electric grid or kerosene lamps. Experience with
improved stoves and the recent move towards LPG use shows that intermediate energy
materials could be distributed successfully to the middle class and eventually to part of the
lower income classes.
1.12  Urban households without electricity are not necessarily those without financial
resources. In Bamako an estimated two out of five households with an average income
and one out of five well-to-do households do not have electricity. Half of the low-income
households also are not connected to the grid. These households typically own one or
two kerosene lamps. Middle income households own three or more lamps and sound
equipment (battery operated radio-cassette players). More than 10 % of affluent
households also own battery-operated television sets. Several thousand units of battery-
operated equipment is owned in Bamako and Segou. In Mopti and Kouiala, equipment
owned by households not connected to the grid typically includes sound equipment (half)
and two electric lamps (two-thirds). Several dozen small electric generators also can be



21
found in medium- to high-income neighborhoods not connected to the grid (Kalaban,
Magnanbougo, etc.). Some have even solar lighting kits.
1.13   The household energy sector has an annual commercial turnover of 10 billion
CFAF, or approximately US$17 million (twice the turnover of the electric power sector)
and provides some 15,000 jobs in the rural areas. This level of economic importance,
however, is far lower than it ought to be, because market prices for fuelwood and charcoal
only represent their financial, not their economic costs. The rural producer, in effect,
subsidizes the urban consumer who, therefore, has little incentive to use energy efficiently.
1.14   Presently, there is little, if any, control over the harvesting of woodfuels and legal
restrictions are largely ignored. There is virtually no control exercised over woodcutters,
the production areas, or the quantities of woodfuels produced and marketed. The present
(low) level of woodfuels taxation is of little financial importance and collection is only
sporadic at best. This, de facto, passive policy of non-intervention in the woodfuel sector
cannot continue given the growing pressure on wood resources that remain.
1.15   In general, urban dwellers consume less wood than the inhabitants in rural areas
and medium-sized towns. Even so, woodfuel consumption in Bamako and the main urban
areas (particularly charcoal) has a greater impact on the environment than woodfuel
consumption in rural areas where the population density relative to available wood
resources generally is low and exploitation is dispersed and non-commercial. Commercial
fuielwood networks which are springing up in smaller towns cause more environmental
damage, but the volumes of wood involved remain limited. In Bamako and the main
urban areas, by contrast, commercial networks dorninate the market, often resulting in
deforested belts along access routes. This is especially true in areas used for charcoal
production.

F.    INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK
1.16  Mali's institutional framework for the energy sector is relatively complex and
weak, making it difficult to implement a systematic, coherent energy policy.
Approximately 20 departments, agencies, or organizations manage the sector. In total,
nearly 50 public or parastatal organizations are active to some extent in the energy sector.
This is because of the dispersed nature of the sector, which has led to the creation of
multiple coordinating or ad-hoc advisory committees.
1.17  Energy sector planning is the responsibility of the National Hydraulics and Energy
Department (NHED) within the Ministry for Mines, Hydraulics, and Energy (MIMBE).
This department is mainly concerned with hydroelectric activities: of the 450 persons on
the staff of the Energy and Dams Division, only five work on energy matters. There are
plans for reorganizing the NHED which will strengthen all planning, regulatory, and
monitoring functions related to the energy sector within the Energy and Dams Division.
1 .18  In its management of the energy sector, the NHED collaborates with other
departments and with numerous operators with activities in the sector. Within the
electricity subsector -- the subsector most directly supervised by the NHED -- the major
operator is Energie du Mali (EDM), the national power utility. The NHED also is
responsible for promoting the development of renewable energy in coordination with two
organizations: the nationally oriented Solar Energy Laboratory (SEL), which is under the
supervision of the MMHIE, and the regionally oriented Centre for Solar Energy Research
(CSER). Two ongoing renewable projects, being implemented by NHED, are the Special
Energy Program (SEP) and the Solar Equipment Maintenance Unit (SEMU). Finally, the
secretariat-of the National Committee for Butane Gas Promotion is part of the NHED.
This Committee was created in 1990 under a CILSS/EEC regional program for promoting
LPG to substitute for woodfuels.
1.19  Among the priorities of the National Plan to Prevent Desertification (NPPD) are
management and control of woodfuels supply, and improved use of woodfuels.
Implementation of the NPPD is being coordinated and supervised by an inter-ministerial
organization, the Sectoral Group for Monitoring the NPPD, which is headed by the
Ministry of Rural Development (NRD). National Waterways and Forests Department
(NWFD) within the MRD is responsible for the forestry sector, including woodfuels. Its
main functions are to monitor forest exploitation, manage classified forests, and verifying
the flows of forestry products. The NWFD staff numbers 780 forestry agents and nearly
700 non-foresters organized into eight Regional Divisions and five "Operations". The
latter are parastatal organizations and include the OAPF and OARS which, in addition to
its main management tasks, produces and markets fuelwood and charcoal. The NWFVD
also is the headquarters for the National Advisory Committee for Improved Stoves, which
coordinates all improved stove projects. Both the NPPD and the NWFD staff have not
been very successful in realizing the NPPD objectives. The Government has realized this
and has taken action to correct this situation, inter alia, through the formulation of a
National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP), the restructuring of the NWFD and the



23
adoption of new laws and regulations which provide incentives to local communities to
manage their natural resource base in an efficient manner.
1.20  Promotion and distribution of improved stoves is the objective of several projects;
the main project is under the jurisdiction of the National Department for Social Affairs
(NDSA). In addition to programs administered by the Regional Divisions for Waterways
and Forests, assistance for stove distribution was provided in the 1980s by the Mali
National Women's Union (UNFM). Promotion of butane gas is mainly the province of
private petroleum distributors, who have introduced portable butane cook stoves in the
market.
MAIN ISSUES IN THE HOUSEHOLD ENERGY SECTOR
Several issues characterize the use of energy in the household sector. A clear
understanding of these issues is necessary for resolving the major problems in the sector.
A.   WOOD CONSUMPTION AND GROWTH IN CHARCOAL USE
2.1   Wood is currently the dominant energy resource, even in urban areas, and is likely
to remain so in the medium term. It is used primarily for cooking and for secondary
energy needs such as water heating. In rural areas, daily per capita fuelwood consumption
varies between 0.7 and 2.4 kg for an average-sized family. This variation is linked to the
availability of wood resources and thus to the time needed to collect wood. With the
exception of kerosene used for lighting, modem fuels are rarely used in rural areas. In
urban areas, wood also dominates as the primary fuel. In Bamako, nearly 9 out of 10
households use wood, and the proportion is even higher in the urban areas of the interior.
However, most families also use several "auxiliary" fuels, such as butane gas and charcoal.
2.2   There are also major variations in urban fuelwood consumption levels, both in
terms of average consumption in each urban area as linked to the price of wood, and in
terms of the energy intensity of activities for which fuelwood is utilized. For example,
average wood consumption in Koutiala (located in the Sudanese area where wood
resources are abundant and where beer brewing consumes large quantities of wood) is
four times higher than consumption in Gao where wood is scarce. In Gao fuelwood is
mostly used for cooking, and the price is three times higher than in Koutiala.
Furthermore, the averages hide major variations in per capita consumption based on
household size. In Bamako and Segou, for example, large households only consume 0.7
kg per capita, per day, whereas daily per capita consumption for small families can reach
as high as three kilos. Eating habits also contribute to major variations in consumption
levels for fuelwood and charcoal. Traditional Malian cuisine (grains and long-simmered
sauces) is very energy intensive. A number of recent modifications to traditional eating
habits -- mostly in younger, well-to-do small households -- have led to a decrease in
consumption levels of wood an charcoal. Some of these modifications, which often



24
happen simultaneously with the household switching its primary fuel, is a welcome sign
and helps.
2.3    Despite the noted variations in consumption levels, the typical household
expenditures for fuelwood are relatively constant from one urban area to another,
although slightly higher in Bamako (16 CFAF per capita/day, as opposed to 12 to 13
CFAF in other urban centers in 1989). Based on these figures, energy expenditures in a
typical household (8 people), with fuelwood consumed as primary fuel, and charcoal and
kerosene used as auxiliary fuels, are about 6,000 CFAF/month in the capital and 5,000
CFAF in other urban areas. This represents a little less than 10 % of total monthly
household expenditures, the percentage is slightly higher for poorer households.
2.4    Urban charcoal consumption has grown steadily: in Bamako, the percentage of
households using charcoal as the primary cooking fuel went from 3 % in 1978 to 11 % in
1989. In the future, increased use of charcoal is probable since the fuel is more convenient
and better adapted to modern life. It is gaining prominence in households in the capital
and in the northern urban areas. Charcoal production induces further environmental
pressure, however, because of low carbonization yields (approximately eight tons of wood
are needed to produce one ton of charcoal with a calorific value only twice that of wood;
and, efficiencies for charcoal cook stoves are similar to those for wood-burning metal
cook stoves).
2.5   Use of butane gas (LPG) by the most affluent households and even by a small
number of middle class households also has increased. About 20% of households in the
capital own single-burner gas cook stoves, 13% in Mopti and from three to seven percent
in the other main urban areas. This corresponds to more than 20,000 cook stoves, a
significant level of market penetration given the obstacles linked to initial investments, the
cost of gas, and users' apprehensions about appliance safety. Few, however, cook
regularly with gas (one percent of households surveyed in Bamako). Decisions to switch
to gas as a primary fuel are restrained by its current price (which is not taxed or
subsidized). Finally, use of kerosene for cooking is limited for two reasons: kerosene
cook stoves are poorly adapted for use in Malian cuisine and the kerosene price is heavily
taxed.
2.6    There are other woodfuel consumers in addition to household consumers
(industries, small craftsmen, service sector, communal food and beverage services) but
their impact on total woodfuel consumption is relatively small. Altogether, they
accounted for four percent of Bamako's total wood consumption and 10 % of its charcoal
consumption in 1989. In certain urban areas, these figures are probably higher, since these
fuels are used for traditional activities such as drying fish (Mopti) and brewing beer
(Koutiala). Furthermore, informal sector producers are micro-consumers -- the largest
among them, the iron masons, average a daily consumption of only 10 kg of charcoal.
Still, expenditures for charcoal can represent a significant percentage of the turnover of
small producers such as iron masons, jewelers or launderers, whereas expenditures for
wood have a much smaller impact on the family's finances.



25
B.    C02 EMISSIONS
2.7   Because of the dominant role of biomass fuels in total energy consumption, the
contribution of other sectors of the economy to C02 emissions is negligible in Mali.
Currently C02 emissions in Mali, excluding the household sector, are estimated at 0.01
ton/capita per year. The estimated amount emitted by the household sector is 0.3
ton/capita per year, or 30 times higher than the non-household sector. It has been
estimated that Mali adds some 2 million tons C02 to the global C02 balance, mainly from
energy use stemming from non-sustainable biomass harvesting. The dominant role of the
urban household sector as a C02 emitter as well as the increasing consumption of
charcoal in Mali in combination with the high urban population growth (7% per year)
require the reduction of urban C02 emissions. More efficient stove/fuel combinations
emit smaller quantities of C02, while accomplishing a similar cooking task. Relative to
kerosene and natural gas, charcoal emits 2.5 times more C02 and wood 3.6 times more.
However, for a proper environmental comparison one needs to take into account not only
end-use, but also conversion, transport and replenishment of the fuel. Fuelwood, if grown
on a sustainable basis, does not, in principle, contribute to net additional C02 emissions,
for example. Wood is grown through photosynthesis while capturing C02 from the
atmosphere, which is again released during combustion. For the global C02 balance it
makes no difference whether wood decomposes naturally or is burnt in a stove. Therefore
the net emission from wood is only 0.3 kg C02 per kg, while the figures for charcoal,
kerosene and gas are respectively: 9.4, 3.1 and 5.1. From these figures it is clear that the
use of charcoal should be discouraged and the use of less noxious fuels such as kerosene
promoted. In a "business as usual" scenario, fuelwood consumption will rise from a total
of 4 million tons in 1987 to 5.2 million tons in the year 2007 as population increases,
exerting further pressure on the forest exploitation zones. If this increasing consumption
is not offset by equal increases in wood production, there will also be a net increase in
total C02 emissions in the country of 9.4 kg of C02 per kg of charcoal.
C.    MARKET PENETRATION BY IMPROVED COOK STOVES
2.8    Mali's distribution rate for improved stoves is quite high relative to other Sahelian
countries. For example, 71 % of the households in Bamako using wood as the primary
fuel own at least one improved cook stove; more than two-thirds of these are portable
metal stoves. Comparable figures for Burkina Faso, Niger, and Senegal are at best 20%.
Real savings in wood consumption attributed to use of improved stoves amount to
between 10 and 20 %, depending on whether the household has one or several improved
cook stoves. These figures are even more remarkable, since in Bamako only 35 to 40% of
the main meals actually are prepared using the improved stoves.
2.9   Successful market penetration by metal improved cook stoves has been achieved at
all socio-economic levels of the urban population. There are several reasons for this
success. First, the price differential between the most popular model of improved stove
and a traditional cook stove is only about 500 CFAF. This differential easily can be
amortized in less than a month on average, assuming the stove is used efficiently (wood



26
savings of about 25%). Promotional and educational activities sponsored under various
projects also have had an influence. Of special note are the SEL/VITA project, the
DNAS/GTZ project and the joint UNFM/DNEF program. These three projects were
launched in response to a March 1986 law requiring the use of improved stoves. Surveys
record a high level of satisfaction among female consumers with regard to the marketing
network, prices and performance of the stoves. The success of these improved cook stove
programs has led to the creation of an autonomous, private-sector for cook stove
distribution, especially in Bamako. There is a need for such private-sector initiatives and
enhanced consumer information programs to be continued in Bamako and initiated or
strengthened in the urban areas of the interior, especially in Gao, Tombouctou and Mopti.
Wood shortages are felt more keenly in day-to-day life in these urban areas; thus the need
for improved stoves programs here is more urgent and the programs are more likely to be
successful.
2.10  It also should be noted that promotion of improved woodstoves typically has a
high economic rate of return. Under conservative hypotheses of performance and use
(10% wood savings), a minimum annual savings of 15,000 to 20,000 tons of wood could
be achieved by the sale of about 50,000 improved stoves. This assumes both direct and
"indirect" stove distribution -- the direct distribution under "official" programs and the
indirect distribution arising from spontaneous actions by small entrepreneurs. The
economic value of wood savings of this magnitude is estimated at US$500,000 per year.
D.    PRICE AND COST COMPARISONS FOR HOUSEHOLD FUELS
2.11  A theoretical and empirical comparison between cooking fuels (ESMAP, 1992)
-- wood, charcoal, kerosene, and gas -- showed that, using the current price structure,
wood is the least expensive fuel; charcoal is 1.3 times more costly than wood, and the
prices of gas and kerosene are about 1.6 times higher than charcoal. This relationship has
not changed very much since the 1994 devaluation, due to the fact that the price of
charcoal has increased more than that of kerosene between 1989-1994. Gas purchases are
only marginally more expensive for the consumer than purchasing kerosene. For most
Malian households, the switch from wood to charcoal is considered a luxury, reserved for
an elite group of small, relatively well-to-do households, because of its perceived higher
cost. Yet the actual cost differential is quite modest, making charcoal well within the reach
of many households. Cooking with gas requires that the consumer breach a totally
different cost threshold. For an average household, using gas as a primary cooking fuel
would require expenditures of about 20 % of the family budget (not including other
energy requirements such as hot water heating, etc.), which represents a substantial
financial burden. Thus the fuel is not readily accessible to most households.
2.12  Urban households in the interior typically also find wood the financially most
attractive fuel. Although retail prices for woodfuels vary significantly from one urban area
to another, even between neighborhoods in the same urban area, and between seasons, the
differences between them are such that wood is the favored fuel. The lowest average
prices were found in Koutiala, where a kilogram of wood costs 6 CFAF and a kilogram of



27
charcoal was sold for 40 CFAF. The highest prices, in 1989, were in Gao: 19 CFAF/kg
for wood and 76 CFAF/kg for charcoal, almost identical to prices in Bamako -- 19 CFAF
and 66 CFAF, respectively. These prices are similar to woodfuel prices in other Sahelian
urban areas. The evolution of wood and charcoal prices generally have been stagnant
throughout the 1980s; in real terms, prices actually have decreased since 1984 when Mali
joined the group of West African countries using the CFAF as common currency. Several
factors contribute to this phenomenon, which although contradictory to the increasing
pefi-urban area of the resource, is common in most Sahelian countries: increased
competition among producers and, to a lesser extent, among other parties acting
throughout the supply network; decreased opportunity costs of peasant labor and the drop
in the real price of petroleum products.
2.13  The price structure for wood and charcoal is determined by the structure of the
supply network. In most cases, the network is so complex with its numerous transfers
that it is possible to describe the price structure only in general terms. Producer costs can
account for 30 to 60 % of the retail price depending on the distance between the
production zone and the urban consumption centre. For example, round wood purchased
along the roadside at a distance of 30 km from Bamako sold for 13 to 14 CFAF/kg at the
end of 1988, as compared to 6 CFAF/kg for wood sold 60 km away from the capital
(along the Bamako-Segou roadway). However, distance is only one factor affecting
producer costs. Other factors include access to and type of transport employed, access to
wood resources, inventory levels of woodfuel resources and availability of wood for
purchase from roadside vendors. The price of standing wood fluctuates between 3 and 10
CFAF/kg (not including the opportunity cost of the land). Thus it was not profitable, with
wood prices stagnating, to plant trees specifically to supply fuelwood, even in peri-urban
zones. After the devaluation of January 1994, the prices of all fuels increased. The price
of wood in Bamako increased to FCFA 19/kg and charcoal to FCFA 87/kg, which
represents an increase of about 20%. However, even this increase has not affected the
interest in planting trees.
2.14   Margins for carriers and urban marketers also vary according to the number of
parties involved and the type of sale (wholesale, discounters, retail). Available statistics
suggest that urban retailers earn margins of about 30 to 50 %, with carriers taking
between 10% and 30 % of the retail price. Similar margins have been noted where the
markets for wood and charcoal are large and competitive. Likewise, the numerous small
retailers (a majority of whom are women) generate large margins; however, net revenues
tend to be low.
2.15  Retail prices for petroleum fuels are higher than their economic costs
-- significantly so in the case of kerosene, but less so in the case of gas, because of high
taxes and margins. The prices of household fuels (in terms of useful energy) were
compared under existing (1994) market conditions. The cost of butane is more than twice
that of kerosene, in terms of useful energy. Modifying the terms for fuel competition
appears therefore to be a necessity.



28
2.16 The financial advantage of using wood is strong in most regions of the country
because retail prices for wood is lower. The economic differential is even more
pronounced since wood resources are more abundant in southern regions (and thus the
economic cost of wood is lower). By contrast, the financial comparison of costs in
northern urban areas yields results almost equivalent to those in Bamako. In these urban
areas, however, standing wood has a economic value considerably higher than in other
parts of the country (39 CFAF/kg). Thus the perspectives for substituting petroleum fuels
for wood are more favorable in these areas.
E.    MARKETS FOR SUBSTITUTION FUELS
2.17  The surveys of choices between household fuels identified two parameters which
most influence the decision to use a substitute fuel: the availability of local wood supplies
and the degree of urbanization. Women in Bamako, Mopti and Gao presented with a
choice of cooking equipment displayed a strong and immediate interest in the use of
charcoal, as well as a long-term preference for gas. The potential markets for substitution
fuels in Bamako and the southern urban areas tend to differ from those in the northern
urban areas. Substitution in the south is based on a desire for convenience and modernity.
2.18 By contrast, substitution in northern urban areas has a different nature since
woodfuels are becoming increasingly scarce and expensive. In these urban areas, where
50 to 60 % of the households expressed a willingness to switch fuels, kerosene is better
positioned than gas to become the primary substitution fuel among well-to-do and middle
income populations. This advantage is conditional, however: kerosene would have to be
cheaper, i.e. priced more closely to its economic cost.
F.    OPTIONS FOR IMPROVING THE SITUATION IN REGIONS WITH WOOD DEFICITS
2.19 Beyond programs to promote substitution fuels or improved stoves, as discussed
above, there are two other options for improving wood supply in areas with resource
deficits (mainly the northern regions): modify woodfuel prices or develop new sources of
supply (plantations, transporting wood and charcoal from the southern regions).
However, these actions will have only a limited impact on the situation. Urban consumers
are responsive to wood prices and tend to conserve the fuel when it becomes scarce and
costly; this is evident from the differential between wood consumption levels in the
northern urban areas and those in the south. However, heavy taxation of wood to reduce
consumption has its limits. The price elasticity of wood demand is certainly less than one,
and for lower income households a large price increase would substantially increase the
relative share of wood expenditures in the total household budget. This would lead to
fewer hot meals for the family, and to less frequent sterilization of water, potentially with
detrimental health consequences.
2.20 Urban consumers also could be supplied with wood transported from longer
distances, if they are willing to pay higher fuel price Preliminary calculations show that it
is not financially viable to transport wood or even charcoal produced in the south to



29
shortage areas in the north. In the case of Gao and Tombouctou, the distances may
exceed 1000 km, and transport costs amounted to at least 15 CFAF/kg for wood and 30
CFAF/kg for charcoal in 1991. The break-even retail price given these costs plus
production costs, marketing and taxes, was considerable higher than prices obtaining in
the two urban areas. The devaluation of the FCFA has not changed this situation,
transport cost has increased as has the cost of charcoal (by 20%). The economic costs of
transporting wood produced in southern regions exceeds the economic value of standing
wood in northern regions, and therefore the option also is not economically viable for
wood, but might be viable in the case of charcoal. It is probable, however, that charcoal
transport from the south might provide an unwanted incentive for charcoal production in
the northern areas (once the market has been created), with devastating environmental
consequences for those areas. In the case of Mopti (and even for Gao and Tombouctou),
the only option under which long distance transport is likely to be viable is for woodfuels
produced from dead wood reserves along the Niger River. Another option would be the
use of charcoal; since it is more economic to transport, this fuel already is making inroads
against fuelwood in the northern urban areas. However, forestry solutions alone (tree
plantations, transporting woodfuels from southern regions) would not prove sufficient to
stem the problems of the northern region. Thus emphasis must be given to developing
infrastructure and programs to promote improved stoves and substitution by petroleum
fuels.
2.21   Various kinds of plantation projects -- dry and irrigated, large-scale industrial and
small landholders -- have been attempted in Mali, and have mostly failed because they are
not financially and economically profitable and because of lack of local participation.
Given current market prices and a cost of standing wood estimated between 11 and 13
CFAF/kg, it is not profitable for a peasant to plant trees to produce wood or charcoal.
The orientation of recent projects has been towards agroforestry wood production or
natural forest management. The latter preserves and enriches the natural forests while
producing fuelwood and other forest related products at a much lower costs than is the
case in plantation forestry. The Koulikoro Village Reforestation Project (natural forest
management), for example, estimates the cost of standing wood in managed forests at only
4 FCFA/kg.
2.22  The increasing preference for charcoal in Bamako and the northern urban areas
means that relatively more charcoal will be produced and marketed in these regions where
wood is most scarce. It is important, however, that there be some kind of control, since:
(i) without Forest Service control and supervision, continued and increasing conversion of
wood from the already degraded natural forests to charcoal will only exacerbate their
environmental degradation; (ii) with Forest Service control and supervision, charcoal
production can be oriented towards depleting the large dead wood reserves currently
stored in the many "wood cemeteries" throughout the regions.
2.23   Neither of these options are available to rural populations, who more or less must
make do with the available resources. In the northern delta regions in particular, the
poorest households often resort to "emergency" fuels -- agricultural and animal residues,
straws, etc. -- as a complement to wood during certain times of the year. Instead, an



30
appropriate option in these areas may be to make agricultural residues into briquettes for
use as energy. A preliminary market potential study for agricultural residues in the form
of briquettes will be undertaken under the project.
G.    INSTITUTIONAL, REGULATORY AND FISCAL FRAMEWORK IS ILL-ADAPTED TO
MANAGING WOOD RESOURCES
2.24  Faced with formalization of commercial wood production on a national scale and
with the enforcement requirements of a restrictive forestry code (particularly against illegal
wood harvesting), the NWFD does not have the personnel or other resources needed to
manage the approximately 10 million ha of forests under its jurisdiction. The Forest
Service must, therefore, opt for a different management approach -- delegating the
management and control of protected forests to the local population. In other protected
land areas (the remaining wooded surfaces, including long-term fallow lands), woodfuel
production occurs on an even larger scale and is poorly monitored. Management of such
areas must occur within the larger context of natural resource management of village and
inter-village territories which would require contractual arrangements between the
Government and the local authorities whereby the control and management of the natural
resource base would be transferred from the Government to the local authorities. Such
arrangements were not possible under the old Land Use or Forestry Codes. Therefore,
the Government has restructured the NWFD and has adopted a number of laws and
regulations in December 1994, which encourage local villages to manage their natural
resource base. Under the new regulations, the Forest Service has assumed a new role as
supervisor of actions implemented jointly by the Forest Service and the local participants.
Legislation for wood harvesting permits and for fiscal policy related to the forests has
been modified accordingly. In particular, the rural communities have been given the
financial means required to manage the use of their forest lands through the collection by
the participating rural community of the tax on woodfuels.
2.25  The previous woodfuel fiscal policy, based on a uniform tax applied throughout
the entire country, invited rather than discouraged overexploitation. Under the old
system, exploitation of the scarce resource was taxed at a lower relative rate. The relation
between the relative tax rate and the value of standing wood varied inversely to the
distance between the production centre and the consumption centre; i.e., the more
intensively wood was exploited near consumption centers, the lower its relative tax rate.
Furthermore, this relation varied directly with the retail price of wood which meant, for
example, that a producer who supplied Gao, where resources are scarce, had a lower
relative tax rate than a producer who supplied Koutiala, where resources are abundant.
Thus, in order to provide incentives for conserving forest resources, the woodfuel fiscal
policies have been reformed, including the development of strategies to relocate forestry
exploitation where production of woodfuel is more economically viable and
environmentally sound.
2.26   Woodfuel transport and marketing largely remain traditional, with the exception of
Bamako. Results of the market study for forest products conducted as part of the Second



31
Forestry Project confirm that the woodfuel supply systems for urban areas are rigid,
informal, and in need of revision. Carriers need to be organized and modernized, transport
methods must be improved, and the urban marketing structure needs to be modified. As a
first step, sector participants qualifying for this kind of assistance (carriers who are willing
to participate, who are engaged in relatively large-scale activities within the sector, and
have a high potential for improving their efficiency relative to the cost of provided
assistance) have been identified, and will be assisted under the project.
2.27  At the marketing level, the effectiveness of the program to geographically reorient
wood off take, will require that the mechanisms for monitoring and controlling woodfuel
transport be strengthened. At present, the Forest Service can only keep track of less than
25% of the wood and 10 % of the charcoal entering Bamako, with no means of tracking
its origin. There are no woodfuel monitoring stations in other urban areas. The
effectiveness of existing stations must be strengthened and similar check stations installed
in interior urban areas to monitor woodfuel entries. The check stations should be
provided with adequate personnel (with training) and equipment. Mobile teams could be
used to minimize efforts to circumvent the check stations. Sanctions will be established
which are sufficiently dissuasive to fraud.
2.28   Only a limited number of household energy related projects were and are being
implemented in Mali. On the demand side the main activity is the German financed
DNAS/GTZ improved woodstoves project, whose planned third phase will become one of
the components of the proposed project. On the supply side there is the Bank financed
Natural Resource Management Project whose objectives include to bring about village-
level investments to stop the degradation of soil, water, and natural vegetation and set up
and implement community natural resource management plans, but whose intervention is
limited to three administrative regions of Mali.



32
THE PROJECT
A.    PROJECT OBJECTIVES
3.1   The long-term development objectives are the reduction of C02 emissions, the
abatement of forest resources depletion and the increased participation of the private
sector in the management of the household energy sector. The main implementation
objectives of the project are to promote popular participation in household energy
activities, rational use of household energy resources and improved end-use of household
fuels. Specific objectives are: (i) to create an enabling regulatory and policy environment
for project implementation; (ii) to provide technical assistance and training to peasants,
charcoal makers, producers and sellers of stoves as well as urban consumers to
respectively efficiently harvest and carbonize fuelwood, to manage the natural forest in a
sustainable manner, to effectively market new energy end-use equipment and to rationally
use improved biomass and kerosene stoves. The basic principle underpinning this project
is that the Government establishes the policy environment, but commercial decisions are
left to private economic agents.
B.    PROJECT DESCRIPTION
3.2   The project would consist of two main components covering demand and
woodfuel supply of household energy. On the supply side, the main focus of the project
will consist of mobilizing popular participation in the management of the natural forest,
and restructuring the fuelwood trade so that woodfuel traders increasingly get their
supplies from managed rather than from mined forests. On the demand side, the focus of
the project will consist of enhancing the role of the private sector in marketing a variety of
fuel efficient end-use appliances. Thus, the project focuses on three important elements of
the CAS, to wit: environment, private sector involvement and popular participation, which
are part of an integrated approach in this project to bring about sector efficiency. The
project will be mainly executed by private sector actors. However, for critical reasons, in
particular the environmental and social dimension and weak private sector institutions, the
Government's role as a catalyst is important to stimulate private sector development in the
household energy sector. Consequently, a large part of the project's activities are
decentralized to the private sector, while public sector involvement will decline over time.
To assist poor consumers to overcome market barriers to energy products that would
greatly benefit them, subsidies will be made available on a temporary basis and in a
transparent manner. Reducing the market price of improved kerosene and charcoal
stoves, both unknown products to the Malian consumer, can help overcome consumer
perception that the new product is out of her reach and expand the market in the long run,
which in turn will reduce the cost to the consumer. Despite the good solar regime in Mali
a solar component has not been included in the project. However, work has been initiated
in Mali with a view to explore the scope for a full-scale solar project for the household,
agricultural, health and education sectors.



33
3.3   The woodfuel supply component. The component consists of the following
interventions: (i) design of woodfuel supply master plans for the main towns and
determine the maximum annual sustainable wood supply in the catchment areas of the
towns concerned; (ii) preparation of and assistance to implement village forest
management plans in about 260 villages in five administrative regions of Mali; (iii)
identification, design and implementation of an improved carbonization program for
existing charcoalers as well as assist interested local private entrepreneurs to carbonize
and compress cotton stalks which could replace charcoal; (iv) provision of institutional
support for central and local government authorities to help with project management and
assist rural communities in implementing their forest management plans; and (v) launching
of a comprehensive training, client consultation, and Information, Education and
Communication (IEC) program on forest management. The project would supply the
financing of civil works, chimneys for improved charcoal kilns, a briquetting machine,
cars, office supplies and other equipment as well as of services such as technical
assistance, consultant services, audits, and studies required for project implementation.
The estimated cost of the woodfuel supply component, net of taxes and duties, is about
US$7.7 million of which US$1.1 million will be financed by GEF, US$2.9 million by the
Netherlands (DGIS), US$3.3 million by France, and about US$700.000 by the
Government.
3.4   The demand side. The component would consist of the following interventions:
(i) identification, design and assistance to implement a marketing program for the sale of
these improved biomass and kerosene stoves; (ii) provision of institutional support for
central government authorities to help with project management and assist private sector
entrepreneurs with the production and sale of improved stoves; (iii) support for a
comprehensive IEC program and systematic consumer consultation, executed by private
sector operators, on the importance of the rational use of energy through the purchase
and proper use of the improved stoves. The project would supply the financing of civil
works, kerosene stoves, improved biomass stoves, cars, office supplies, other equipment
as well as technical assistance, consultant services, audits, and studies required for project
implementation. The estimated cost for this demand component, net of taxes and duties, is
about US$3.2 million of which US$1.4 million will be financed by GEF, US$0.1 million by
the Netherlands (DGIS), US$1.2 million by Germany, and about US$500.000 by the
Government.
C.    DETAILED FEATURES
1.    Woodfuel Supply Master Plans.
3.5   The project would finance and contract out the design of urban woodfuel supply
master plans for Bamako, Mopti, Koutiala, Segou and Kayes. The purpose of these
master plans is to identify the priority intervention zones as well as their appropriate
management systems. The development of the masterplan rests on three pillars: (i) a
forest resource base assessment; (ii) an analysis of the fuelwood market chain; and (iii) an
agro-socio-economic zonation of the urban catchment area. These data will be obtained



34
through satellite imagery, areal photography and ground-truthing for (i); through
fuelwood market-chain surveys, targeted interviews with market-chain actors, and surveys
of rural and urban wood sales points for (ii); and through village surveys, desk-studies and
analysis of demographic data for (iii).
3.6   The forest resource assessment aims at deterrnining, as reliably as possible,
whether in 1995 the standing woodstock, taking into account annual productivity, is
sufficient to harvest fuelwood without cutting into the existing capital stock. The analysis
of the fuelwood market chain aims to quantify the annual fuelwood flows into the cities, to
identify the main sources of fuelwood and its supply routes, and to describe the socio-
economic dynamic of the market chain. The purpose of the agro-socio-economic zonation
of the catchment area is to identify the main ways in which the natural forest cover is
currently being managed as well as to hierarchize the environmental and socio-economic
factors that determine fuelwood exploitation and woodfuel transportation to the cities.
3.7   Based on the analysis of the Master Plan data the priority areas and means of
intervention for each catchment area will be determined. Thus, the Master Plans allows
the Govemment to reorient forest exploitation spatially, qualitatively and quantitatively
and to bring about rational forest management in the catchment areas of the cities
concerned.
2.    Village Forest Management Plans.
3.8   The project would finance the development of some 260 management plans in the
participating villages, which will be a joint effort of project staff, forestry service,
consultants and the villagers themselves. The process of establishing a village forest
management plan entails three phases:
preliminary interdisciplinary studies of villages, identified through the Master Plan, such
as:
- land tenure study to agree on the village borders;
- pastoralists study to take pastoral needs and constraints into account;
- interviews with woodcutters to establish existing exploitation patterns;
- simple village forest inventory to establish the annual quota and
management scheme;
- cartographic work and synthesis to establish the file to get approval for
the rural market.
organizational activities including:
- information campaign to inform the villagers of their right and duties;
- creation of the management structure of the village association and of
rural fuelwood market;



35
- training of the rural market manager and woodcutters; and literacy
training of villagers.
sensitization of peasants, through regular visits, to ensure the proper operation of the rural
woodfuel market and the village management plan during the first two years after its
creation.
3.    Carbonization Program.
3.9   The project would finance and contract out the improvement of carbonization
techniques as well as the introduction of carbonized briquets through the following
activities:
(a)   training of trainers and charcoalers in improved charcoal techniques;
(b)   assistance to trained charcoalers to constitute themselves into professional
groups;
(c)   ICE campaign to sensitize charcoalers and peasants to use wood resources
in an efficient manner. In the cotton zone, this campaign will be aimed in
particular at peasants to carbonize the post-harvest cotton stalks and sell
the carbonized product to designated entrepreneurs;
4.    Kerosene, Charcoal Stoves and Briquets Dissemination Program.
3.10  To encourage consumers to start using charcoal stoves and kerosene stoves and
help consumers overcome their perception of high entry cost and get accustomed to a new
and unfamiliar product the project would temporarily subsidize up to 50% of their cost (to
a total amount of US$1 million). Because these products are unknown to the consumer
and need to be market-tested the project also will finance and contract out market-testing
and, if required, product adaptation. This work will be carried out by project staff assisted
by short-term technical assistance. Once the period of market-testing and product
adaptation has been completed training of charcoal stove makers will take place. Similar
training will take place when the Government and THE BANK will decide to make part of
the kerosene stoves in Mali itself This will be followed by a sustained ICE campaign for
both the charcoal and kerosene stoves. The Household Energy Unit will contract out the
implementation of a briquetting pilot project, including purchase of briquetting
(agglomeration) equipment, production and market testing of briquets, and training of
interested entrepreneurs in the use of the equipment with a view to develop a sustainable
commercial operation.
3.11  In general, subsidies should not be financed, because the subsidized product often
is diverted for other uses and does not necessarily reach the targeted group. However,
when it is necessary to assist poor consumers to overcome market barriers to a product
that would greatly benefit them, subsidies, provided they are temporary and transparent
and do not negatively effect the market in which they are used, can be a positive element.



36
Reducing the market price of improved kerosene and charcoal stoves, both unknown
products to the Malian consumer, can help overcome consumer perception that the new
product is out of her reach and expand the market in the long run, which in turn will
reduce the cost to the consumer. To make this process transparent, contracts will be
signed with private sector operators (after local bidding) to import and produce
respectively kerosene stoves, charcoal stoves and kiln chimneys. These contracts will not
be for the total number of stoves that are expected to be disseminated during the lifetime
of the project, but for a limited number, that will be renewed when the stocks are being
drawn down. In addition, to make consumers aware of the subsidized market price of the
stoves concerned these will be publicized in the media as well through posters at their
sales points.
5.    Institutional Support for Government Services.
3.12  In addition to salaries for contractual staff, the proposed project would also cover
investment and operating cost, including the construction of new office space and
woodfuel control-posts, aerial photography, satellite imagery, office equipment (including
computers, software, photo-copying machines, type-writers, and fax), garage, four-wheel
drive vehicles for the support teams, and motor-cross cycles for forest-guards. On the
basis of the master plans, these cars and motor-cycles would be partly distributed among
the regional forestry directorates for the implementation of these plans. Funding would
also be provided for the operation and maintenance of these vehicles, equipment and field
allowances of the technical staff and drivers.
6.    Skills Development and ICE.
3.13   To provide the villagers, technical and administrative staff and the urban
consumers with the information and skills necessary to the success of the program, the
proposed project would finance:
(a)   the design and implementation of promotional and awareness campaigns
for both the forest management and the energy conservation activities by a
private public relations firm and their dissemination by TV, radio and in the
written media (including posters);
(b)   the cost of implementing a village population sensitization, alphabetization
and training program by contractants (extension staff, NGOs, other
projects); and
(c)   the cost of specialized training of technical staff both in Mali and abroad in
required techniques and methodologies.



37
7.    Technical Assistance.
3.14  All activities would be implemented by both national staff and by nationally and
internationally recruited expertise in accordance with the Project Implementation Manual
(see Annex V for terms of reference). Generally, short-term technical assistance will be
required only, with one exception. On the basis of the Niger project experience it is
considered vital that one long-term technical assistant be recruited for three years to assist
in the launching and realization of the urban woodfuel master plans and the village forest
management plans. Terms of reference as well as the distribution between national and
international specialists have been drawn up, discussed and agreed upon during project
preparation and constitute a part of the project's four-year implementation plan. All
consultants, for whom special terms of reference will be drawn up each time they will visit
the project to perform a well-defined task, will transfer their knowledge to the local
counterparts (who could either be project staff and/or private sector operators) through
on-the-job training, where feasible. The project would provide a total of 93 person-
months of technical assistance, of which 57 months are short-term and 36 months long-
term (forest management specialist). The short-term technical assistance will be
distributed as follows among the two project components. The demand side component
will be supported by an energy economist (6 pm), a marketing specialist (8 pm), a bio-
mass engineer (8 pm) and a survey specialist (6 pm). The woodfuel supply component
will receive support from a forest economist (5 pm), a forest management specialist (9
pm), a cartographer (3 pm), rural extension specialist (6 pm), a forest inventory specialist
(4 pm), a lawyer (4 pm), a carbonization specialist (3 pm), and a forest exploitation
specialist (3 pm).
D.    PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
There is a Project Implementation Manual of which we give the key elements here.
3.15   Project Organization. Overall project coordination will be the responsibility of a
Project Steering Committee. This Steering Committee will be composed of senior staff
from the Ministry of Energy and Hydraulics and the Ministry of Rural Development and
will meet twice a year to evaluate and provide direction for the project. The project
already represents a coordinated effort, combining the efforts of cofinanciers and parallel
financiers. During the preparation phase of the project a special effort has been made to
identify all potential partners and collaborators with whom contact has been established
and with whom the project's objectives and methodologies have been discussed. In
addition, there will be created a National Coordination Council for the household energy
sector, in which the Government, all interested donors, NGOs and private sector
representatives will participate to discuss and advise on policy, technical and coordination
issues in the sector. Day to day project coordination, administration and financial
management of the project will be the responsibility of an existing Project Coordination
Unit (UPS), within the Ministry of Energy, which is composed of members from both
Ministries. At the national level the demand component will be executed by the
Household Energy Unit (Ministry of Energy and Hydraulics) and the woodfiiel supply



38
component by the Woodfuels Unit (Ministry of Rural Development). To make the
process of subsidization of energy appliances transparent, contracts will be signed with
private sector operators (after local bidding) to import and produce respectively kerosene
stoves, charcoal stoves and kiln chimneys. These contracts will not be for the total
number of products that are expected to be disseminated during the lifetime of the project,
but for a limited number, that will be renewed when the stocks are being drawn down. In
addition, to make consumers aware of the subsidized market price of the stoves concerned
these will be publicized in the media as well through posters at their sales points.
3.16   At the regional and district level, project implementation of the supply side
component would be supervised by the regional directorates of both NEHD and NWFD.
To ensure good acceptance and "ownership" of the project by the technical and
administrative staff at regional and district levels, they will be part of the team that designs
the urban fuelwood master plans. Further, the CCL will provide support to these regional
directorates (vehicles, operation and maintenance cost) to enable them to supervise the
implementation of these master plans as well as to assist in the design and supervision of
the village forest management plans. Thus CCL staff itself will solely play a role in the
management of the design and development of the master and management plans, while
their execution and supervision will be entirely the affair of respectively the village forest
management associations and the regional directorates of N\VFD. The CCL will continue
to provide incidental technical assistance, but this will be in support of the line operators
as well as provide monitoring and evaluation of the project's activities. Annex I provides a
Supervision Plan, Annex II a Project Implementation Plan, Annex III Annual Monitorable
Indicators, and Annex IV an organization chart.
3.17  Implementation of demand side activities will be carried out in collaboration with
the regional directorates of NEHD, various ongoing (and planned) projects, private sector
operators, and NGO's. In all cases, close contact will be established with the regional and
district administrative authorities. The UPS will be responsible for the selection and the
completion of contractual arrangements with interested entrepreneurs, who wish to
distribute kerosene stoves or produce charcoal stoves. These entrepreneurs will organize
the import of the kerosene stoves, will stock and distribute the stoves. UPS will also issue
a tender for the production of improved charcoal stoves and the charcoal kiln chimneys.
Monthly monitoring of prices and sales of energy equipment as well as spot checks by the
CED will determine whether these entrepreneurs, who have signed a contract with the
Project Coordination Unit (UPS), stipulating the price level and structure as well as the
procedures for marketing the stoves, will perform as required and agreed upon.
3.18   At the village level, once a village has been selected by the CCL, based on its
interest to be involved in forest management and having sufficient forest resources, village
associations will be established by the villagers, unless such a voluntary association already
exists. After the creation of this association and its necessary administrative framework,
the CCL through the regional directorate of NWFD would provide technical assistance
and training to the members of the village association in such subjects as: alphabetization,
simple book-keeping, forest management, wood cutting, and where appropriate
carbonization and tree-planting. Special attention will be paid to adapt the management



39
system to the needs of pastoralists and other forest users, inter alia, by having
representatives of groups other than agriculturalists represented in the council of the
village association. The CCL would further, in collaboration with the village association,
design and develop the village forest management plan, of which the village association is
the exclusive executor. Consequently, any problems that may arise as a result of the
implementation of these management plans, such as a conflict about land tenure or other
rights, will also be the sole responsibility of the village association concerned. The
regional directorate of NWFD will provide technical assistance to the village associations
as well as supervise the implementation of the management plans.
3.19  Staff recruitment would take place in accordance with the staffing plan agreed
upon. The project coordinator (UPS) has been appointed. The recruitment of the
remaining staff of UPS, CCL and CED is a condition of grant effectiveness. The
recruitment of additional extension staff would precede the formulation of the village
management plans. Care will be taken to make use of existing extension staff, such as
employed by the Natural Resource Management project, who work in villages targeted by
the project. Assurances were obtained that the staffing plan would be implemented in a
manner satisfactory to the Bank, including the provision by the Grantee of a short list of
candidates for all technical personnel.
3.20  Recruitment for positions under the credit would be publicized and open to all
qualified candidates, including Government staff willing to separate from administrative
service. Terms of reference (included in the project's implementation plan), qualifications
and conditions of selection have been agreed upon between the Bank and NWFD and
dME (see Annex I). Assurances have been obtained during negotiations that for
purposes of project implementation, the Borrower would employ and maintain staff with
qualifications, experience, terms and conditions of employment satisfactory to the Bank.
The level of remuneration would be commensurate with the temporary nature of the
contract, but should not result in a disincentive to Government officials with similar
qualifications and responsibilities.
3.21   Village participation. The selection of villages that will participate in the project
will be on a voluntary, i.e. demand driven basis. The main selection criterion will be (a) its
inclusion in the urban woodfuel master plan, and (b) its commitment to forest
management. Villages may be excluded by the project if there is a major dispute within
the village or with neighboring villages.
3.22  After their selection, establishment of the village association and development of
the management plan by the CCL and the villagers, which will be preceded by an
information and sensibilization campaign in the relevant national languages, a rural
woodfuel market will be created by the CCL as the focus of the village association's
marketing function. This will be followed by training of the members of the village
association, given by the CCL, and the beginning of forest exploitation and management
by the village associations. Given the large number of villages involved, the necessary
start-up period of the project staff, and the need to develop the urban woodfuel master



40
plans, village participation will start during the second year of the project and gradually in
phases extended to other villages during the remainder of the project's existence.
3.23   Coordination With Other Projects. The proposed project would be closely
coordinated with other ongoing projects, either similar or complementary. For example,
there will be about 50 villages that are in an area that will be both covered by this project
and that of the natural resource Management Project. The latter project also has already
developed a forest management manual that could be made use of. Thus, the purpose of
this coordination is to (a) take advantage of the experience gained; (b) build on the
facilities and services (staff, equipment) available at the field level (Natural Resource
Management Project, Agricultural Services Project); and (c) ensure that the village
communities covered by the project have access to the services and inputs provided by
these projects.
3.24   Mechanisms for Evaluation. The Project includes a mechanism for evaluation
and control because: (i) it will deal with a wide diversity of components and many
participants which need coordination and follow-up; (ii) it is based on continuous dialogue
between and feed-back to the participants: sector professionals (from small peasant wood
choppers to directors of petroleum companies) and consumers; (iii) the CCL and the CED
need to brief the Government and project donors on the progress of actions taken within
the framework of the Project; and (iv) the MMEH and the MRD must follow closely the
evolution of the household energy sector, as well as the outcomes of implemented
measures, in order to adjust project interventions if necessary, and to measure the
greenhouse gas emissions avoided and carbon storage achieved through the Project's
intervention. Close collaboration will exist with the Natural Resource Management
project, in particular its national entity charged with monitoring and evaluation of
desertification control and resource management.
3.25   NWFD and the Information and Evaluation Service of the NEHD will evaluate the
Project results and inputs from the public and private sector operators affected by the
projects. The evaluation process must quantify the actions taken, the impact of these
actions, and their effects on different groups. In the case of woodfuel supply, results
which can be quantified include the number of rural markets in operation, the surface area
of land used to supply these markets or the number of managed forests and their surface
areas. The effectiveness of new arrangements also must be estimated; for example, the
quantities of wood originating from rural markets, quantities of wood originating from
managed forests, additional fiscal resources, the proportion of regulated supply among the
woodfuels entering the urban area, and fiscal fraud.
3.26  The CCL will analyze the impact on the general organization of woodfuel supply.
Areas to be evaluated include the distribution of supply traffic by mode of transportation
and by port of entry into the urban area; fuel prices in rural areas (market prices, producer
prices, price of standing wood) and in urban areas. The CCL also will attempt to measure
environmental impacts by comparing the evolution of the forest cover in depleted areas
not under regulation, in supply areas for rural markets (referred to in the text as preferred
exploitation areas, since these areas are not under regulation), and in managed forests.



41
3.27  The CCL will further measure the effects of the project on the different groups
affected by woodfuel supply. These groups include: participating village communities and
the various professionals in the sector, including producers, carriers and distributors.
3.28  On the demand side, the CED will quantify distribution of improved stoves and
other popularized energy products. A principal measure will be the number of improved
stoves, kerosene, gas cook stoves and PV systems marketed during project
implementation. In addition, other indicators will provide more permanent information
regarding the market structure and distribution potential for kerosene and butane:
quantities imported and consumed, origin and destination of the fuel, price structures.
3.29 Consumer behavior also will be monitored by the CED. The CED will combine
the preceding information with the results of regular, direct observations of consumer
behavior. The latter will be achieved through focused beneficiary assessments and
continuous client consultation. Consumers will be categorized according to stove type
and fuels used (primary and secondary); specific consumption; attitudes and preferences
(satisfaction indexes, planning to buy). This information will be gathered using specific
surveys and through dialogue with permanent consumer panels. The CED will rely as
much as possible on surveys which are already conducted regularly by the ANSI, and will
try to "institutionalize" collection of the important data needed by the CED through use of
these surveys. As a matter of course, all data generated by the monitoring and evaluation
system also serve to adjust the project's interventions, when these data indicate such a
need.
3.30 Project Management, Auditing, and Accounting. A computerized accounting
system is currently already in use by UPS. This accounting system also has an accounting
procedures manual. Assurances have been obtained at negotiations that for all
expenditures for which the withdrawals from the Credit account were made on the basis of
statements of expenditure (SOEs), the Borrower shall (a) maintain records and accounts
reflecting such expenditures; (b) retain for at least one year all records evidencing such
expenditures; (c) enable the Bank's representatives to examine such records, and (d)
ensure that such records and accounts are included in the annual audit, and that the report
of such audit contains a separate opinion as to whether the SOEs can be relied upon to
support the related withdrawals. Based on the Implementation Manual, which contains
detailed annual workprograms and budgets, every six months the UPS will submit (i) a
detailed workprogram, including performance indicators, for the following six months and
its budget; (ii) an evaluation of the execution of the workprogram of the preceding six
months period and its budget; and (iii) a budget for the remaining project period. These
reports will be discussed and the up-dated workprogram and budget approved by the
Bank and its cofinanciers during the twice annual supervision mission. At negotiations a
detailed workprogram and budget for the first year has been agreed upon.
3.31  During negotiations agreement has been reached that the Special Account of the
project and Statement of Expenditures (SOE) will be audited annually and separately. All
audits should be conducted by independent external auditors acceptable to the Bank and
according to sound and internationally recognized auditing standards. The audited



42
accounts and the auditors' report will be submitted to the Bank within six months
following the end of the fiscal year while SOE's will be reviewed by the Bank on a regular
basis. The auditor's report will include a statement on the adequacy or otherwise of the
accounting system and internal controls, the reliability of SOEs as a basis for credit
disbursements, and compliance with financial covenants. Assurances have been obtained
at negotiations that (a) the records and accounts will be audited for each fiscal year, in
accordance with appropriate auditing principles consistently applied by independent
auditors acceptable to the Bank; (b) the Borrower will furnish to the Association as soon
as available, but in any case not later than six months after the end of each such year, a
certified copy of the report of such audit by said auditors, of such scope and in such detail
as the Association shall have reasonably requested; and (c) the Borrower will furnish to
the Association such other information concerning such records, accounts and the audit
thereof as the Association shall from time to time reasonably request. Prior to
negotiations, the Malian delegation has submitted a short list of auditing firms to the Bank
for approval, while a signed contract with an auditing firm acceptable to the Bank to audit
project accounts based on a one-year automatically renewable contract, except in the case
of poor performance will be a condition of effectiveness.
3.32  Project Supervision. Supervision would take place in close collaboration with
other donor agencies to ensure consistency among the different parallel financing agencies.
One joint donor supervision mission would be scheduled each year at the time of the
annual review round table. In addition, other supervision missions would be carried out
jointly or in a concerted manner with other cofinancing agencies. Supervision of the
project's financial management, accounting and auditing follow-up would be undertaken as
a separate exercise. Supervision missions would involve, in addition to the task managers,
such experts as would be required for assessing the project's progress (Annex III).
E.    PROJECT COSTS
3.33   As shown in the table below, total costs over the project period, including all
incremental capital, personnel, and operating expenditures, are estimated to be US$10,5
million (net of taxes and duties) of which US$5.0 million (44%) is in foreign exchange.
Total project cost, including taxes and duties which are financed under this project,
amount to US$11,2 million.

3.35   The GEF grant (US$2.5 million) will finance the import and sale of kerosene
stoves at a reduced retail price, including information campaigns aimed at consumers and
retailers (US$1.4 million), the purchase of equipment to modernize kilns and training of
charcoalers (US$800,000), the purchase of equipment and training of operators to
carbonize and compress cotton stalks (US$300,000). The Netherlands (DGIS) will co-
finance the preparation and implementation of the urban woodfuel supply master plans, the
plans for recovery of dead wood reserves, and the development and implementation of



44
forest management plans outside the Bamako and Sikasso areas (US$3 million). Germany
will finance all wood stove activities, including promotional and marketing activities, the
monitoring and evaluation system for stoves dissemination, training, and technical
assistance (US$1.2 million). France will finance the design, development and
implementation of village management plans in the gazetted forests around Bamako
(US$2.3 million), as well as in the Sikasso area (US$0.9 million). The Government will
contribute approximately US$1.2 million equivalent to cover local personnel costs over
the four-year implementation period and payment of taxes, for taxes and duties will not be
financed by the donors.
G.   PROCUREMENT

the Woodfuels Unit as well as 12 woodfuel control posts. The total cost is estimated at
US$364,000. These works would be financed by the Netherlands but managed by the
Bank under Bank's Procurement Guidelines and procured through National Competitive
Bidding (NCB) using procedures and standard bidding documents developed by the local



45
contract management agency (AGETIPE) established under a Bank-financed project (Cr.
237 1-MLI), acceptable to IDA.
3.38  Goods. Goods financed under the Project would include vehicles, office
equipment, audio-visual equipment and materials, and spare parts. Most of the vehicles
would be procured in the first year of the project, except for replacement vehicles, and
could be grouped into packages of at least US$200,000 and procured on the basis of ICB
for an estimated total cost of US$583,000, in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for
procurement. Goods procured under contracts estimated to cost less than US$200,000
equivalent each would be suitable for procurement through NCB under procedures
acceptable to the Bank provided the aggregate amount of such procurement does not
exceed US$1.2 million equivalent. The remaining goods, which cannot be grouped into
bid packages of at least US$200,000 equivalent, would be procured on the basis of price
quotations from at least three suppliers, provided the aggregate amount of such
procurement does not exceed US$0.2 million equivalent.
3.39  Service contracts for aerial photographs and satellite imagery of an estimated value
of US$100,000 would be purchased through ICB.
3.40  Services. Consultants and other experts for the project (about US$3.1 million),
excluding those financed by the parallel financiers who will follow their own procurement
guidelines, would be selected in accordance with Bank Guidelines for the use of
consultants (August 1981), and would be employed on terms and conditions satisfactory
to the Association.
3.41  GEF-financed contracts for works and goods above a threshold of US$200,000
equivalent each and contracts for firms and for individual consultants, respectively, above
a threshold of US$ 100,000 and US$50,000 equivalent each would be subject to prior
review. However, for firms and individual consultant contracts below, respectively, the
US$ 100,000 and US$50,000 thresholds, the Bank would review the terms of reference,
single source hiring, assignments of a critical nature as determined by the Bank and
amendments of contracts raising their value above these thresholds.
3.42  Procurement information will be collected and recorded as follows:
(a)   prompt reporting of contract award information by the Grantee;
(b)   comprehensive semi-annual reports to the Bank by the Grantee indicating:
- revised cost estimates for individual contracts and the total project
including best estimates of allowances for physical and price
contingency.
- revising timing of procurement actions, including advertising, bidding,
contract award, and completion time for individual contracts;



46
- compliance with aggregate limits on specified methods of procurement; and
- use of standard bidding documents.
3.43   Disbursements. The proposed grant would be disbursed by the end of fiscal year 1999 in
accordance with the estimated schedule shown in the table below. Disbursement of the GEF
grants will be filly documented except for expenditures valued at less than US$100,000
equivalent which will be disbursed against Statement of Expenditures (SOEs). To expedite project
implementation, a special account will be opened in a commercial Bank acceptable to the Bank
and maintained and operated on terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank. The authorized
allocation for the special account would be US$250,000. All GEF-financed expenditures of less
than US$ 100,000 equivalent will be financed from a Special Account that will be submitted with
an up-to-date Bank statement, reconciliation statement and fiull documentation, except for
expenditures below US$100,000 which the Grantee will be permitted to submit on the basis of
SOEs. SOE documents will be kept in the project office for immediate inspection by Bank staff
during supervision missions and for annual audits. No direct payment request under the
equivalent of US$100,000 will be accepted. A regional disbursement seminar held early in 1994
evaluated special accounts, resolved outstanding disbursement problems and advised and guided
personnel on Bank disbursement practices and procedures. The purchase of the kerosene and
charcoal stoves as well as for the charcoal kiln chimneys will be done by one or more private sector
entrepreneurs who have been selected based on their financial and technical offers to participate in the
project. The temporary GEF subsidy for these products will be passed on to the consumer through a
corresponding lower retail price.

BENEFITS, ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT AND RISKS
A.    BENEFITS
4.1    The main benefits of the project are the protection of the fragile environment
around urban areas and a reduction in C02 emissions. An attempt has been made to
quantify some of the costs and benefits. The targeted promotion of 160.000 improved
wood, 68.000 improved charcoal stoves and 17.000 kerosene stoves under the project will
result in savings in firewood consumption that could amount to about 330,000 tons a year
by 1999.

4.2   In addition, the project aims to bring 720,000 ha of natural forest under
management and recover 200.000 tons of dead wood. Assuming the economic value of
wood to be between CFAF 26 -39/kg and taking into account only firewood savings, the
rate of return on the household energy component is calculated to be over 30%. This is a
conservative estimate, and takes into account neither the increase in forest cover yields,
nor the reduction in C02 emissions, or the major long-term ecological benefits, such as
the positive effects on agricultural production, the fodder situation, and soil fertility. The
household energy component would improve living standards of rural populations in
affected areas and stabilize employment opportunities in the firewood trade. The
increased use of kerosene and LPG stoves would also reduce cooking time and make food
preparation easier.

B.    RIsKS
4.3   The project is new and innovative in Mali and will encounter technical and
institutional obstacles. The Government has structurally reorganized its forestry service
and formulated a transparent regulatory framework for the sector to reduce these
obstacles. The major risks therefore are:
complex coordination and implementation arrangements;
uncertainty whether consumers will accept and buy the new kerosene and charcoal stoves;
and
uncertainty whether the villages are willing to participate in management of the natural
forest.
The following actions will be taken to minimize the above-mentioned risks:
(a)   a national coordination commnittee will be established to monitor and
evaluate coordination and implementation of all activities in the household
energy sector;
(b)   during project preparation, detailed market studies were conducted to
determine the market profile for the new stoves, while during project
execution consumer consultation, beneficiary assessment and feed-back
from the monitoring and evaluation system will provide information that
,will alert project management to lack of progress and allow adjustments to
be made in the project's approach; and
(c)   a national ICE campaign, including visits by extension agents, will ensure
the villagers' participation.
ASSURANCES AND RECOMMENDATION
5.1    During negotiations, agreement has been reached on the following matters:
(a)   for purposes of project implementation, the Grantee will employ and
maintain staff (Marketing Specialist, Technologist, Agro-economist, Rural
Sociologist and Pastoralist) with qualifications, experience, terms and
conditions of employment satisfactory to the Bank. The level of
remuneration will be commensurate with the temporary nature of the
contract, but should not result in a disincentive to Government officials
with similar qualifications and responsibilities.



49
(b)   for all expenditures for which the withdrawals from the Credit account
were made on the basis of statements of expenditure (SOEs), the Grantee
shall (a) maintain records and accounts reflecting such expenditures; (b)
retain for at least one year all records evidencing such expenditures; (c)
enable the Bank's representatives to examine such records, and (d) ensure
that such records and accounts are included in the annual audit, and that
the report of such audit contains a separate opinion as to whether the SOEs
can be relied upon to support the related withdrawals
(c)   (i) the records and accounts will be audited for each fiscal year, in
accordance with appropriate auditing principles consistently applied by
independent auditors acceptable to the Bank; (ii) the Grantee will furnish to
the Bank as soon as available, but in any case not later than six months
after the end of each such year, a certified copy of the report of such audit
by said auditors, of such scope and in such detail as the Bank shall have
reasonably requested; and (iii) the Grantee will furnish to the Bank such
other information concerning such records, accounts and the audit thereof
as the Bank shall from time to time reasonably request.
(d)   each year, by December 3 1 at the latest, the Borrower will convene a
project implementation review meeting with the Bank, and other co- and
parallel-financiers.
(e)   after completing the mid-term review in July 1997, the recommendations
resulting from this review as agreed upon between the Bank and the
Grantee, will be promptly carried out.
(f)   the Government will submit to the Bank: (i) semi-annual reports within 60
days at the end of June and December providing information on progress of
the project; (ii) copies of all consultants' reports on studies financed under
the proposed credit; and (iii) a project completion report within six months
of implementation of all project components.
5.2    Conditions of Grant Effectiveness. Conditions precedent for the release of
incremental funding are that the Government agrees to: (i) appoint following members of
the project staff: Marketing Specialist, Technologist, Agro-economist, Rural Sociologist
and Pastoralist; and (ii) submit a timetable for the increase of the stumpage fees for
charcoal and fuelwood, respectively to FCFA 6 and FCFA 2 per kg, by December 1996.
