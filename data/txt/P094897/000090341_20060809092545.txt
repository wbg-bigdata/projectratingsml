Objectives              The proposedProgrammatic Development Loan is part ofaprogrammatic
                        series o fthree to four DPLs intended to support the fundamentals and
                        three mainpillars o f the government's development plan "Vamos
                        Guatemala". Within this framework, it focuses on actions aimed at
                        improving the business and investment climate, creating fiscal space for
                        greater social investmentand achieving key milestones inimproving the
                        fiduciary environment. Other key areas for growth identified ineducation,
                        health and nutrition and rural economic infrastructure are supported within
                        the CAS programthrough investment operations, which buildon the
                        ongoing portfolio o f interventions inthese areas. Future DPL operations
                        are expected to maintainthe focus on the growth agenda (trade, investment
                        climate, public private partnerships, access to credit by SME), social
                        sector financing, transparency and efficiency inpublic spending.
Description             This second loano fthe programbuildson the successful first operation. It
                        continues to focus on strengthening the international trade andbusiness
                        environment, for which it draws on findings set forth inthe CEM, PER,
                        DR-CAFTA studies, as well as the Investment Climate Assessment. The
                        CEM and PER, together with the Poverty Assessment, also form the basis
                        for the emphasis on means o f expanding social spendingand investment.
                        DPL I1will likewise continue to emphasize transparency and efficiency in
                        public spendingby including follow up actions onpublic financial
                        management and procurement to ensure the gradual implementation o f
                        measures as prescribed inthe CFAA and CPAR..
Benefits                TheKey benefits expectedfiom theprogram are:

                             Meeting fiscal and financial needs. This proposed loan would help
                             meet the Government's objective o f providing financing on more
                             favorable terms and diversifying financing sources for its 2007
                             budget. This, in turn, would support the Government's concurrent
                             goals o f maintaining fiscal stability and addressing social needs
                             through increased and more efficient spending.
                             Improving the outlook for economic growth. The loan supports a
                             broad agenda o f measures anchored around Guatemala's efforts to
                             deepen its trade and regional integration agenda, including its
                             participation in DR-CAFTA. The agenda includes key actions o f the
                             complementary agenda o f policy and institutional reforms to ensure
                             that Guatemala can fully benefit from the opportunities o f trade and

                           greater integration into the world economy.         Key complementary
                           actions include measures to facilitate the expansion o f trade and
                           investment levels,      improvements     in the investment climate,
                           addressing infrastructure investment and services, and promoting
                           innovation and technology.
                           Increasing the eficiency and transparency ofpublic sector
                           management. The loan supports public sector modernization efforts
                           aimed at improving the efficiency o fpublic expenditures,
                           strengthening governance and fighting corruptionwith a specific
                           focus on government procurement and financial management. Efforts
                           inthese areasarealsoexpectedto foster anenvironment more
                           conducive to investment and growth.


Risks                 The operation is subject to four mainrisks during the implementation o f
                       the DPL series:
                           Political gridlock, given a divided Congress which creates obvious
                           risks for the timely passage and subsequent implementation o f the
                           Government's legislative agenda,
                           Societal tensions related to the country's post-conflict status,
                           especially around controversial areas like tax reform, continued trade
                           liberalization, promotion o f increased private participation in
                           infrastructure, and issues surrounding property rights and land,
                           Exogenous shocks related to natural disasters, which could derail
                           efforts to attract investment and necessitate unanticipated spending for
                           emergency assistance and reconstruction, and

         SECONDBROAD-BASEDGROWTHDEVELOPMENT POLICY LOAN


                                    I.COUNTRYCONTEXT

1.      With a multi-ethnic population of about 13 million and a per-capita GNI of about
$2,350, Guatemala is the largest economy in Central America. While a source o f cultural
strength and rich historical heritage, Guatemala's ethnic diversity has also unfortunately been
accompanied by a pattern o f conflict and exclusion since colonial times. Inthe latter half o f the
20th century, long-standing socio-political and economic tensions sparked a debilitating 36-year
civil war, which ended in 1996 with the signing o f a set o f Peace Accords between government
and guerrilla leaders, following protractednegotiations.

2.      The 1996 Peace Accords marked an important turning point in Guatemala's
development, both ending the civil war and setting out targets to reverse the country's
historically exclusionary pattern of social and economic development. The Accords set national
targets in four main areas: (i)resettlement, reincorporation and reconciliation, (ii)human
development, (iii)  productive and sustainable development, and, (iv) modernization o f the state
and improved governance. Inthe ten years since the signing o f the Accords, progress towards
achievement o f the specific targets contained therein has been uneven, with major gains in some
areas (e.g., reductions in the military, decentralization, coverage-albeit  not quality-of social
and basic services) but slower-than-hoped-for progress in others (accelerating economic growth,
raising tax revenues to       12% o f GDP, land registrationhedistribution and reducing
crime/violence).

3.     Largely as a result of the country's historical legacy, poverty and inequality are high
and social indicators (health, nutrition, education) are low relative to the country's average
income. About 56 percent of all Guatemalans lived inpoverty in 2000 and about 16 percent in
extreme poverty, despite a decline inthe late1990s when growth rates reached 4 percent or about
1.4 percent per capita on average. The Government is currently undertaking a new living
standards measurement survey which will provide updated poverty and welfare statistics by late
this year. An economic slowdown inthe first years o f the millennium (2001-2003) is likely to
have dampened the rate o f poverty reduction, although rising remittance flows from family
members working abroad probably offset this for many households.

4.     I n order to reduce extremepoverty by halfbetween 2000 and 2015 and thus accomplish
thefirst of the Millennium Development Goals, Guatemala needs to both accelerate economic
growth and increase investment in basic social and infrastructure services to help ensure that
the benefits of growth reach the poor. Calculations presented in the Bank's 2004 Country
Economic Memorandum (CEM) indicate that to meet the extreme poverty MDG by 2015, the
economy needs to grow at a per capita rate o f about 2-2.4 percent or approximately 4.5-5 percent
per annum inreal terms. Inaddition to growth, it is critical to continue to increase investment in
human development (education, health and nutrition) and infrastructure to facilitate the
participation o fthe poor inthe growth process.




                                                 1

5 .      An important impediment to steady progress on growth, poverty reduction and
strengthening of public institutions since the Peace Accords has been the lack of political and
policy continuity. This, in turn, is related to the short political cycle, immature political
institutions and political and social fragmentation-a                legacy o f the country's colonial history and
civil war. For example, the current 158-member congress is made up o f representatives o f three
"major" parties (including President Berger's party, GANA) each with between 25-30 seats, 3
other parties with around 10 seats each ,and remaining seats split among a number o f smaller
parties, most with under 5 seats.                  Presidents are elected for 4-year terms, but given a
constitutional limit to a single term, positioning by parties and candidates for the next election
begins early, with obvious difficulties for passage o f legislation sponsored by the executive.
There have been a number o f efforts to forge longer-term consensus on development priorities
and policies through national dialogues on key issues such as fiscal reform, the MDGs/poverty
reduction and land, but the impact o f these has been limited to date.


   11. ECONOMICCONTEXT AND RECENTMACROECONOMIC PERFORMANCE

6.       The structure of Guatemala's economy has shifted substantially since the 1980s,
moving from a principally agriculture (coffee-dominated) base, to a much more diversified
economy, with increased emphasis on commerce, tourism and financial services. Commerce and
services together accounted for about 30% o f GDP in2004, followed by agriculture (about 23%
o f GDP) and industrial manufacturing (13% o f GDP). Maquila, mining, energy, tourism,
financial services and transport/ communications were the fastest growing sectors. In terms o f
employment, however, agriculture remains dominant, accounting for about 36% o f employment,
versus about 22% and 17% in commerce and industry respectively. Consumption remains
dominated by the private sector (82% o f GDP), supported inpart by steady growth in worker's
remittances, while public sector consumption is small, at about 8% o f GDP. Likewise, gross
domestic investment (19-20% o f GDP) i s dominated by the private sector-accounting                                for about
four-fifths o f the total or about 16% o f GDP.

7.      Since the Peace Accords of 1996, Guatemala has also made notable progress in
entrenching macroeconomic stability through the adoption of disciplinedfiscal and monetary
policies, and key banking reforms.        This is evidenced in part by the economy's ability to
weather significant shocks including the recent oil price shock and the damage caused by tropical
storm Stan which struck the country in October 2005. Table 1 above provides a comparison o f
key economic indicators for Guatemala and its Central American neighbors. As the table shows,
Guatemala compares favorably on a number o f key indicators including public debt, fiscal
management and external position. Inflationthough not out o f line with most neighbors, i s a key
focus o f Government attention. Currently, the Central Bank is targeting an inflationrate close to
6% for 2006-07, supported through gradual increases inbenchmark interest rates (see para 14).

A. Growth and MacroeconomicManagement: Recent Evolution

8.       For several decades, dating back to the 1960s, Guatemala's economy has been
characterized by low volatility and inflation, but also lower growth, when compared with LAC
regional averages. Growth was especially poor inthe 1 9 8 0 when per capita income declined
                                                                  ~ ~
drastically due to regional macroeconomic instability andthe intensification o f Guatemala's civil
war. Inthe 1 9 9 0 ~ ~ Guatemalan economy posted an annual average growth rate o f slightly
                      the
over 4 percent per annum (1.4 percent per capita). While this pace was a dramatic improvement
over the previous decade, it was nonetheless a somewhat disappointing outcome given high
growth expectations following the cessation o f the civil war in 1996 and major structural reform
efforts-in   trade and financial sector liberalization, private participation in telecommunications
andpower and increased spending andpolicy improvements ineducation andhealth.

9.      I n thefirst years of the current millennium (2001-03), growth in Guatemala was once
again negative in per capita terms, due both to external and internal factors. Internally, the
investment climate was negatively affected by a widespread lack o f private sector confidence in
the former government associated with unpredictable changes in public policy, deterioration in
governance and a weakening o f the rule o f law. On the external front, the terms o f trade were
negatively affected, due mainly to a drastic and long-lived collapse inthe world price o f coffee.
Coffee export revenues fell from close to $580 million in 1999 to $268 million in2002. Rising
oil prices following 9/11 have also tended to depress growth. Inaddition, a slow-down in the
world economy (including the U.S. economy) in 2001-02 resulted in falling demand for
Guatemalan exports (e.g., maquila products) and affected manufacturing activity through
investor sentiment and other channels.

10.      TheBerger Administration, which took office in January 2004,placed highpriority on
reigniting growth as a key pillar of its "Vamos Guatemala!" plan to achieve the economic
and, especially, poverty reduction and social goals identified in the 1996 Peace Accords. Its
strategy for achieving and sustaining growth rates o f 4-5% i s well-aligned with the findings and
recommendations o f the Bank's Country Economic Memorandum (completed inearly 2004) and
focuses on: (i)maintaining macroeconomic stability while continuing efforts to raise fiscal
revenues; (ii)further expanding international and regional trade; (iii)     improving the business
climate-including    reducing red tape, increasing infrastructure investment and strengthening
property rights; and (iv) further strengthening the financial sector. The Vamos Guatemala! plan,




                                                  3

described more fully below (section C), also includes a number o f other important elements
aimed at directly addressing poverty and inequality as well as other Peace Accords goals.

11.     I n the two years since implementation of the Berger Administration's development
plan began, the economy is showing strong signs of recovery. Reflecting, inter alia, greater
business confidence in the new administration, the prospects for increased trade openness (DR-
CAFTA, regional integration), improved public sector transparency and a rebound in the prices
o f traditional exports, economic growth (just) surpassed population growth for the first time in
four years, reaching 2.7% in 2004. In 2005 growth rates rose further to 3.2%, despite high
petroleum prices and the widespread damage andbusiness losses due to Tropical Storm Stan.

12.     Private investment has increased substantially since the start of the Berger
Administration, growing at 8.6% and 11.2% respectively in 2004 and 2005. By contrast,
average growth inprivate investment during the four years o f the previous administration (2000-
2003) was negative (-0.4%). For 2006, growth rates are expected to rise to 4.4% and reach 4.7%
by 2007 according to official estimates-Le.,       about 1.8% and 2.1% per capita respectively.
More conservative estimates indicate growth will be closer to 4% per annum for the 2006-07
period, still broadly in line with the Berger Administration's "Vamos Guatemala! development
                                                                                      "
plan. Ifthese growth rates are indeed realized-and      sustained-the   long-run impact on poverty
reduction i s likely to be significant.

13.      The balance of payments also strengthened in 2004-05, with strong growth in exports
and international reserves of about 5 months of imports. Non-traditional exports have been
performing well for several years with strong growth in the maquila sector and a dynamic non-
traditional agriculture export sector (e.g., flowers, seasonal vegetables, fruits and organic crops).
Between 2004 and 2005, non-traditional exports grew by a further 11%, from US$1.9 billion in
2004 to US$2.1 billion in2005, with around three-quarters o f this growth derived from increased
sales to Central American markets.       Traditional exports, following a period o f decline, also
increased dramatically over the 2004-05 period-by       nearly 24%&driven by rebounding world
prices for coffee and sugar. Imports also rose rapidly over the past 2 years contributing to a still-
hightrade deficit o f about 15% o f GDP. However, the current account deficit, helpedbyworker
remittances (9.3% o f GDP in2005) and capital inflows, fell slightly from 4.4% to 4.1% between
2004 and 2005. Overall, Guatemala's external position remains stable, given the country's low
external debt and strong position with respect to internationalreserves. This i s reflectedinrecent
upgrades incountry risk ratings by Fitch (to BB+with a positive outlook) and Standard & Poor's
(to BB with stable outlook).

14.     Fiscal policy remained prudent in 2004-05 while monetary policy slowly tightened in
response to higher-than-anticipated inflation.          The prudent fiscal policy o f successive
Guatemalan governments is reflected inone o f the lowest public debt-to-GDP ratios inthe region
at 19.4% in2005. Since taking office inJanuary 2004, the Berger administration has maintained
fiscal discipline as illustrated by the 2004 and 2005 fiscal deficits o f 1% and 1.5% o f GDP
respectively. For 2006 and 2007, budget deficits o f 1.8% and 1.6% are projected although the 3-
year budget framework approved by Congress in late 2005 allows for a higher deficit (of 2.5%)
in2006 to allow for reconstructionneeds associated with Tropical Storm Stan. Incontrast to

fiscal policy, the monetary framework was strained in2004-05 inthe face of: (i) appreciation the
o f the quetzal given the global weakening o f the U S dollar; (ii)       strong inflows o f private capital
and remittances; and (iii)      the cost-push from higher oil prices. In this context, the authorities
adopted a relatively accommodative monetary stance (despite a rise ininflationto 9.2% in2004)
inan effort to contain second-round effects from the oilprice shock andto discourage additional
capital inflows and further appreciation o f the quetzal. Towards the end o f 2004 and in2005 the
central bank began to implement modest increases in interest rates, with the result that inflation
came down to 8.6% in 2005, though still well above the target range o f 6 (+ or - 1) percent.
Recent inflation data for May 2006 indicate a further downward trend at 7.6% compared to 8.5%
12 months earlier. Banguat (the central bank o f Guatemala) has continued to gradually raise its
seven-day benchmark interest rate, most recently to 4.75 percent inJune 2006.

B. Raising Tax Revenues: A Continuing Challenge

15.     A key challengefor Guatemala is raising tax revenues up to the target of 12percent set
in the Peace Accords as well as the 11 percent target for its tenure set by the Berger
Administration. Although not a major factor in the maintenance o f fiscal stability, given the
country's strong track record on fiscal discipline (see Debt Sustainability Annex), higher tax

16.     Movement on tax policy has had a "stop-go" character under the Berger
Administration, as it traditionally has done in Guatemala. Throughout recent history, powerful
vested interests on both the right and the left have consistently opposed tax initiatives in
Congress or, failing that, launched court challenges to achieve the strike down o f taxes,
appealing to Article 243 o f the constitution, which protects taxpayers from payment o f taxes
which exceed their capacity. The Berger Administration has been forced to play catch-up to
recover lost ground in its efforts to increase tax revenues as a result o f two major setbacks
handed down by the Constitutional Court (CC). These include: (i)     a December 2003 CC ruling
eliminating the minimum corporate tax (IEMA), which had generated about half o f all revenues
from enterprises in2003; and (ii)   a December 2004 CC injunction against the excise tax on fuel.
Inresponse to the first of these decisions, which would have reduced revenues to under 9% o f
GDP, the Government promoted a new tax package (approved in watered-down form by the
Congress in June 2004) that attempted to compensate for the loss o f the IEMA through
reintroduction o f excise taxes on alcoholic beverages, introduction o f a turnover tax as an option
under the corporate tax regime and reintroduction o f a lower, and differently structured
presumptive minimumcorporate tax (IETAAP). This tax package, together with major efforts to
improve tax administration (see below) resulted in tax revenue collections o f 10.4% o f GDP in
2004.

17.     Tax revenuesfor 2005, however,fell slightly to 10.1% of GDPfrom 10.4% in 2004.
The decline was largely attributable to three factors:      (i)one-offopportunityprovidedto
                                                               a
corporate tax-payers under the 2004 tax law to pay 2005 presumptive taxes in2004 with a small
discount-thereby     transferring about 4600 million o f 2005 revenues to 2004; (ii) a 73% drop in
the collection o f the petroleum excise taxes which had been struck down by the CC at the end o f
2004 and could not be collected until a revised version was approved by Congress inmid-2005;
and (iii) the payment o f overdue VAT refunds to exporters, significantly reducing the stock
(0.5% o f GDP) inherited from the previous administration in2003.

18.     I n contrast to the tax policy arena, reforms in tax administration have been
progressing strongly over the past two years, supported inpart by a Bank TA loan and by the
IMF. Under the current administration, the Tax Administration Superintendence (SAT) has
made significant progress in implementing strengthened policies and procedures for tax
collection, in line with its strategic plan. Among the main areas in which progress has been
achieved are: (i) creation o f a Large Taxpayers Coordination unit, responsible for monitoring the
country's 300 largest taxpayers and a Special Taxpayer unit to administer the subsequent 2,700
largest taxpayers; (ii)the designation o f "account officers" to manage taxpayer files; (iii)
required electronic filing by the 3,000 largest taxpayers using SAT software and penalties for
banks accepting paper returns for taxes owed in excess o f Q10,OOO; (iv) penalizing o f taxpayers
for noncompliance with deadlines, by requiring them to make partial payments based on
previous returns; and (v) electronically linking the waybills o f air and sea carriers to customs
declarations to combat smuggling.        In addition to these measures already underway, the
Government has pushed forward a new law on tax administration-approved             by Congress in
June 2006-termed      the "Law for Strengthening o f Tax Administration" which seeks to broaden
the taxpayer base by combating evasion and eliminating loopholes. The Law (see Box A) i s a
major step forward inimprovingtax administration and, consequently, revenues. Implementation

of the law is expected to result in increased revenues of around 0.3% o f GDP (IMF estimate)
over time.

C. GovernmentPrioritiesandDevelopmentPlan

19.     The current Government, in office since January 2004, has affirmed its commitment to
the achievement of national goals established in the 1996 Peace Accords in the political and
human rights, as well as socio-economic, spheres.                 Its policy document, Vamos Guatemala!
(Let's go, Guatemala!), launched in August 2004, lays out an ambitious program for building
social solidarity, competitiveness andtrust (chart 2).

20.      Vamos Guatemala comprises four           main areas for      action during the Berger
Administration's term. At the base are a set o f fundamentals            aimed at addressing the
foundations o f the national development program which comprise: a stable macroeconomic
framework, security (including both citizen security with respect to crime and violence and legal
security-access     to speedy justice); and improved governance and public sector institutions.
Resting on this foundation are three strategic pillars as follows:

     0   Guate Solidaria-aimed      at promoting social solidarity, reduced inequality and greater
        economic integration through strengthening social protectiodnutrition programs for
        vulnerable groups, accelerating investments in education and health and development o f
         social-economic infrastructure in indigenous and rural areas as a means o f reducing
         inequality and creating opportunities;


     0   Guate Crece/Compite-aimed       at accelerating growth to above the 4 percent observed in
         the 1990s, this component o f the strategy emphasizes trade expansion, financial sector
         strengthening,   improved     investment   climate,   export  promotion,   public-private
        partnerships for investments in housing and infrastructure (principal roads, ports and
         airports, renewable energy), development o f high potential sectors (e.g., tourism and
         forestry), support for MSMEs and greater attention to quality standards and technological
         innovation;


     0   Guate Verde-aimed       at promoting sustainable development including building central
         and sub-national capacity for environmental analysis, assessment and monitoring,
         strengthening protected areas management, conserving bio-diversity and preservation o f
         social and cultural heritage.
Inaddition to the above components, and recognizing the constraints imposed by the small size
o f the state, the Vamos Guatemala strategy formally incorporates a cross-cutting emphasis on the
development o f public-private partnerships (with business, NGOs and community groups)
across key areas o f public action.




              111.WORLD BANKCOUNTRYASSISTANCE STRATEGY (CAS)

21.      The Bank's CASfor Guatemala, covering the period FY05-08, was developed within
the Vamos Guatemala program, which represents a satisfactory framework for moving
forward the Bank's core objectives of (i) reducingpoverty and inequality; and (ii)fostering
sustained, equitable growth.       The strategy adopted by the Bank is to move forward with a
balanced program o f roughly equal amounts o f investment lending and quick-disbursing support
inthe base case, the former focused on interventions aimed directly at improvingkey social and
economic services, infrastructure and governance and the latter focused on reigniting equitable
growth. This strategy was predicated on the assessment that Guatemala's long track record o f
sound macroeconomic management, coupled with the Berger administration's commitment to
promoting equitable growth, strengthening public institutions,          improving the country's
competitive position and addressing long-standing social issues, makes the country a good
candidate to receive DPL assistance at this time.

Government, the base case of the CAS includes a built-in range from $460 million to $660
million, linkingprocessing of each DPL in the series of three to continued progress on afew
strategically signijkant policy       objectives.    These areas include fiscal performance,
improvements in governance and public sector management, social sector advances, and
progress on trade, financial sector reforms and the business climate, as key drivers o f growth.
The country has made notable progress overall on these strategic areas, leading to the judgment
that it is appropriate to proceed at this time with the second operation o f the DPL series. With
respect to fiscal performance, deficits have been maintained at low levels as anticipated, but as
previously discussed (paras 15-18), the Government has not been able to make headway in the
effort to raise total revenues as a share o f GDP, due to political opposition, unfavorable
constitutional court rulings on taxes and other factors. While the DR-CAFTA is expected to
affect revenues negatively due to a drop intariffs, improvements in domestic tax collections are
expected to offset these declines at least partially and the government i s expected to maintain its
conservative fiscal stance. In all other areas, performance has met or exceeded targets.          For
example, advances in transparency and public financial management have far surpassed
expectations, with nearly all central government agencies using a real-time, internet-based
system for financial management (SIAF) and procurement (Guatecompras).                    Moreover,
expansion o f the systems to the municipal level has expanded more rapidly than anticipated, with
about 110 and 260 (of 331) municipalities using SIAF and Guatecompras respectively, as against
a target o f 80 for end 2007. Social spending has also exceeded expectations, reaching 5.4% of
GDPby end2005 versus a target o f 5.5% for end 2007 andprogress is beingmade on improving
education quality and health and nutrition for vulnerable groups, in part with assistance from
Bank investment projects. In the growth and competitiveness arena, there have been continued
advances in: (i)trade openness, both international and regional; (ii)financial system
strengthening (electronic payments system in place, supervision o f financial conglomerates to
curb related party lending, financial sector consolidation supported by Bank lending); (iii)
reduction o f red tape and transactions costs and time in key areas such as customs, business
licensing and property registration-though       much more is needed; and (iv) public-private
partnerships in key infrastructure sectors and development o f the legal framework for
concessions for major roads projects.

23.      Consequently, a number of strong factors warrant proceeding with the loan. To
summarize, these factors include: (i) government's persistent efforts, inthe face o f a difficult
                                       the
political context, to strengthen tax administration, raise public revenues and to lay the
groundwork for future increases in taxes through developing political and social consensus on
public investment goals and priorities; (ii)despite the lack o f progress inraising the tax ratio, the
government has been able to achieve its objective o f increasing pro-poor social spending as a
share o f GDP within a framework o f fiscal prudence, by making difficult cuts in military and
administrative spending and reallocation o f existing resources; and (iii) the strong progress inall
areas o f the DPL other than the tax ratio, with performance exceeding expectations inkey areas
such as improved governance and transparency.

24.      This document lays out the program for broad-based growth to be supported by the
DPL series, with special reference to the second loan cfor US$lOO million). The quick-




                                                  10

disbursing support provided through the DPL series is synchronized with the government's
annual budget cycle and would enable the Government to reduce its external financing costs by
partially replacing higher cost bonds issued in the international capital markets. The design o f
the DPL series, described in detail inthe remainder o f the document, draws on an extensive body
o f recent analytical work undertaken by the Bank. Chief among these are the 2003 Guatemala
Poverty Assessment (GUAPA), the C E M (2004) the Investment Climate Assessment (2004), the
regional DR-CAFTA Study (2005), the Public Expenditure Review (2005) and joint CFAA-
CPAR (2005).

25.     The CAS envisages that the DPL series in Guatemala will be accompanied by selective
investment lending focused mainly on reducingpoverty and inequality in key areas where the
Bank has global expertise and which build upon prior successful implementation o f innovative
operations in Guatemala.     These include projects for (i)education quality and secondary
education expansion; (ii)maternal and child health and nutrition; (iii)rural economic
development, including infrastructure, technical support and decentralized planning; (iv) land
administration (cadastre and titling); (v) infrastructure development through a public-private
partnership (PPP) and guarantee approach; and (vi) governance and public sector management
improvements. In order to be responsive to the government's needs, and taking into account the
election cycle, investment lending will be clustered inFY06 and FY07.

26.     I n addition to lending, the CAS encompasses other significant analytical work in
support of Vamos Guatemala, including a Country Environmental Analysis (CEA), Poverty
and Social Impact Analyses (PSIAs) in FYs 05 and 06 and an update of the Poverty
Assessment (FY07). The PSIAs are geared to support key refoms included in the DPL series,
ensuring that social impacts are identified and mitigating actions taken as necessary. The first
PSIA was carried out in the first half o f 2005, providing a detailed analysis o f the potential
income and welfare impact o f DR-CAFTA tariff reductions on producers and consumers and
incorporated into a chapter o f the regional DR-CAFTA report that was widely disseminated and
discussed in Guatemala. A new PSIA currently in near-final drafl is analyzing impacts o f the
trade agreement in greater depth on Guatemala's indigenous population (both urban and rural).
In addition, a PSIA on the distributive impact of Guatemala's tax regime-including         fiscal
reforms supported by the first DPL-was        completed in FY05 and disseminated to range o f
opinion-makers from civil society and think-tanks. The CEA (Box B) focused on analyzing the
efficiency and effectiveness o f Guatemala's environmental policy and institutional framework to
address current and future environmental issues with special emphasis on those arising from
trade liberalization and infrastructure investments.     The report has recently been sent to
Government for review and its findings will be supported through ongoing Bank operations
and/or grant support. The Poverty Assessment Update, based on the Government's new 2006
living standards survey to analyze trends in poverty and inequality, will also inform Bank
operations design.

              Box B: Guatemala Country EnvironmentalAnalysis-Preliminary Findings
Guatemala has made significant progress inestablishing a solid legal and institutional framework for environmental
protection. This fiamework provides a sound -but still incomplete -basis for developing effective environmental
policies. The country amended the Constitution to give legal importance to environmental issues; passed an
environmental law and created the National Environmental Commission; passed a law on protected areas and
established the National Council o f Protected Areas; created the Environmental Secretariat; expanded significantly
the regulatory framework; created the Ministry for the Environment and Natural Resources; and launched an
environmental agenda (Guate Verde 2004-2008) aimed at ensuring the long-term sustainability o f the country's
development program through systematic attention to environmental considerations. Despite these institutional and
legal improvements, Guatemala still faces considerable environmental challenges, including: i)over-exploitation o f
water resources; ii)water pollution; iii)deforestation; iv) soil and land degradation; and v) vulnerability to natural
disasters.

      Given the new challenges facing the country with the signing o f DR-CAFTA and the proposed scaling-up o f
infrastructure investments, there is a need to accelerate consolidation o f institutional and organizational tasks in
Guatemala. Based on the best regional and international practices, the report concludes that mainstreaming
environmental considerations into sectoral policies rather than scaling-up the operations o f environmental agencies
i s the best way to prepare Guatemalan institutions for current environmental challenges and those it will encounter
in the future. Furthermore, the report concludes that if MARN concentrates on its core fimctions and works in
coordination with other environmental agencies, ministries, and municipalities, most o f these challenges can be met
in a short time with minor adjustments to the existing framework of environmental management. Two important
issues to address are: i)improve the effectiveness and efficiency o f the Environmental Impact Assessment system
(EM), and ii)delegate some ofMARN`sresponsibilities to other ministries, environmental units and municipalities.
      The report also emphasizes the need to provide the right incentives to economic agents (e.g., promoting
compliance through achievable requirements but with credible sanctions to violators, rather than trying to change
behavior by threatening with criminal charges that are ultimately not enforced) and to engage civil society by
improving information and participation mechanisms. Inthe long term, deeper reforms to the legal framework for
water and transparency would be needed, but they need longer periods o f maturation, consensus building, and
.negotiations, and ultimately congressional approval.



      IV. RESTORINGBROAD-BASEDGROWTH:PROGRESSAND CHALLENGES

27.       Besides maintaining macroeconomicstability, Guatemala's key challengesin restoring
broad-basedgrowth are: (i)         taking advantage o f expanding trade opportunities and ensuring that
SMEs can share in those opportunities, (ii)              strengthening the climate for both domestic and
foreign investment and business, (iii)        modernizing property rights, (iv) addressing infrastructure
bottlenecks to growth, (v) continuing to strengthen and deepen the financial sector, (vi)
enhancing the capacity for efficient and effective poverty-oriented public spending-especially
for education and health, and (vii) strengthening public sector management and transparency.
The principal issues and government plans with respect to each o f these areas are discussed
further below in some depth as they form the background to the specific actions supported by
this DPL series. For ease o f reference they are organized in the same order as they appear inthe
DPL matrix, for which they form the background. Controlling the high levels of crime and
violence i s another key element o f the effort to promote growth (as well as security) in
Guatemala. Issues in this area are not described here as they lie beyond the scope o f this DPL
operation. It should be noted, however, that Government is currently working with a number o f
bilateral donors (including Japan, Spain and USA) to implement an integrated strategy to address
this problem, within aregionalcontext.




                                                          12

A.      PROMOTING GROWTH          AND STRENGTHENINGTHE INVESTMENT CLIMATE

A.1: Promotionof Trade Expansion

28.      The Berger Administration regards international trade expansion as a principal
driver of growth in Guatemala in the short- to medium-term and has expended considerable
political and institutional capital on expanding trade and investment opportunities.                 The
Guatemalan Congress ratified the US-Central America-Dominican Republic Free Trade
Agreement-DR-CAFTA-in             March 2005 (a prior action for DPL I).         Over the past year, the
focus has been on passing the CAFTA Implementation Law, an omnibus law involving
amendments to existing legislation in a number o f areas related to CAFTA provisions.
Following a tough set o f negotiations initially with USTR and subsequently with domestic
interest groups and congressional blocs, the CAFTA implementation law was finally approved in
early June 2006 and CAFTA became effective on July 1, 2006. Free trade agreements are now
also in place with Mexico and Taiwan, and discussions with Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia
and the European Union are ongoing.            To ensure that opportunities opened up by the new
agreements are widely disseminated and to help Guatemalan businesses understand requirements
to access international markets, the Government has established an FTA Management and Trade
Compliance Office. It has also taken steps to facilitate and promote foreign investment and
support quality improvements in Guatemalan products, as discussed further below.

29.     Guatemala is also spearheading regional integration efforts within Central America,
with steps already being taken towards a Central America customs union, through the
harmonizing and simplification of customs procedures with neighboring countries, most
notably El Salvador and Honduras. Specific achievements to date in this area include: (i)
harmonization o f about 95% o f customs duties among all Central American countries-with
work ongoing for the remainder; (ii)use o f identical customs forms (FAUCAS) for by
Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador; (iii)          reduction o f customs clearance times to 2 hours
(against 1-2 days previously) for air and road cargo between Guatemala, El Salvador and
Honduras through adoption o f an electronic filing system and a reduction inphysical inspections
for goods originating in these cooperating countries; (iv) implementation o f a pilot scheme to
eliminate customs inspections at the national borders for goods cleared through specified Central
American border entry points'; and (v) provision for customs inspections by other Central
American countries at elected regional ports andborders.

30.    Poverty and Social Impact Assessment (PSIA) conducted in 2005 and 2006, with
support from the Bank, indicate that the net effects of DR-CAFTA on the poor and on the
indigenous population broadly would bepositive. On average, a typical indigenous household
would enjoy gains o f nearly 15% o f its average per capita expenditure, with consumption gains
dominating income losses. Even though maize prices decline over time and this hurts producers,
these losses are more than compensated by consumption gains on clothing, yellow maize, other
cereals and dairy. However, it should be noted that the white maize exception in CAFTA

1. Tecun Uman, Puerto Quetzal, Puerto Santo Toms and Puerto Barrios inGuatemala, Puerto Cortes inHonduras,
   Puerto Cutuco and Puerto de Ajacutla inEl Salvador, and PenasBlancas inNicaragua.



                                                     13

provides some protection to producers. An important finding is that further significant gains can
be realized by the poor if the export opportunities brought by CAFTA in agricultural activities
and manufacturing employment are complemented by domestic reforms aimed at facilitating
production and trade. Government priorities in this respect are summarized below in paras 30-
31.

31.      The strategyfor trade expansion assigns a central role to ensuring that the benefits of
new trade opportunities are accessible to SMEs, both directly through access to export markets
and indirectly by developing strategic linkages with foreign and local exporting companies. This
effort i s being supported through the Rural Economic Program operation which assists rural
cooperatives to form productiodTA and marketing linkages with larger formal sector businesses.
Inaddition, the Presidential Commission for Competitiveness (PRONACOM) has supported the
establishment o f networks o f SME entrepreneurs (the "grupos gestores") throughout the country.
It is also supporting improved availability o f market intelligence, including data on export
contacts, via a joint program with the National Institute o f Statistics (INE). Special efforts are
being made to reach out to indigenous entrepreneurs through the Association o f Mayan
Entrepreneurs and support to CECMA to create an Indigenous CompetitivenessResearch Center.
Finally, a network o f "infocenters",      with internet connectivity, is being established to
disseminate information throughout the country, in part with assistance from the Bank's Rural
Economic Program operation approved earlier this year. The infocenters are expected to act as
important focal points for support to SMEs outside the capital city.

32.      To assist low income farmers and laborers (especially those involved with maize
production) to shvt away from traditional livelihoods, the government has also launched an
initiative to promote alternative employment in non-traditional agriculture, sustainable forestry
and off-farm activities insectors such as tourism and agribusiness. Inpartnership with the private
banking sector and groups such as the non-traditional exporters association, Agexpront, the
initiative combines technical assistance and marketing help for micro, small and medium rural
producers with improved access to finance via the commercial banking system, through the
provision o f a Government guarantee. The initiative is being supported by USAID and other
donors. The IDB-, Sweden-, and World Bank-supported Rural Economic Program is also aimed
at strengtheningrural cooperatives to take advantage o f opportunities created by trade expansion
agreements.

A.11: PromotingInvestmentand BusinessEfficiency

33.      While Guatemala still has a long way to go in improving the overall business climate,
there have been some notable achievements in reducing the costs of doing business over the
past 1-2 years-an       important factor in assisting SMEs in particular. One important
achievement has been the implementation o f a lower time limit for customs processing, from 4 to
2 days. If the required time expires and the cargo i s not cleared, the trader can go to the
warehouse and claim it. There has also been a reduction in discretionality and "red lights" in
customs, through adoption o f a new risk based system for inspections, which relies on objective
risk profiles such as type o f import, place o f origin, product type etc). On the basis o f this
system, the number o f physical inspections o f cargo has been falling steadily to levels more
consistent with international practice-from    physical inspection o f about 81% o f imports in




                                                14

January 2005 to about 45% in June 2006.            A second major initiative has been the recent
establishment o f a "one-stop shop" for business start-ups allowing prospective firms to apply for
company, tax and social security registration inone step and check the status o f their applications
on line, with help services provided through a chat line. Once this registration agency is fully
operational it i s expected to grant same-day temporary registration and final registration within
around 25 days. A third important development since DPL Ihas been the presentation to
Congress o f a new law which would restrict the abuse o f nullity actions (a motion that requests
dismissal o f a case on procedural grounds).          To date, debtors seeking to avoid contract
enforcement could file a nullity action for as little as a spelling error ina contract, thereby buying
considerable time (up to 5-6 months) while the case came up for adjudication. Under the new,
proposed law, judges would be given more discretion to reject nullity motions and new, shorter
time limits would be set for the presentation o f nullities.

34.     Another area in which progress is apparent is the promotion of foreign direct
investment (FDI). A newly-established agency, Invest inGuatemala (IIG), leads this effort with
assistance from MIGA and the Bank's Competitiveness project.                 The agency has begun
implementing its promotion strategy which highlights investments in light manufacturing,
tourism, call centershusiness process outsourcing and agribusiness. The strategy outlines targets
for new investments, job creation, indirect employment, and the expected impact o f these FDI
flows on exports. IIG i s now seeking to effectively measure the amount o f local value added.
This will set a benchmark to implement programs that increase linkages between the local
private sector and international investors operating in Guatemala to provide goods and services
that further increase local value added. IIG can already point to a number o f successes in
attracting foreign investments-e.g.,    since it became fully operational about a year ago (a prior
action for DPL I),    IIG has been instrumental in attracting about US$120 million in FDI to
Guatemala, involving the creation o f 6,000 new jobs. Government has also sought to increase
the operating autonomy o f IIG, through a partnership with a reputable private sector foundation,
FUNDESA, operating inGuatemala.

35.      To ensure institutional coordination in the competitiveness area, the Government has
created an Office      of the Presidential Commissioner for the Promotion of National
Competitiveness (Pronacom) and maintains a system o f monthly meetings between Pronacom,
the Ministry o f Economy, and representatives o f the private sector, universities and civil society,
to review and monitor work plans and progress achieved. Pronacom is part o f a Central
American network o f government competitiveness agencies, allowing the region to coordinate
closely as it faces the challenges presented by the DR-CAFTA agreement. In carrying out its
mandate, Pronacom has developed a strategy o f alliances with key local partners such as
Agexpront and the tourism sector as well as close connections with regional and international
institutions such as INCAE, the USDA, the World Bank Group and the UNsystem.                  Thus
far, Pronacom i s holding itself to a high standard o f performance, with concrete indicators in
priority areas for the private sector and DR-CAFTA.

36.      The adoption of new technologies and promoting innovation are key elements of the
Guatemalan Government's effort to increase the productivity of Guatemalan businesses. In
addition to the appointment o f a Presidential Commissioner for Science and Technology, the
Government has established a program linking universities and research centers with the private




                                                  15

sector in order to stimulate the research and development process. Another priority since 2004
has been the reform o f the national training system, led by INTECAP, as a means o f raising the
skills level o f the labor force. Inthis regard, some pilot programs have been implemented inthe
past year under which INTECAP acts as a regulator and certifier of training programs organized
and implemented by the private sector, rather than providing the training directly as it has
traditionally done. Depending on the success o f these pilots, the end-goal i s to transform
INTECAP's role from training provider to regulator in the medium-term. A third initiative has
been to reorient the focus o f the Council o f Science and Technology towards improved
technological diffusion among small- and medium-sized enterprises and to expand the role o f the
private sector in its advisory board. In addition, a system o f incentives has been established to
promote the acquisition o f new technology via capital goods purchases, technology licensing
arrangements and other appropriate mechanisms.


A.111: PropertyRights

37.      Fundamental to Guatemala's growth agenda-as well as to the achievement of
increased social solidarity and a better business climate-is     the establishment of secure rights
to land. Over the past several years, considerable progress has beenmade on cadastral surveying
and regularization o f land-largely    inurban,but also inrural, areas where most poor households
live. Until 2004, however, this progress was threatened by limited titling and the transitory
nature o f the institutional framework.      An example is the Department of Peten, where the
cadastral work was substantially completed by early 2005 but only about a quarter o f land
parcels surveyed had been titled and registered, reflecting both the institutional weaknesses o f
the titling entities (municipalities for urban, andFONTIERRAS for rural, land) and the transitory
nature o f the cadastral process. With the aim o f rectifying these problems, Government, in2005,
passed a modem law o f cadastre and land registry which, inter alia, establishes an autonomous,
unifiedregistry and cadastral office (registro de informacion catastral-RIC)   outside o f the court
system, and increases the transparency and accountability o f the RIC through establishment o f an
independent Board with members representing different societal interests. Since passage o f the
law, the new Registry has been established, it's board installed, and a new, independently-
selected, director appointed. Moreover, over the past year or so, the time to register property fell
by almost two weeks due to an increase in the number o f registrars from 3 to 14 and full
implementation o f an electronic registration system. The RIC i s now establishingphysical maps
o f all properties which will help resolve cases o f overlapping property titles.      The Bank's
ongoing Land Administration project is supporting these efforts.


A.IV: StrengtheningInfrastructurethroughPrivateSector Participation

38.      On the supply side of the economy, the Government's growth strategy places strong
emphasis on public-private partnerships for            both financing and implementation of
investments in infrastructure (roads, ports and airports, telecommunication and ICTs and
renewable energy). As a first priority, the Government has promoted a series o f large
infrastructure projects in the transport sector to be implemented via public `private partnerships.
These include: link roads in the northern and Pacific corridors, a link road connecting the




                                                  16

Atlantic and Pacific ports, a partial metropolitan beltway for Guatemala City and the
construction of a freeway from Guatemala City to ElRancho. To establish a clear legal basis for
this effort, the Government presented a framework law for public-private partnerships to the
Congress in 2005 as well as specific laws facilitating private participation in the construction o f
(i) 362kmnorthernlink-roadconnectingsomeofthepoorestareasofthecountry(Franja
    the
Transversal del Norte) and (ii)  the 1OOkm partial metropolitan beltway (Anillo Metropolitano).
Congress enacted the two specific laws in late 2005 and an international bidding process has
beeninitiated for their construction, with bids expected inAugust 2006. Work has also begun on
the Guatemala-El Rancho freeway with assistance from the Government o f Taiwan, albeit
outside o f the PPP model. Thus far, however, Congress has not acted on the framework Law o f
Public-Private Alliances, despite wide national consultation o f the Law and its provisions by the
Executive prior to its submission to Congress. Government i s still pressing for its enactment
duringthe second halfo fthis calendar year.

39.     Efforts are also underway to establishpartnerships with theprivate sector to improve
management of key infrastructure such as airports and ports. In late 2004, a management
committee comprised o f users (including airlines, cargo companies, the tourism agency etc.) and
representatives o f the civil aviation authority for better management o f the main international
airport (La Aurora). Inaddition, Government has made substantial progress inimplementation o f
a well-designed program o f upgrading and expansion o f the nation's main airport facilities in
accordance with an approved master plan, which is hlly in line with recommendations o f a
Bank-supported PPIAF study o f air transport needs and international safety and security norms.
Action i s also underway to upgrade Guatemala's USFAA ranking to Category Ithrough a
program o f strengthening the civil aviation authority, including security measures. This would
enable direct flights (both cargo and passenger) to U.S. destinations by Guatemalan carriers.
Government's efforts with respect to seaports during 2005 and early 2006 were focused on
upgrading their security certification to international standards (prior action for DPL I).   With
this achieved, the focus has now been on improvingthe efficiency o f operations at Puerto Santo
Tomas, the country's publicly-run main Atlantic sea port, through establishment o f a new private
dock for cruise ships (construction now underway) and development o f plans for a privately-
operated cargo handlingand warehouse facility at the port.

40.     Another priority for Government is the diffusion of information technologies (ICTs)
and telecommunicationstopreviously un-sewed rural municipalities. Guatemala made huge
strides in access to telephones due to privatization and liberalization reforms program
implemented by the end o f the 1990s. The number o f fixed lines has risen from 400,000 to one
million; and cellular phones, from 30,000 to 1.2 million.          The Berger administration i s
committed to stimulating hrther private sector investment in telecommunications and ICTs by
updating the legal and regulatory framework to make it consistent with DR-CAFTA, to take into
account market and technological innovations and to encourage the use o f ICTs to improve
governance,' delivery o f services and increase the competitiveness o f Guatemala's economy. In
order to address the growing urban-rural "digital divide", a rural access strategy has been
adopted that uses output-based aid (OBA) mechanisms aimed at fostering private sector
provision to each municipality o f at least one internet access point that enables local
governments, NGOs, and private sector operators broad band access to the internet and to ensure
that all rural localities have at least one public payphone. Implementation o f the rural access




                                                 17

strategy i s already underway and the strategy is being incorporated into a broader Information
Society Strategy which aims at determining priorities for the national broad-band internet
network.     The effort i s being supported by the Bank under the Rural Economic Program
operation and by WBI.


A. V: FinancialSector Strengthening,ModernizationandDeepening

41.      Continuing to strengthen, and deepen the reach oJ; the financial system is a major
priority for the government, building on the significant progress made since the banking crisis
of 2001. Legislation passed in the wake o f the crisis and complementary regulation addressed a
number o f deficiencies in the framework for (a) the conduct o f monetary and financial policy,
including the capitalization o f the Central Bank and the modernization o f payments systems and
(b) the prudential regulation and supervision o f financial intermediaries moving them closer to
international standards, including reforms for strengthening the legal and institutional capacity o f
the Superintendence o f Banks (SOB) to engage inrisk-based supervision o f financial institutions
and financial groups and creating an orderly market exit mechanism. These reforms aimed at:
enhancing financial stability and solvency, lowering incentives to engage inexcessive risk-taking
activities, improving risk management, improving the quality and availability o f financial
information, increasing access to financing, and preventing money laundering to reduce illegal
activities and comply with international norms. The Berger administration has continued to
implement these legal and institutional changes, with increasingly important progress in areas
that typically take several years to implement (such as full-fledged risk-based supervision). In
addition, it supports consolidation of the banking system through restructuring or closure o f
insolvent banks, and through mergers and acquisitions (with increased interest from regional and
other international players most recently), using the exit mechanismo f the 2002 banking law and
supporting instruments.

42.      The reforms and implementation thus far have contributed to making the financial
system better able to withstand external shocks and facilitate growth, although some
vulnerabilities remain. Guatemala's financial sector has strengthened substantially since 2000
due to improvements in the prudential regulatory framework and stepped-up onsite inspections,
provisions levels are still low and related party lending high. The SOB has completed the
registration o f financial groups, including offshore banks, in accordance with provisions o f the
banking 2002 law, while making progress in their supervision and overall assessment and
supervision o frisks. Inaddition, the SOBhas been taking steps towards implementation o f Base1
11-like supervision (analysis o f bank risks and implementation o f risk-based consolidated
supervision) including: (i)   undertakingmajor restructuring o f the SOBto enhance integration o f
onsite and offsite supervision and increase coordination among supervisors o f different
components o f financial groups, (ii)   changing procedures and basis for supervision away from a
compliance-based approach, (iii)     requiring the creation of risk management units at banks and
promoting improvements in risk analysis, (iv) preparing a revised risk-based consolidated
supervision manual, and improving cooperation and exchange o f information with other SOBS,
(v) mapping o f economic groups, beyond registered financial groups, to enable broader analysis
o f their risks and inter-linkages, (vi) improving the availability and quality o f information at its
credit registry, (vii) institutionalizing financial institution risk assessment through analysis o f

economic sectors and scenario modeling and (viii) completing consultations on revised
accounting manuals for financial institutions, more inline with international norms. Guatemala is
also implementing a significantly strengthened anti-money laundering (AML) regime. InJuly
2004 it was taken o f f the list o f non-cooperative countries o f the Financial Action Task Force
(prior action for DPL I)   and in2005 passed the Law Against Fundingo f Terrorism, which makes
it a crime to fund terrorist activities. Also, it has increasingly participated in regional efforts to
jointly assess the supervision o f other countries' AML/CFT system, reflecting its improved
capacity to analyze and supervise these areas.

43.     The focus is now on completing the modernization of the financial sector legal
framework, operations and increasing access to financial services, including to SMEs. The
Government has recently submitted to Congress a package o f laws, supported under the Bank's
FSAL, as follows: (i) Microfinance Law, which would allow the strongest non-bank financial
                        the
intermediaries (currently NGOs) focusing on this sector to operate as lenders under regulation
and supervision by the SOB;^ (ii)     the Law o f Movable Guarantees, which is intended to facilitate
the use and repossession o f non-traditional collateral, to promote access to finance; and (iii)            the
Insurance Sector Law, which will modernize the legal and supervisory framework o f insurance
companies broadening the availability and access o f financial products, which could eventually
include specialized products to address the larger exposure o f Guatemalan firms to weather-
related disasters. In addition, laws have been submitted to facilitate the consolidation o f the
banking system through the removal o f tax impediments to sale o f Bank assets, and a law o f
"Reciprocal Guarantees", which would set the basis for the establishment o f associations that
would provide collateral for its member companies to facilitate access to credit. This package o f
financial sector laws aims to increase prudent lending to groups and enterprises which have
generally been excluded from bank financing, such as MSMEs. In terms o f financial sector
operations, Banguat has been modernizing the institutional and supervisory framework for the
functioning o f payments systems. A major step has been the full implementation o f the Real
Time Gross-Settlement Systems (RTGS) in effect since January 2006.                        The new system i s
substantially increasing the efficiency and accuracy o f financial sector transactions.


B: ENHANCING      CAPACITY FOR PRIORITY SPENDING

44.     A key element of the Government's growth and poverty agenda is the objective of
increasing public spending in key areas such as human development (education, health and
nutrition) and on rural economic and social infrastructure, an area where good progress has
been made to date. Notably, the Berger Administration in2004, reduced by one-third the size of
the military and began a step-wise effort to direct a greater share o f the budget to social
programs. Social expenditures (Peace Accords definition) rose fi-om 5% o f GDP in 2004, to
5.4% in 2005 and a further increase, to 5.9%, has been budgeted for 2006. This level would
implyexpenditures on the social sectors o f around halfo f total public spending and over halfo f


2. This i s expected to have positive demonstration effects over smaller NGOs also focusing on microfinance,
   which will remain self-regulated but for which institutional and legal reforms are also underway. Other
   complementary efforts to improve the legal, institutional and supervisory efforts could be expected to emerge
   regarding credit cooperatives, which are very important players in the provision o f microfinance and housing
   products.



                                                       19

total revenues. 78% o f the increase in social spending has been directed to education (excluding
tertiary level), health and social assistance. The effort to reorder expenditure priorities is
especially commendable in light o f the high proportion (about 41%) o f legally mandated
earmarks, which leave very little room for maneuver. In addition, there has been a concerted
effort to increase investment spending vis a vis recurrent spending. Between 2004 and 2005,
investment expenditures increased by 18% innominal terms while the corresponding increase in
recurrent spendingwas 8.6%, close to the level o f inflation.

45.      I t is worth noting that Government has launched a campaign to promote public
awareness oJ and spearhead a national dialogue on, the country's social objectives and needs,
define their costs, and build consensus on the appropriate role for the public sector in
achieving them.       In part, the goal is to facilitate a common vision of poverty and social
development strategy as well as lay the ground-work for further tax policy changes in support o f
that vision. In parallel, the central government i s working with local authorities to promote
revisions to the municipal tax code to enable increases inproperty tax revenues, in part through
provision o f greater autonomy to the municipalities to set appropriate property tax rates. This, in
turn, would enable a higher contribution by municipalities to the provision of key basic and
social services inthe areas under their jurisdiction.

46.       I n addition, Government is committed to strengthening budgetaryprocesses in order to
increase the efficiency and effectiveness of core ministries, through adoption of a results-
based and multi-annual approach to budgeting.           The Government took a significant leap
towards enhanced planning and accountability in key sectors with the introduction in 2005 o f
agreements among MOF, SEGEPLAN and four major Ministries (Education, Health, Agriculture
and Infrastructure, Communications and Housing) to move towards this new budgeting
framework. The process has been undertaken under a well-designed planthat has resulted inthe
early communication o f institutional budget ceilings to improve the formulation process within a
formal medium-term expenditure framework. To validate and sustain what is, by nature, a long-
term endeavour, a gradual approach is being adopted. The 2006 budget included results-based
allocations for key programs in two o f the four pilot Ministries-Education    and Public Health,
with extension o f the approach to all four pilot Ministries for the 2007 budget cycle. A
monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system is also being developed, inpart with assistance from a
BankIDFgrant.

47.      I n addition to the above efforts to strengthen the efficiency and quality of public
spending, the Government is continuing its efforts to vigorously attack corruption and improve
the transparency of public expenditures (with support from the Bank's Integrated Financial
Management Project). This, inter alia, should help build confidence in the fiduciary role o f the
Government in the use o f public funds and, consequently, reduce opposition to a new tax effort.
This i s discussed further below, inthe section on transparency andpublic sector management.


c.       PUBLIC EXPENDITURE      TRANSPARENCYMANAGEMENT
                                                  AND

48.      One of thefundamentals of the administration's Vamos Guatemala! Plan is to improve
governance and credibility of public sector management and institutions, as means o f forging
higher levels o f trust between government and the public (inpart as the ground work to counter

objections to increased taxes) and in enhancing investment climate. Important steps have been
taken inthat regard, such as the creation o f the Office o f the Commissioner for Transparency, the
issuance o f norms for access to public information in the executive branch, the legalization and
thorough implementation o f a public procurement transparency portal (Guatecompras), the
continued expansion o f the public financial management and public investment systems, and
efforts to clean up customs administration.

49.     At the center of financial management reform is the continued development of the
integrated financial management system (SIAF), which is considered an example of good
practice in the region in terms o f a successful IFMS. SIAF is operating in 70 public sector
entities o f the central government (from 63 when DPL 1was appraised). It incorporates modem
processes and systems in the core areas o f budgeting, treasury, accounting, as well as in other
areas such as human resource management. The ongoing development o f a management system
(SIGES) has the objective o f establishing automatic linkages betweenthe core financial modules
andthe supporting administrative systems (e.g., procurement andregisters o f fixed assets).


                                       Box C:The Relevance of SIAF

An integrated financial management system with comprehensive coverage has implications for public expenditure
management at four main levels: (i)it contributes to fiscal discipline byprovidingtimelyandreliable informationon
budget execution and by enforcing expenditure limits in accordance with approved budgets and cash flows; (ii)
increases operational efficiency by expediting and standardizing processes; (iii)    supports internal and external
controls through transactional safeguards and audit trails; and (iv) contributes to transparency by facilitating the
publicationo fbudget execution reports and other fiscal reports.



50.     An ambitious objective of the government's reform program is to implement afinancial
management system throughout Guatemala's 332 municipalities, complementing basic tools
for budgeting, accounting, and treasury with additional modules in areas such as civil registry,
services administration and property tax for pertinent local governments. A simple version for
budget recording (SIAFITO-MUNI) was installed in 317 municipalities during 2003 and 2004.
A more robust version (SIAF-MUNI) has been in deployment since 2005 and has replaced the
simplified version in a number o f municipalities. This new version was already operational in
over 110 municipalities (from 46 when the D P L series was appraised) by December 2005, and
the two largest ones (Guatemala and Quetzaltenango) have adopted the central government's
version o f the system. This progress significantly exceeds what was anticipated at the time o f
DPL I,when it was estimated that about 40 additional municipalities would transition from
SIAFITO to SIAF-MUNI inthe year between the two operations.

51.     Looking ahead, the Ministry of Finance is planning to further increase operational
coverage of SIAF to at least 7additional central government entities and of SIAF-MUNI to at
least 40 additional municipalities in the short term. While the DPL program supports these
selective actions, it should be noted that these are framed in a larger action plan adopted by the
Ministry for improvement o f public financial management. Through these measures, the
comprehensiveness and availability o f public information on fiscal and budgetary performance
will be increased, carrying unquantifiable benefits such as facilitating external scrutiny and
analysis, which inturn enhance the government's financial accountability framework.



                                                         21

52.     By December 2005, the government e-procurement system (Guatec0mpras)was in use
by 104 public sector procuring agencies of the central government, and over 260
municipalities. Through an executive decree, social funds, trust funds and NGOs using public
funds are required by law to use Guatecompras, and the recent CAFTA Implementation Law
modifies the National Procurement Law making it mandatory for all government entities.
Moreover, an interface o f Guatecompras and SIAF has been achieved through the
implementation o f SIGES. It i s expected that further development o f the system will take place
inthe context of a comprehensive strategic plan for e-procurement, product classification and
information standards anduse o f data for procurement planning.

53.      Going forward, the procurement policy formulation and oversight responsibilities,
including leadership for implementing and monitoring the reform, need strengthening.
Currently, capacity building initiatives are not well coordinated, the development o f key
implementing tools (e.g. bidding documents and procedures) is lagging, and there have beenno
in-depth assessments o f the government's procurement strategy or the supplying markets to
support the introduction o f new contracting approaches and cost reduction programs. At the
executing entity level, in government entities, most institutional procuring units are non existent
or have poor capacity. It i s expected that short-term priority will be given to the strengthening o f
the procurement regulatory body (DNCAE) and to the creation or strengthening o f the
institutional procurement units.



                                   V. THE PROPOSEDLOAN

A.      PROGRESSINTHE BROAD-BASED           GROWTH    AGENDA

54.     As the discussion in Section I V above describes, Guatemala has made steady progress
in promoting more equitable, broad-based growth in all areas supported by this DPL series.
Given the design o f the Bank's CAS and the DPL series within Government's own Vamos
Guatemala! plan(paras 19-20), there i s strong client ownership o f the DPL agenda, namely:

    0   promoting equitable growth and strengthening the investment climate

    0   enhancing capacity for increased public spending inpriority sectors

    0   improvingpublic expenditure transparency andmanagement

Following the medium-term framework laid out inDPL I-underpinned            by the substantial body
o f analytical work carried out by the Bank inpartnership with the Government o f Guatemala (see
Box D), the design o f key prior actions, triggers and indicators for DPL I1support progress in
each o f the above three areas.

55.     As noted above and discussed in detail in Section IV,the DPL program remains on
track, with solid progress in each of the three main areas of the agenda. Table 3 below
provides a comparison o f the original triggers for DPL I1laid out inthe DPL Idocument and the



                                                  22

prior actions for the DPL I1 operation.    As the table shows clearly, there has been strong
momentum in all areas o f the DPL program with the original triggers either fully met as
anticipated when DPL Iwas presented to the Board or surpassed invirtually all cases. Notably,
original triggers were exceeded in areas related to improved transparency and efficiency o f
public resource use, intax administration. One area where a change in strategy occurred, relates
to actions on the National Mortgage Bank (CHN), where the difficulty in obtaining a qualified
Congressional majority to support closure (the first-best option) has forced a reassessment.
However, major advances on risk-based supervision-arguably      a more central issue for sectoral
strengthening-have    been made much more rapidly than originally anticipated.         Moreover,
significant progress has been made on containing C H N vulnerabilities. In infrastructure,
substantial progress has been achieved inpassage o f laws pertaining to major PPP-oriented roads
projects and in moving forward the air transport agenda, although the PPP framework law has
been delayed in Congress due to other pressing legislative priorities. The Law remains on the
legislative agenda and will be discussed inCongress during the second half o f this calendar year.
All other areasproceeded as plannedwith onlyminor changes to original expectations.

56.     Looking ahead to DPL III,thefocus is on full implementation of many of the policy
and legislative reforms undertaken to date in areas critical to achievement of the DPL
program 's specified results. The emphasis on implementation rather than legislative actions also
reflects recognition o f the reality that the already-complex process o f getting Congressional
approval for new legislation will become still more difficult going forward, as 2007 i s an election
year. With this in mind, the DPL program was always designed to focus the third operation in
the series on actions which contribute substantially to program objectives but remain under the
control o f the Executive. The specific triggers identified are described in Table 4 below. It
should be noted that a trigger on environment could be added following discussion with
Government o f the recently-completed CEA.

B.      FIDUCIARY       ASPECTS

57.     The 2005 Country Fiduciary Assessment (CFMCPAR) indicates that the fiduciary
environment in Guatemala is generally adequate, as evidenced by the improvements in the
public expenditure management systems made over the previous decade and the actions being
taken by the current administration to continue to increase transparency. Indeed, as described in
detail in previous sections o f the report, the government has shown strong commitment to the
tackling o f fiduciary issues and surpassed targets in many key areas identified by the Country
Fiduciary Assessment. Drawing from this work, certain key actions and selective milestones in
the context o f the DPL program have been identified to help track the public financial




                                                        27

management reform progress. The latter, in turn, are significantly supported by the Bank-
financed Third Integrated Financial Management Project under implementation.



C.      LOAN  ADMINISTRATION

58.     The Bank would disburse the loan proceeds into an account of the central bank
(BANGUAT) denominated in US d01lars.~BANGUAT will immediately credit the disbursed
amounts to the Ministry o f Finance Treasury Single Account ("common fund"), thus becoming
available to finance budgeted expenditures. Within a week o f this operation, the Ministry will
accordingly provide the Bankwith a written confirmation.



D.      MONITORINGEVALUATION
                        AND                  ARRANGEMENTS

59.     The government and the Bank will take advantage o f several important data sources to
assess progress for the DPLs, including:

e       Central and nonfinancialpublic sector budget monitoring from the Ministry o fFinance

e       National Institute for Statistics reports, including a living standards survey planned for
        2005, and annual tracking surveys

e       Investment climate surveys

e       Central Bank o f Guatemala reports and analysis

e       Reviews and analyses o f laws and implementing regulations from the Bank and other
        stakeholders

e       Data from key Government agencies such as SAT, Pronacom andRIC

e       Financial audits and follow up o f CPAR and CFAA recommendations

e       Bank and IMFsupervision missions andreports

e       CEPAL and SIECA surveys.

60.     The government of Guatemala and the Bank have agreed to monitor progress in the
DPLprogram regularly, including at the annual reviews of CASprogress, when revisions to
the scale and timing of the Bank's lendingprogram can be undertaken. Discussions will be
held with the Ministry o f Finance, the main counterpart agency for the loan, who will be in
charge o f M&E for the loan and for collecting from the appropriate sources the data necessary to
assess implementation progress. Other agencies that will play an important role in this process
are the Central Bank (for financial sector issues), the Ministry o f Economy and the Commission
for Competitiveness (for trade and investment climate issues), the SAT (for tax administration

   BANGUAT.Moreover, BANGUATis aparticipant inthe Bank's Reserves Advisory and ManagementProgram

E.      CONSULTATION AND DISTRIBUTIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL                IMPACT

61.     TheDPL series has been developed within theframework of the Government's "Vamos
Guatemala! "plan, which was widely consulted and disseminated within the country. Specific
laws, institutional reforms and programmatic actions supported by the loan series were (and are)
also discussed widely with different groups, including civil society organizations, the private
sector and the research and academic community. A PHRD grant for the DPL series supported
by the Japanese Government included a series o f studies on key issues such as social needs and
tax reform, sectoral impacts o f CAF'TA, improved efficiency of procurement, and public-private
alliances ininfrastructure which were discussed at workshops at the national and regional levels.
With respect to improvements inbusiness climate, including customs reforms, reduction o f red
tape etc., consultations have occurred through the PRONACOM expanded committee, which
includes representatives o f diverse constituencies.     Finally, workshops have been held for
members o f Congress to increase understanding o f the nature o f DPLs and their main features.

62.     The actions supported by this DPL are not expected to have significant adverse
distributional impact in the short- to medium-term. To the extent that the measures have played
a role in Government's ability to maintain social spending levels, their impact on income
distribution i s expected to have beenpositive. This is confirmed bypublic expenditure incidence
analysis undertaken inthe context o f the GUAPA which indicates that public social expenditures
(Peace Accords definition) are generally pro-poor. Likewise, a FY 05 PSIA on the distributive
impact o f fiscal reforms supported by the DPL series, found the reforms to be mildly
progressive. With respect to the social impact o f CAFTA, the Bank's regional report "DR-
CAFTA: Challenges and Opportunities for Central America" found that about 84% o f the
Guatemalanpopulation are net consumers who would benefit from price reductions as a result o f
increased competition. A follow-up PSIA, focused on analyzing the impact o f DR-CAFTA on
the indigenous population, found that an average gain in consumption o f all income groups
(including the poor) would be on the order o f 15% (para 29).          The PSIA found that even
households engaged in maize production would benefit from DR-CAFTA because o f
consumption gains on other necessities and because maize price declines would be mitigated by
the white maize exception included inthe treaty. As a result o f the exception, white maize prices
would likely fall by 19% over time rather than by 38% (without the exception). Nonetheless, to
the extent that a small minority o f maize producers could be adversely affected by the gradual
decline in maize prices, possible mitigating measures would be part of the policy dialogue for
future DPLs and other Bank interventions inGuatemala.

63.     The specific policies supported by this DPL operation are not expected to entail
significant direct impacts on the environment, forests or other natural resources. However, to
the extent that measures supported by the DPL program are successful, over time, in attracting
new investment (including in infrastructure) and trade expansion, there will be a need to
strengthen Guatemala's national institutional capacity to identify and address environmental
policy and regulatory issues. With this in mind, a strategic Country Environmental Analysis



                                                 29

(CEA) was undertaken in 2005-2006 (Box B) and discussed with the Government. The CEA
provides cost effective recommendations for closing gaps in institutional capacity for
environmental regulation. The Government acknowledged the usefulness o f most o f the CEA
analysis and recommendations and has requested the Bank's assistance to implement them. As a
first step, Government intends to allocate an additional Q5 millionto MARNinthe 2007 budget
to strengthen its capacity for environmental monitoring. It has also asked the Bank to form part
o f a commission to try to raise additional funds for this purpose from donor sources.

F.      RISKS

64.      Continued strong performance by the Government is subject tofour main risks during
the implementation of the DPL series: (i) political gridlock, given a divided Congress, (ii)
societal tensions related to the country's post-conflict status, (iii) exogenous shocks related to
natural disasters, and (iv) macroeconomic risks due to external or domestic market volatility.
These are described below.

65.     Political risk is inherent in apost-conflict situation such as Guatemala's, where there
continue to be deepfissures within society, the electorate is verypolarized and the Government
lacks a simple majority in Congress. This, inturn, creates obvious risks for the timely passage
and subsequent implementation o f the Government's legislative agenda. Given that the
executive's party, GANA, holds only about 30 o f 158 seats in Congress, consensus needs to be
reached with opposition parties for all legislative priorities, with important implications not only
for the pace o f reforms, but also the ability to retain the technical and policy coherence o f the
agenda within a political context o f continuous trade-offs and compromises. Especially
controversial i s the tax reform agenda which (as discussed in para 16) is strongly opposed for
different reasons by powerful interests on both the right and the left and subject to the decisions
o f the Constitutional Court (CC). Government is attempting to address this issue through shifting
the focus o f the public dialogue on social needs, their costs and the revenue requirements o f
meeting them, while also reactivating the fiscal pact. Recent changes to the composition o f the
CC, giving it a more technocratic orientation, should also help with respect to fiscal reforms
going forward.     Political as well as social tensions also arise in other controversial areas
including trade liberalization and promotion o f increased private participation in infrastructure,
and issues surrounding property rights and land, all o f which are crucial to accelerating growth
and are central to the Government's agenda. Several o f these areas are also part o f the national
dialogue initiated by the executive to reach broader consensus on directions with different,
interested civil society groups, the private sector and the political parties.

66.      Thusfar, the executive has largely been able to maintain its development agenda in
Congress, through the establishment of clear priorities with the Congressional leadership and
wide consultation with different interest groups within Congressand with broader civil society
groups. Efforts by the international community (including IMF, IDB, UNDP, bilateral and the
Bank) to modernize and professionalize Congress have also helped create better understandingo f
the technical issues surrounding the legislative agenda. In addition, the Government's public
communicatiodconsultation initiatives as well as its continued anti-corruption and public
expenditure transparency campaign, have helped buildcredibility with some groups and opinion-
makers.




                                                 30

67.     Besides political and social risks, Guatemala is also susceptible to external risks
derivingfrom natural phenomena. As with the other Central American countries, Guatemala i s
vulnerable to natural disasters (hurricanes, and seismic or volcanic activity) which could
necessitate unanticipated spending for emergency assistance and reconstruction, thereby
affecting achievement o f established development goals in the short term. Experience with
Tropical Storm Stan shows, however, that fiscal discipline has been a high priority even in the
face o f an emergency.

68.      The main macro-economic risks derive from the financial sector and the external
environment. The financial sector, though substantially stronger than in the past, needs to be
further strengthened through consolidation, improved provisioning and better assessment o f risk.
There has been strong commitment inGuatemalatowards tackling financial sector vulnerabilities
since the 1998 banking crisis and steady progress in reforming the sector has been made with
support from the IMF and the Bank (through the FSAP program and two complementary
financial sector operations). The DPL's focus on strengthening risk-based supervision is also
expected to have a positive impact. In addition, there remains the threat o f shocks from the
external economic environment (e.g., low commodity prices, persistently highoil prices, a slow-
down in the US economy, unfavorable conditions in financial markets) that could affect the
economy negatively-affecting     the achievement o f higher growth rates and negatively affecting
efforts to raise tax revenues.

69.      TheBank's DPLprogram isparticularly well suitedfor managing the risks inherent in
Guatemala's difJicult political and social context. The choice o f a programmatic series o f
single-tranche operations for the provision o f quick-disbursing support means that there will be
several points at which the Bank's program could be reassessed if political gridlock or social
tensions appear to be derailing the development agenda, despite the Government efforts to
address them. In addition, the overall flexibility o f the single tranche design means that-
provided overall progress i s on track-specific elements o f the planned program can be adjusted
interms of the scope and form of specific reforms as well as necessary sequencing changes to
take into account changing political and social realities. Moreover, as noted earlier, the focus in
DPL I11on implementation o f legislative reforms undertaken in DPLs Iand 11, helps to reduce
risks from the political environment going forward.

 Ms. Pamela Cox
 Vice President for Latin America andthe Caribbean
 World Bank
 Washington DC, U S A


 Dear Ms.Cox:


'Since the inception o f the current Government, the administration o f President Oscar Berger has
 established poverty reduction as one o f its principal aims. To achieve this, the focus has been on
 the implementation o f national policies which seek to establish efficient and transparent
 institutions and a stable macro-economic framework as means o f enabling more competitive
 markets, and o f creating opportunities for all citizens to increase their productivity, gain
 employment and invest. Inother words, the goal is to promote development in an equitable and
 sustainable manner.

 Given this aim, the Government has implemented a program o f structural reforms in the
 economic, political and social arenas, which allows for the gradual creation of propitious
 conditions for sustained economic growth and improved national competitiveness, which, in
 turn, would support the achievement o fthe MillenniumDevelopment Goals (MDGs).

 The Government's plan for 2004-2008, formulated inthe program "Vamos Guatemala" includes
 concrete actions for a medium-term strategy and is made up o f five strategic components:
 Guatesolidaria, Guatecrece, Guateinvierte, Guatecompite and Guateverde. It establishes a series
 o f actions whose objectives are to promote a favorable climate for productive investment, which,
 in turn, should translate into better conditions o f living for the Guatemalan population. As a
 result o f this program, important policies have been approved and implemented, these include: a)
 Food Security; b) National CompetitivenessAgenda; and c) Program for National Reforestation.

 The assistance strategy agreed between the Guatemalan Government and the World Bank
 envisages, inter alia, support to "Vamos Guatemala" through a series o f 3-4 Development Policy
 Loans over the period 2005-2007. Since approval o f the first loan in 2005, the Government has
 achieved continued progress in the key areas defined in the matrix o f program implementation,
 which i s why we now feel qualified to request the negotiation and approval o f the second loan
 for an amount o f US$100 million. As with the first loan, this requested loan would support the
 achievement o f further progress in the economic and social agenda o f the country and will also
 helpimprove the external debtprofile.

 The following i s a briefsummary o f progress achieved inthe following areas:




                                                  42

I.EconomicGrowthandImprovementoftheInvestmentClimate

In terms of the economy, the consolidation of macroeconomic stability and the increased
confidence in the country allowed for a growth rate o f 3.2% in 2005 while inflation reached
8.57%.      This is the best growth rate experienced in five years, despite the impact o f high
petroleum prices5 and the impact o f Hurricane Stan6. For 2006, real economic growth is
expected to be around 4.4% while the rate o f inflation registered in June 2006 was 7.55%, as
against a target o f 6% established by the monetary authorities.

A key objective o f the Government's program has been to maintain a low fiscal deficit. Inthis
respect, the Government has tried to generate additional fiscal revenues to finance a significant
increase inpublic investment, inparticular in support o f social expenditures. The Prudent fiscal
management combined with an adequate monetary policy, led to a real fiscal deficit o f 1.5% of
GDP in2005. As part o f Government's efforts to generate revenues to enable increased public
spending for social investment, the executive presented to the Congress a proposed law aimed at
combating tax evasion and loopholes through control mechanisms to facilitate the detection o f
evasion and elusion practices and at enabling the state to improve tax collections. Following a
process o f wide consultation with different interested sectors, and negotiations with the different
political parties, a consensus was achieved which resulted in the approval by the National
Congress on June 6,2006 o f Decree No. 20-2006 "Legal Provisions for the Strengthening of the
Tax Administration". Although the Executive's original proposal was watered down, the Decree
nonetheless represents a major step forward and is expected to yield additional revenues o f about
0.3% o f GDP in2007.

At the same time, the Government continues to be committed to the objective o f improving tax
revenues and has been supporting the work initiated by the Peace Accords National Council for
the assessment, update and launching of a dialogue that revitalizes the principles and
commitments o f the Fiscal Pact with the aim o f making more feasible the achievement o f the
Peace Accords and the MDGs.           .


The country's external position as measured by the level o f international monetary reserves i s
satisfactory with reserves equivalent to almost 5 months o f imports o f goods and services, while
the deficit in the current account in the balance o f payments in 2005 was 4.1% lower than the
4.4% registered in 2004.         At the same time, external debt was maintained at a low level,
amounting to US$3,591.9 million or 11.3 percent o f GDP, while total public debt (external and
internal) amounted to US$5,750.3 millions or 18 percent o f GDP, the lowest in the Central
America region. This management o f external debt is congruent with the principles o f the Fiscal
Pact which emphasizes the maintenance o f a prudentpolicy with respect to indebtedness.

On the trade front, regional integration continues by means o f simplification and harmonization
o f customs procedures between Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras. Similarly, in the search
for better opportunities for growth and investment, the government has promoted the opening o f


5.  The negative impact on growth of highpetroleum prices was estimated to be 0.5% of GDP and its contribution
    to inflation was about 2% in2005.
6. The negative impact o f Hurricane Stan interms of lost economic flows was estimated at 1.7% of GDP in2005.

the economy through bilateral trade negotiations with Mexico, Taiwan and with the USA. With
respect to the latter, subsequent to the ratification by the National Congress o f the DR-CAFTA
treaty inMarch 2005, the government focused its efforts on the approval o f internal legislation to
permit the coming into effect of the treaty. After several negotiations with the U S counterpart
and extensive debates inthe National Congress, the DR-CAFTA came into effect from the lSt         o f
July 2006.

The Government o f Guatemala is convinced that openness to more and better markets will only
bring benefits inthe sense that the country will continue to improve its investment andbusiness
climate, and to provide for appropriate infrastructure.      The modernization o f the country's
customs system, which includes, inter alia, the implementation o f an electronic customs
manifest, simplification o f the customs declaration forms and reduction o f processing times at
ports and airports, isjust one o f the measures that have been taken inthis direction.

With respect to physical infrastructure, the Congress has already given green lights to two large
highway projects which will enable public-private alliances and there has been rapid progress in
the modernization o fthe country's principal airport.

Inparallel, the Government has promoted secured legal property rights and the strengthening of
the financial system, both fundamental to maximizing the benefits o f the trade opening.
Following the approval of the Cadastral Information Law, via Congressional Decree No. 41-
2005 o f June 15, 2005, an independent directorate for the Cadastral Information Registry was
appointed and i s currently developing an operational plan for the Registry for the next few years.

Inthe financial sector, and incontinuation of the financial reforms that began at the start of this
decade, banking supervision has been oriented towards risk management through the
restructuring o f the Superintendence o f Banks.       Likewise, the payments system has been
modernized to enable bank settlements in real time, in accordance with good international
practices.

11.     Investment andpriority publicspending

As part o f its program o f work, the Government has given priority to interventions in the
education, health and social protection sectors, as reflected inrising budgetary allocations for the
ministries and executing entities responsible for these sectors at the national level.

The Government has taken on board the principle that solid and durable peace should cement
participatory socioeconomic development oriented toward the common good and responsive to
the needs o f all citizens. Such development requires solidarity and social inclusion as one pillar
o f national unity. It is to this end that the Government's Plan 2004-2008, reaffirms the Peace
Accords and defines their achievement as a commitment o f all Guatemalan society. The Vamos
Guatemala! Program, through its Guate Solidaria component, gives specific focus to means o f
reducing poverty and exclusion. In line with the foregoing, social spending as defined in the
Peace Accords, which includes among others expenditure on education, health and housing,
received additional emphasis in 2005, registering an increase of 19.7 percent with respect to
2004. It is important to note that in2005 social spending rose to its highest level since 1995 as a




                                                 44

proportion o f total central government spending, accounting for 44.7 percent or 5.4 percent o f
GDP at end 2005 (versus 5.0 % o f GDP in 2004; the budgeted social expenditure for 2006 is
6.1% o f GDP). Inaddition, it is noteworthy that when expenditures on social pensions, rural and
urban development, and spending on social security by the Guatemalan Institute for Social
Security, is added to the Peace Accords definition o f social spending, total social spending rises
to 9.5 percent o f GDP in 2005, which is higher than the 9.1 percent registered in2004. In2006
the budget allocation for this broader definition o f social spending will rise again to 10.1percent
o f GDP.

It is important to emphasize that, as part o f the efforts to improve expenditure quality, a process
for results-based budgeting has beeninitiated with the support o f the World Bank Institute. The
purpose o f this effort is to include in the budget the results that have to be achieved with the
allocation o f resources, through the incorporation o f objectives, targets and expenditure
indicators. A results-based budget will be reflected in 2007 budget for the main ministries. In
addition, a general framework has been defined for monitoring and evaluation o f public
expenditure, which will be coordinated by both, the Ministry o f Finance and the Secretary o f
Economic Planning.

111.    Modernizationandtransparencyof publicsector

The Government continued with the implementation o f measures aimed at improving the
efficiency and transparency in the use o f public resources, focusing principally on the issue o f
accountability. As had been planned, the objective o f expanding the coverage o f the Integrated
Financial Administration and Control System (SIAF-SAG) to 7 decentralized entities has been
achieved, bringing to 29 the number o f entities with budget execution authority which can be
monitored in real time.      Likewise, the affiliation o f local governments to the system has
continued, with 64 additional municipalities having been integratedinto the system.

With respect to public procurement, the Government has made significant advances inthe use o f
the GUATECOMPRAS information system, a system which contributes to increasing the
transparency o f public purchases and contracts and allows a greater number o f bidders thereby
increasing competition. Starting this year, a Government decree requires that all purchases by
central and local government entities, above a specified threshold, are required to use the
GUATECOMPRAS system. In addition, and with the purpose o f strengthening procurement
processes, a program for strengthening the National Directorate o f Norms for Public
Procurement (Direccion de Normativas y Contrataciones del Estado) has been initiated. For this
purpose, the World Bank's support has been requested for the preparation o f a strategic plan for
the regulatory body, for the standardization o f procedural manuals and bidding documents as
well as for training o f government officials involved inprocurement.

Conclusion

As the foregoing shows, the Government o f Guatemala remains highly committed to the
promotion and implementation o f actions necessary to launch higher, sustained and broad-based
economic growth, increased productive investment and employment, as well as reduced levels o f
poverty through priority investments inthe health, education and social protection sectors.

It is inthis context that the support o f the World Bank through the Second Development Policy
Loan takes on special relevance and forms part o f the strategy for budget financing of the
country.

With thanks for the continuing support received from the World Bank, Itake this opportunity to
express to you my esteem andregards.

Sincerely,

                            Annex 4. Debt Sustainabilityin Guatemala
Guatemala has one o f the lowest debt levels as a share o f GDP in Latin America and among
developing countries worldwide, reflecting a tradition o f very disciplined macroeconomic
management. Given the relatively low level o f tax revenue to GDP it is nevertheless relevant to
analyze the sustainability o f public debt. To explore this issue a medium term sustainability
analysis was prepared under the key macroeconomic assumptions presented in table A4.1 and a
f i l l delivery o fthe $610million IBRDCAS envelope.




                                                                          -0.6     -0.4    -0.3     -0.3



Evenunder relatively conservativemacroeconomicassumptionspublicexternaldebtwould
stabilize to 11.4 percent of GDP by 2009 in the baseline scenario (see table A4.2 below.
Similarly, debt service on external public debt would decline to 7.9% o f exports by 2009 .                  ?
Following the Government's current debt policy, the baseline scenario assumes no new
sovereign bond financing o f the fiscal deficit. The use o f less costly DPL lending during the
2006-2008 period would prevent sharp increases in interest payments. These conclusions are
consistent with the analysis presented in the Public Expenditure Review (see Public Domestic
Debt section below) as well as with the IMF's debt sustainability analysis in its most recent
Article N report (see Box A4.1 for details). The debt sustainability analysis (DSA) presented
here contains an improved outlook compared to what was presented in the DPLI program
document. The DPLI D S A assumed that the government would increase external borrowing
substantially in 2005 to finance reconstruction expenditure in light o f Hurricane Stan. Inactual
fact, the government borrowed much less than expected and this, combined with a 4 percent
appreciation o f the exchange rate, reduces the external debt-to-GDP ratios.

This analysis also indicatesthat all externalvulnerability indicatorswould remain sound.
Although the share o f preferred creditor debt to total debt increases over the period
(including that o f IBRD) this should not be a cause o f concern because o f Guatemala's
relative ease o f servicing total debt. The current account deficit would remain stable at around
3.9 percent o f GDP by 2009 as a result o f steady growth in remittances and stronger
nontraditional exports. The scenario also contemplates that debt-creating inflows would be
reduced due to new DR-CAFTA-related foreign direct investment and as a result, Guatemala's
private external debt would stabilize at around 5.2 percent o f GDP by 2009, slightly lower than
2004 levels. International reserves would also remain strong at 4.3 months o f imports o f goods
and nonfactor services throughout the period.

PublicDomesticDebt
An analysis o f total public debt undertakeninthe GuatemalaPER (June, 2005) complements the
results presented above by including public domestic as well as external debt. It finds that
Guatemala's total public debt o f almost 20.6 percent o f GDP in 2004 i s sustainable even at
relatively low GDP growth rates between 2.0 and 2.5 and no primary fiscal surplus. The analysis
also shows that if annual GDP growth were to increase significantly (e.g., to 4 percent), there
could be some scope for a temporary, but not permanent, expansion o f fiscal deficits that will
result in a higher public debt level. Such a debt expansion must be approached with caution,
however, taking into account the various risks inherent in an economy that is vulnerable to
external and internal shocks. Indeed, it would be prudent to postpone major expansions o f public
debt until the country has established a track record o f higher growth, and seek to maintain a
cushion o f debt-absorptioncapacity inthe face o f possible adverse shocks.

                      Box A4.1. The IMF andDebt Sustainabilityin Guatemala

Inits latest Article IV consultation report of April 29, 2005, the IMF finds that Guatemala's external and
public debt outlook i s sustainable, even under alternative negative shock scenarios for the underlying
macroeconomic variables. The baseline scenario estimates that total public debt would decline to 15
percent o f GDP by 2010, from 18 percent in 2004. Similarly, public external debt will decline from 14 to
12 percent o f GDP during the same period. The `weaker policy' scenario assumes that tax revenues are not
raised, inflation remains at current levels and financial reform i s postponed. The results show that public
debt would remain at 18 percent by 2010, instead o f declining. Nevertheless, the ratio o f public debt to tax
revenue would still be the lowest in Central America and Guatemala's protection against vulnerabilities
would remain relatively strong. Temporary negative shocks to key variables (interest rate, exchange rate
and GDP growth) would lead to some increase in the level o f public and external debt, nevertheless the
ratios return to a declining path once the shocks disappear. Under such negative circumstances, the IMF
warns that the investment climate could be affected, raising the cost of borrowing for Guatemala and
Mherlowering GDP growth.
