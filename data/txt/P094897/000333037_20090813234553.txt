F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (from Program Document)
 The proposed Programmatic Development Loan is the last of a programmatic series of
three DPLs intended to support the three main pillars of the government's development
plan: promoting equitable growth and strengthening the investment climate, enhancing
capacity for increased public spending in priority sectors, and improving public
expenditure transparency and management. Other key areas for growth identified in
education, health and nutrition, and rural economic infrastructure are supported within
the CAS program through investment operations, which build on the ongoing portfolio of
interventions in these areas.

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design Context. At the time of the
DPL I, the 1996 Peace Accords agenda of reforms continued to be a preoccupation of the
country. The agenda specifically was directed to stimulate and sustain economic and
social policy, with a focus on improved delivery of basic services and good governance.1
Progress under the Peace Accords program during the Arzu administration (1996-99) had
promoted competition, removal of commodity subsidies, privatization (telecoms and
electricity) and increases in social spending; however, the pace of reforms slowed
considerably during the Portillo Administration (2000-04). Even so, a social consensus
held that advancing the Peace Accords agenda was necessary to enhance the legitimacy
of public institutions in the eyes of civil society and the international community.

The Berger Administration (2004-08) confronted a difficult economic situation. Income
per capita had declined since 2000 and in 2003 macroeconomic stability had become an
issue. Complicating the matter, just as Guatemala began to emerge from its financial
crisis the Supreme Court struck down revenue measures intended to buttress the
country's fiscal position. The international community, including the World Bank,
became increasingly concerned about the risk of fiscal imbalance and particularly, the
implications for sorely-needed increases in social spending.

The Berger administration quickly articulated a strong commitment to comply with the
Peace Accords and confront Guatemala's macroeconomic and growth challenges. To
address fiscal and other concerns, the authorities pushed through: (a) a new tax package
which reinstated, in revised form, the gross corporate income tax the Supreme Court had
previously repealed, (b) reduced military allocations, (c) protected social expenditures,
and (d) devised a 106-point strategic plan to address revenue challenges. The
Administration also sharpened its focus on governance, particularly related to
transparency of public expenditure and the identification and punishment of corrupt
practices. The Government also took steps to facilitate trade (CAFTA, EU, Taiwan, and
Colombia) and foster competitiveness as well as generate rapid economic growth, with a
view to providing employment and income opportunities for the one of the fastest
growing populations in Latin America.

Project Development Objectives. The Project Development Objectives for all three
Development Policy Loans aimed at fostering broad-based growth by: (i) promoting
growth and improving the investment climate, (ii) enhancing capacity for public spending
in priority sectors, and (iii) achieving greater transparency in public sector management.

The CAS envisaged a program aimed at reducing poverty and inequality, through a
combination of budget support and selective investment lending in key areas where,
building on prior successful implementation of operations in Guatemala, the Bank had
global expertise. These included projects for: (i) education quality and secondary

        The Peace Accords themselves were not legally binding and formal approval of other laws and
decrees within the institutional framework were required to implement the accords. A 1999 referendum to
modify the Constitution on certain aspects of the Accords approved some but not all of the proposals.

land administration (cadastre and titling); (v) infrastructure development through a
public-private partnership (PPP) and guarantee approach; and (vi) governance and public
sector management improvements. To be responsive to the government's needs, and
taking into account the election cycle, budget support lending would be clustered in
FY06-07.

In addition to lending, the CAS encompassed other analytical work in support of the
government's development plan, "Vamos Guatemala", including a Country
Environmental Analysis (CEA), Poverty and Social Impact Analyses (PSIAs) in FYs
2005 and 2006 and an update of the Poverty Assessment (FY07). The PSIAs were
geared to support key policy reforms included in the DPL series to ensure that social
impacts were identified and mitigating actions taken. The first PSIA was conducted in
the first half of 2005 and provided a detailed analysis of the potential income and
welfare impacts of DR-CAFTA implementation on producers and consumers eventually
becoming a chapter of the regional DR-CAFTA report that was widely disseminated and
discussed in Guatemala. A second PSIA analyzed the impacts of the trade agreement in
greater depth on Guatemala's indigenous population (both urban and rural). In addition,
a PSIA on the distributive impact of Guatemala's tax regime--including fiscal reforms
supported by the first DPL--was completed in FY05 and disseminated to leaders from
civil society and think-tanks. The report was sent to Government for review and its
findings supported by ongoing Bank operations and/or grant support. Finally, the Poverty
Assessment Update, based on the Government's new 2006 living standards survey
analyzed trends in poverty and inequality, and this information was also used to inform
subsequent Bank operational design.

Design and Principles: The DPL programmatic design represented a new lending
approach and took into account lessons learned from past operations in Guatemala and
the latest thinking on Development Policy Lending. The underlying principles of the
initial DPL operation were:

(i) Upfront action instead of ex-post conditionality: The loan was triggered by the new
government's demonstrated commitment to continue the Peace Accords agenda, albeit in
a difficult socio-political context, and by specific and significant policy actions.

(ii) Support of a reform program instead of specific conditionality. The DPL and the
programmatic approach underpinned a broad government reform program. Lack of
reform progress in a specific area could be compensated for with actions in others if the
overall reform program remained on track.

(iii) Aligning program loans with the budgetary cycle. The proposed programmatic
approach was designed to become a predictable low-cost source of financing for the
government.




                                           2
The DPLs were scheduled for Board presentation in June or July of three consecutive
calendar years to enable the Guatemalan Government to fully incorporate them into the
budget and allow for legislative discussion before being presented to the Congress during
the third quarter.

Development Policy Loans

Development Policy Loan I--P094365

The first DPL (July 7, 2005) was integral to the achievement of CAS objectives. It drew
largely on the Government's own priorities as delineated in "Vamos Guatemala," its
detailed sector plans, and the Bank's analyses of key issues and desirable policy
directions through the GUAPA, CEM, ICA, PER, CFAA, and CPAR. DPL I focused on
policy and institutional aspects related to broad-based growth that are most amenable to
support via a program of single-tranche loans. These included actions aimed at improving
the business and investment climate, creating fiscal space for greater social investment,
and achieving key milestones in improving the fiduciary environment.

Development Policy Loan II--P094897

DPL II (August 29, 2006) aimed at maintaining Bank support for the Government's
performance. The underlying factors for proceeding with DPL II included: (i) the
government's persistent efforts, in the face of a difficult political context to strengthen tax
administration, raise public revenues and lay the groundwork for future increases in
taxes through developing political and social consensus on public investment goals and
priorities; (ii) the increases in pro-poor social spending as a share of GDP within a
framework of fiscal prudence and despite the lack of progress in raising the tax ratio,, by
implementing difficult cuts in military and administrative spending and reallocating
existing resources; and (iii) the strong progress in all areas of the DPL -other than tax
collection-, with performance exceeding expectations in key areas such as improved
governance and transparency.

Context for Development Policy Loan III--P101311

DPL III (August 2, 2007) was triggered by the steady progress Guatemala made in
promoting more equitable, broad-based growth in areas following the medium-term
framework laid out in DPL I and II. The design of DPL III focused on full
implementation of many of the policy and legislative reforms undertaken under the
previous DPLs as well as strengthening the financial sector related to the PDOs. The
emphasis on implementation and sustainability, rather than legislative actions, also
reflected recognition that the complexity of obtaining congressional approval for new
legislation was more complicated because of the election year. Thus, DPL III focused on
actions that contributed to the PDOs under the control of the Executive.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The proposed Programmatic Development Loan was a series of three DPLs intended to
support the three main pillars of the government's own development plan: promoting
equitable growth and strengthening the investment climate, enhancing capacity for
increased public spending in priority sectors, and improving public expenditure
transparency and public sector management

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved):

The original policy areas supported by all three DPLs were:

I. Promoting Growth and strengthening Investment Climate

Specific measures aimed at Promoting growth included: (a) a stable macroeconomic
framework, (b) trade expansion through treaties and Central American integration, (c)
improvements in the investment climate and business efficiency through de-regulation
and creation a strong sustaining institutions, (d) strengthening infrastructure through
private sector participation, (e) enhancement of property rights through registration and
titling, and (f) financial sector modernization and deepening.

II. Enhancing the capacity for public spending in priority sectors

Measures in support of capacity enhancement for public spending in priority sectors
included: (a) an acceleration in the pace of modernization customs and taxes to facilitate
compliance and enforce the law; and (b) increases in the budgetary allocations to social
sectors in consonance with the 1996 Peace Accords.

III. Transparency and Public Sector Management

To improve transparency and efficiency of public resource usethe DPL series supported
the following measures: (a) the expansion of the Integrated Financial Management
System (SIAF) nationwide including the launching of a fiscal transparency portal to
enhance public access to budget data, and (b) the development and expansion of a
transparent web-based procurement system (Guatecompras).

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

Program performance was satisfactory. The Bank Board approved each of the DPL
operations on time (2005, 2006, and 2007). There were, however, delays in disbursing the
available resources as Congressional approval of the operations by Congress took more
time than expected and caused delays in effectiveness and disbursements. These delays
seem not to have affected the execution of the budget.

Overall, the program did not undergo substantial changes during implementation. The
policy areas remained the same; so did the Development Objectives, where changes were
introduced only to make them more precise. Trigger design was well aligned to track
progress toward the development objectives, although in some cases the initial trigger
had to be adjusted with different actions under the same development objective. In a few
cases, new actions were introduced to reflect unexpected developments, such as
addressing the failure of two large banks. Changes to the actions did not weaken the
program.

The government met all prior actions, in some cases exceeding expectations, as in SIAF
expansion and Guatecompras. Some expected results were difficult to meet, such as
increased tax collection particularly in a context of falling import tariffs rates, due to the
implementation of DR-CAFTA. The following is a summary matrix and narrative of the
program's performance for each of the three program pillars.

The following section reviews the implementation of the program for each one the policy
areas.

   I. Promoting Growth and Strengthening Investment Climate

Under the first pillar, the DPL series supported efforts in a number of complementary
areas thought to be of high relevance to accelerate economic growth. These included,
maintenance of an appropriate macroeconomic framework, promotion of international
trade through the ratification of the US-Central America-Dominican Republic Free Trade
Agreement (CAFTA-DR), improvements in the investment climate and business
efficiency, supporting legislation aimed at removing infrastructure bottlenecks, and
strengthening the financial sector.

I.1 Macroeconomic environment

Building on the country's record of macroeconomic management, the DPL series
supported Government's efforts to maintain a stable macroeconomic environment, further
strengthening Guatemala's reputation as a country with prudent fiscal and macro policies.
The DPL framework did not set specific targets to evaluate macroeconomic performance,
but the core macroeconomic indicators either remained stable at satisfactory levels or
improved. Inflation, which in 2007 escalated as a result of the food price crisis and the
dramatic increase in oil prices, was the exception but in line with developments in other
countries.




                                           9
I.2 Promoting Trade Expansion

In 2004, Guatemala's only free trade agreements were with Mexico and Chile. The DPL
series supported the government's efforts to obtain greater access to the markets of its
two main trading partners, the United States and Central America. In March 2005, the
Guatemalan Congress ratified CAFTA-DR (DPL-I). However, the Office of the United
States Trade Representative requested additional negotiations, making it necessary to
change the initial laws. In June 2006, Congress approved these changes. The Treaty
became effective on July, 1 2006 and has been effective since then (DPL-II). During the
implementation of the DPL series the Bank prepared and disseminated analytical work
examining the likely impact of the treaty on the economy and proposing strategies to
protect the poor by linking the traditional sectors to the globalization process. Some of
these initiatives are currently under implementation.

In addition, the DPL series supported a process of greater regional integration, including
the harmonization of 95 percent of customs duties and the use of identical customs forms
in Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. A scheme to eliminate customs inspections at
the national borders for goods cleared through specified Central American border entry
points is in operation since DPL-II. Originally, DPL-I foresaw further prior actions on
regional trade for DPL-III, but DPL-II dropped them in favor of other actions. While
these measures were not included in the DPL series, this did not reflect a slowdown in the
implementation of the regional integration agenda.

I.3 Promoting Investment Climate and Business Efficiency

A good investment climate and business efficiency appeared as key elements underlying
a growth strategy based on trade liberalization and expansion. To support the
government's efforts aimed at improving the investment climate and increasing business
efficiency, the DPLs supported the following actions: (a) facilitating business registration
and moving goods through customs, (b) fostering Foreign Direct Investment (FDI); and
(c) advancing registration and titling of real estate. Bank self-standing operations were
already assisting in these areas, specifically, the Competiveness Enhancement Project, the
Tax Project (SAT), and Land Administration DPL.

The focus on business registration was part of a broader effort to improve the business
environment, along the framework provided by Doing Business (DB) Indicators. The
approach was grounded on consultations with the private sector to identify the areas of
intervention. These efforts led to the creation of a "one-stop-shop" that according to
DB2008 reduced the number of days needed to register business by 42 percent, i.e., to 26
days. According to Doing Business (2009), the number of days to register a business
remains at 26 (DPL-III).

As part of the same effort, the DPL focused on improving the performance of customs
(trade facilitation) with significant achievements including: (i) the introduction by the
Superintendencia de Administracion Tributaria (SAT) of electronic customs manifests in
all parts of the country and airports; (ii) the reduction in the discretion in customs



                                            10
inspections (red channel) through the introduction of risk assessment and selectivity
based on the SAT database and related information (in 2004, 80 percent of goods went
through the red channel); (iii) the improvement in the performance of the main airport
(Aurora) through the establishment of a 24/7 air express office and of the main port
(Quetzal) with the creation of one-stop offices for documentation analysis; and (iv) the
increase in the transparency of the import process through the introduction of a system
that allows importers to track on-line the status of their imports (DPL-II).

As for the efforts to facilitate and encourage the inflow of Foreign Direct Investment
(FDI), the authorities established in 2005 a fully operational investment promotion office,
Invest in Guatemala (IIG). IIG complemented the Office of the Presidential
Commissioner for the Promotion of National Competitiveness (PRONACOM), as part of
the Central America Network of government competitiveness agencies (DPL-I). Both of
these agencies had as an objective helping the economy compete in a DR-CAFTA world.
The Competiveness Enhancement Project supported these efforts. MIGA provided
technical assistance for the creation of Invest in Guatemala (DPL-II).

Finally, Guatemala traditionally had lacked modern real estate registration and titling
institutions. The ensuing legal uncertainty had arguably been one of the contributors to
internal conflict. Most of the agricultural land was untitled, giving rise to multiple claims
and putting landholders in a status of high insecurity, the DPL supported on-going efforts
to remedy this situation. A prior action for DPL-II supported the approval of the Cadastre
Law in 2005. This law set the legal basis for a modern registration system through the
creation of Registro de Information Catastral (RIC) (DPL-II). DPL-III did set targets to
track implementation.

I.4 Strengthening Infrastructure through Private Sector Participation

Given the limited availability of public resources, and the prudent approach to
macroeconomic policy, the room for public investment to undertake large infrastructure
works had been traditionally limited in Guatemala; hence, efforts to involve the private
sector through Public Private Partnerships (PPP) were highly relevant to eliminate
infrastructure bottlenecks that could limit the growth potential. In 2004, Guatemala
lacked an appropriate legal framework for PPP operations. The authorities sought to
remedy this situation through the approval of a law on Public-Private Alliances for
undertaking infrastructure projects. This law was presented to Congress as a prior action
for DPL-II. In addition, and given the likely difficulty in obtaining approval for a blanket
PPP law, the authorities obtained approval for two specific priority projects to modernize
critical routes, namely, laws authorizing PPP arrangements for the construction of the
Anillo Metropolitano and Franja Transversal del Norte.

DPL-III noted efforts to enhance security arrangements at the Aurora International
Airport. As a result, Guatemala successfully passed an audit and received final
certification for Category 1 classification under the International Aviation Safety
Assessment. This enabled direct flights (both cargo and passenger) to U.S. destinations
by Guatemalan carriers, thereby enhancing competitiveness by facilitating tourism and



                                             11
the transport of Guatemalan exports. Overall progress in upgrading safety standards for
the La Aurora Airport was impressive and exceeded expectations.

I.5 Strengthening the Financial Sector

By the time the Berger administration came to power, a process was underway to address
the aftermath of the 2001 financial crisis, with the remaining challenges centered on: (a)
strengthening the regulation of the banking sector by removing risks from unregistered
offshore operations and related lending; (b) improving the reputation of the country by
extending full cooperation to the Financial Action Task Force; and (c) facilitating access
from small and medium enterprises.

DPL-I acknowledged government efforts that took Guatemala off from the list of Non-
cooperative Countries of the Financial Action Task Force (July 2004) (Guatemala has
remained off the list since then). The Superintendency of Banks (SIB) has staffed and
trained specialized units in charge of tracking money-laundering.

As argued in DPL-I, the financial sector agenda focused on further strengthening of the
financial system through improved supervision of financial groups, as evidenced by: (i)
restructuring the organization of the Superintendency of Banks (SIB) to enhance
implementation of risk-based supervision; and (ii) mapping the financial conglomerates
in line with 2000 FSAP recommendations. DPL-II found that the authorities had made
satisfactory progress in reorganizing the SIB, adopting rules for risk-based supervision,
and mapping the interconnections among financial groups. In turn, DPL-II foresaw
commencing implementation of the new financial architecture by DPL-III.

However, during 2006-07, difficulties in two commercial banks, which accounted for
around 10 percent of the assets of the banking system, tested the strength of the financial
sector. The authorities found that Bancafe, the fourth largest bank, was non-compliant
with legally established prudential norms due to difficulties created by offshore
operations. Similarly, Banco del Comercio faced problems arising from an undisclosed
affiliate. The authorities addressed the crisis with the support of the IMF, the Bank, the
IFC, and the IDB. The resolution of Bancafe initiated in October 2006, and that of Banco
de Comercio, initiated in January 2007 using the mechanisms provided by the 2002
Banking and Financial Groups Law. The deposit insurance, FOPA, and the Banking
Capitalization Fund, FFCB, funded the resolution of these two banks. FOPA
subsequently was successfully recapitalized through additional fiscal funds, an increase
in the premium charged to banks as well as additional funding from the banks. FFCB has
yet to be recapitalized.

In addition to the DPL dialogue, the Bank also provided support through the Financial
Sector Adjustment Loan (FSAL), which had been designed within the framework
provided by the 2000 FSAP. DPL-III acknowledged the efforts made by the authorities to
limit the impact of the two-problem banks. IEG rated as highly satisfactory Bank
performance under the FSAL.




                                            12
Despite the crisis, by the end of the DPL, the basis had been established for risk-based
supervision, which was practically non-existent in 2003, and efforts to improve
supervision of financial conglomerates are about to commence. A Bank technical
assistance operation (FTAL) has continued to aid the improvement of the legal and
regulatory framework for finance and the implementation process. Also, a strengthened
payment system included a fully operational electronic clearing system for banks and
new settlements in real time (January 2006). Since November 2006, the new payment
system of the Central Bank covers clearance and settlement activities and since
December 2006 foreign exchange transactions.

However, perhaps because of the attention required to contain the impact of the two
failed banks, approval of additional legislation originally presented by the Berger
administration (the Insurance Law and the Movable Collateral Law to increase access to
finance by small and medium enterprises) was still pending by the end of the DPL series.
Congress approved the Movable Collateral Law in 2008.

    II. Enhancing the capacity for public spending in priority sectors

Under Pillar two, the DPL series supported government priorities very much in line with
the Peace Accords of 1996: (a) increasing the mobilization of public revenues through
taxation and (b) allocating greater budgetary resources to social expenditure. The Peace
Accords had set precise targets in both regards: 12 percent of GDP for internal revenue
mobilization2 and 6 percent for allocation to social expenditure. Meeting both targets had
proven elusive in the past. The DPL series set an interim target of 11 percent of GDP for
revenue.

II.1 Taxation and Customs

The DPL agenda covered: (a) tax policy, (b) expansion of the tax net by bringing in new
taxpayers, (c) facilitating compliance, and (d) more selective and effective enforcement.
The DPL series emphasis on taxation supplemented and supported the on-going work to
reform the SAT, which had slowed during the previous administration.

On tax policy, DPL-I focused on recuperating revenues lost as a result of Constitutional
Court rulings that pushed back policy reforms introduced by the previous administration.
The proposed solution included temporary policy measures that had to be reviewed
periodically, but has since become permanent. The DPL series did not consider a
comprehensive tax policy reform, as this was not on the agenda of government and
instead focused on improving tax administration.

In this regard, DPL-I supported the passage of the Law against Tax Evasion and
Avoidance (2006). This law provided the "Secretaria de Administracion Tributaria"


2
        The ratios given here use a GDP with the original base year used in the Peace Accords (1958). The
equivalent target, with a 2001 base is 13.2 percent.



                                                   13
(SAT) with better tools to enforce legislation and implement a 106-point tax strategic
action plan to improve tax and customs administration. In addition to the new law, the
reform of the SAT had the support of the World Bank and Inter-American Development
Bank. The World Bank Tax Administration TAL (FY98) had supported the merger of
taxes and customs and provided the agency an independent revenue source equivalent to
2 percent of revenue mobilized. The Tax TAL was completed successfully 3 despite
implementation difficulties during the Portillo administration, including serious
governance issues at SAT that in turn led to arrests and prosecutions of some high level
administrative staff.

These efforts produced positive results as acknowledged by DPL-III. By 2007, the
unified tax registry had grown by 10 percent. Electronic filing had expanded to cover
large and special taxpayers. Extended cross-checking of information and other innovative
techniques to encourage compliance and facilitating compliance were helping reduce
Value Added Tax (VAT) evasion, which was down to 31.6 in 2006, from 35.2 percent in
2001. A May 2007 assessment by the Bank and the IMF found that the government's
objectives on tax administration and customs had been met.

II.2 Improving budget allocations

The DPL series set targets under each operation to increase incrementally the allocation
of budgetary resources to the social sectors, following the definition of the Peace Accords.
The increased allocation proceeded faster than the original schedule. From 5 percent in
2004, the allocation increased to 5.3 percent in 2005, 5.4 percent in 2006 and 5.8 percent
in 2008.

III. Transparency and Public Sector Management

The Integrated Financial Management (SIAF) had been under design and implementation
since 1996, with the support of a Bank Project series that is still under implementation.
After a rapid start the implementation, the process had slowed during the Portillo
administration; but, the design was well advanced. The DPL complimented the decision
of the country to extend its implementation nationwide. The DPL targets tracked the
process of expansion of the SIAF within the central government and the municipalities.
The expansion process proceeded rapidly and faster than initially expected. By the end of
the DPL series most of the public sector was using SIAF. The DPL series did not set
targets regarding other aspects of the SIAF expansion process, consistent with the stated
objective of improving the efficiency of public resource use.

The expansion of the SIAF system contributed to greater transparency by making detailed
budgetary information available to the public, aided by new technologies that permit on-


3
         The ICR graded outcomes and Bank performance under the project as marginally satisfactory. IEG
concurred. The main drawback identified by the review was the implementation delay. However, the
project's performance and results during this CAS were satisfactory.



                                                  14
line availability through the web. Today the general public has access to the same
information in SIAF as government officials.

The progress on procurement followed a similar path with the expansion of
Guatecompras, a web-based tool that makes information available to the public on
government procurements. Guatecompras, is now working towards supporting e-
procurement. The use of Guatecompras has become mandatory and budgetary processes
are contingent on its use. Strengthening the procurement regulatory body (DNCAE) by
developing tools for regulatory management (i.e., procedural manuals, standard bidding
documents, etc), was not achieved because of expected enhancements to the law that
would make the tools obsolete. The substitution of public expenditure transparency and
management actions (concerning expansion of SIAF's integration with Guatecompras)
compensated for, but did not replace, the need for reform of procurement practices.

The expansion of SIAF and Guatecompras was a difficult process especially at the level
of municipalities because many of the mayors objected to the utilization of SIAF, arguing
that the central government did not have the authority to mandate its use by local
governments. Nonetheless, a key element in its adoption at the municipal level was the
support of civil society organizations to this valuable tool.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

There were a number of factors affecting program implementation. First, the DPL
program was well aligned with the government's own program, "Vamos Guatemala."
This program sought to put the country back on the development path originally initiated
by the Peace Accords of the early 1990s, which had been neglected by the administration
prior to the DPL series.

Second, although the government was highly committed to the reform program it did not
always succeed in obtaining the support of Congress for its key initiatives, which delayed
the effectiveness of the DPL operations.

Third, the DPLs were anchored in ongoing projects with the support of the World Bank
and other institutions. The World Bank support included SIAF, SAT, Financial Services,
cadastre, and land registration, among others.

Fourth, in some cases, civil society, by supporting SIAF, or the private sector, by
supporting the competitiveness agenda, proved valuable allies in the reform process.
Nonetheless, there remains substantial opposition in the country to increased revenue
mobilization.

Fifth, several events, such as Hurricane STAN, the banking crisis, the struggle to increase
the revenue yield, the difficult dialogue with Congress--all affected implementation of a
policy reform program that was strategically ambitious.




                                            15
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

The Bank provided support for government and civil society activities to help build
capacity to evaluate information, increase transparency, and build public sector
accountability. The government and the Bank took advantage of several important data
sources to assess progress and development impact of the DPL, including:
            Central and nonfinancial public sector budget monitoring from the
               Ministry of Finance
            National Institute for Statistics reports, including a living standards
               survey planned for 2007, and annual tracking surveys
            Investment climate surveys
            Central Bank of Guatemala reports and analysis
            Reviews and analyses of laws and implementing regulations from the
               Bank and other stakeholders
            Data from key Government agencies such as SAT, Pronacom and RIC
               Financial audits and follow up of CPAR and CFAA recommendations
               Bank and IMF supervision missions and reports
               CEPAL and SIECA surveys.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):

Based on the successful results of the initial DPL series, the Bank launched a new DPL
series in 2008. The new series is aimed at supporting government actions to develop a
broad consensus on critical reform areas, especially in the area of fiscal and institutional
reform. In September 2008, the Bank Board approved the first Programmatic Fiscal and
Institutional DPL for an amount of US$200 million, which has been disbursed. A second
DPL, under preparation, will help Guatemala weather the storm of the current global
crisis and complement the IMF's precautionary SBA approved in April 2009.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The objectives of the DPL series remain relevant to meet the development challenges of
the country. In fact, the Colom Administration is giving continuity to most of the themes,
albeit with different emphasis. Indeed, the program of the current government
emphasizes strengthening the capacity of the state to create conditions propitious for
economic activity and delivering basic services to all of the population. In this regard,
fiscal issues--revenue mobilization, quality of public expenditure and transparency
remain highly relevant. Fiscal reform continues to be at the front of the agenda, but
remains a contentious area for reform. Social spending is a key priority with emphasis
now on introducing a conditional transfer program to attend the neediest. The global
crisis is putting stress on the economy, and while the country is relatively well prepared,
completing the reform agenda (prudent supervision, access, etc). acquires certain urgency


                                            16
and prudence. The Bank maintains a dialogue and assists the authorities on most of these
issues through the implementation of the 2008 Country Partnership Strategy.
Nonetheless, the current economic environment and the contentious domestic politics
may make deeper fiscal reform difficult.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

   a. Achievement of the Program's Broader Development Objectives

The achievement of the outcomes under the program has been satisfactory. Positive and
satisfactory improvements took place in most of the areas of engagement. These
achievements, particularly when seen against the backdrop of a slowdown in the reform
drive during the previous administration show that Guatemala has made significant
progress, but, nonetheless still ranks low in a wide range of global indicators (business
environment, human development, governance, etc).. An accomplishment of the DPL
series was to help rekindle the reform process.

Economic growth accelerated between 2004-08 and the average yearly rate of economic
growth was 4.75 percent, compared with near stagnation during the previous four years.
Certainly, higher prices for coffee (Guatemala's main export), expanding exports
associated to a positive global environment, growing remittances, and higher investment
fueled economic growth. Still the program contributed to the short-term performance by
helping to improve macroeconomic stability and address promptly the banking
difficulties that emerged at the end of 2006. Guatemala's macro situation, while
deteriorating, is proving relatively resilient during the current crisis.

The competitiveness agenda launched by the Berger administration advanced as CAFTA-
DR and other international agreements helped expand market opportunities and foreign
and domestic investment responded. Facilitation of tax payments and moving goods
through customs has been achieved. The authorities managed to address promptly and
effectively the failure of two large banks, while at the same time continuing the agenda to
improve on the regulatory design. Significant gains have been made in improving the
transparency of public expenditure and the ability of the authorities to control and report
on budget execution. The resources allocated to social expenditures increased along the
lines of the Peace Accords and have contributed to expanding health and education
services.

There were some laggard areas, however. Neither the Public-Private Partnership (PPP)
legal framework has been approved nor the special laws for large road projects
implemented. This is unfortunate as infrastructure (roads and electricity) remain an
important constraint to competitiveness. Registration and titling of rural land has not
moved as fast as expected. Although the target tax revenue to GDP ratio was mostly met
up to 2007, mobilizing revenues in Guatemala remains a challenge as the economy is
now slowing down and fiscal reform continues to be controversial.

Overall, the gains made during the DPL series provided a solid basis from which to
advance on development outcomes. The DPL contribution to reaching the outcomes lies


                                            17
in having served as a mechanism of prioritization and coordination for government and is
consistent with the CAS program. Also, the commitments under the DPL helped the
authorities address internal coordination and disagreements.

   b. Achievement of Program Development Indicators

   I. Promoting Growth and Strengthening Investment Climate

Objective I.1 Macroeconomic stability

Medium-term outcome indicator:

       Maintain macroeconomic stability

The macroeconomic policy framework is better in 2009 than it was in 2004, and
Guatemala is relatively better situated to face the current global crisis than its neighbors.
Indeed, the combination of the government's macroeconomic track record, the low public
and external debt burdens (around 20 percent of GDP), the solid commercial debt
repayment history, as well as the robust economic growth from 2004 to 2008, have
contributed to continued improvements in the rating of its international debt. Fitch rated
Guatemala BB+ with a stable outlook in 2008, up from BB- in 2005. Fitch has
maintained this rating. Standard & Poors upgraded its country risk assessment of
Guatemala to BB- with a stable outlook, placing Guatemala on a par with well-
performing middle-income countries. In view of one rating agency, Fitch, these strengths
have provided a sufficient buffer to deal with adverse shocks and should continue to do
so over its rating horizon. Major concerns in 2007-2008 were inflation and the high
current account deficit, due to external factors such as high oil prices, which are falling in
the current economic downturn.

Objective I.2 Promotion of trade expansion

Medium-term outcome indicator:

       Increase in non-traditional exports in US dollar terms by at least 9 percent
       (Banguat data) (Baseline: US$1.9 billion in 2004).

The DPL sought to measure the impact of trade expansion efforts (CAFTA-DR et al).
through increases in non-traditional exports. This indicator was met. The information
available shows that non-traditional exports have expanded 44 percent since 2004, or 9.6
percent per year as did traditional overall exports, driven partly by higher commodity
prices. With hindsight, however, the short- to medium-term expansion of non-traditional
exports is not the only way (and perhaps not the best) to measure the likely impact of the
trade agreements. Domestic observers are of the opinion that the real relevance of
CAFTA-DR is bringing stability to the existing transitory trade arrangements with the US,
the main trade partner of the country. So while CAFTA-DR in effective substituted for
previous temporary and ad-hoc trade preference systems, rather than substantially reduce
trade barriers, the long-term certainty it provides may be inducing investment. The 2008


                                             18
Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) argues, for instance, that CAFTA-DR is already
contributing to a noted increase in foreign investment, with further impacts on trade
anticipated overtime.

The efforts to create a more integrated Central American Market are continuing under the
Colom administration, with Guatemala placing greater emphasis on working with El
Salvador and Honduras. Notably, the plans for integration extend beyond trade in goods
to the development of complementary infrastructure, such as energy and roads. Thus, the
emphasis on greater integration with global and regional markets is deepening.

Objective I.3 Promoting investment and business efficiency

(The four medium-term outcome indicators are discussed in two groups below)

Medium-term outcome indicators:

         Reduce Customs clearance times for imports and exports by at least 15 percent
         (SAT indicators) (Baseline: air cargo: 12 hrs; seaports: 4 days in 2004).

         Reduce from 45 to about 25 days the time required to register a new business
         (Pronacom Indicators) (Baseline: 45 days in 2004).

These two indicators of the business climate have been met. First, it now takes
significantly less time to process goods through customs at airports and seaports. Air
cargo is now clearing in an hour as opposed to 12 hours in 2004. Seaports require an
average of 22 hours, not 4 days (2004). Couriers go through in an hour, not a day (2004).4
Efforts at improving performance transparency at customs and taxes continue with the
recently implemented SAQBE customs management system currently under
implementation in three large ports. This system will allow the importer or exporter to
identify bottlenecks some of which may be outside customs. The program of the new
administration is giving greater emphasis to logistics as an important pillar of the
competitiveness of the country. In this regard the authorities, in cooperation with the
private sector are benchmarking key logistics networks to identify other bottlenecks.

Second, a one-stop-shop for business registration is now operational. Doing Business
(DB) 2008 quotes as 26 the days needed to register a company--a reduction of 42
percent from 2004. DB2009 quotes the same number of days.5 Other improvements in
business facilitation include a reduction in the number of days for registering property to


4
         2009 Doing Business likewise reports a reduction in the time and cost of importing and exporting
goods.

5
          To be precise, to obtain the definite registration, tax and social security numbers and authorization
to print invoices takes 14 days. A temporary license is obtained in one day and the final license 14 days
later. The rest of the days are spent outside the one-stop fulfilling complementary requirements.



                                                      19
30, a 57 percent reduction from 2004. This is the easiest property registration in LAC
according to DB2009.

These and other advances have ranked Guatemala a "top reformer" in Doing Business
2007 and 2008. In 2009, Guatemala was listed as a "reformer." Independent evidence
corroborates that indeed the business environment has improved. The 2008 Investment
Climate Assessment (ICA) compared results from business surveys in 2007 and 2003 and
found major improvements in a wide range of indicators. Other indicators of positive
impact include a pick-up in the creation of new business since 2004 (after having dropped
during the previous four years). 6 The combination of improved access to external
markets and more stable macroeconomic environment and the administrative efforts by
government are contributing to noted increase in FDI, whose value has more than tripled
since 2005, when it was US$208 million. Despite all these gains, the ICA also identified
three areas where progress has lagged: in justice (contract enforcement), infrastructure,
and security. To sustain and build on gains, these areas will need focused attention going
forward.

Guatemala has in place various public and private institutions that can help monitor
progress and lead efforts going forward. 7 There is also a wide experience of public
private sector dialogue. The World Bank, the IDB, and the IFC have contributed or are
contributing to building and maintaining this institutional architecture. The World Bank
has done so through Competitiveness Enhancement project which closes end-June 2009.
As this financing ends, the IDB funding will replace it. The IFC, in turn, has assisted
some municipalities to remove local barriers to business.

Medium-term outcome indicators:

         Cadastral survey of 50 percent of national territory completed (RIC); Baseline: 20
         percent in 2004

         Titling and registration for 33 percent of national territory completed (RIC)
         (Baseline: 12 percent in 2004)

7
         Institutions focused on competitiveness include PRONACOM, INVEST IN GUATEMALA,
FUNDESA, and others. etc. FUNDESA competitiveness work focuses on connecting small and medium
enterprise sector and the regional economies to the process of globalization, following on analytical work
(PSIA) that call for strengthening the linkages to markets of the small and medium enterprises and the rural
areas.




                                                    20
Of these two indicators of progress in land administration, the second target was
exceeded, while achievement fell short on the first. According to information from RIC,
the on-going cadastral survey has covered slightly over 30 percent of the country up from
20 percent in 2004; most of this work corresponds to El Peten, the largest department in
the country. The target has not been met because of delays in implementing the
supporting World Bank financial assistance--Land Administration APL. Implementing
the first project of the APL (phase 1) took longer than expected and the second project
was delayed first by a long lag to obtain congressional approval and then because of
initial weak implementation capacity of RIC and a change in the Project's cadastral
surveying strategy proposed by the new administration (which took office in January
2008). The ICR for the first project examined the impact of land registration on economic
outcomes in El Peten and found increases in the price of registered and titled land. No
further analyses of impact are currently available.

Land titled and registered, according to the latest information, has gone from 12 percent
in 2004 to 33.1 percent in 2006. This slightly surpassed the program outcome target of
33 percent. Historically, only property in the larger cities had titles at local registries.
Progress in titling outside the larger cities, and especially in areas covered by the
cadastral survey, has proceeded slowly for various reasons. First, titling is voluntary and
FONTIERRAS--which was created as an autonomous agency by the 1999 Land Fund
Law to facilitate titling--has weak capacity and a broad mandate which makes it difficult
for FONTIERRAS to focus on titling. During the first phase, FONTIERRAS did not
make titling a high enough priority and could not keep up with the progress made on
cadastral surveying. Second, between 15 to 20 percent of the plots have problems that
delay titling and the legislation to adjudicate among competing claims is not yet in place.8
Third, greater integration is needed between RIC and the General Property Registry
(RGP), a different institution from RIC.

With hindsight, although the law creating RIC was a positive step, changing institutional
structures for land administration in the country is a long process requiring continuous
political will. Today, implementation of the Bank-financed project on land administration
continues to proceed at a slow pace. As noted previously, the process of real estate
registration has improved and Guatemala ranks high according to 2009 DB. However, the
process of titling rural land, where the potential for conflict exists, is moving slowly.

Objective I.4 Strengthening Infrastructure through private sector participation

Medium-term outcome indicators:

        An adequate legal framework exists for Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) and is
        being implemented (staff assessment)



8
         There are no clear rules on how to proceed when there are doubts about the quality of land claims.
This has contributed to delays in titling. A Land Regularization Law is needed.



                                                    21
       At least a 7 percent reduction in handling times and costs via efficiency
       improvements in ports and airports (Facilitation Group, Pronacom)

Of the two indicators, the first one was not met, the second was exceeded. Congress did
not approve the PPP Law during the Berger administration. Neither did the Berger
Administration succeed in implementing two special laws to undertake major road
projects that Congress approved. Thus, the objective of setting an adequate framework
for PPP remains unmet. According to local experts, the two drafts of the PPP law
considered by Congress had design problems and therefore, with hindsight, it was
probably best that they were not approved. A third version of the law is now in Congress
and the current government lists the approval of this law among its priorities. Engaging
the private sector to help develop infrastructure remains a high and relevant priority (as
previously noted, infrastructure was cited in the 2008 ICA as of the major constrains to
competitiveness and economic growth in Guatemala).

While infrastructure remains a challenge, the progress in facilitating transit through
customs exceeded the program target. PRONACOM reports that handling times at
airports and ports came down by around 15 percent during the period more than twice the
goal of 7 percent. Doing Business 2009 likewise reports a drop in the time and cost of
importing. But, trading across borders remains costly in part due to the infrastructure
constrains.

Objective I.5 Strengthening, modernizing and deepening of the financial sector

(The two medium-term outcome indicators are discussed in separately).

Medium-term outcome indicator:

       Improvements in the legal and regulatory framework to facilitate access to credit
       by SMEs implemented and functioning (staff assessment)

The medium term outcome indicator has been accomplished. Guatemala has made
significant progress in improving the regulatory framework and implementing it. Indeed
the prior actions supported by the DPL series have contributed to: (i) the application of
risk-based consolidated supervision procedures on a pilot basis to selected financial
institutions; (ii) the mapping of interrelationships between all financial groups and their
subsidiaries and related parties; (iii) the classification of information derived from such
mapping, as the basis for designing new analytical tools, as required for the assessments
of the impacts that the incorporation or withdrawal of related entities may have on the
solvency of the financial groups; (iv) improvements, both quantitative and qualitative, of
the data on large corporate debtors reported by institutions to Banking Superintendency;
and (v) approval of a new law on Movable Collateral.

In parallel to these improvements on the regulatory front, Guatemala has also improved
its ranking in a number of indicators that measure credit access, including by SME. For
example, Guatemala improved its ranking with regard to access to credit in the 2009


                                            22
Doing Business to 28 from 61 in 2008. Similarly, the 2008 ICA also reports that access to
credit has improved and information available at the Superintendency of Banks shows
that credit to the SME sector grew by 60 percent from 2005 to 2007. The country has
made successful efforts to expand credit to the micro enterprises and in three major banks,
over 15 percent of the loans are considered micro-credit. SIB continues to review the
existing financial regulation to identify options that best can help the development of
micro-finance, which today comprises a wide range of mostly non-regulated entities.

Perhaps more importantly, the objective of strengthening and modernizing the financial
sector has also been achieved. Today the Guatemalan financial sector is stronger than in
the past and the analysis of the new information generated by SIB has permitted the
identification and correction of potential risks in a limited number of banking institutions.
Following the identification of these risks, the SIB proceeded to present the results from
the analysis to the boards of the banks jointly with actionable recommendations to be
implemented overtime. The result was a positive response from the approached Banks.
The fact that banks have complied with recent increases in mandatory general reserve
requirements on the way to full coverage of bad debts (currently at 70 percent), signals
increased discipline and commitment from banks.

On the whole, standard financial sector indicators show that the improvements in the
financial sector since 2000 continued during 2004 to 2008: the coverage over assets at
risk increased from 43.6 in 2004 to 73.2 in 2008; the profitability over capital went from
14.4 in 2004 to 16.3 in 2008; and the capital asset ratio went from 8.9 in 2004 to 10.3 in
2008. These indicators have remained stable since December 2008 till now.

The strength of the financial sector is also reflected in prompt and effective response to
the failure of two banks during the DPL period. Indeed, the authorities and its
international partners showed skill and commitment, a point stressed by the ICR to the
FSAL. The performance of the Bank was also rated highly and, in fact, IEG confirmed a
rating of highly satisfactory for Bank performance under the FSAL. These events brought
to the forefront the need to accelerate improvements in supervision and risk management.
But also pointed out the need of proceeding gradually, as tightening regulations too fast
may itself create compliance difficulties.

Medium-term outcome indicator:

       Payment System implemented and in operation (Banguat)

This objective has been achieved. The Central Bank continues to improve the payment
systems and work is underway to interconnect with other countries in Central America.




                                             23
   II. Enhancing the capacity for public spending in priority sectors

Objective II.1 Improvement in tax collections

Medium-term outcome indicators:

       Strengthened tax administration as assessed by independent agencies (e.g., IMF,
       World Bank)

       Tax revenue at 11 percent of GDP (Ministry of Finance, base year 1958)
       (Baseline: 10.4 percent in 2004)

The first indicator on strengthened tax administration was achieved. The tax revenue
target was met for 2007, but due to backsliding in 2008 progress on the medium-term
outcome is considered to have fallen short. Revenue collection as a proportion of GDP
(using the 2001 revised National account) increased from 10.4 percent in 2004 to 11.2
percent in 2007, meeting the DPL series target of 11 percent, but falling short of the
Peace Accords equivalent target of 12 percent of GDP. In 2008, the ratio dropped to 9.5
percent.

A 2007 review of the tax and customs system and the ICR for the Guatemala Tax
Administration TAL (which closed in March 2007) concur that Guatemala's tax and
customs practices had improved. The merger of tax and customs in one agency, SAT, has
taken hold as has the autonomy of the agency, in contrast to the situation during the
previous period to 2004. There is also significant agreement in tax and customs
facilitation--around 95 percent of the tax revenues are paid electronically and the time
and cost of handling goods through customs has declined. The roster of taxpayers is
increasing continuously. Institutionally, SAT is stronger and equipped with modern
systems and procedures and greater legal powers to enforce the law. The SAT has
improved its strategic capacity and has moved beyond the "action plan" approach of the
previous period. Its enforcement capacity has also improved through design and ability
to carry out risk-based auditing. The need for these reforms was identified through a
dialogue with the private sector, a dialogue that still continues.

Despite these substantial gains in tax administration, tax revenue fell short of the target in
2008. While the global economic slowdown contributed to this decline, the lack of
significant progress on tax policy constrains tax collection. In the past, efforts to maintain
or improve the revenue yield have led to temporary tax measures which were
accompanied by an abundance of tax exemptions, creating fiscal risk and standing in the
way of a more comprehensive tax policy. Guatemala's low revenue collection continues
to limit the capacity of the government to undertake needed social investments and build
up competitive capacity. With hindsight, the reasonableness of expecting a sustained
increase in revenue mobilization with respect to GDP in the context of a DPL is
questionable, unless a comprehensive tax policy is already in place. IEG made a similar
point in commenting to the ICR for the Tax Administration TAL.




                                             24
The impact of the tax administration reforms are leading to an improved business
environment and a greater formalization of the economy; 9 but the impact on revenue
collection over the long-haul is less certain as it will depend on more tax policy reforms
and effective enforcement.

Objective I.2. Improving budget allocations

Medium-term outcome indicator:

         Increased availability (6 percent of GDP) of funds for social sectors and better
         targeting of resources for social sectors (Ministry of Finance).

The medium-term indicator was mostly achieved in terms of increased funds for social
sectors, whether or not the resources are better targeted remains to be assessed. The
resources available to social sectors increased considerably in real terms both because
GDP growth increased and because a higher share of GDP was allocated to social
services. Social expenditures as a percentage of GDP increased from 5.3 percent in 2005
to 5.4 percent in 2006 and 5.8 percent in 2008. 10 These resources contributed to
expanding health, education, and other social services. In 2009, social expenditures as a
share of GDP are expected to jump to 7.4 percent as the government implements a new
Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) program.

These increasing resources are likely to have contributed to maintaining the positive trend
in human development indicators identified by the 2008 Poverty Assessment. Based on
2006 survey information, the 2008 PER found advances across the board including in
education, health, and water and sanitation since 2000. During this period, Guatemala
reduced its gap with average LAC indicators. Nutrition was an exception. 11 The
improvements have been such that during the 2000-2008 period Guatemala's rate of
improvement in social indicators ranked amongst the best in the region and the world.
Still, the 2008 Poverty Assessment notes that Guatemala still continues to lag Latin
America in all social indicators. Where gains in service access have been made, like in
basic education and health indicators, quality of services remain a concern.




9
  The 2009 Doing Business does not reflect the gains made in tax compliance facilitation and continues to
rank Guatemala low at 120 with no changes in the indicators since 2006. The authorities are aware of the
dissonance and have approached the Doing Business staff for clarification.

10
          Information from the 2008 Poverty Report shows that public expenditure on social programs
(health, education, water, culture and others) as a percentage of GDP has oscillated at around 6 percent
since 1999. The significant increase took place from 1996 (3.5 percent) to 1999. Guatemala's social
expenditures as a percentage of GDP are about half of the Latin American average.

11
         See 2008 Poverty Report, Table 2.



                                                     25
No definitive information was obtained to assess trends in the targeting of public
expenditures in the social sectors. Nonetheless it appears that the additional resources
have been uniformly allocated across social sectors. Under the government's new CCT
program additional expenditures are being targeted toward the poor and extreme poor.
Greater attention to assessing the impact of social sector spending could help improve the
impact of future investments in Guatemala.

   III. Transparency and Public Sector Management

Objective III.1 Improving transparency and efficiency of public resource use

Medium-term outcome indicators:
   Enhanced public financial management performance (as measured by
     international indicators.
   Strengthened transparency and public efficiency in public procurement. (staff
     assessment).

Both medium-term outcomes are judged to have been met, though a more thorough
assessment is currently underway that will help gauge Guatemala's progress relative to
other countries. A Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) exercise is
assessing public financial performance in Guatemala, including procurement practices.
The results can then be compared with the 2005 Country Financial Accountability
Assessment and the Country Procurement Assessment Report. In the absence of
international indicators, results on improving public financial management were gauged
in terms of (a) coverage, (b) control, (c) transparency, (d) potential for expansion, and (e)
impact on efficiency.

On coverage, SIAF expanded beyond expectations and now covers all public entities at
the central and local levels. In addition, through an executive decree (11-2006), social
funds, trust funds, and NGOs using public funds (fideicomisos) are required by law to be
included in the budget and use SIAF. In 2004, SIAF was operational in only about 60
percent of central government agencies and 30 percent of decentralized agencies.

On control, SIAF incorporates modern processes and systems in budgeting, treasury
operations, accounting, and human resource registration and payroll. A management
system complements SIAF by establishing automatic linkages between the core financial
modules and supporting administrative systems (e.g., procurement and registries of fixed
assets). As a result of the more extended coverage and the design of the SIAF system, the
central government now has greater control over budget execution and outcomes. All
reporting (either periodic to the public or annual to Congress) relies on information
provided by SIAF. The current SIAF platform allows expansion, for instance, towards
multi-year budgeting. Though, some rigidities in the budgetary classifications may
constrain other developments, such as results-based budgeting, ongoing efforts to
upgrade the system would overcome such constraints.




                                             26
Interviews undertaken with civil society representatives, while gathering information for
the preparation of this ICR, evidenced an ample consensus that transparency in the use of
public funds increased by making SIAF information available online. In fact, civil society
organizations have been active and support the expansion of the SIAF and they have
helped move the process through in the face of political opposition.

Similarly, Guatemala's web-based procurement tool, Guatecompras, has also expanded
coverage to the point that it is mandatory for all public agencies, as opposed to 2004
when it was hardly used. Today, Guatecompras (GC) is partially interfaced with regular
budgetary procedures, which cannot be carried out unless a GC number has been
assigned. Guatecompras serves to inform potential bidders and let the public know of
upcoming transactions. The information allows the public (press) to monitor transactions,
as is already taking place. Guatecompras does not yet allow for procurement online,
although such an extension is reportedly feasible in the near future. Further progress in
procurement reform will require approval of proposed changes to the existing
procurement legislation, which is pending in Congress.

Recent analysis of the likely impact of SIAF and Guatecompras improvements on
development outcomes or the effectiveness of the Ministry of Finance or local
governments is not available. Thus, it is not possible to make definite statements on the
impact on the efficiency of public expenditure. Somewhat dated analysis, such as from
the FY06 Public Expenditure Review (PER), suggests that the government's enhanced
budget management capacity has contributed to more effective use of public funds. The
Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) showed procurement reforms have
produced fiscal savings from lower prices and better quality. The Country Financial
Accountability Assessment (CFAA) found that the capacity of local governments to
mobilize revenues and deliver services has improved. Documentation presented to the
Board March 4, 2008 for approval of the Additional Financing to the Third Integrated
Financial Management Technical Assistance Project makes reference to improvements in
efficiency.

Discussions with the authorities, civil society, and Bank technical staff show that a
greater emphasis on tracking impact should be part of any future agenda. Also, the
information available from SIAF should lead to greater involvement of civil society in
monitoring results building on the lessons from Accion Cuidadana, or the training of
journalists to follow economic information, and should help strengthen sustainability.
Forthcoming analytical work could focus on developing a precise understanding of the
links between the PFM reform achievements and improved service delivery in health,
education, and nutrition, among others.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating


Ratings: Satisfactory. The themes selected for the DPL were relevant to the development
challenges of the country and they were aligned with the government program. The
themes continue to be relevant today as they at the core of the challenges of the country.



                                              27
The DPL program was ambitious and covered a wide range of areas, some of them
subject to a difficult political economy, a fact that influenced implementation.

The Program achieved the bulk of the development outcomes. Public finance is more
transparent, the Ministry of Finance has better control of fiscal affairs, social sectors are
receiving greater resources, and tax compliance and enforcement have improved. The
business environment is now better and access to external markets is more secure, with
CAFTA and the advances in Central America intervention. The authorities showed skill
and commitment in dealing promptly with the failure of two major banks and are
advancing in mending the regulatory framework and practices to prevent problems
similar to the past and protect against current threats from the global slowdown. A strong
macroeconomic situation has position the country to deal well with the current crisis.

However, the country still does not have a solid legal framework to engage the private
sector in infrastructure--a weak link in competitiveness. And, registration and titling of
land is progressing at a snail's pace. Tax revenue mobilization remains a challenge for
macroeconomic health and delivery of social services.

The DPL was well integrated with the CAS investment program; various investment and
technical assistance operations help with achieving the prior actions and moving towards
the development objectives. Examples include: the work on taxation through the Tax
TAL, the work on the budget and procurement through the SIAF project; the work on
finance through the FSAL and the on-going Finance TAL; the Land Registration Project;
as well as analytical work that either helped design the DPL program or track impact.

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The DPL contribution to a stable and growing economy and the greater allocation of
resources to social sectors is likely to have contributed to reduce poverty. 12 In 2006,
poverty affected 51 percent of Guatemalans, slightly lower than 56 percent in 2000.
Given that per capita income declined from 2000 to 2004, poverty reduction during 2000-
2006 was likely driven by rising incomes and remittances since 2004. Extreme poverty
remained at around 15 percent from 2000 to 2006. Poverty continues to be high among
rural and non-Spanish speaking populations; 70 percent of rural Guatemalans live below
the poverty line and 25 percent live in extreme poverty. Guatemala continues to have one
of the highest GINI coefficients in Latin America and worldwide, despite a decline from
0.48 in 2000 to 0.45 in 2006.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

Institutional gains have taken place across the board in the program: (a) the independence
of the SAT has been assured and its technical capacity increased, (b) SIAF and its gains
have been integrated into the Ministry of Finance, (c) the SIB has been restructured to
better serve the needs of modern supervision; and (d) a set of semi-public institutions
with private sector involvement are overseeing the improvement in competitiveness.

N/A

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
 All risks identified by the DPL series proved to be factors in implementation of the
 government's three pillar reform program. They included (i) political risks, (ii) societal
 tensions related to the country's post-conflict status, (iii) exogenous shocks related to
 natural disasters, and (iv) macroeconomic risks due to external or domestic market
 volatility. These risks were mitigated by the coordination of DPL operations with the
 budget process, the political commitment to the reform agenda agreed in the DPLs at the
 time of implementation, the results orientation and transparency of the program and
 dissemination of impact to the general public, as well as sustained and incremental
 improvement in interregional trade liberalization and financial and banking reform with
 prudent oversight by the financial sector.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
 (i.e., performance through lending phase)

Ratings: Satisfactory. The DPLs were aligned both with the country's reform program,
called "Vamos Guatemala", and the Country Assistance Strategy that was a direct
reflection of the government's explicit development priorities. The DPL instrument was
employed to meet the array of challenges confronting the country after a low point in
economic, fiscal, and governance indicators preceding the Berger Administration. The
quick disbursing nature of the DPL was designed to render large-scale and immediate
budgetary support in key and critical areas of the government's program, which was a
compelling need at the time the DPL series was initiated. Hence, the quality at entry was
good and the instrument used by the Bank was appropriate and was aligned with the
government's preference to jump-start its ambitious reform program. It was understood
by the Government and the Bank at the outset that strong interagency and ministerial
cooperation and coordination would be needed, which was also viewed as an important
aspect of institution building that had been neglected by the previous administration.



                                              29
Interviews with officials of the Berger administration that acted as counterparts to the
Bank concurred the design was adequate and aligned with the program and financial
needs of the government.

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including M&E arrangements)

Satisfactory. The supervision reports for the DPLs indicated all binding conditions stated
in the Loan Agreement were met with no issues arising and all prior actions showing
demonstrable progress. The dialog with the Government of Guatemala remained positive
and the team composition was appropriate to carry out the supervision. The intent of the
DPLs was to help finance the government's budget and meet the PDOs that reflected the
priorities of the Government's reform program, "Vamos Guatemala." While there was a
delay in congressional approval of the national budget that impacted disbursement, the
Bank team and the government were able to adjust to the circumstances and disburse
planned amounts against DPL I, II, and III successfully.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Ratings: Satisfactory. The overall Bank performance showed flexibility and persistence,
drew on strong borrower commitment, and reflected strong analytical work performed
before during and after the DPL series was initiated. By incorporating the Peace Accords
agenda in the context of fiscal, investment, and social platforms, the Bank continued to
maintain a dialog through the DPL instrument in key development areas and helped the
government maintain the basic momentum required to achieve the myriad Vamos
Guatemala objectives. The former officials interviewed commended the Bank for its
readiness to adjust to circumstances that would have allowed Guatemala to borrow on
long term basis at competitive rates. In their view, the Bank managed to put in place a
competitive package that was financially attractive, while lowering the burden of
conditionality by aligning triggers and prior actions with the program of the government
and introducing enough flexibility to deal with the unforeseen developments.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Ratings: Satisfactory. The government continued to seek congressional and civic support
for its stated reform program objectives through the DPL series. Although there were
temporary setbacks in the form of delays in congressional approval of DPL-related
support for the budget, the government remained focused on achievable outcomes and
met the majority of the program triggers agreed to continue with the growth program.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Ratings: Satisfactory. The Ministry of Finance stood at the center of the government's
reform agenda and as such took responsibility for keeping the DPL agenda on track. The
DPL prior actions were all met and the required inter-ministerial and interagency
cooperation was forthcoming. In addition, while the legal framework for private public
partnership was not politically feasible, the competitiveness agenda moved forward and
appears to be a platform on which further progress can be made. Likewise, the


                                            30
government showed strong commitment to the fiscal reform program, despite setbacks in
Congress. Programs on tax administration reform were highly successful. Evidence of
that is the commencement of a second series of DPLs in 2008.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Ratings: Satisfactory. Given the circumstances at the time of the DPL series initiation,
namely a reform program derailed and the need to put it back on track quickly, the
Borrower (government) sought a mechanism to push forward its ambitious reform agenda
but with adequate control and targeting of interventions as well as results in
reestablishing its standing in the region and internationally. The commitment of the
government to the objectives embedded in the DPLs moved the program forward through
massive and deliberately rapid financial infusions in the budget. The government showed
the requisite flexibility to adjust to changing circumstances--congressional delays in
budget passage in particular--and yet maintain the thrust of its growth agenda, hence the
satisfactory rating.

6. Lessons Learned

1. DPLs can facilitate the Bank's role as a catalyst for moving forward a broad
program of reforms and promoting important coordination among a diverse group of
public and private beneficiaries.

The Guatemala programmatic DPL series played an important role in helping the
authorities coordinate and execute their own development strategy. The DPL triggers and
prior actions served as a useful public commitment that helped the authorities and civil
society keep track of progress on key development objectives. It also helped the
authorities coordinate program delivery across numerous government agencies and
projects. Government officials noted that the prior actions under the DPL helped them
galvanize and stimulate the reform process, especially by motivating various agencies to
complete their prescribed tasks within a broader reform agenda. In addition, the DPL
supported the overall Country Assistance Strategy and investment program by enhancing
the policy framework in key complementary areas. The operation was well coordinated
with the government's efforts to rekindle the implementation of the 1996 Peace Accords
reform agenda, which had slowed under the prior administration, as well as support broad
social and political consensus building under a difficult and contentious political
environment.

2. A complementary technical reform framework is essential to promote multiple DPL
objectives and provide the necessary synergies for overall program effectiveness. The
effectiveness of a broadly designed DPL requires complementary technical support from
Bank projects, other International Financial Institutions, government programs, or local
institutions. Without this technical support, it would have been difficult to achieve the
ambitious development objectives as reflected in the DPL series on a timely yearly
schedule coordinated with the national budget. In Guatemala, the DPL was well
integrated with the Bank's investment operations and the government's program of
policy reforms under the CAS framework. The DPL benefited from the support of


                                           31
investment projects, TA operations, and analytical work, including the Tax
Administration TAL, SIAF project, Financial Sector AL, Land Administration APL, the
DR-CAFTA report, CPAR/CFAA reports, among others. Most of these operations, had
been under implementation for some time, and had already laid a groundwork from
which results could spring.

3. Program design can accommodate risky environments, but only if there is clear
government ownership. A broad design allows flexibility to adjust to changing
circumstances, i.e., if one part of the program proves intractable, the operation can still
move forward if program interdependency is low. Hence, as in the case of Guatemala, a
broad design seems appropriate to help implement a program, despite a politically
contentious environment, as it can also be an instrument to provide inertia to large
segments the reform program even when some parts face difficulties. As noted, the
reform agenda had the support of a broad technical assistance program and the degree of
country ownership was very high. While some parts of the program did not achieved
expected or sustained results, such as the legal framework for public private partnerships,
other parts could be expanded or deepened, such as in the financial sector support.
Despite the high degree of ownership facilitated with inter-agency coordination, the
operation did not drive the legislative agenda. In the case of Guatemala, ownership alone
did not always translate into reliable delivery when implementation depended on third-
party agreements. For example, the alignment with the Vamos Guatemala development
plan supported the reform platform, but the implementation risks remained high and
program outcomes were missed in some areas given the lack of political consensus and
strong vested interest groups.

4. There are limitations to what a DPL can deliver in difficult policy areas. Although a
broad DPL design, as noted, allows flexibility to accommodate risks in the delivery a
wide program of reforms, a broad design can also dilute efforts to meet many and diffuse
objectives. In Guatemala, the agenda fell behind in difficult policy areas like land
registration and titling, and public private partnerships for infrastructure which has been,
and continues to be, difficult areas for agreement in the political arena. In these areas, the
role of the DPL as a commitment mechanism is limited, as perhaps it should be. If taken
too far it runs the risk being viewed as an external interference in internal affairs. The
past and present authorities agree that the DPL structure should be aligned with
government programs, but going beyond this may entail considerable risks for the overall
program.

5. Breaking difficult barriers, like increasing the ratio of revenue to GDP, or
measurably increasing the effectiveness of government, may require more focused
complements to the DPL process. In contentious policy areas, such as land and tax
reform, emphasizing analytical work and broad dialogue may be more effective. In
addition, as suggested by some stakeholders in Guatemala, alternative approaches may
exploit further synergies across initiatives, such as improving efficiency in public
expenditures with increasing revenue flows to the government.              While these
complementary strategies were pursued during the implementation of the DPL, closer and
more explicit scrutiny of the political economy of difficult areas could lead to design



                                             32
approaches to dissipate the possibility of policy stalemates, but it is no guarantee of
success.

6. For the delivery of results, the Guatemala DPL succeed with the involvement of civil
society and the private sector as key forces to forge the necessary political consensus to
maintain broad policy dialog and political momentum. The Guatemala experience with
the DPL series suggests that increasing the societal demand for reform improved program
design and moved the policy agenda forward. Reforms that increase transparency and
trust are likely to find support among civil society, as a lack of public information
frequently leads to mistrust and lack of political commitment. In Guatemala, civil society,
the private sector and the Congress were actors in either the design or implementation of
various reforms included in the DPL package. Civil society provided a powerful voice in
the demand for transparency and similarly played a role in improving the effectiveness of
public expenditure. The dialogue with the private sector also proved effective in
maintaining the focus on competitiveness. Bank sponsored forums for dialogue on public
policy effectively engaged Congress on fiscal policy options. Interviews with country
stakeholders confirmed the important role these forums played in building a consensus on
the introduction of new reforms. Efforts to show progress on the transparency agenda
illustrates the point. The teams working on taxes, customs, and competitiveness involved
the private sector through dialogue in the design and implementation of the agenda. This
involvement improved the design by identifying areas that needed improvement and
helped facilitate broad acceptance by both public and private sector participants.

7. A well articulated results framework is required to track and evaluate DPL
outcomes, but is not a perfect instrument. A good results framework facilitates
evaluation, but it cannot be a definitive measure of the impact of an operation. For
instance, although a reasonable argument can be made that the approval of the DR-
CAFTA (prior action) would increase the growth of non-traditional exports (medium-
term outcome), this not necessarily the case. An important aspect of the passage of the
DR-CAFTA was the permanence it created for previously temporary trade arrangements,
but this does not necessarily imply a higher increase in growth of non-traditional exports.
While, non-traditional exports did increase, it is unclear whether this is attributable to
solely the DR-CAFTA treaty or simply a pre-existing trend. Likewise, a stagnation of
non-traditional exports would not have necessarily reflected poorly on the on the impact
of the treaty, or the success of the prior action, as other factors could have come into play.
Other examples of this type of attribution problem can also be found, but this is a general
problem with the interpretation of results, not this particular operation, per se. Care
should be taken to ensure that the expected results reflect, as close as possible, the core
content and likely impact of actions supported, but are not an unambiguous indicator or
guide to the impact of the operation.

Lender's Classification of the Project

The general objective of the three Loans was to support the Government's financing
needs. Thus the loans were designed as budget support operations, without any direct
link to sectoral or specific expenditures, in accordance with the country's priorities. The
loans responded to the Governments' efforts in the execution of a Policy Reform
Program to improve the efficiency and targeting of expenditures and social investment
towards the poorest sectors of the population.

Disbursements of resources were subject to compliance with certain general conditions,
including maintenance of a stable macroeconomic framework and a transparent
environment in the administration of public finances.

In order to achieve the Government objectives the loans supported several actions: 1)
protection of the Ministry of Education's and of the Ministry of Public Health and Social
Assistance's budgetary allocations corresponding to the years of the loans' execution. Iin
this area, taking as the baseline the budgetary allocations for the year 2005 as approved
by Congress, it can be observed that during the years of execution the allocations
increased by 13 percent13 whereas for the year 2008 the increase reached 48 percent.
Similarly, for the year 2006 social spending reached Q14,604.3 millions that represented
40.1 percent of the total expenditure by the central administration, or 5.4 percent of GDP,
compared with 5.3 percent in 2005.

Likewise, the following accomplishments were reached:

        Implementation of the "ventanilla nica" for the registration of businesses in the
        Registry within 25 days.
        The Republic of Guatemala was awarded a certification from the air transport
        security for the La Aurora International Airport, confirming of the country's
        capacity to adhere to the international practices in airplanes operations and
        maintenance operations established by the Organization of International Civil
        Aviation.
        New improvements in the supervision of financial groups.


13
        It is important to indicate that as a result of the non-approval of the Budget in FY2007, the
approved Budget of FY2006 went into effect; when comparisons are made with the approved amounts, the
percentages are 13 percent in 2005 and of 26 percent for 2006.



                                                 40
       Intervention and dissolution of bankrupt banks (Bancaf and Banco de Comercio),
       without altering the solidity of the country's financial system.
       Creation of the Special Investigation Unit of the Banking Superintendence in
       charge of investigating illegal activities.
       Implementation of the Legal Framework to strengthen the Tax Administration
       Office. Support for efforts aimed at advancing the strategic plan, by for example,
       requiring the electronic submission of applications from the biggest 3,000
       contributors; the expanding the crossed-controls controls program to these 3,000
       contributors; and expanding the registry unified tax.
       Widening of SIAF's operative coverage (to 8 additional central government and
       decentralized organisms and 70 additional municipalities).
       Implementation of the use of the Guatecompras to at least 370 public entities from
       a total of 280 municipalities.

Borrower's performance

In order to improve the efficiency and focalization of social investment toward the
poorest sectors, the Government of Guatemala designed the Economic and Social
Reactivation Program which is comprised of four strategic elements: Guate Crece, Guate
Compete, Guate Solidaria, and Guate Verde.

The implementation of the Loans constituted for the Government of Guatemala a
strengthening experience in inter-institutional coordination, in which the involved entities
participated, and achieved the execution of loans within the envisioned time frame.

In addition, it must be pointed out that thanks to loans' management and the start of the
implementation for a poverty reduction strategy, an identification process was set out to
identify the poorest communities with large indexes of unsatisfied basic necessities. This
in turn allowed for the analysis of the existing documentation to achieve clear criteria on
targeting.

Bank's performance

The Bank provided consistent support during the project's preparation, which was
focused on providing support to the Government of Guatemala to attend to actions related
to the financing of its priority programs. The Government of Guatemala considers the
Bank missions to be satisfactory and appropriate, as well as the technical teams involved
in the development of these operations.
