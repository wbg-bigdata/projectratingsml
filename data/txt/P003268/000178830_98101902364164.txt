LOAN AND CREDIT AND PROGRAM SUMMARY
BORROWER                             : Government of Zimbabwe
AMOUNT                               : US$50 million - Bank
SDR 12.10 million (US$15 million
equivalent) - IDA
TERMS                                : Loan - 9.60 percent interest repayable
in 20 years including 5 years of grace.
Credit - standard.
PURPOSE                              : The proposed Bank loan and IDA credit
would assist the Government to increase
utilization of the country's manufacturing
capacity. The loan and credit would
make available a total of US$65 million
to help meet priority import requirements
of raw materials, spare parts, components
and balancing equipment. Counterpart
funds would be used to finance develop-
ment projects in the Central Government
budget. The manufacturing sector
operating at high levels would generate
appreciable employment and substantially
increase production of manufactured
goods for export and domestic consumption.
No appreciable risks to the imports
program have been identified, although
present unsettled conditions in the
country are of concern.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON PROPOSED MANUFACTURING REHABILITATION IMPORTS PROGRAM LOAN AND CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF ZIMBABWE
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
Manufacturing Rehabilitation Imports Program loan for the equivalent of
US$50 million, which would have a term of 20 years including 5 years of
grace, with interest at 9.60 percent per annum, and a proposed credit on
standard terms for SDR 12.10 million (US$15 million equivalent) to the
Republic of Zimbabwe.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The first economic mission, since Zimbabwe attained independence,
visited the country in September 1980, and its report is scheduled to be
distributed shortly. 1/ The information in this report was gathered by
this mission and two subsequent missions which visited Zimbabwe in October and
November to appraise the proposed Manufacturing Rehabilitation Imports Program
Loan and Credit.
3.        Zimbabwe is a landlocked country of about 390,000 square kilometers,
which borders Mozambique on the east, Botswana on the southwest and Zambia
on the northwest. Topographically, the territory rises from low plains
(low veld) in the northwest and southeast to the middle veld (600-1,200
meters) and further to a high plateau (high veld, 1,200-1,500 meters), which
runs from the southwest to the northeast. The high veld is a temperate
climate with a reasonably high level of rainfall, while the middle veld
regions are warmer and drier and the low veld areas are arid to sub-arid.
Population estimates for Zimbabwe for end-December 1979 indicate that there
are about 7.3 million people, 97 percent of whom are Africans. 2/ The remaining
or "non-African" people consist of about 220,000 Europeans, 10,000 Asians and
23,000 people of mixed origin. The growth rate of the African population is
estimated to be 3.6 percent per year while the number of non-Africans is now
declining due to emigration. It is estimated, on the basis of pre-war data,
that 20 percent of the population is urban.
4.        The economic structure is well diversified.  Agriculture, manu-
facturing and mining are the important directly productive sectors of the
economy. Agriculture accounts for about 12-15 percent of GDP and provides
1/   The data in this report is drawn from the draft version of the economic
report and is not therefore entirely consistent with the social indicators
in Annex 1, which were prepared in October 1980.
2/   The Government of Zimbabwe's nomenclature.



- 2 -
formal employment for 334,000 persons (34 percent of all the formal employ-
ment) and income opportunities for another estimated 1.4 million who depend
mainly on subsistence or smallholder agriculture. Until recently, agricultural
exports provided about 39 percent of total foreign exchange earnings. Major
products are flue-cured tobacco, cotton, maize, sugar, wheat, coffee and
livestock.
5.        Zimbabwe's mineral resources, include gold, asbestos, nickel,
copper, coal, chrome ore, tin, iron ore, silver and cobalt.  Besides contribut-
ing 7.5 percent of the country's GDP and providing almost 6 percent of total
formal employment, mining also is central to Zimbabwe's foreign trade. In
1979, for example, mining exports -- mainly gold, asbestos, copper, nickel,
and ferrochrome -- earned about 40 percent of the total foreign exchange
earnings.
6.        The mining and agricultural sectors supply the bulk of the inputs
for the manufacturing sector, which in 1979 was 25 percent of GDP, employed
145,000 of the 989,000 workers in formal employment and accounted for 21
percent of Zimbabwe's merchandise exports.
7.        In 1979, per capita income was about Z$357 (US$470, using the World
Bank Atlas methodology). Distribution of income and assets between Africans
and non-Africans, however, was highly skewed. The Land Tenure Act of 1969
divided the country's total land area roughly into two equal parts for European
and African settlement. About 8 percent of the area designated for African
settlement was set aside to be available for purchase (African Purchase
Areas), while the rest was designated as Tribal Trust Lands (TTL) to be held
under communal ownership and used mainly for subsistence farming. This
distribution of land implies that there are at present 2.5 hectares of land
per African person as compared with 65.2 hectares of land per non-African.
Similar disparities exist in the distribution of other productive assets.
Rough estimates suggest that the per capita income for the African population
in 1979 was about Z$110 (US$175) compared with roughly Z$5,500 (US$9,000) for
non-Africans.
8.        In 1965, the international community imposed economic sanctions
on Rhodesia with the aim of forcing the Government to abandon its unilateral
declaration of independence. The subsequent war between the white-dominated
regime and African nationalists, who joined together in the Patriotic Front,
intensified from 1973, but neither the sanctions nor the war appeared to have
seriously affected the economy until 1975. In fact, real GDP grew at about
seven percent and per capita income about 3.5 percent a year, until 1974, with
manufacturing, agricultural and mineral output all registering impressive
gains.
9.        The sanctions were only partially effective, however.  In addition,
they stimulated the development of local capacity to manufacture substitute
goods for imports so that by 1979 consumer goods were only about ten percent
of total imports, compared with 22 percent in 1964. They also encouraged
diversification of commercial agriculture. Virginia Tobacco for example,
accounted for more than 56 percent of total agricultural output in 1964/65,
but by 1979/80 had dropped to only 25 percent. Livestock production over the



- 3 -
same period increased from 22 to 30 percent of total output, and cotton, soya
beans, wheat and coffee emerged as major crops. Overall, the value of agricul-
tural output rose from Z$123 million in 1966 to Z$305 million in 1979. During
the same time, mining grew rapidly under the impetus of expanding exports
(more than 90 percent of mining output is exported) and continuing reinvestments
by firms plus some new investments from abroad. By 1979 the value of mining
output had risen nearly 400 percent since sanctions were imposed in 1965.
10.       The economic situation changed considerably from 1975 on.  Sanctions,
the war and its petroleum requirements, oil price increases and two droughts
caused considerable disruption and resulted in a decline in economic activity
between 1975 and 1979. As a result, per capita income in real terms fell by
35 percent between 1975 and 1979 returning to its 1965 level. Although the
value of exports rose slightly during the period, the increasing cost of
imports, in particular oil, caused the volume of imports to fall precipitously.
Real investment also fell from Z$336 million in 1974 to Z$153 million in 1978.
11.       The war and two droughts in 1978 and 1979 caused declines in
agricultural output, mainly of maize, so that Zimbabwe, which had been
exporting an average of about 500,000 tons of maize a year, became a net
importer in 1979. The manufacturing sector also declined. Formal employment
fell by about 65,000, affecting virtually every sector except public admini-
stration, which increased by over 20,000 persons.
12.       In the sixties and early seventies, the Government's budget was
approximately in balance. However, beginning in 1974/75 deficits each year
increased until the 1979/80 deficit amounted to 35 percent of total Government
expenditures and 14 percent of GDP. Government expenditures during the same
period rose 20 percent per annum and in 1979/80 was 37 percent of GDP,
compared with 18 percent in 1971/72. The composition of Government expendi-
ture also shifted. The share of expenditure for administration and defense
constituted 46 percent of the total in 1979/80, while the portion directed to
economi't services, notably agriculture, commerce and industry declined.
While extensive controls kept price increases relatively low, -- 5 percent
annually during 1970-75 -- the annual rise from 1975 to 1979 was about 11.5
percent.
13.       Externally, the economy maintained a reasonable balance on current
account -- as imports grew less rapidly than exports -- until 1975, when there
was a deficit of Z$116 million, financed in large part by private borrowing
abroad. With tightened exchange controls in 1975, imports in the following
three years dropped below 1974 levels and the balance on current account was
restored. A Z$61 million deficit in 1979, due in part to a sharp increase in
imports, as well as a net outflow of private capital was covered by Govern-
ment borrowing from South Africa.
14.       With the end of the war and attainment of independence, the economy
began to grow. This was mainly due to an almost 40 percent increase in
imports, which facilitated a slight increase in capacity utilization. The rise
in imports has been financed from expanded foreign exchange earnings from
mineral exports (the price of gold increased appreciably). It has also been
financed from additional foreign exchange earnings resulting from the removal



- 4 -
of sanctions, which obliged Rhodesia to pay a premium for imports and accept
discounted prices for its exports. Furthermore, with the end of the war,
the people are now able to concentrate on economic pursuits. Finally,
growth in the agricultural sector has been facilitated by favorable weather.
Consequently, a 6-8 percent real growth is expected in 1980.
15.       The new Government's first budget presentation to Parliament stresses
pragmatic policies and programs aimed at a rapid rehabilitation of the economy,
greater employment opportunities, and redistribution with growth.  Relative
increases are registered in Government expenditures on health, education,
smallholder agriculture and capital investments by the Government. The
capital budget increased from Z$85 million in 1979/80 to Z$142 million in
1980/81, and the recurrent budget from Z$972 million to Z$1145 million.
Expenditures for internal security and defense are expected to continue to be
sizeable and to make larger demands on resources than previously anticipated.
Overall, the budget projects a deficit of about Z$575 million.
16.       Economic prospects for the next two to three years are generally
good, provided the Government is able to control potentially divisive political
and military forces. Economic rehabilitation will require substantial
amounts of external assistance in addition to the domestic savings which can
reasonably be expected to be mobilized. The Government has established a
reconstruction fund, separate from the Central Government budget, which is
expected to attract about US$350 million of foreign grants and loans on
concessionary terms over the next three years. These will assist in covering
the cost of reconstruction of damaged schools, hospitals, local roads and
rural infrastructure. The mining sector can be expected to continue to
attract private foreign investment for its growth and to earn increasing
amounts of foreign exchange for several years to come.  Significant efforts to
restructure the agricultural sector and increase output are expected parti-
cularly through Government encouragement of smallholder production and giving
incentives, initially to maintain and later to increase agricultural output
from the commercial farmers.
17.       However, Zimbabwe faces a formidable array of problems calling
for both immediate and long-term solutions. The immediate problems relate to
rehabilitation and reconstruction. The Government must mobilize substantial
amounts of resources over a very limited period in order to remove critical
bottlenecks in the economy created by the war and the sanctions. In addition
to the proposed rehabilitation of the manufacturing sector (see Section IV),
plans are also underway for the rehabilitation of the transport sector and
massive investments will soon be needed for power generation. The annual cost
of the railway and power investments should about equal total gross fixed
investment in 1979. Therefore, if these and other large capital requirements
are to be met, external assistance of about US$400 million a year for the next
few years will be required.
18.       Unemployment is another critical problem which must be addressed
quickly.  The Government is attempting to deal with this problem through
settlement and resettlement programs and through improving capacity utilization.

Relative to other African countries, Zimbabwe has a reservoir of skilled
manpower. However, in relation to the Zimbabwean economic structure and
degree of sophistication, the country is short of trained manpower; a problem
which has been aggravated by migration following independence. Retention of
existing skilled workers is an important reason for the Government's moderate
and reconciliatory attitude after independence. In addition, serious efforts
are being made to attract some 25,000 educated and skilled Zimbabweans back to
the country.
19.        The most complex problem is going to be restructuring the economy in
a manner which will ensure equitable distribution of income and assets without
jeopardizing growth. This implies integrating the African majority into
Zimbabwe's economic mainstream. Plans are underway for land reform, develop-
ment of smallholder agriculture and establishing smallscale industries to
bring about the gradual redistribution of assets and integration of the
African population. Zimbabwe's longer run political and economic stability
will depend on how fast the Government makes progress in this area.
20.        Zimbabwe emerged from fifteen years of sanctions and the war with
relatively low external indebtedness. In mid-1980, foreign debt totalled
Z$451 million, and the country's gross international reserves equalled about
Z$215 million or three months of estimated 1980 imports of goods. The external
debt figure was the equivalent of US$98 per capita or about 15 percent of
estimated GDP. The debt service ratio, which is expected to be four percent
in 1980, is projected to rise to nine and eight percent in 1981 and 1982
respectively. These external indebtedness figures do not include foreign
exchange obligations resulting from restrictions on the repatriation of
certain monies by private individuals and companies. Although the exact
amount of these is not known, they are not large enough to affect the overall
picture significantly. Consequently, given the low estimated debt service
ratios and the country's potential for growth and expansion, Zimbabwe clearly
is creditworthy for Bank lending. However, given Zimbabwe's massive external
resource requirements for reconstruction and rehabilitation, expected high
interest rates and relatively hard repayment terms, the future debt service
ratio seems certain to rise. Because of these large resource requirements,
Zimbabwe needs to receive at least part of the external assistance required on
concessionary terms.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
21.        Before 1965, the Bank made five loans totalling US$140.3 million,
benefitting Rhodesia -- two directly to the Government for agriculture
(US$5.6 million) and power (US$28 million), and two loans totalling US$87.7
million to the Central African Power Corporation (CAPCO) and a US$19 million
loan to the Rhodesia railways. As a guarantor of each of the loans, the UK
serviced them after 1964. The loans for agriculture and the railways have
been repaid, and CAPCO resumed servicing its two loans, on which US$13.8
million was still outstanding as of June 30, 1980, following the lifting of
sanctions in December 1979.



- 6 -
22.       IFC's first investment in Zimbabwe was approved by the IFC Board
last month. The investment is in the form of a US$38 million loan of which
US$20 million is for IFC's own account, and US$18 million comprises commercial
bank participations in the IFC loan. IFC was also responsible for arranging a
further US$10.3 million of commercial bank financing related to a proposed
loan by the Export-Import Bank of the United States (Eximbank). The invest-
ment, in the Wankie Colliery Company Limited, is to help finance a project to
produce coal for a thermal power station presently under construction as well
as for other customers.
23.       Following Zimbabwe's becoming a member of the Bank Group in September
1980, Bank staff discussed with the Government an initial program of corporation,
including the proposed Manufacturing Rehabilitation Imports Program and an
imports program to rehabilitate the transport sector. The latter, which is
scheduled for Board consideration later in FY81, would comprise (i) spare
parts and track maintenance equipment and tools for the railways; (ii) road
service motor vehicles; and (iii) equipment for the Central Mechanical Equipment
Department (CMED). Work on identifying and preparing projects in agriculture,
rural development, power, transport, manpower development and training and
industrial intermediation also is underway or shortly will be initiated.
PART III - MANUFACTURING SECTOR
24.       Almost 75 percent of Zimbabwe's industries are concentrated in the
metropolitan areas of Salisbury and Bulawayo. The sector, dominated by
external investments from the United Kingdom and South Africa, is relatively
well diversified and sophisticated, producing almost 90 percent of the manu-
factured goods consumed in Zimbabwe. The most important industries are food
processing, metal and metal products, textiles, including cotton ginning,
chemical and petroleum products, drinks, tobacco and transport equipment.
Priority is given to manufacturing for exports, mainly food, beverages,
tobacco, metal and metal products and textiles.
25.       Between 1965, when sanctions forced the country to turn more and
more to local production, and 1974, Zimbabwe's manufacturing industries grew
faster -- more than 4 percent yearly (in real terms) -- than did GDP.
However, as the war intensified and began to take its toll, manufacturing
output fell 13 percent between 1974 and 1978. With the general recovery in
economic growth, the performance of the manufacturing sector also started
improving after the war, expanding nine percent in 1979. However, there still
is substantial idle capacity in the manufacturing sector.
Constraints
26.       Manufacturing output is limited mainly by shortages of foreign
exchange and skilled manpower. While the latter is important in the long
run, the foreign exchange shortage is immediately serious. In 1979 the



foreign exchange allocation to the sector was only about 35 percent of the
1974 level (in real terms). Even in 1979, output and employment failed to
reach their earlier 1974/75 peaks. Zimbabwe's textiles, clothing, furniture,
pharmaceuticals, toilet preparations, iron and steel, non-ferrous metals and
metal products, all have export markets in neighboring African countries
and/or overseas, as well as unsatisfied domestic demand. Adequate foreign
exchange, however, for imported spare parts, raw materials and equipment is
needed to expand production.
27.       The Government, because of the country s unfavorable external
position, has resorted to quantitative restrictions on imports, largely
through foreign exchange controls. As Zimbabwe-s position improves in the
future, however, the Government intends increasingly to substitute tariffs and
other fiscal measures for these quantitative controls in order to reduce the
blanket protection they have afforded local producers. Despite the high
degree of protection, and the current constraints on capacity utilization,
there are clear indications that a number of industries like the textiles and
clothing, iron and steel, etc., are operating efficiently. The indications
include comparison of prices of similar manufactured goods in other countries
which are at about the same level of development, and the fact that there are
significant export orders which have been placed with Zimbabwean firms. Bank
staff have not had the opportunity yet to study the sector in sufficient
detail to be able to make any definitive judgement. In general, however,
overall sector efficiency is bound to improve with increased capacity
utilization as a result of this operation.
Incentives
28.       In addition to tariff protection for manufacturing industries, the
Government provides other investment and export incentives; namely (i) exemp-
tion from double taxation of income; (ii) a 100 percent special initial income
tax allowance for fixed investment in manufacturing; (iii) a 15 percent tax
allowance on fixed investment; and (iv) special depreciation allowances on
fixed assets. The most common export incentive scheme is a bonus payment by
the Ministry of Finance to exporters of manufactured goods (having at least 25
percent local content), equivalent to 5 percent of the foreign exchange
(f.o.b) earned on exports. Refunds of customs duties, which have been paid
on parts and materials used in manufacturing are normally granted on the
export of the finished product. The Ministry of Industry and Engery Develop-
ment also administers several other export incentive schemes, which will be
reviewed by a Bank mission scheduled to visit Zimbabwe in April 1981.
29.       The present tariff structure was not designed to provide comprehen-
sive incentives and to maximize collection of revenue, but was geared towards
meeting war needs. In order to ensure that in future the import licensing
and tariff regimes become more effective instruments in collection of revenues
and allocation of resources, the Association has obtained assurances that the
Government will by March 1, 1983 review the licensing and tariff practices in
accordance with terms of reference agreed between the Association and the
Government, and will furnish to the Association a report on the conclusions
and recommendations arrived at as a result of the review, and will allow
reasonable opportunity to exchange views thereon with the Government prior to
adoption and implementation of the recommendations in the report. (Section



- 8 -
4.02 of the Draft Credit Agreement.) The results of the study will form part
of a continuing dialogue between the Bank and the Government in connection
with future operations.
Supporting Institutions
30.       The Ministry of Industry and Energy Development is responsible for
overall coordination of the Government's activities concerning the manu-
facturing sector.  However, the Ministry of Manpower and Social Affairs,
through Government-sponsored workers committees and labor legislation, also
has an important role, particularly in ensuring an equitable share of income
for workers while fostering harmonious relations between labor and management.
It also enforces occupational safety standards. While labor unions claim a
sizable membership, their influence on matters of wage policy and labor
relations is limited.
31.       As in the case of other private businesses in Zimbabwe, there is
close cooperation between the sector and the Government. The Prime Minister,
for example, periodically meets with the Private Sector Coordinating Committee,
consisting of heads of the Associated Chamber of Commerce, Chamber of Mines,
Commercial Farmers Union, Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries, and Zimbabwe
Tobacco Association, before the Government makes any major policy decisions
affecting the business community.
32.       Zimbabwe has many financial, promotional, and other institutions
supporting manufacturing activities. A full range of commercial banking
facilities are available at most of the branches of the commercial banks.
These facilities are supplemented by four merchant banks which specialize in
providing long-term capital to large business organizations. In addition,
six financial institutions specialize in medium-term finance and leasing
facilities. An Industrial Development Corporation (IDC), established by a
special act of Parliament in 1963, assists the development of industries by
providing finance, and advice on technical, marketing, financial, accounting
and administrative matters and project preparation. In order to support
emerging African businessmen to set up smallscale enterprises and to expand
existing labor intensive industries, two other financial institutions have
recently been set up: the Development Finance Company (DFC), a wholly-owned
subsidiary of IDC, and Funds for Emergent Business Companies (FEBCO) Ltd.,
owned by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe and the four commercial banks in the
country. Two other institutions -- Small Industries Advisory Service (SIAS)
and the Institute of Business Development (IBD) -- have also been operating in
this field for several years. Finally, there is IPCORN Ltd., an independent
and privately owned development finance corporation, which assists industry
and plantation agriculture.
PART IV - THE MANUFACTURING REHABILITATION IMPORTS PROGRAM LOAN AND CREDIT
33.       During the economic review mission which visited Zimbabwe in Sep-
tember 1980, the Government requested the Bank for quick disbursing assis-
tance in order to remove bottlenecks and rehabilitate the manufacturing
sector as quickly as possible, so as to fully use the assets already in



- 9 -
place in the manufacturing sector. Appraisal and post appraisal missions
for the proposed loan and credit visited Zimbabwe during October and November,
1980 respectively. Negotiations were held in Washington on February 3-6, 1981;
the Zimbabwe delegation was led by Mr. J. Gurney, Deputy Secretary to the
Treasury.
34.       Although economic sanctions and the war of independence had little
impact on the overall economic growth until 1975, they, nevertheless, deter-
mined the pattern of resource allocation, as the Government was forced increas-
ingly to put the economy on a war footing. The first priority was to meet the
requirements of the war, and as the war progressed decreasing amounts of
foreign exchange were made available for requirements other than the war
needs.  As a result, many established industries, particularly those manu-
facturing for the domestic market, were not allocated adequate foreign
exchange. In addition, some manufacturing establishments suffered physical
damage as a result of the war and acts of sabotage. Consequently, consider-
able idle capacity built up particularly in such key industries as textiles,
clothing, non-ferrous metals, iron and steel, transport, fertilizers and
automobile assembly, etc. (see Annex V, Table 1). As overall manufactur-
ing output declined, excess domestic demand built up substantially.
35.       Following the cessation of hostilities, the country now is faced
with settling and resettling large numbers of displaced persons and ex-freedom
fighters, rebuilding damaged schools, clinics, water supplies, roads and other
facilities in rural areas and restoring infrastructure, particularly transpor-
tation and power, which has been neglected. The Government, therefore, is
forced to divert a major part of available resources to these urgent needs so
that foreign exchange for the manufacturing sector is grossly inadequate for
it to operate at optimum levels. Additional foreign exchange for imports for
the sector could generate badly needed employment and substantially expand
production of goods in demand for export and domestic consumption.
Resource Requirements
36.       Total foreign exchange requirements for the manufacturing sector
during 1980/81 (commencing October 1, 1980) are estimated at about US$520
million. Of this amount, the Government expects to allocate on a quarterly
basis about US$380 million (73 percent) out of export earnings leaving a
shortfall of US$140 million. The proposed Bank loan and credit of US$65
million would finance about 13 percent of the total foreign exchange require-
ment and 46 percent of the shortfall. The Government and the Bank are actively
seeking finance from other external sources for the balance. Delay in obtain-
ing the balance required would only delay some of the benefits of the operation,
but would not comprobise its integrity.
37.       The import program is designed to expand output of the manufacturing
sector and to sustain the expanded 'Level of production. Zimbabwe's economy
has the potential to recover sufficiently to obviate the need for further
program assistance for importing intermediate goods for the manufacturing
sector. Future imports are expected to be financed from Zimbabwe's own
increased export earnings, and some of the intermediate goods are expected to
be produced domestically.

Allocation of the Manufacturing Imports Program Loan and Credit
38.       Foreign Exchange.  The proposed loan of US$50 million and credit
of US$15 million would help to finance imports of raw materials, spare parts,
balancing equipment and components. Only those goods needed for raising the
utilization of existing manufacturing capacity, and for which the Government
issues licenses would be eligible for Bank/IDA financing. Consumer goods
and capital items would be excluded (see Annex IV). To permit maximum
flexibility in utilizing the loan and credit, no industry by industry alloca-
tion is proposed.
39.       Counterpart Funds.  The Zimbabwe dollar equivalent generated by
the loan and credit would be credited to a special Government account in
the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe to finance development projects in the Central
Government budget. Transfers from the project account would be made by the
Government periodically and reported to the Bank (Section 3.02(a) (iii)
of the Draft Credit Agreement).
Procurement
40.       Procurement by private firms would be according to procedures
satisfactory to the Association. The commercial sector in Zimbabwe is
sufficiently diversified and competitive to ensure efficient procurement.
Procurement by public sector agencies would follow the procurement procedures
of the Central Tender Board. All purchases by Government and public sector
agencies exceeding Z$500 in any single year must be approved by the Central
Tender Board, 'which requires either competitive bidding or submission of more
than two quotations from different suppliers. However, all purchases in
excess of US$4 million would be procured on the basis of procedures which
include broad international tendering. The latter contracts would be subject
to ex post review, that is, a brief report containing evidence that each was
let in a manner satisfactory to the Association, would be submitted prior to
or with withdrawal requests.
41.       In order to expedite early use of the loan and credit proceeds,
existing import licensing and foreign exchange allocation procedures which
were reviewed and found satisfactory, would be used. The Treasury allocates a
global sum of foreign exchange to the Ministry of Industry and Energy Develop-
ment on a quarterly basis. The latter allocates specific amounts for various
end uses and issues import licenses in accordance with the Government's
economic priorities. Within the manufacturing sector, priority has been
assigned to imports for the export subsector. The amount of foreign exchange
allocated to each importer does not exceed three months requirements.
Disbursements
42.       The proposed loan and credit would reimburse the c.i.f. cost of
eligible imports against full documentation, including copies of invoices,
bills of lading and import licenses endorsed by the respective commercial



- ii -
banks as evidence of payment.  (All merchandise imports are paid for through
the commercial banks.) The commercial banks would submit copies of documents
of eligible imports to a special unit to be set up in the Reserve Bank of
Zimbabwe, provided: (i) such goods have been procured in member countries,
Switzerland and Taiwan; (ii) each eligible invoice is of a minimum value
US$5,000 equivalent; (iii) invoices in respect of contracts in excess of
US$4.0 million equivalent have been accompanied by an evaluation report of
bids or quotations received certified by the Ministry of Industry and Energy
Development.
43.       Because of the country's urgent need, it is proposed to permit retro-
active financing of eligible imports paid for on or after a date three months
prior to Board Presentation up to an amount not exceeding US$6.5 million
equivalent or 10 percent of the loan and the credit amount. No reimbursement
would be made for imports for which other sources of financing have been
secured. The exclusion of items costing less than US$5,000 equivalent would
not create any hardship, as these items can be covered by the Government's
resources. Disbursements should be completed within nine months from effec-
tiveness.
Accounts Audit and Evaluation
44.       The project account (para. 39) would be audited by auditors accept-
able to the Bank and to the Association and certified copies of the relevant
financial statements submitted to the Bank and the Association by September 30,
1982. The Borrower will maintain records adequate to monitor project imple-
mentation. Furthermore, not later than six months after completion of the
project, the Government would prepare and furnish to the Bank and Association
a completion report on the costs and benefits resulting from the operation.
Benefits and Risks
45.       The principal benefits of the proposed imports program would be
increased production of manufactured goods, utilizing capacity which other-
wise would be idle, greater exports and more employment. Of the expanded
production, 15 percent is expected to be exports valued at about US$50 mil-
lion per annum. The balance of output mostly would be import substitu-
tion worth about US$300 million in foreign exchange. The increased supply
of manufactured goods for domestic consumption would help materially to
reduce the large amount of unsatisfied domestic demand. Equally important is
the fact that the import program is expected to generate about 8,600 additional
jobs. Finally, the assistance would provide a vehicle for a dialogue on key
policy areas relating to licensing and tariff practices.
46.       Given the Government's ability to administer the program and Zimba-
bwean manufacturers' ability to use it to expand production and employment,
there are no appreciable risks in the program per se. However, present
unsettled conditions in the country obviously are of concern, since they



- 12 -
could result in serious-economic dislocation. Future stability, however, will
depend in good part on how quickly the economy can respond to present demands
for raising output and expanding employment -- two key areas in which the
proposed imports program for the manufacturing sector is designed to make an
important contribution.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
47.       The Draft Loan and Development Credit Agreements between the
Republic of Zimbabwe and the Bank and the Association, the Report of the
Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles of
Agreement of the Bank and the recommendation of the Committee provided for in
Article V, Section l(d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Association are
being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
48.       Special conditions of the project are listed in Section III of
Annex III.
49.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan and credit would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
50.        I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan and credit.

/a   There is no generally agreed upon way of classifying trade data according
to the categories agriculture, mining and manufacturing. As a result,
the composition of exports or imports can differ depending on the classi-
ficaticf used. For instance, if the Government s own trade classification
is used, the composition of exports for 1979 would be agriculture, 19 per-
cent; mining, 34 percent; and manufacturing, 47 percent. On the other
hand, if manufactured goods are defined in terms of SITC codes 5, 6 (less
non-ferrous metals and ferrochrome), 7, and 8, and agricultural produce is
defined in terms of SITC codes 0 and 1, a portion of 2 and 4, then the
composition of exports for 1979 would be agriculture, 39 percent;
mining, 40 percent; and manufacturing, 21 percent.
/b   Defined as edible food and fats plus non-edible agricultural output
such as tobacco, cotton, forestry products, etc.
/c   Defined as crude materials and minerals, gold and processed mining
materials--mainly unfabricated metals. Much of this might, by another
classification, be considered manufacturing output.
