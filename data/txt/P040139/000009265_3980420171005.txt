Block 1: Project Description
1. Project development objectives (see Annex I for key performance indicators):
Specific development objectives of the proposed line of credit are to:
(i) provide stimulus to private sector development through the financing of new investments in private or newly privatized
enterprises in need of fresh capital for expansion or restructuring;
(ii) support the Government's objective of promoting competition in the financial system by helping strengthen the institutional
capacity of participating commercial banks (PCBs); and
(iii) foster the development of a market of medium and long-term financing of investment projects.
Progress in achieving these development objectives will be evaluated on the basis of:
(i) improvements in performance (i.e., sales, employment, profitability) of final beneficiaries. as well as the number of
beneficiaries having continued access to credit after the first generation of loans is due.
(ii) qualitative assessment of improvements in the operational efficiency of PCBs' management.
(iii) increase in the share of long-term loans and lengthening of the average maturity of PCBs' portfolio.

3. Benefits and target population:
The main direct and indirect benefits of the project will be:
(i) funds made available to private sector enterprises in need of capital for expansion or restructuring. Indirectly, this is
expected to enhance the financial condition and/or viability of private sector enterprises;
(ii) enhanced institutional capacity of PCBs which as part of the proposed IRP will adhere to an institutional development plan.
Indirectly, this is expected to bring improvements in the quality of banking services provided to the private sector; and,
(iii) increased availability of long-term financing. Indirectly, it is expected that as PCBs improve their risk management
procedures and gain more expertise in appraising long-term investment projects, they will be able to provide a more
sustainable source of long-term financing for the private sector.
The target population for on-lending of World Bank funds are private or newly privatized enterprises in need of fresh capital for
expansion or restructuring. Disbursements will be channeled through eligible PCBs.

4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
Implementation period: 4 years, FY1998-FY2001
Executing agencies: Four PCBs, three private (Varazdinska Banka dd. Varazdin: Dalmatinska Banka dd. Zadar: Ale Jadran
Banka dd. Split) and one undergoing privatization (Slavonska Banka dd. Osijek), have been selected to
implement the proposed IRP. Each PCB will assign one member of its Management Board as a counterpart
for the project. In addition, each bank will assign a Project Implementation Team (PIT) constituted of at
least one senior manager (project coordinator) and two staff members. The PIT will be primarily responsible
for the overall technical and managerial implementation of the project. Each borrower's project
implementation plan (see project files, Annex 8) details specific responsibilities for implementation.
Project oordination: Ministry of Finance (Mofi: The MoF has nominated a project coordinator in order to oversee the overall
coordination and consistency of implementation across PCBs.
Project oversight (policy guidance, etc.): MoF's project coordinator.

Accounting, financial reporting and auditing arrangements: PCBs' PIT will prepare the necessary documentation prior to
supervision of the project; Prior to effectiveness, PCBs' PIT will appoint external auditors to audit the
project accounts on an annual basis. External auditors will be primarily responsible for expressing an
opinion of compliance with the financial covenants under the PCBs' respective loan agreements.
Monitoring and evaluation arrangements: World Bank supervision missions, MoF's project coordinator, PCBs' PIT semi-
annual progress reports. National Bank of Croatia (NBC) on-site and off-site inspection of PCBs.
Block 2: Project Rationale
5. CAS objective(s) supported by the project:      Document number and date of latest CAS discussion: 14088-HR, April 4, 1995
The project addresses one of the main areas cited by the CAS, encouraging private sector-led growth, by providing financial
assistance to emerging and newly privatized private sector enterprises; and by supporting the institutional development of eligible
PCBs. The support to the PCBs, in turn, will help advance the Government's agenda of financial sector reform aimed at
encouraging competition and a more efficient allocation of resources by the banking system.

6. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
Private sector development:
At independence (1991), Croatia inherited the different types of enterprises of the former Yugoslav system: small private enterprises,
cooperatives, and mostly Socially-owned Enterprises (SOEs) - a form of ownership in which the State and the employees held
together not very well defined ownership rights. Early efforts to promote private sector development started in April 1991 when the
Law on Transformation of SOEs, covering some 2,800 SOEs in all sectors of the economy, was adopted. The law transformed
enterprises into joint stock companies subject to the commercial code and transferred their shares to private owners through a variety
of methods. A small number of large strategic enterprises (oil conglomerate and public utilities) followed a separate track by which
most of their share capital remained owned by the State, and ad-hoc plans for restructuring and/or privatization were initiated.
The privatization program and the impressive development of new private enterprises in the last few years have dramatically
changed the enterprise sector. New private and privatized enterprises currently account for almost the entire number of enterprises
registered in Croatia, although due to the large size of the large public enterprises undergoing restructuring and privatization (see
Enterprise andfinancial sector reform section below), private enterprises account for 71% of employment and 74% of revenues
(from 2% and 4%, respectively, in 1990). Private enterprises represent only 64% of total equity however, as the majority are small
and medium size enterprises (SMEs). The remaining SOEs are generally large, including those considered of strategic importance,
and are therefore more difficult to privatize. The progress of privatization to date varies substantially by sector, with a higher degree
of privatization in sectors like trade, construction and tourism. Industry is notoriously lagging behind. The emphasis on the
acquisition of enterprises by employees created a well diversified ownership base (640,000 small shareholders, 14% of the
population). Yet, acquisition of shares by employees reinforced the perception of future guaranteed employment in their firms.
Managers often encouraged their employees to subscribe shares and subsequently convinced many of them to assign their voting
rights to management. Little consolidation of ownership has occurred. Trading of shares on the secondary market has been limited
mainly due to inadequate market infrastructure, ownership title and pricing deficiencies, the overhang of payment obligations (and
confused perceptions) on subscribed but not fully paid shares, and even expectations of a new privatization law. As a result, despite
the noticeable increase in private participation, ownership in former SOEs remains heterogeneous and disperse, and has generally
not been conducive to improving enterprise governance. The lack of a broad population education campaign on shareholders' rights
at the inception of privatization has also had a long lasting negative effect on enterprise governance - small shareholders generally
misunderstanding or underestimating their rights.
Government efforts to support the private sector continue to show a strong commitment to develop further the enabling business and
legal environment under which private enterprises and investors operate. Ongoing plans aim primarily at the completion of the
divestiture of the State's portfolio through a more forceful search for strategic investors (including DFI) and a voucher privatization
program with the participation of investment funds. Other measures include: (i) improvements in the privatization processes
brought about by the new March 1996 Privatization Law (realistic "market" pricing of shares, clarification of rights of subscribed
but not fully paid shares, clear rules on deferred payment contracts for shares); (ii) development of the capital markets infrastructure
supported by the Bank's Capital Markets Development Project (Ln. No. 3999-HR, see section No. 9) and enactment of the Securities
and Investment Funds laws at end-1995; (iii) public education campaign on shareholding and voucher privatization, and
development of small shareholder associations; and (iv) splitting large holding companies into smaller enterprises that can be more
easily acquired by outside investors.

The institutional support for private sector development is still somewhat limited given the changes in the market economy -
particularly for SMEs. The only two formal organizations are the long established Croatian Chamber of Economy (CCE) and the
Chamber of Artisans, successors to the respective Chambers under the Yugoslav system. Membership in these chambers is
compulsory for all companies and registered economic units regardless of their ownership structure. The CCE covers a broad range
of sectors (including industry, trade, tourism, banking, etc.) and has a wide regional network of county chambers plus sectoral
associations. It is becoming more independent vis-a-vis the Government and plays an important advocacy and information role for
enterprises. However, a major effort is needed for development of the SMEs. The Ministry of Economy and the CCE, with help of
foreign SME support, research institutions, and the Bank (see section No. 9), have recently started to elaborate a strategy for SME
development. The objective is to propose and implement a support program for SMEs and the artisanal sector, proposing policy
guidelines and ad hoc legal measures, training (particularly at the local level), information and technological development, and
support infrastructure (including business centers, advisory services, technological parks and incubators). The rapid development of
SMEs will be essential in providing permanent employment to the thousands of demobilized soldiers, once temporary job
opportunities due to the reconstruction efforts are reduced as reconstruction comes to an end.
The legislative framework: In parallel with the rapid growth of the private sector, Croatia has made notable strides in adopting a
new legal and regulatory framework appropriate for a market economy and closely compatible with the legislation of EU countries.
The most significant legislation enacted since 1991 in addition to the Privatization Law and Securities Law includes: (i) the Law on
Companies (1995), drawing primarily on German Law, (ii) the Law on Obligations (1991) - based on the former Yugoslav law and
subsequently amended; (iii) the Law on Labour (1995), which permits collective bargaining agreements; (iv) the Law of Accounting
(1992) - making use of International Accounting Standards (IAS) guidelines mandatory, and the Law on Audits (1992) - requiring
independent audits for large and medium companies (1993); (v) the Law on Protection of Market Competition (anti-trust law, 1995);
and (vi) the Law on Bankruptcy (January 1997). Further legislative developments are under way. The law on VAT was passed in
1995 and is expected to apply from January 1998. Draft legislation is being prepared in relation to real property ownership,
compensation of former owners of nationalized property, foreign credit relationships, and court enforcement procedure. Overall, the
process of continuous development of the legal system has left many companies and small entrepreneurs in a state of confusion,
aggravated by the insufficient strengthening of the judicial system that is needed in a full-fledged market economy. A glaring
illustration of the problem were the major bottlenecks in the commercial courts in 1995, when thousands of companies were queuing
up to re-register in accordance with the new company law. A comprehensive development program (more ambitious than current
efforts) of the judiciary system is needed, coupled with an intensive education campaign for entrepreneurs and company managers
on the new legal and regulatory framework.
Enterprise and financial sector reform:
Before 1993, bank intermediation suffered from prolonged periods of near-hyperinflation and from years of misallocation of funds to
loss-making State owned enterprises. A few State banks dominated the system accounting for some 60% of the deposits and 66% of
the assets of the system. A large portion of non-performing assets precluded banks from reallocating their resources to more
productive uses, creating a credit squeeze for sounder private or newly privatized enterprises. In addition to the prevailing structure
of the banking sector, the poor financial standing of a number of large State banks and memories of the highly inflationary
environment resulted in high real interest rates. To a large extent, prevailing conditions in the banking system have burdened
borrowers, discouraged investment activity, and blocked the development of instruments for medium and long-term financial
intermediation. The latter has perhaps represented the single most compelling constraint to the establishment of a conducive
investment environment and to the development of the private sector.
In late 1993, the Government initiated the design and implementation of a reform program to address the microeconomic causes of
the problems in the enterprise and financial sectors. This program, prepared with Bank assistance and supported by the recently
approved EFSAL (Ln. No. 4159-HR), emphasizes three main areas of reform: (i) restructuring and privatization of public
enterprises; (ii) completion of the privatization of former socially-owned enterprises; and (iii) rehabilitation and privatization of
ailing State banks. At the moment, important elements of this strategy are being implemented, and substantial progress has already
been achieved. The Government has begun to reorganize and restructure some of the largest public enterprises (i.e., INA, HEP,
HPT) it has implemented important changes to the operational and legislative framework under which they operate, and it has
started to privatize part of their assets. A comprehensive set of actions is being adopted to provide new momentum to the
privatization process. This includes the development of new (and the improvement of existing) privatization methods and
supporting legislation (including a voucher privatization program), as well as key changes in the institutional framework (i.e., the
creation of a new full-fledged Ministry of Privatization and the transformation of the current structure of the Croatian Privatization
Fund). Finally, with respect to the rehabilitation of the State troubled banks, the Government has established the basic legislative
and institutional framework under which ailing State banks have already been brought under rehabilitation and are being closely
monitored by the Bank Rehabilitation Agency. Ultimately, the goal will be to put these banks under a sound set of incentives, so

that they can be incorporated into the ongoing privatization strategy.
Early gains from the initiatives taken in enterprise and financial sector reform are starting to emerge. Competition in the banking
system has increased - private banks currently account for some 55% of the deposits and 45% of the assets of the system, and a few
foreign banks have already opened (or are about to open) branch offices in Croatia. In addition, interest rates which were constantly
under pressure in the interbank market, in part due to the illiquidity of some of the ailing State owned banks, have declined
substantially since the rehabilitation of some of the State banks began.
Investment and financing reauirements:
After 1990, investment in Croatia declined dramatically in all sectors to levels averaging for 1992-94 only 20-25% of former
investment levels. Despite a slight revival in 1994, investment stagnated in all sectors, particularly in industry. With this situation,
the enterprise sector remained technologically outdated and generally unable to maintain its existing production capacity, as a
sizable amount of expected replacement and normal upgrading of equipment was not carried out at adequate levels. Though reliable
figures at aggregate levels are not available, a survey of some 50 enterprises made during project preparation (see project files,
Annex 8) revealed that over the 1993-95 period, the SMEs surveyed invested an annual average of DEM 6.7 million, mostly in
equipment. Financing came mainly from internal resources, with only about one-third from credits (largely short term). About one-
third of the investments were for replacement or reconstruction, and about two-thirds for additional capacity, illustrating the fact that
these firms could be considered to be in the most dynamic segment of the SME population. For the years 1996-97, enterprises
surveyed indicated that they had plans to invest at least three times more and that they planned to rely significantly more on credits.
In the course of the ongoing restructuring and changing conditions affecting most of the Croatian economy, it is evident that a
number of enterprises have little viability, while others are unlikely to have investment plans that could qualify for bank financing.
Assuming that only about one-fourth of the SME population would have investment projects that might attract bank financing, at
levels comparable to those of the surveyed enterprises, total investments likely to attract financing would be in the range of DEM 2
to 5 billion per annum (based on investment levels comparable to surveyed SMEs, realized or expected, respectively). This
corresponds to a demand for credit, assuming 40% of total financing needs, of DEM 0.8 to 2 billion per annum. By comparison, a
survey of five banks also made during project preparation (representing some 8% of the Croatian banking sector), indicated that they
expected a demand for investment credits of some DEM 500 million per year for 1996-97. On a proportional basis, the investment
credit demand from enterprises for the whole banking sector would therefore be on the order of DEM 6.5 billion. Aggregate
estimates from national account statistics, assuming an investment level of 16% of GDP, indicate a total investment in the range of
DEM 4 billion. Though none of these estimates can be considered accurate, they certainly reflect a sizable difference between the
desired or estimated demand for investment credit, and the small portion of the total credit (5-7%/6) that is currently considered to be
for long-term investment purposes. Confidence in the banking system, and particularly in private banks, has slowly started to build-
up during the last two years, yet the capacity of commercial banks to mobilize medium to long-term deposits is still limited, thus
hampering their ability to fulfill their role in term transformation and efficient allocation of credit.
7. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
.......................................................... ........................................   .......................................................................................................................................................
Private sector development:
The project will address issues related to the Government's agenda for private sector development, not only by increasing the supply
of long-term funds in the credit market that ultimately will be on-lent to newly emerging or privatized enterprises, but by fostering
the institutional development of eligible PCBs. To this effect, three of the four selected PCBs (Dalmatinska Banka, Zadar,
Varazdinska Banka, Varazdin, and Alpe Jadran Banka, Split) which are among the best private banks in Croatia, are expected to
further develop the necessary risk management skills that will allow them to better serve emerging SMEs in their respective regions.
The other selected PCB, Slavonska Banka, Osijek, which is about to successfully complete its privatization, will also be expected to
implement an aggressive institutional development plan.
Financial sector reform:
The main goal of the Government's program of financial sector reform is to create an environment that will enable increased
competition, and a market mechanism of resource mobilization and allocation of credit. The proposed IRP will address this issue by
helping to improve the institutional capacity of eligible PCBs, which in turn, are expected to become better competitors, more
capable of fulfilling their role in funds term transformation and assessment of long-term investment projects. A strategic choice was
made by selecting among the best private (or undergoing privatization) commercial banks in the banking system (with a branch
network capable of serving practically all regions) which are expected to strengthen their leadership position in the financial system,
improve their risk management capacity, and make an efficient allocation of funds among some of the best investment projects in
the country.

Investment and financing requirements:
The project is expected to help foster the development of instruments of long-term financial intermediation, which, in turn,
accompanied by PCBs' strengthened risk based management procedures, could help foster the recovery of confidence in the financial
system and lead to a self-sustained generation of credit for long-term investment financing.
8. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
Institutional/financial arrangements:
At an early stage of preparation, the Bank explored the possibility of having an apex institution (presumably located at the Ministry
of Finance) as the executing agency for the project. The apex institution would have had responsibility for overall coordination and
implementation of the project, as well as on-lending funds to PCBs. This option was discussed with several Government officials
and considered inadequate mainly due to the bureaucratic procedures that it would have entailed, and the lack of institutional
capacity in the Government to handle implementation of the line of credit. Direct lending gives the Bank a better opportunity to
have a closer relationship with PCBs and, deal directly with, and assist them on, their institutional development issues.
Proiect beneficiaries (targeted population by regions, sectors, or size of borrower):
All options for targeted populations (except those sectors excluded for environmental considerations) were discarded in order to
maximize flexibility and efficiency in the implementation of the project.
Alternative on-lending terms:
At an early stage of project preparation PCBs were surveyed regarding appropriate on-lending terms to final beneficiaries. Views
elicited were relatively consistent among PCBs and are reflected in the proposed terms (see section No. 14, Financial Assessment).
Pricing of on-lending funds:
During early project preparation, the MoF raised some concerns regarding the level of commercial banks' long-term real lending
interest rates (16% p.a. on average DEM linked interest rates, by end-1995). In order to address this concern, and in an attempt to
remain within a framework of market determined interest rates, it was agreed that the MoF would organize a one-time bid for the
use of World Bank resources among proposed PCBs. This scheme was expected to favor those PCBs able to provide the most
favorable on-lending terms to their prime customers. PCBs would bid for the amount of funds they intended to lend and for the on-
lending rates they would charge to different risk categories of customers. In order to link the suggested bidding mechanism to the
variable market conditions in the credit market, bids could be expressed as a function of the prevailing long-term market average
interest rate, and accordingly, applied during implementation of the project. It was expected that this market mechanism would not
only reinforce a price discovery feature in the long-term credit market, but also that it would encourage participating banks to
carefully evaluate their proposed projects, leading them to introduce a system of credit risk differentiation with respect to the
treatment of their prime customers.
At present, the average long-term DEM linked interest rate has decreased to an average of about 11% p.a., therefore alleviating
concerns about excessively high interest rates in the market. Given the declining trend in long-term interest rates, the Government
agreed to simplify further the proposed pricing mechanism. The latest version of the project implementation plan, discussed with
the MoF and all PCBs, includes the provision that PCBs be allowed to on-lend at prevailing long-term market rates, as long as
interest charges are free of all other fees, commissions, and other non-interest charges.

10. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
Previous line of credit operations in reforming economies in the region suggest that financial intermediary operations perform better
when the design is simple, the objectives are limited and clearly defined, the project is not sector specific, and the focus is on the
selection of competent financial intermediaries. In addition, the proposed pricing mechanism is intended to be flexible enough to
handle possible variations in market conditions, and therefore, it is expected to remain competitive throughout project
implementation, a problem that hampered the well functioning of some previous operations in the region (see also Section 21).

11. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
By the Government: (i) Council of Ministers' approval to issue a Government guarantee in favor of PCBs; (ii) substantial
cooperation at every step of project preparation, primarily, at the time of the preparation of the project implementation
plan by providing useful comments and suggestions on the early drafts.
By PCBs: (i) substantial cooperation with World Bank staff in the preparation of their respective assessment reports, including a
request to their external auditors to assess their compliance with the conclusions and recommendations expressed therein;
(ii) development, jointly with World Bank staff, of institutional development plans; (iii) commitment to adhere to the
basic principles proposed in the institutional development plans (see section No. 16, Institutional Assessment); (iv) letters
sent by all PCBs to the MoF expressing their intention to participate in the project, and (v) PCBs' expressed desire for
substantially more funds than the amounts proposed by the MoF.

Process of selection of PCBs:
The initial selection of PCBs targeted about a dozen banks suggested by the MoF that complied with the following criteria: (i) they
were already private or undertaking some form of privatization strategy; (ii) they had not registered losses during 1993-1994; and
(iii) they had at least one year of internationally audited financial statements. Overall, these criteria were considered appropriate to
narrow the universe of possible PCBs that made feasible to launch the selection process. The final selection was based on the
candidate PCBs' responsiveness to the proposed IRP, and primarily on subsequent financial and institutional assessments. At a later
stage of the selection process, the Government suggested the inclusion of Slavonska Banka, Osijek, as a way to adequately serve
SMEs' needs and support Government's efforts in the Slavonia region. Furthermore, it was agreed that Bank's assistance could be
requested to complete the privatization process of this institution (currently being sponsored by the EBRD). An assessment of
Slavonska Banka, and the development of a proposed institutional development plan, were subsequently successfully completed.
Framework used to establish criteria for selecting PCBs: A series of questions and schedules were designed to enable an assessment
of PCBs' corporate governance and financial risk management. This model allowed an evaluation of PCBs in terms of the
traditional CAMEL-ratings method (see acronym initials in parenthesis below), although it was designed to go beyond the rather
limited review of this methodology.



Project Appraisal Document                                                                                          Page 8

The framework emphasized the following areas:
*   corporate governance (M) - an evaluation of the roles played by the:
shareholders
supervisory board
management board
internal audit function
external auditors
* financial risk management - an unbundling of the risk management process under the following headings:
the structure of the balance sheet and changes therein, over time
profitability (E)
capital adequacy (C)
credit risk management (A)
liquidity risk management (L)
currency risk management
market / price risk management
interest rate risk management
In addition, the criteria used in the selection of proposed PCBs also emphasized the assessment of qualitative aspects (available in
the project files - see Annex 8). Factors driving the final selection included a qualitative evaluation of the bank's management and
management processes, an evaluation of existing risk management techniques and its appropriateness to the bank's current market
and market position (size), and the willingness and readiness of banks to implement an institutional development plan which will
address each bank's most critical risk management development needs.
Based on the above framework, four commercial banks were selected (see Annex 5), which are among the best private banks (or
undergoing privatization) in Croatia and are capable of serving final borrowers in all regions of the country. These banks have
demonstrated that they have adequate management and risk management processes for their current level of operations, a
satisfactory level of capitalization, and a sustained level of profitability. Nevertheless, the proposed framework for institutional
development (see Section 16, Institutional Assessment) is designed to address areas needing strengthening identified during the
appraisal of the proposed banks.
On-lending terms: (see Annex 2 - Detailed Project Description)
Four single-currency loans will be made to the participating commercial banks. The MoF has agreed to issue a guarantee (priced at
0.5% of the loan amount) in favor of participating banks. Banks will charge a premium over their cost of funds to the final
borrowers; the size of this premium will be based on the borrower's credit risk which will depend, among other factors, on the
quality of the project, collateral arrangements, and client credit history (see below). Loans to final borrowers may be either in
foreign currency or in local currency, with the final borrower assuming the foreign exchange risk. Sub-loan maturities will be no
less than two years, with grace periods up to a maximum of two years for principal repayment of up to one-third of the maturity of
the sub-loan. The sub-loans may be used to finance capital investments and may include a component of associated working capital.
Individual sub-loans to a single borrower will be no greater than 10% of the total individual PCB loan amount.

a. Executing agencies:
PCBs' proposed framework for institutional development:
This framework is the basis for the preparation of an institutional development plan that was developed to address the main
issues and concerns identified during the review of PCBs. What follows is a basic conceptual framework that to a large extent
has been translated into specific actions and management decisions that have been jointly developed and agreed between the
World Bank and the management of each PCB during appraisal and negotiations. This framework was designed to ensure that
the recommendations of the assessment of each PCB form part of a long-term strategy, which will ensure that institutional

changes and operational improvements are properly sequenced and become an integral part of the way in which the corporate
governance of the PCBs is exercised.
The proposed framework is based on the following principles:
. senior management and the management board must receive and require risk-based management information on a regular
basis, and must use that information to ensure that procedures are in place to safeguard assets (including the loan portfolio) and
deposits, as well as to ensure the integrity of the information they receive.
. risk management systems and procedures must be designed to support the information needs of management, to ensure that
the desire for proper risk management drives all systems development.
. the internal audit function must be adequately developed to ensure compliance with risk management policies established by
the management and/or supervisory board, both of which must liaise directly and on a regular basis with the internal auditor.
. Development of human resources must complement the risk focus of PCBs to ensure that the qualified staff is retained,
recruited, and trained, to enable compliance and maintenance of the risk management procedures established.
b. Project management:
Each PCB will assign one member of its Senior Management as an overall counterpart for the project. In addition, each PCB
has established a Project Implementation Team comprising of at least one senior manager and two staff members. The PIT will
be primarily responsible for the administrative aspects of project implementation. PCBs' Project Implementation Plan
(available in the project files, see Annex 8) details specific responsibilities for project management.

The proposed project was assessed for its environmental impact and classified as a "B" project, since on-lending activities will
ultimately support enterprise restructuring and expansion. An environmental assessment will not be required, but assurances were
obtained from PCBs that they will follow sound environmental guidelines when evaluating loan applications from final borrowers.
An integral part of the Project Implementation Plans deals with the implementation of adequate environmental guidelines provided
by the World Bank to all participating banks. (See project files: Environmental Review Procedures, Operational Manual).

20. Sustainability:
The project supports the development of an institutional framework for PCBs that will help in strengthening their capacity to
improve permanently their risk-based management processes. Over time, the PCBs' improved risk management capacity should
contribute to the development of the commercial banks' long-term loan/debt market.

bring a major increase in the level of interest rates. In this event, we expect that the proposed pricing mechanism for on-lending
funds will be flexible enough to accommodate changing market conditions. The emphasis on the selection of PCBs and their
institutional development will assure that an efficient and competitive allocation of funds is maintained.
Block 4: Main Loan Conditions
23. Effectiveness Conditions
The following conditions were discussed with all PCBs during appraisal and agreed during negotiations:
*  Agreement with PCBs on key elements of their institutional development plan, including a timetable and resources required for
its implementation, to be adopted before effectiveness.
*  Agreement with PCBs on the specific arrangements, including hiring specialists, to be taken as part of the implementation of the
institutional development plan.
*  In the case PCBs undergoing privatization, appointment of a privatization advisor with qualifications and terms of reference
satisfactory to the Bank.

Annex 2
Detailed Project Description
Total Loan Amount - DEM 52 million (US$30 million equivalent)
Line of credit to participating commercial banks (PCBs) to be on-lent to private sector enterprises.
LIBOR-based single-currency loans in Deutsche Marks, disbursed directly to PCBs.
MoF guarantee fee = 0.5% of the loan amount of each PCB.
The allocation of the Loan will be as follows: Varazdinska Banka (DEM 13.9 million), Dalmatinska Banka (DEM 15.6
million), Alpe Jadran Banka (DEM 5.2 million), Slavonska Banka (DEM 17.3 million).
Sub-loans. Sub-loan maturities will be no less than 2 years, including a grace period of no more fian two years for
principal repayment of up to 1/3 of the maturity of the sub-loan. The sub-loans may be used to finance capital investments
and may include up to a 20% component of associated working capital. Total amount of all sub-loans to a single borrower
may be no greater than 10% of the total individual PCB loan amount. All sub-loans will be made at market interest rates in
DEM or in local currency indexed to DEM2. The sub-borrowers will assume the foreign exchange risk. Sub-loans will be
made available on a first-come, first-served basis, without prior allocation to specific types of activity or categories of
enterprises.
Eligible Enterprises. Any enterprise duly established under the laws of Croatia, with at least 51% private shareholding
(controlling share), will be eligible to seek financing under the Loan. PCBs will undertake normal financial investigations
as part of their credit analysis of potential sub-borrowers.
Sub-loans may finance up to 80% of an expansion/modernization project in the case of an existing enterprise, or up to 50%
of total investment in the case of a new enterprise. To meet more immediate needs, loans may be made in connection with
the commencement of operations or an increase in working capital for the expansion of operations.
For all sub-loans equal or greater than 5% of the total individual PCB loan amount: (i) during the term of the sub-loan, the
enterprise's debt:equity ratio should not exceed 60:403, and the debt service coverage ratio4 should not fall below 1.5:1; and
(ii) the proposed investment must have a financial rate of return of at least 12%. For sub-loans smaller than 5% of the total
individual PCB loan amount, the PCB will utilize its own criteria to assess the viability and financial soundness of the
investment and the sub-borrower's capacity to service the debt. PCBs will be required to include in their credit appraisal a
demonstration that the currency and terms selected for the sub-loans are appropriate, given the projected foreign exchange
revenues of the sub-borrowers.
Prior review. Prior review by the World Bank of sub-loan appraisal and approval documentation by each PCB will be
required for: (i) the first sub-loan irrespective of its size; (ii) the first three sub-loans equal or greater than 5% of the total
individual PCB loan amount; and (iii) all sub-loans equal or greater than 10% of the total individual PCB loan amount.
2 For this effect, and as agreed during negotiations, it is proposed that the average long-term foreign currency indexed interest rate be
used as a reference rate for on-lending activities of PCBs. This rate is being published monthly in the NBC bulletin, and at the moment
is in the range of 11-12%. Interest charges to eligible enterprises should be free of additional fees, commissions, compensatory balances,
and any other direct or indirect non-interest charges.
3 Defined as long-term debt divided by total equity
4 Defined as the sum of net income after taxes, interest expense and depreciation, divided by the sum of interest expense and principal
amortization.

Note: This table shows the funds provided by the line of credit. A calculation of the estimated local costs was
considered inappropriate given the lack of information at this stage. During implementation, PCBs will ensure that sub-
loan applications include the details of local costs along with a financing plan.

Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
Procurement
Procurement methods and prior review thresholds (Tables A and B not applicable)
Procurement documentation for bid packages with an estimated value of DEM 2 million or greater will be subject
to the Bank's prior review. This applies to Bank-financed works, goods and services procured using Bank Guidelines under
International Competitive Bidding (ICB), Limited International Bidding (LEB) and Direct Contracting. For International
Competitive Bidding (ICB) Bank standard bidding documents wiU be used.
For bid packages estimated at less than DEM 2 million per account, the beneficiaries will use their established
Commercial Practices which have been reviewed by the Bank and found acceptable. These involve competitive quotations
obtained internationally. The use of Commercial Practices is justifiable because the proceeds of the loan will be used only
by privately owned enterprises (51% of ownership in private hands) which carry out their domestic and foreign purchases
based on competitive prices. Certain equipment, components, parts and materials are available locally on a competitive
basis. Goods and technical licenses which the Bank agrees are of proprietary nature, or the quick purchase of which is
critical for efficient project execution, or need to be compatible with other installed equipment will be procured through
Direct Contracting. For equipment and materials which are available only from a limited number of suppliers, LIB
procedures wiUl be followed. Selective post reviews for procurement valued at DEM 2 million or less will be carried out as a
regular supervision activity.
Given the nature of the project, involving support to sub-projects which have not been pre-appraised, detailed
estimates for the breakdown of Project Costs by Procurement Arrangements and Prior Review Thresholds (Tables A and B)
are not available.
Disbursement
Allocation of loan proceeds (Table C)
Proceeds of the proposed loan will cover 100% of sub-loans for goods, works, and related services.
Use of statements of expenditures (SOEs):
Disbursements for contracts valued at less than DEM 2 million equivalent will be on the basis of statements of
expenditure (SOEs). The documentation to support these expenditures will be retained by the PCBs' project
implementation team, audited by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank, and made available for review by Bank staff
upon request. Applications for withdrawals against contracts valued at more than DEM 2 million equivalent will be fully
documented.
Special account:
A special account may be established by each participating bank with a total authorized allocation of up to 10% of
the loan amount.
