MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF LATVIA
FOR A MUNICIPAL SERVICES DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.           I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed loan to the Republic of Latvia for the equivalent of US$27.3 million to help finance a
project for the rehabilitation of municipal services. Assistance would be provided for Riga urban
transport, Daugavpils water and wastewater treatment and a special pilot Municipal Development
Fund. The loan would be at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, with a maturity of seventeen
years, including four years of grace. The proceeds of the loan would be onlent to Riga City, the
Daugavpils Municipal Enterprise Udensvads and beneficiaries of the Municipal Development Fund for
seventeen years including four years of grace with interest at the Bank's standard variable rate plus a
mark-up of no more than thirty percent of the Bank interest rate. Co-financing in the amount of
US$11.0 million would be provided for the Daugavpils Water and Wastewater component of the
project by the Nordic Environment Finance Corporation, the Government of Sweden, the Government
of Denmark, the Government of Finland and EU PHARE.
2.           Country/Sector Background. Since the restoration of Latvian independence in 1991,
the country has undertaken a program of political and economic reforms aimed at achieving a
transformation to a market economy. A formal macroeconomic stabilization program was launched in
July 1992, supported by an IMF standby arrangement. A transitional currency, the Latvian ruble,
was introduced in 1992 and was replaced by the permanent currency, the Lats, in May 1993. The
Government has been successful in containing monetary expansion and fiscal deficits, though the
Government has recently been faced with an unanticipated revenue shortfall for 1995. Initial
inflation has been brought under control, falling from over 900 percent in 1992 to 36 percent in 1994.
It is projected to decline to approximately 25 percent for 1995. The sharp decline in GDP which
occurred during the initial adjustment period has been arrested and initial indicators show positive
growth in 1995.
3.           Structural adjustment in key areas has progressed significantly: (i) most prices have
been liberalized; (ii) an open trade regime has been introduced and privatization of small business,
agricultural land and banking institutions is well advanced and housing privatization has recently
commenced; and (iii) the Government is reforming the social safety net through better means-testing
to target benefits to low-income groups. Banking and industrial sector reforms, however, have been
slower than initially anticipated. A banking crisis has emerged over the spring of 1995 and will pose
additional demands on Government resources to fund planned partial compensation of depositors.
National elections took place in early October 1995. Since no party won a commanding lead, another
coalition government will be created. While the implications for the continuation of the economic
reform process are not yet clear, there are good indications that major political parties are committed
to the reform.
4.           The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) was discussed by the Board in September
1994. The World Bank's overall objective in Latvia has been shifting from supporting economic
stabilization and early structural policy measures to deepening structural reforms and promoting
private and public sector investments. In doing so, the Bank will also support decentralization efforts
made by the government, in particular, in delegating authority to municipalities in administrative and
financial decision making. The focus of the Bank's strategy is to: (i) enhance private sector
development; (ii) improve public infrastructure services and energy conservation; (iii) strengthen the
social safety net and improve social services; and (iv) address pressing environment concerns.



- 2 -
Investmiients in municipal infrastructure and environment have been identified as a priority in the
Public Investment Program (1995-1997) of the Government; they are also in line with the CAS
objectives and will be supported by the project.
5.            Although basic coverage by municipal services is relatively high, substantial
investment is required for rehabilitation and improvement of existing facilities, many of which are in
extremely poor condition given the lack of maintenance and investment in the adjustment period
following re-independence and given the already poor state of much plant and equipment. Urban
transport systems are operating above capacity given low vehicle availability, aging fleets and lack of
spares and new replacement vehicles. Municipal dump sites are nearing capacity and continued
operations pose a threat to groundwater supplies in many areas. Water quality is poor, distribution
systems inefficient and wastewater treatment limited. District heating systems are inefficient, which
leads to higher costs and increased burden on local inhabitants. Roads are in poor condition and
continue to deteriorate.
6.            Reform of the sector has progressed rapidly. Municipal enterprises have been
transforned into independent legal entities with budgetary autonomy. User charges are determined by
the municipality according to legal guidelines established by the national government. There has been
substantial movement towards cost recovery in all municipal services, and subsidies from both
national and local governments have been largely eliminated. Some privatization of municipal
services has already occurred, particularly in the area of solid waste collection. Reforms in
intergovernmental fiscal relations have provided local governments with the clear expenditure and
revenue assignment necessary for planning and capital budgeting and for borrowing and issuance of
guarantees needed for investment in municipal infrastructure.
7.            Project Objectives. The project aims to support the extensive decentralization and
intergovernmental fiscal reforms already instituted by the government by providing access to
investment financing and technical assistance needed for rehabilitation and improved management of
municipal services. The project's specific objectives are to: (i) improve efficiency and quality of
public transport services in Riga, improve the financial condition and promote further corporatization
of the three Riga public transport companies; (ii) improve the quality of drinking water in Daugavpils,
reduce discharge of untreated and partially treated wastewaters to the Daugava River and Baltic Sea,
improve the financial management and promote further corporatization of the Daugavpils water
utility; and (iii) pursue similar objectives in other communities through financing of the Municipal
Development Fund.
8.            Project Description. The project consists of three components: (i) rehabilitation of
the Riga urban transport system; (ii) rehabilitation of the Daugavpils water and wastewater treatment
plants; and (iii) a pilot Municipal Development Fund. These components were identified in
coordination with the local authorities. A brief description and the estimated costs of each are as
follows:
(i)    Riga Urban Transport (US$18.7 million). The quality of public transport services has
declined throughout Latvia but has been a much more serious problem for Riga which
is Latvia's only major city. This component provides investment financing for the
purchase of new buses and trolleybuses, provision of priority spares, purchase of
maintenance equipment, construction of a new workshop and technical assistance for
the implementation of agreed policy reforms. Investment is intended to arrest the
decline of public transport services, reduce operating costs and support corporatization



- 3 -
of public transport enterprises. These funds will be onlent to the municipality on
behalf of the transport companies.
(ii)    Daugavpils Water and Wastewater (US$22.2 nmillion).  Daugavpils has been identified
as one of the "hotspots" under the Baltic Sea Program and upgrading of the
wastewater treatment plant can be expected to have a strong positive environmental
impact on the River Daugava, Riga Bay and the Baltic Sea. Drinking water is of poor
quality and vulnerable to industrial pollution as Daugavpils draws the majority of its
drinking water supply from the River Daugava. This component will support the
upgrading of wastewater treatment facilities, construction of a new groundwater
wellfield, installation of meters for demand management, rehabilitation of sewage
pumping stations, and technical assistance to support improved operations and further
corporatization. Bank funds will be onlent to the Daugavpils Municipal Enterprise
Udensvads (DMEU) with the guarantee of the City of Daugavpils. The Nordic
Environment Finance Corporation (NEFCO) will provide a fifteen year loan to
DMEU with the guarantee of the City of Daugavpils in the amount of US$2.0 million
at an interest rate equal to its cost of funds plus a margin of 0.5%. Grant funds will
be provided by the Government of Sweden (US$3.0 million); EU PHARE (US$2.6
million); the Government of Denmark (US$2.2 million) and the Government of
Finland (US$1.2 million). Implementation will be the responsibility of DMEU.
(iii)   Municipal Development Fund ($4.3 million). Most municipalities in Latvia lack
access to long-term credit necessary to finance investment in infrastructure and cannot
access funds through international financing agencies given their small size. The
Municipal Development Fund (MDF) will channel funds to a number of small-scale
investments in municipal services. These funds will be onlent to participating
municipalities. Sub-projects will be selected according to objective criteria and
procedures agreed with the Bank.
(iv)   Institutional Development Component ($0.2 million). The Project will provide for
technical assistance to the Borrower as required for implementation of the MDF and
for the functioning of the Project Coordination Unit (PCU).
9.            Project Implementation.  Implementation of the sub-projects will be the
responsibility of: (i) the Public Transport Unit (PTU) in the City of Riga; (ii) DMEU; and (iii) the
Public Investment Program unit in the Ministry of Economy which will administer the MDF.
Implementation of MDF sub-projects would be the responsibility of the beneficiary municipality.
Overall project coordination (including liaison with the World Bank, donors and co-financiers) will be
the responsibility of a Project Coordination Unit in the Ministry of Environmental Protection and
Regional Development.
10.          The total project cost is estimated at US$45.4 million equivalent. The foreign
exchange component is US$ 33.9 million (75% of project costs), and the local cost component is
US$11.5 million (25% of project costs). The Bank would finance US$27.3 million equivalent (68%
of total foreign costs, 37% of local costs and 60% of total costs). A Project Preparation Facility has
been requested by the Government. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in
Schedule A, page 7. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursements are shown in Schedule
B, pages 8 and 9. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in Latvia are given in Schedules C and D, pages 10 and 11 respectively. A map is also

attached (No. 27295). The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 14950 LV, dated November 20, 1995, is
being distributed separately.
11.          Project Sustainability. A condition for Bank financing of sub-projects is that
participating municipalities adopt a schedule of user charge increases sufficient to maintain appropriate
debt service coverage and return on assets. This schedule of user charge increases was developed
with reference to studies of affordability of municipal services, and affordability has also been taken
into consideration in sizing of project investments. Participating municipal enterprises have also been
required to provide a program of agreed actions to improve operational performance.
12.          Establishment of more formal contractual relations between municipal enterprises and
the municipality will be required and will promote further corporatization of municipal services.
Additional actions to strengthen management of municipal services, including establishment of
appropriate regulatory regimes, will be undertaken through technical assistance to be provided under
the project.
13.          The MDF will pilot a mechanism for channeling loan funds to municipalities for
improvements in municipal infrastructure and will reduce the dependence of municipalities on state
grants for such investments.
14.          Lessons Learned from Previous Bank/IDA Involvement. The Municipal
Development Sector Review (R-94171 dated August 22, 1994) notes that a critical factor in the long-
term development of urban services is the existence of satisfactory intergovernmental fiscal relations.
In Latvia, reform of intergovernmental fiscal relations has moved rapidly, and the municipal finance
framework is adequate to support the project and long term development of the sector.
15.          Projects now under implementation in Latvia by the Bank have demonstrated the value
of targeted technical assistance to facilitate procurement, construction supervision, implementation of
institutional strengthening and policy reforms. Such technical assistance has been included in the
proposed project.
16.          Rationale for Bank Involvement. This project is consistent with the Country
Assistance Strategy (13424-LV) as discussed by the Board of Directors during the presentation of the
Enterprise and Financial Sector Restructuring Project (Ln. No. 37950-LV) on September 20, 1994.
The CAS emphasizes investment in municipal infrastructure and intergovernmental fiscal relations and
seeks to support Latvia in financing priority investments in municipal services including urban
transport, water and sewerage. The CAS also emphasizes the importance of environment in Latvia's
public investment programming and supports the need for investment in improved water and
wastewater treatment facilities. The project is included in Latvia's Public Investment Program which
has been previously reviewed by the Bank; the project's specific investments were selected after
thorough consultation with national and local governments about priorities. The project will provide
funds for critical investments in priority municipal infrastructure which will improve service delivery
and promote increased operational efficiency. Policy reforms achieved under the project will improve
the financial status of municipal enterprises and will enable them to generate internal funds for future
investment.
17.          Agreed Actions. Agreement has been reached on: (i) implementation arrangements
including establishment of a Project Coordination Unit in the Ministry of Environmental Protection
and Regional Development, establishment of the Riga Public Transport Unit and establishment of a



- 5 -
PMU in DMEU; (ii) criteria and procedures for the selection of MDF sub-projects and formal
estahlishlinent of the MDF by Decree of the Cabinet of Ministers; (iii) a schedule of user charge
increases for the Riga and Daugavpils components of the project sufficient to maintain appropriate
debt service coverage, net income and return on net assets; (iv) conclusion of contracts between the
City of Riga and the three public transport companies regarding terms and conditions for provision of
transport services as a condition of effectiveness; (v) conclusion of a contract between the City of
Daugavpils and DMEU regarding the provision of water and wastewater services as a condition of
effectiveness; (vi) adoption of a revenue, costing and inventory control system by the three Riga
public transport companies prior to June 1, 1996; (vii) compliance with all conditions for co-financing
of the Daugavpils component by NEFCO, EU PHARE and the Governments of Sweden, Denmark
and Finland; (viii) compliance with Government and Bank requirements for environmental monitoring
and mitigation activities with regard to the Riga and Daugavpils components of the Project; and (viii)
reorganization of DMEU prior to December 31, 1997.
18.          Environmental Aspects. Preparation of the project has included environmental
studies consistent with the requirements of the Latvian law on "State Environmental Impact
Assessments" (1990) and the provisions of World Bank Operational Directive 4.01, "Environmental
Assessment." In accordance with these procedures, an environmental review was prepared, consistent
with the requirements for a category "B" project.
19.          The project is anticipated to have positive environmental impacts. Addition of
biological treatment facilities at the existing sewage treatment works in Daugavpils and conservation
of water will reduce pollution of the River Daugava, Riga Bay and Baltic Sea. Phased development
of a new groundwater wellfield for Daugavpils will increase the safety and reliability of drinking
water supply and is anticipated to have positive public health benefits for Latvia's second largest city.
A groundwater monitoring program will be included under the project, as will monitoring of
industrial wastewater discharges. Improvements in disposal of sludge from the wastewater treatment
plant will also be required under the project. Improved maintenance, rehabilitation and purchase of
new vehicles will reduce emissions and fuel consumption for Riga public transport. Improved public
transport will reduce the pace of growth of private automobile traffic which will further reduce
emissions and fuel consumption.
20.           Program Objective Categories. The project aims to improve economic management
and environmentally sustainable development through investments and technical assistance for water
supply, wastewater treatment and public transport services.
21.           Participatory Approach. The preparation of the project has been carried out in close
cooperation with the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Regional Development, the City of
Riga, the Riga public transport companies, Daugavpils municipality, DMEU, the Public Investment
Program unit of the Ministry of Economy and the Ministry of Finance. Preparation of the Daugavpils
water and wastewater sub-project was carried out under the supervision of a steering group including
representatives of the Latvian authorities, the Swedish International Development Agency, the Danish
Environmental Protection Agency, the Finnish Ministry of Environment, EU PHARE, NEFCO and
the World Bank. Preparation of the Municipal Development Fund sub-project has been supervised by
a steering group including representatives of the Latvian Union of Local Governments.
22.           Project Benefits. Project benefits include: (i) increased reliability, comfort and
efficiency of public transport systems in Riga, improved financial viability of public transport
companies, a reduced rate of increase in automobile traffic and reduction in the likely rate of increase



in air pollutioni; (ii) improved quality and safety of drinking water supply in Daugavpils, reduction in
the pollution of the River Daugava, Riga Bay and the Baltic Sea, decreased water consumption
through introduction of demand management measures, and improved financial viability of DMEU;
(iii) similar benefits in other communities obtaining financing for similar projects through the MDF;
and (iv) establishment of a vehicle for non-subsidized financing of municipal services. The economic
rate of return is estimated at 22% for the Riga urban transport component of the project (US$18.7
million or 41 % of total project costs). The benefits of the Daugavpils water and wastewater
componenit do not lend themselves to quantification, although they are assumed to be significant given
the positive expected impact on public health and the physical environment.  Instead, they have been
subjected instead to least cost analysis of alternatives. Subprojects to be financed under the MDF will
be required to demonstrate a minimum economic rate of return of 12 percent.
23.           Risks. Risks are that: (i) participating municipalities would not adhere to agreed
policy conditionality and/or financial and performance covenants including provision of counterpart
financing; (ii) inability of local governments to manage project implementation leading to construction
and procurement delays; (iii) inability of local governments to prepare satisfactory investment
proposals for financing under the MDF; and (iv) inadequate supervision of MDF projects.
24.           These risks will be mitigated by: (i) prior agreement with municipalities on terms and
conditions required for sub-loan effectiveness and, in particular, related to financial covenants,
organizational arrangements and local counterpart financing; (ii) requirement that sub-loan agreements
between the participating municipalities and the Ministry of Finance on behalf of the Government of
Latvia enable the Ministry of Finance to deduct interest and principal repayments from taxes and
other revenues collected on behalf of local governments by the state tax administration; (iii) provision
of technical assistance for critical areas of project implementation; (iv) adequate staffing of the PMUs
for the three primary sub-projects; (v) addition of consultant staff to the Public Investment Program
unit to assist with administration of the MDF and to support municipalities in preparation and
supervision of projects; and (vi) establishment of a central project coordination unit to monitor
compliance with loan and sub-loan covenants and with project implementation timetable.
Reconmnendation
25.           1 am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of
the Bank and I recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
