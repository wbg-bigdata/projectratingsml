                            SCHEDULE 5
                          Special Account
1.   For the purposes of this Schedule:
     (a)   the term "eligible Categories" means Categories 1,2,3
and 4 set forth in the table in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to
this Agreement;
     (b)   the term "eligible expenditures" means (i)
expenditures in respect of the reasonable cost of goods and
services required for parts A, B and D of the Project and to be
financed out of the proceeds of the Loan allocated from time to
time to the eligible Categories in accordance with the

reasonable cost of goods and services required for Investment
Projects  under Part C of the Project and to be financed out of
the proceeds of the Loan allocated from time to time to the
eligible Categories in accordance with the provisions of
Schedule 1 to this Agreement, provided, however, that
notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph B 2 (b) of
Schedule 7 to this Agreement, payments for expenditures to be
financed out of the proceeds of free-limit Sub-loans may be
made out of the Special Account before the Loan shall have
authorized withdrawals from the Loan Account in respect
thereof. Such expenditures, however, shall qualify as eligible
expenditures only if the Bank shall subsequently authorize such
withdrawals; and
     (c)   the term "Authorized Allocation" means an amount
equivalent to $500,000 to be withdrawn from the Loan Account
and deposited in the Special Account pursuant to paragraph 3
(a) of this Schedule, provided, however, that unless the Bank

limited to an amount equivalent to $250,000 until the aggregate
amount of withdrawals from the Loan Account plus the total
amount of all outstanding special commitments entered into by
the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions
shall be equal to or exceed the equivalent of $2,000,000.
Page  17
2.   Payments out of the Special Account shall be made
exclusively for eligible expenditures in accordance with the
provisions of this Schedule.
3.   After the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to it
that the Special Account has been duly opened, withdrawals of
the Authorized Allocation and subsequent withdrawals to
replenish the Special Account shall be made as follows:
     (a)    For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation, the
Borrower shall furnish to the Bank a request or requests for a
deposit or deposits which do not exceed the aggregate amount of
the Authorized Allocation. On the basis of such request or
requests, the Bank shall, on behalf of the Borrower, withdraw
from the Loan Account and deposit in the Special Account such
amount or amounts as the Borrower shall have requested.
     (b)   (i)  For replenishment of the Special Account, the
                Borrower shall furnish to the Bank requests for
                deposits into the Special Account at such
                intervals as the Bank shall specify.
           (ii) Prior to or at the time of each such request,
                the Borrower shall furnish to the Bank the
                documents and other evidence required pursuant
                to paragraph 4 of this Schedule for the payment
                or payments in respect of which replenishment
                is requested.  On the basis of each such
                request, the Bank shall, on behalf of the
                Borrower,  withdraw from the Loan Account and
                deposit into the Special Account such amount as
                the Borrower shall have requested and as shall
                have been shown by said documents and other
                evidence to have been paid out of the Special
                Account for eligible expenditures.
     All such deposits shall be withdrawn by the Bank from the
Loan Account under the respective eligible Categories, and in
the respective equivalent amounts, as shall have been justified
by said documents and other evidence.
4.   For each payment made by the Borrower out of the Special
Account, the Borrower shall, at such time as the Bank shall
reasonably request, furnish to the Bank such documents and
other evidence showing that such payment was made exclusively
for eligible expenditures.
5.   Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this
Schedule, the Bank shall not be required to make further
deposits into the Special Account:
     (a)   if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined that
all further withdrawals should be made by the Borrower directly
from the Loan Account in accordance with the provisions of
Article V of the General Conditions and paragraph (a) of
Section 2.02 of this Agreement; or
     (b)   if the Borrower shall have failed to furnish to the
Bank, within the period of time specified in Section 4.01 (b)
(ii) of this Agreement, any of the audit reports required to be
furnished to the Bank pursuant to said Section in respect of
the audit of the records and accounts for the Special Account;
     (c)   if, at any time, the Bank shall have notified the
Borrower of its intention to suspend in whole or in part the
right of the Borrower to make withdrawals from the Loan Account
pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.02 of the General
Conditions; or
     (d)   once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan
allocated to the eligible Categories, less the amount of any
outstanding special commitment entered into by the Bank
Page  18
pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions with respect
to the Project, shall equal the equivalent of twice the amount
of the Authorized Allocation.
     Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the
remaining unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the
eligible Categories shall follow such procedures as the Bank
shall specify by notice to the Borrower.  Such further
withdrawals shall be made only after and to the extent that the
Bank shall have been satisfied that all such amounts remaining
on deposit in the Special Account as of the date of such notice
will be utilized in making payments for eligible expenditures.
6.   (a)   If the Bank shall have determined at any time that
any payment out of the Special Account: (i) was made for an
expenditure or in an amount not eligible pursuant to paragraph
2 of this Schedule; or (ii) was not justified by the evidence
furnished to the Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice
from the Bank: (A) provide such additional evidence as the Bank
may request; or (B) deposit into the Special Account (or, if
the Bank shall so request, refund to the Bank) an amount equal
to the amount of such payment or the portion thereof not so
eligible or justified.  Unless the Bank shall otherwise agree,
no further deposit by the Bank into the Special Account shall
be made until the Borrower has provided such evidence or made
such deposit or refund, as the case may be.
     (b)   If the Bank shall have determined at any time that
any amount outstanding in the Special Account will not be
required to cover further payments for eligible expenditures,
the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund
to the Bank such outstanding amount.
     (c)   The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to
the Bank all or any portion of the funds on deposit in the
Special Account.
     (d)   Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs 6
(a), (b) and (c) of this Schedule shall be credited to the Loan
Account for subsequent withdrawal or for cancellation in
accordance with the relevant provisions of this Agreement,
including the General Conditions.

                   Modifications of General Conditions
     For purposes of this Agreement, the provisions of the
General Conditions are modified as follows:
(1)  The last sentence of Section 3.02 is deleted.
(2)  (a)   The words "the Bank may, by notice to the Borrower,

Section 6.03 are deleted and the following is substituted

     or approvals or to make withdrawals from the Loan Account,
     as the case may be, with respect to such amount or portion
     of the Loan.  Upon the giving of such notice, such amount
     or portion of the Loan shall be canceled."
     (b)   The second sentence of Section 5.01 is modified to
Page  19
read:
           "Except as the Bank and the Borrower shall otherwise

     services supplied from, such territories; or (b) for the
     purpose of any payment to persons or entities, or for any
     import of goods, if such payment or import, to the
     knowledge of the Bank, is prohibited by a decision of the
     United Nations Security Council taken under Chapter VII of
     the Charter of the United Nations."
                               SCHEDULE 7
