APPRAISAL OF ThE NINTH POWER PROJECT
Empresa Nacional de Luz y Fuerza (ENALUF)
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises the ninth power project in Nicaragua, for
which the Empresa Nacional de Luz y Fuerza (ENALUF) has requested financial
assistance from the Bank.
ii.       Since 1953, the Bank Group has made eight loans and one credit,
totalling US$71.3 million, to Nicaragua's electric power sector. ENALUF -
an autonomous Government-owned corporation which is responsible for practi-
cally all public electric generation and transmission - and its predecessor
have been the beneficiaries of all but the third loan of US$0.4 million in
1955. The first seven projects have been completed successfully, although
with some delays and cost overruns, which were particularly serious in the
case of the seventh project. Through its participation in these projects the
Bank has contributed to the financing of all of ENALUF's generating capacity.
iii.      The electric portion of the earthquake reconstruction project,
financed in 1973 by Credit 389-NI (Part C) has had minor delays in procure-
ment. Most of the damaged facilities have been rehabilitated and service
restored. This part of the project should be completed within appraisal
cost estimates, with disbursements ending in early 1977.
iv.       The eighth power project, financed in 1972 by Loan 840-NI (jointly
with the Central American Bank for Economic Integration - CABEI), is expected
to be completed in 1977 with a delay of about 14 months. The delay resulted
from late agreement on the interconnection contract with Honduras (the contract
was a condition of loan effectiveness), late procurement and late equipment
deliveries, and the consequences of the 1972 earthquake. Together with
inflation in Nicaragua and abroad, it led to cost overruns of US$14.6 million (42%).
The overruns and additions to the project, costing of US$9.7 million (resulting
from increases in construction standards and quantities of certain items notto be
financed by the Bank) are being financed by a loan to ENALUF of US$16.1 million equiv-
alent from the Venezuelan Investment Fund (VIF) which was secured with technical
assistance from the Bank, by internal cash generation and by Government con-
tributions. Despite these increases, the project continues to be economically
justified. The top management of ENALUF is strongly centralized in the Execu-
tive President and two Vice-Presidents. The need for improving this arrange-
ment has become progressively more evident with the increased burdens imposed
on ENALUF first by the 1972 earthquake and subsequently by the energy crisis.
These strained ENALUF's financial situation and led to major changes in the
power investment program. The Bank has assisted ENALUF in addressing these
problems and further improvements are expected during the implementation of
the proposed project.



- ii -
v.        The National Planning Council (NPC) now has overall responsibility
for energy policy and planning, technical planning for electric power system
expansion, however, remains with ENALUF. In this context, Nicaragua's power
sector organization needs to be updated. The proposed project provides for a
sector organization study and a long-range master plan for development of the
electric power system.
vi.       Recent changes in the relative prices of primary energy have led to
a reassessment of the previous strategy to expand thermal generation facilities,
which resulted in savings of capital but was not conducive to energy self-
sufficiency. The Government is now aiming at reducing the dependence on
imported oil through balanced development and use of geothermal and hydro-
electric resources to meet the demand for electricity, growing at about 12%
annually. Consequently, Nicaragua has accelerated preparation of both the
Momotombo geothermal and the Copalar hydropower project for which external
financing is expected to be sought.
vii.      Nicaragua has extended electric distribution into most of its popu-
lated areas, so that over 40% of the population now has access to service.
About 23% of sales go to residential consumers, 47% to industry and 8% to
irrigation. During 1976-1981, ENALUF's normal distribution expansion, its new
IDB-financed rural electrification project, and the distribution facilities
included in the proposed project to serve low-income areas are expected to
provide access to service for an additional 400,000 people.
viii.     Average electricity tariffs are adequate at present; however, there
are structural imbalances resulting from promotional tariffs (providing
incentives to industry and irrigation customers) which are below incremental
production cost. To prepare the basis for new tariffs (which would encourage
most economical use of electricity) ENALUF agreed to carry out and review with
the Bank, prior to implementation of its results, a tariff study based on the
concept of long-term marginal cost of service. ENALUF also agreed to auto-
matically adjust its rates for changes in fuel and purchased power costs.
ix.       The 1974 amendment to ENALUF's Constituent Law reflects the consul-
tant's recommendations--prepared under the eighth power project--for ENALUF's
reorganization. The organizational structure requires ENALUF's Executive
President, who is also Board Chairman, to exercise a strongly centralized
control. To assist him in supervising day-to-day operations and also in the
implementation of the improvement programs agreed with the Bank, ENALUF has
appointed a General Coordinator under satisfactory terms of reference. This
Coordinator will be assisted by experts in procurement and training and also
in other areas which he will identify. The experts will be engaged under
arrangements agreed with the Bank. Conditions of effectiveness of the loan
are (i) the engagement of experts in procurement and training and (ii) presen-
tation of terms of reference for other experts, both to be satisfactory to the
Bank. For the growing tasks ahead, ENALUF will also need to widen its manage-
ment base along functional lines.



- iii -
x.        The proposed project would basically provide for: (a) the Nicaraguan
portion of an interconnection line to the Costa Rican system; (b) transmission
and distribution items which would complement the facilities for generation
and transmission supplied under the eighth project; (c) a national load
dispatch center to operate the ENALUF system and the Honduras-Nicaragua-Costa
Rica interconnection more effectively; and (d) studies of tariffs, the future
organization of the Nicaraguan power sector, institutional improvements for
ENALUF (including a training component) and the preparation of a master plan.
Due to the nature of its components, the project is not expected to have a
major effect upon the environment.
xi.       The proposed project is estimated to cost US$32.3 million with a
foreign component of about US$20.2 million; total requirements (including
financial charges during construction) are US$36.2 million and US$24.2 million,
respectively. The proposed loan of US$22.0 million would cover the foreign
cost and about US$1.8 million in interest and other charges on the loan during
construction. The remaining costs would be covered by ENALUF's net internal
contribution to expansion.
xii.      For the various phases of the project, ENALUF has agreed to engage
consultants who would mainly carry out their services within ENALUF's project
groups to promote counterpart training and the transfer of technological know-
how.
xiii.     To obtain more competitive prices, procurement of similar equipment
and materials would be packaged to increase the size of orders. All contracts
for Bank-financed works, goods and services (other than engineering and train-
ing) would be awarded through international competitive bidding, except for
standardized and imported items required in small quantities in a total
amount of US$0.55 million. Retroactive financing is recommended up to
US$0.8 million for expenditures for studies and engineering to advance the
preparation of the project. As under the eighth project, the Bank would
agree to the extension of preferences to local or Central American Common
Market manufacturers of the lower of 15% of the CIF landed price or 50% of
the applicable import duty.
xiv.      The project's physical components would be the least-cost alterna-
tives. In view of the difficulty of allocating benefits -- measured in terms
of revenues -- to the project or its components, a rate of return on the
investment program has been estimated. Based on 1976 tariffs, the rate of
return would be 13.1%; if sunk costs incurred prior to 1976 are excluded, the
return would increase to 16.2%.
xv.       ENALUF's financial performance was poor in 1973 and 1974 due to the
December 1972 earthquake, the energy crisis (which adversely affected sales),
and the additions ENALUF made to the eighth project. As result of 1974-1975
tariff action, however, performance improved in 1975-1976 and should continue
to do so. ENALUF would earn at least 8.5% on annually revalued net operating
assets and cover its debt service at least 1.49 times on an annual basis.
ENALUF's 1976-1980 expansion program provides for implementation of the
projects described in paragraph vi and is, therefore, extremely ambitious.



- iv -
It amounts to US$286.2 million (including interest during construction). The
financing of this program is based on ENALUF's net internal contribution to
expansion of US$63.3 milion (22%), borrowing of US$202.6 million (71%) and
Government contributions for rural electrification and geothermal development
of US$20.2 million (7%). ENALUF has agreed to undertake major expansions,
other than the proposed projects, only after satisfactory economic justifi-
cation and with adequate financing.
xvi.      The prQposed project would form a suitable basis for a Bank loan of
US$22.0 million for a term of 17 years, including 3.5 years of grace, made to
ENALUF and guaranteed by the Republic of Nicaragua.



NICARAGUA
APPRAISAL OF THE NINTH POWER PROJECT
Power Transmission Project
Empresa Nacional de Luz y Fuerza (ENALUF)
1.   INTRODUCTION
1.01      This report appraises a transmission and distribution project in
Nicaragua, for which Empresa Nacional de Luz y Fuerza (ENALUF), an autonomous
Government entity, has requested financial assistance from the Bank. Since
1953, the electric power sector has received eight Bank loans and one IDA
credit totalling US$71.3 million, of which seven, totalling US$65.5 million,
were made to ENALUF and its predecessor. Annex 1 contains a description of
the main project components. The first seven of these projects have been
completed successfully, although with some delay and cost overruns. These
were particularly serious in the case of the seventh project (completed in
1972) which encountered substantial unforeseen geological problems. These
problems arose during the construction of the dam, canal and power tunnel for
the main project component, a 50 MW hydro power plant, but they did not affect
its economic justification. Completion of another major component, a 40 MW
steam electric unit, was delayed by strikes in the main contractor's country;
this delay had only a temporary effect on the reliability of ENALUF's power
production. The Bank, through its participation in these projects, has
contributed to the financing of all of ENALUF's generating capacity in opera-
tion or under construction and most of the transmission facilities.
1.02      The ongoing earthquake electric reconstruction project, executed by
ENALUF (Part C of Credit 389-NI), is expected to be completed in early 1977.
Most of the damaged facilities have been rehabilitated, and ENALUF has
installed the distribution facilities needed to serve the relocated population
and commerce with electricity. Due to delays in procurement, disbursements
have been late, but cost overruns are not expected.
1.03      Although the eighth power project (Loan 840-NI) -- financed jointly
with the Central American Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI) and consisting
mainly of the 100 MW Tiscuco steam electric plant, near Puerto Somoza, asso-
ciated transmission system and the interconnection with Honduras -- is still
under construction, the lessons learned in the implementation of this project
have guided the preparation of the proposed loan.
1.04      The eighth project is expected to be substantially completed in
mid-1977, with a delay, on average, of 14 months compared with the appraisal.
The delay was primarily due to: (i) late loan effectiveness (because of delay
in signing the interconnection contract with Honduras); (ii) delayed delivery
of equipment due to strikes; and (iii) consequences of the 1972 earthquake



- 2 -
which delayed local works and services. Faced with these problems, ENALUF was
slow in responding to the additional challenges posed by the sharp increases
in its fuel costs since late 1973. ENALUF top management is strongly central-
ized in the Executive President and two Vice-Presidents. The need for improv-
ing this arrangement has become progressively more evident with the increased
burdens imposed on ENALUF first by the 1972 earthquake and subsequently by the
energy crisis. During the preparation of the proposed ninth project the Bank
has assisted ENALUF in addressing these problems. Further improvements are
expected during the implementation of the project (see paras. 3.04-3.07).
Cost overruns, in connection with the eighth project, amount to US$24.3
million (70% of the appraisal estimate of US$34.7 million). Only US$14.6
million (42% over appraisal), however, are directly related to the original
project; the balance of US$9.7 million resulted from additional works. 1/
Despite these increases, the project continues to be economically justified.
To cover the financing requirements arising from the cost overrun, ENALUF has
obtained, with technical assistance from the Bank, a loan from the Venezuelan
Investment Fund (VIF) of US$16.1 million equivalent (Annex 16).
1.05      Originally, the proposed ninth project was expected to include
the first geothermal unit at Momotombo (para. 2.20). Since the geothermal
studies have been delayed and ENALUF and the Government now intend to finance
the first unit with bilateral and suppliers' credit, the proposed project
provides mainly for: (i) the interconnection with the Costa Rican system;
(ii) high priority transmission and distribution works; (iii) a national load
dispatch center to control the national system and the interconnections to
Honduras and Costa Rica; and (iv) consultant services, studies and training
(para. 4.02). The transmission and distribution works would complement ENALUF's
facilities which are being built under the eighth project.
1.06      The proposed ninth project is an integral part of ENALUF's 1976-1980
expansion program. The total and foreign cost of this program are respectively,
US$264.1 million and US$168.5 million (excluding US$22.1 million in financing
charges); the total and foreign cost of the proposed ninth project are US$32.3
million and about US$20.2 million (excluding US$3.9 million in financing
charges).
1.07      A loan of US$22.0 million is proposed to provide for the project's
foreign financing requirement (including US$1.8 million in financing charges
on the proposed loan). The loan would help ENALUF by (i) providing a portion
of the US$202.6 million equivalent borrowing required for its 1976-1980 con-
struction program for which it has obtained US$47.6 million so far; (ii) pro-
moting regional integration through interconnection of power systems;
(iii) strengthening ENALUF management; and (iv) improving sector organization
and expansion planning.
1.08      This report is based on a feasibility study prepared by ENALUF,
the findings of the December 1975-January 1976 appraisal mission composed
of Messrs. Helmut Wieseman, Andrew Waldrop and John E. Graves, and information
provided subsequently by ENALUF.
1/Resulting from ENALUF's decision to increase construction qualities and standards
on certain items (operator's village, access road) not to be financed by the Bank.

2.   THE SECTOR
Energy Resources and Uses
2.01      Nicaragua has no proven commercially exploitable fuel deposits;
exploration for oil and gas by private oil companies, however, has recently
been intensified. Coal and fuels derived from oil are imported at present.
The country's geological characteristics indicate that it has a large geothermal
potential, which is presently being studied at the Momotombo volcano. In
connection with the Central American Hydrometeorological Project sponsored by
the United Nations, Nicaraguan hydropower potential was estimated at around
1,600 MW firm capacity, of which a large proportion would be from low-head
hydro plants. If fully developed, annual energy in an average hydroyear would
be about 11,000 GWh. Further hydropower studies are under way (para. 2.21).
2.02      Traditional sources (wood, bagasse) supplied 55% of primary energy
in 1960 and 36% in 1973, when a total of about 1.1 million tons of petroleum-
equivalent energy was used. Traditional energy is rapidly being replaced
by commercial, petroleum-based energy. Coal usage is insignificant. Commer-
cial energy requirements in 1973 were estimated at about 690,000 tons of
petroleum equivalent, of which about 590,000 tons were supplied by imported
oil and the rest by hydroelectricity. From 1960 to 1973 commercial energy
demand rose at an average annual rate of about 10%, which was substantially
above the real GDP growth rate of about 6.5%. Attachment 3 of Annex 2 pro-
vides further details.
Sector Organization
2.03      In January 1975, the Government strengthened planning by constitut-
ing the National Planning Council (NPC). This Council has overall responsi-
bility for technical studies and analysis and for preparing plans and recom-
mendations for most sectors of the economy, for the consideration of the
President of Nicaragua. Through its recently established National Planning
Directorate (NPD), NPC is formulating plans and policies for the overall
energy sector to implement the strategy outlined in paragraph 2.08.
2.04      The Electric Industry Law of April 1957 regulates public electricity
supply. The National Institute for Electric Energy (NIEE) is the regulatory
agency of the Central Government, responsible for the development, coordina-
tion, regulation, control and supervision of electricity service. Due to
technical and financial limitations of NIEE, however, the study and program-
ming for optimum development of the sector, utilizing national energy resources,
is assigned to ENALUF (an autonomous Government corporation) which supplies
87% of electricity generated in the country. The proposed sector organization
study (para. 2.06) is expected to review this situation.
2.05      In addition to ENALUF, five cooperatives, 13 private companies and
three municipalities distribute electricity; they account for 17% of sales
at retail to 37% of the country's electricity clients (Annex 2).

Power Sector Organization Study
2.06      In view of the need for substantial changes in Nicaragua's energy
development strategy the Government is assessing the future organization of
the energy sector. In the power sector there is need for formulation of
(a) detailed development policies; (b) long-range plans; and (c) priorities
for expansion. To provide the framework for future decisions in these areas
and to rationalize sector organization and development, the proposed loan
provides funds for a sector organization study. This study would be carried
out by consultants working under NPD direction with terms of reference accept-
able to the Bank (Annex 4) to which the Government has agreed. The study
would be fully coordinated with the preparation of the master plan (para.
2.22) under the direction of ENALUF which has agreed to provide full coopera-
tion.
Energy Sector Development Strategy
2.07      Before the oil crisis, Nicaragua's energy sector development was
basically oriented by a lack of low cost hydropower sites and by petroleum
prices generally lower than those of its neighbors (Honduras and Costa Rica),
the latter because of special incentives legislated for the local refinery.
Due to the cost advantage of thermal generation in Nicaragua and abundant
hydro energy of its neighbors, the country planned to import primary energy
based on oil and hydropower. Preparation of investment-intensive projects
(geothermal and large hydro) was given low priority. The country consequently
continued expanding electric generation facilities on a thermal basis, fore-
going energy self-sufficiency, while avoiding the larger investment required
for building hydro or geothermal stations. Accordingly, ENALUF undertook, in
1972, the construction of the Tiscuco 100 MW steam electric station with the
intent of selling excess power to Honduras which had better prospects for
economic high-head hydropower. Thermal power would be needed in Honduras
during the construction period of the El Cajon project in that country and to
provide protection against dry years. The Bank supported this strategy by
financing the construction of the station and an interconnection between
Nicaragua and Honduras (Loans 840-NI and 841-HO).
2.08      Recent changes in the relative prices of primary energy (Annex 2)
have led to a reassessment of this strategy. The Government is now aiming
at reducing dependence on imported oil through balanced development and use
of local geothermal and hydroelectric energy. Preparation of the Momotombo
geothermal and Copalar hydropower projects (para. 2.20) has been intensified
with the intent of reducing annual oil consumption for electricity production
from a peak of about 30% of the total projected for 1978 to about 5% in 1985.
Fuel oil will continue to be used for transport and industry.
Electricity Supply and Consumption
2.09      Nicaragua has an area of 118,360 km2 and a population of about 2.1
million. Electricity supply is concentrated largely in the north, central and
Pacific coast areas. The Pacific coast area, which includes all the major



towns (Managua, Leon, Masaya, Granada, Chinandega, Corinto) is the most devel-
oped and industrialized part of the country. It consumes over 90% of all
electric energy produced in the country, and 60% of its population enjoys
access to electric service (compared to a national average of 41%).
2.10      Annex 2 shows the electric energy supply situation in 1974 in detail;
it is summarized as follows:
Generation in GWh
Hydro    Steam    Diesel    Gas        Total       %
Public Service
ENALUF                352.1    396.7       11.5      3.8      764.1      87.4
Private Companies       0.5       -         7.0      -          7.5       0.9
Subtotal         352.6    396.7      18.5      3.8       771.6      88.3
Self-Generation            16.0     30.4      56.2       -        102.6     11.7
Total            368.6    427.1      74.7      3.8       874.2    100.0
These figures show the high proportion of public supply and the importance of
ENALUF in the sector. ENALUF's share of distribution sales at the retail
level (85% in 1974) is expected to decrease to about 78% in 1990 because its
sales are growing more slowly than those of other retailers.
2.11      The industrial sector is the largest consumer of publicly supplied
electricity in Nicaragua, accounting for 47% of total power sales in 1974. On
a national basis, the sales by client category have grown as follows in recent
years:
Average
1970 Sales          1974 Sales       Annual Growth
GWh         %       GWh         %            x
Industrial                    188.3    43.9       298.0    46.9           12.2
Irrigation                     17.8      4.1       53.0      8.3          31.4
Pumping                        15.9      3.7       27.7      4.4          14.9
Subtotal                222.0    51.7        378.7    59.6           14.3
Residential                   117.4    27.4        145.8    22.9           5.5

Irrigation is the fastest growing category. Growth in the residential, com-
mercial and Government categories was slowed by the effects of the Managua
earthquake of December 1972 (Annex 14). Access to electric service in the
country is shown in Annex 3; it was 32% in 1970 and was estimated at 41% for
1975. The largest increase in the rate of electrification is in the area
served by cooperatives.
Rural Electrification
2.12      ENALUF supplies electricity at wholesale to five cooperatives
serving rural areas. The cooperatives began with a 1964 pilot project near
Masaya followed by four cooperatives, set up between 1969 and 1975 under the
First National Plan for Rural Electrification with financial assistance from
US-AID, in the area towird the Pacific Ocean. The five cooperatives supply an
area of about 20,000 km with a population of about 180,000 (or about 18% of
an estimated rural population of one million).
2.13      In order to serve more rural clients directly, ENALUF, since late
1975, has been undertaking the first stage of the Second National Electrifica-
tion Plan at a cost of about US$21 million, with IDB financing US$16.5 million
and the Government contributing US$4.4 million equivalent as equity. With
this project ENALUF is expected to provide about 70,000 people in the Matagalpa
and Rama areas with electric service.
2.14      In line with the Bank's lending strategy to help spread the benefits
of growth to more people, the proposed loan includes funds for extending elec-
tric service into low-income (mainly urban) locations in the concession areas
of ENALUF (para. 4.02). This would enable a comparison, in about three years,
of the results obtained by the cooperatives and by ENALUF in increasing elec-
trification and would assist the Government in determining the priorities for
future development of Nicaragua's electric power sector.
Electricity Tariffs
2.15      Although legal responsibility for electricity tariff regulation
rests with NIEE, actual tariffs are determined (with ENALUF's informal assist-
ance) at the highest level of Government. Current average electricity prices
reflect the Government's policy of providing incentives to commercial agri-
culture and industry through low, promotional tariffs. For instance, the
1976 price per kWh to irrigation and industrial clients will average USJ2.2
and USU4.1 respectively, compared with a fuel cost of USd2.1 per kWh sold
from the Tiscuco steam electric station (at 1976 fuel prices). On the other
hand, residential clients pay an average of USJ8.8 and commercial clients
USJ6.4 in addition to substantial contributions in aid of construction and
connection fees. Annex 15 shows the present tariffs of ENALUF, electric
cooperatives, and other retailers, indicating notable differences in pricing.
2.16      In view of the Government's promotion of decentralization, the differ-
ences between tariffs of ENALUF and those of other distributors need to be
reconciled. Nicaragua's unfavorable resource endowment may require promo-
tional tariffs to be adjusted to encourage more efficient use of electricity.



2.17      To prepare the basis for new tariffs, ENALUF agreed to carry out (as
part of the proposed project) a nation-wide tariff study based on the concept
of long-term marginal cost of service. The recommendations of this study
would be reviewed with NIEE and the Bank.
2.18      ENALUF's present tariff schedule includes a nonautomatic fuel
adjustment clause, on the basis of which ENALUF raised tariffs twice, in
February and October 1974, albeit with a delay. As late application of the
clause has caused notable loss of revenues, ENALUF and the Government agreed
to an automatic adjustment of ENALUF's rates to cover additional operating
expenses resulting from variations in the cost of fuel and purchased power.
Power Sector Development
2.19      Since the interconnection with Honduras was commissioned in October
1976, ENALUF has supplemented its generation of electricity by purchases from
the Empresa Nacional de Energia Electrica (ENEE) in Honduras. Beginning 1979
power would also be purchased from the Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad
(ICE) in Costa Rica. As shown in Annex 5, ENALUF has projected substantial
purchases from Costa Rica (averaging about 145 GWh from 1979 on) and after
1982 from El Cajon hydro electric project in Honduras (up to 77 MW and 590 GWh
in 1984).
2.20      The next generation addition after the Tiscuco plant would be one
35 MW and two 50 MW geothermal units at the Momotombo volcano (Annex 6). This
project, originally studied by the United Nations Development Programme
(UNDP), is now being prepared with contributions provided by the Government.
ENALUF completed the feasibility study for the first unit in late 1976 and
expects to install the unit under a supplier-financed turnkey project by
mid-1979; the second and third units are planned for operation in 1980 and
1981. In addition to the geothermal plant, ENALUF expects (based on a pre-
feasibility study prepared with US-AID help) to build for 1985 operation a
hydro electric plant with an ultimate capacity of 330 MW at Copalar on the
Matagalpa river.
2.21      The above mentioned plans for the interconnection to Costa Rica, the
Momotombo geothermal plant and the construction of Copalar are subject to
confirmation by further studies and to firm agreements on interchanges with
the neighboring systems:
(a) the Momotombo geothermal reservoir is very complex; it may not
yield 135 MW on a continuous basis. However, there is substan-
tial manifestation of a large resource at the San Jacinto
geothermal field just north of Momotombo. ENALUF is making plans to
extend its geothermal investigation into this area as part of the
master plan (para. 2.22);
(b) the completion of the arrangements for financing the interconnec-
tion with the ICE system may delay its construction (Annex 6);
(c) the feasibility study for Copalar, which is being prepared
for the Government by a Nicaraguan-Canadian consulting consortium,



- 8 -
may recommend an earlier development of the Matagalpa river
due to faster than predicted load growth (see (e) below);
(d) the results of the San Juan river multi-purpose development
study (financed by UNDP with IDB as the executing agency and
contracted with the US Bureau of Reclamation) may be more
favorable for hydropower than presently anticipated; and
(e) the power market may develop more rapidly than ENALUF has
predicted, in part because the Government may commit the
construction of a fertilizer plant earlier than has been
assumed; this plant could have electric energy as one of its
primary inputs.
2.22      In view of these uncertainties, and since ENALUF is responsible for
planning the expansion of the national electric power supply, the proposed
project provides for the preparation of a long-term master plan by a team to
be formed with ENALUF staff and consultants. The master plan would include a
power market survey; an energy resource survey (hydro, geothermal, fuels);
optimization of the development of the generation, transmission and distribu-
tion system and international interconnections; and a study of alternatives
for a national load dispatch center. It would review and build on the work
undertaken by ENALUF and its consultant -- the International Engineering
Company (USA) -- in connection with the prefeasiblity study for the Copalar
hydropower project, which included an expansion plan for generation and
transmission to 1988. The terms of reference for the preparation of the
master plan are satisfactory.
3. THE BORROWER
General
3.01      The borrower would be ENALUF, a Government-owned autonomous national
enterprise established in 1954 for generating, transmitting and distributing
electricity and related activities. ENALUF grew out of an initial consolida-
tion of electricity companies that operated in its present concession areas.
The effective generating capability of ENALUF's National Interconnected System
(NIS) is 193 MW; the installed capability is expected to reach 428 MW by 1981
as shown in Annex 5.
Organization and Management
3.02      ENALUF is governed by its Constituent Law, as amended April 1968 and
November 1974. The November 1974 amendment reflects the organizational recom-
mendations of the consulting firm, R.W. Beck & Associates (USA) as prepared
under ENALUF's eighth project. These recommendations concerned mainly non-
technical management, accounting and financial activities. The amendment



strengthened ENALUF's autonomy in budget formulation and established ENALUF's
present organization (Annex 7).
3.03      ENALUF's Board of Directors comprises eight members:  an Executive
President who is by law the chief executive officer; two representatives of
the Government - one each from the National Economic Council and the National
Development Institute (INFONAC); one representative from the private associa-
tions; two representatives of the majority political party; and two represen-
tatives of the minority party. All Directors are appointed for two years by
the President of Nicaragua and can be reappointed. Only two members have
been on the Board longer than 24 months (the Executive President and one
representative of the minority party).
3.04      The organizational structure requires the Executive President to
exercise a strongly centralized control over ENALUF's activities. To relieve
him of a part of the burden of supervising day-to-day operations and to assist
in the implementation of the improvement programs agreed with the Bank, ENALUF
has appointed a General Coordinator under satisfactory terms of reference.
ENALUF has agreed to continue to employ a General Coordinator under terms of
reference acceptable to the Bank and to give the Bank a reasonable opportunity
to comment on any proposed new appointee to this position. Assisted by the
General Coordinator, ENALUF's top line executives will be in a better position
to attend to policy formulation, interdepartmental coordination, training of
subordinates and development of team work. ENALUF should also prepare for
broadening the line management base along five functional lines (engineering
and construction; operations; commercial; financial; and general administra-
tion).
3.05      The General Coordinator's terms of reference give him responsibility
for directing the development and implementation of improvements in financial
controls, planning, construction management, procurement, organization, staff-
ing and training. He would be assisted by an expert in procurement and a
training director (see below) and would identify the need for other experts.
Presentation of satisfactory terms of reference for these additional experts
(who are expected to deal with cost estimating, construction management, finan-
cial control and budgeting) would be a condition of effectiveness of the pro-
posed loan.
3.06      ENALUF needs to develop its staff more fully in order to utilize
its experienced personnel in management and supervision. To institute a
coordinated training program, which would also consider the future growth
needs of the organization, ENALUF would set up a training unit under a full-
time director with wide experience in power utility training. ENALUF agreed
to prepare a training program acceptable to the Bank (see outline in Annex 21)
by June 30, 1977 and begin implementation by December 31, 1977 through a
training unit under a training director and under satisfactory terms of
reference. The hiring of the training expert under satisfactory terms of
reference would be a condition of loan effectiveness.
3.07      In recent years, ENALUF awarded several large orders (not financed
by the Bank) locally on a negotiated basis, paying higher prices than would
have been obtained under competitive bidding. To prevent a recurrence of this



- 10 -
problem in the future the General Coordinator would review ENALUF's procure-
ment regulations to ensure that procurement is based on placing orders (after
appropriate competitive bidding or alternative procedures which would be re-
viewed with the Bank) with the supplier offering the lowest evaluated price.
He would be assisted in this work by an expert in procurement who would also
suggest improvements in the organization of ENALUF's procurement activities.
Hiring of the procurement expert under satisfactory terms of reference would
be a condition of loan effectiveness.
Insurance
3.08      ENALUF carries insurance with Compania Nacional de Seguros de
Nicaragua (CNSN) providing coverage against catastrophic loss of some of its
installations due to various risks, including the risk of earthquake. ENALUF
suffered an uninsured loss of about US$2.8 million as a result of the 1972
earthquake. After discussions with the Bank, ENALUF contracted a competent
insurance expert to study the adequacy of its current insurance program, with
particular emphasis on casualty insurance for plant and equipment (Annex 16,
para. 9). ENALUF agreed to submit the findings of the expert for review by the
Bank within 10 days from loan effectiveness, and to take all necessary action
in conformity with the report and the recommendations of the Bank to provide
adequate insurance coverage.
Management Information Systems and Audit
3.09      ENALUF is upgrading its internal management information system
by implementing the recommendations of R.W. Beck and Associates for providing
computerized accounting and budget control. ENALUF's financial statements
have been certified by Arthur Andersen and Company (Nicaragua); their work
appears generally satisfactory. ENALUF has agreed to have its accounts
audited by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank and to send audited
financial statements and the auditors' report to the Bank within four months
of the end of the calendar year.
Performance Indicators
3.10      During the project period, ENALUF expects to make improvements in
the efficiency of its operations. These improvements are reflected in the
annual targets listed in Annex 17, which would be used to monitor ENALUF's
performance during project implementation.
4. THE PROGRAM AND PROJECT
Investment Program 1976-1980
4.01      In line with the development strategy and plans to reduce Nicaragua's
fuel imports (para. 2.08), ENALUF expects to carry out the following investment
program in 1976-1980:



- 11 -
(a)  Generation:  Completion of the Tiscuco 100 MW steam electric
plant at Punta Tiscuco and construction of the 135 MW geothermal
plant at Momotombo and of the initial works of the 330 MW Copalar
hydroelectric development;
(b) Transmission: Installation of 420 km of 230 kV and 160 km of
138 kV lines and 432 MVA of transformer capacity;
(c) Subtransmission and distribution: Installation of 136 km of
69 kV lines; 20 MVA of transformer capacity for stepdown to
13.8 kV and 25 kV; and distribution system expansion;
(d) Load dispatch: Installation of a national load dispatch
center, including extension of communication and telemetering
facilities; and
(e) Studies.
Annex 8 shows the projected annual disbursements for the investment program,
which is expected to cost about US$264 million equivalent. About half of
this amount would be for the Momotombo geothermal project, which ENALUF hopes
to finance with the help of suppliers' credits (for the first unit) and loans
from international agencies (for the second and third unit). Existing proj-
ects account for 21% and are being financed primarily by the Bank, CABEI and
VIF (13%) and IDB (8%) for the eighth power project and additions, and a rural
electrification project, respectively. Major future expenditures include the
normal distribution and general plant expansion (7%), the initial works of the
Copalar hydroelectric project (5%) and the further geothermal studies (5%)
financed by the Government. The proposed ninth power project would amount to
12% of the investment program. The above works appear to comprise a rational
program for meeting the expected growth in demand.
Project Concept and Description
4.02      As identified in detail in Annex 9 the ninth power project would
provide for:
(a) The ENALUF portion of an interconnection line to Costa Rica and
the transmission and distribution items (which would complement
the facilities for generation and transmission supplied under
the eighth project), consisting of:
(i)  about 145 km of single circuit of 230 kV on steel towers for
interconnection with Costa Rica;
(ii) about 9 km of double circuit and 8 km of single circuit
of 138 kV to complete the Managua Ring; and construction of
about 5 km of single circuit transmission line of 138 kV to
connect the Sebaco-Santa Rita line to the Matagalpa substation;



- 12 -
(iii) construction, addition, and/or conversion of about seven sub-
stations of 138/13.8 kV or 138/25 kV, by adding about 122 MVA
transformer capacity;
(iv) relocation of about 75 MVA transformer capacity of 69/13.8
kV to six existing substations;
(v) installation of about eight 69 kV circuit breakers and of
protective relaying and metering equipment;
(vi) installation of about 65 MVAR switched and unswitched
capacitors to supply reactive power; and
(vii) installation of distribution lines, transformers, and
connections in low income areas.
(b)  Construction of a national load dispatch center, and installa-
tion of equipment for operating the Honduras-Nicaragua-Costa
Rica interconnection and the national system;
(c)  Services of engineering, planning, tariff consultants and
of expert advisors to assist in:
Estimated
man-month
(i)  carrying out the physical works of the project            180
(ii) preparing a master plan of power system expansion
(para. 2.22)                                             144
(iii) preparing a study of alternatives and specifications
for the national load dispatch center (para. 2.22)         20
(iv) preparing a nation-wide tariff study based on
marginal cost pricing (para. 2.17)                         10
(v) preparing and carrying out of a progam for improving
ENALUF's management and administration and training
(paras. 3.04-3.05)                                        96
(vi) preparing a sector organization study for NPD
(para. 2.06)                                               18
4.03      The growing need for a reliable electricity supply from an increas-
ingly complex national power system and the rather sophisticated operating
requirements in the context of Nicaragua's central role in the existing and
proposed international interconnections with Honduras and Costa Rica make
it technically essential to promptly provide a modern load dispatch system.
(Similar centers are already being built in the Central American isthmus in



- 13 -
Panama, Costa Rica, Honduras and El Salvador with Bank participation and finan-
cial support.) Detailed specifications would be prepared for the load dis-
patch component after selecting the best evaluated alternative recommended by
consultants who would prepare a study of alternatives and the specifications
as part of the project under terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank.
Approval of this study would be a condition of disbursement of the funds
included in the proposed loan for the load dispatch center.
4.04      The interconnection with Costa Rica was recommended by a recently
completed feasibility study carried out by Kennedy and Donkin (UK) for ENALUF
and ICE.  This study was financed by CABEI, with a view to financing the
project.  ICE has applied to CABEI for financing of the Costa Rican portion
of the interconnection and CABEI has declared the project eligible for financ-
ing. Based on the feasibility study, ENALUF and ICE are currently negotiat-
ing an interconnection contract. Disbursements from the proposed loan for the
Nicaraguan portion of the interconnection would be conditioned on the effec-
tiveness of this contract and on presentation of satisfactory assurances on
the availability of funds for the Costa Rican portion.
Project Cost
4.05      The project is estimated to cost US$32.3 million with a foreign
component of about US$20.2 million. Total financial requirements (including
financial charges during construction) are US$36.2 million and US$24.2 million,
respectively. The cost for lines, substations and distribution equipment is
based on recent quotes obtained in Costa Rica and Honduras; and for the load
dispatch center, on a recent installation with similar scope in Panama.
These costs have been adjusted for expected end-1976 Nicaraguan conditions.
The cost of engineering and other consulting services was estimated by ENALUF;
compared with recent projects of similar scope, they are reasonable. The
detailed cost estimate is shown in Annex 9 and summarized as follows:

Engineering
4.07      To gain experience in managing non-turnkey installations, ENALUF
has agreed to hire consultants for engineering and construction supervision.
They would perform most of their work at ENALUF to maximize training of
counterpart staff. ENALUF has agreed to employ consultants satisfactory
to the Bank. Annex 12 outlines agreed procedures expected to be followed for
hiring the consultants. As shown in Annex 9, the average cost for consulting
services (excluding price contingency, travel and subsistence) was estimated
at about US$4,300 per man-month.
Procurement and Disbursements
4.08      All contracts for Bank-financed works, goods and services (other
than for consultants and training) would be awarded through international
competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with guidelines for procurement under
Bank loans except for: (i) imported special protective relaying and metering
equipment (for substations) which is not suitable for ICB because of the need
for standardization, to be purchased on a negotiated basis at an estimated
cost of about US$0.35 million; and (ii) other items of imported equipment and
materials, totalling about US$0.2 million, which would be required in small
quantities and which would be impractical for ICB, also to be procured on a
negotiated basis. Suppliers whose bids contain items produced in the Central
American Common Market (CACM) - of which Nicaragua is a member - would be
granted preference of the lower of 15% of the CIF landed price or 50% of the
applicable import duty. Items which could be competitive under this arrange-
ment would include conductors for the lines, construction materials (including
wood poles), low voltage switchgear and distribution transformers, accounting
for up to about US$2.2 million of the amount proposed for financing by the
Bank.
4.09      To obtain better prices, ENALUF plans to package the items, to be
procured for the construction of the works, in agreement with the Bank.
Complete supply-and-erect contracts would be awarded for the transmission
lines, as is present practice, because of the smallness of these works. There
is a sufficient number of experienced local or regional firms which are expec-
ted to be engaged for civil and erection works; however, most of the major
equipment would be installed under suppliers' supervision. Some construction,
which would not be Bank-financed, is expected to be performed by ENALUF's own
forces. Agreed project implementation schedules (Annex 10) would provide the
basis for project progress reporting.
4.10      ENALUF and the Government have confirmed that they would continue,
under the proposed project, their practice of reducing shipping costs through
waivers, issued by the appropriate agencies, of any provisions of the shipping
law of Nicaragua which would lead to delays, or freight charges above those of
regular shipping lines and maritime conferences.
4.11      Disbursements would be made for the percentages of costs shown
below:
(i)  100% of the foreign exchange cost of imported equipment
and materials and of the foreign currency cost of installation
supervision;



- 16 -
(ii)  92% 1/ of the ex-factory cost of contracts for goods awarded
to Nicaraguan manufacturers;
(iii) 75% 2/ of the total cost of locally procured goods for
the project's distribution component up to the limit shown
in paragraph 4.08 (ii);
(iv)  100% of the foreign exchange cost of training and of the
total cost of services of consultants and experts; and
(v)  100% of the financial charges on the Bank loan through June 1979.
Retroactive financing is recommended up to US$0.8 million for expenditures
after July 1, 1976 for studies and engineering to advance the preparation
of the project. Annex 11 shows the estimated loan disbursements, with a
closing date of March 31, 1981. Because of the ongoing nature of distribution
investments of ENALUF any funds remaining undisbursed at the completion of the
project would be applied to other works of a similar nature, after agreement
of the Bank.
Environmental Effects
4.12      The transmission lines and substations included in the project
are not expected to have a major effect upon the environment; substation
works would be almost entirely in existing installations. Only two new
substations would be built, both in uncongested rural areas. Having recently
experimented with esthetic design for 69 kV lines while rerouting circuits
near Managua, ENALUF is conscious of their visual impact and intends to
minimize the impact of the proposed new lines. ENALUF has covenanted to
carry out the project with due regard to environmental factors.
Project Risks
4.13      The physical components of the project are relatively simple and
their execution should involve few difficulties. The return on the low-
income electrification component could be notably less than projected if the
rate of new connections is lower than expected. ENALUF has therefore agreed
to consult with the Bank on measures to improve this rate if actual results
are lower than those shown in the project performance indicators. Successful
implementation of the recommendations of the studies and of the management
assistance component of the project will require a high degree of commitment
1/   To exclude the element of local taxes in the case of possible purchases
from Nicaraguan suppliers.
2/   To exclude the mark-up by local suppliers and the element of local
taxes paid by ENALUF.



- 17 -
on the part of the Government and ENALUF. Although the risk exists that
Nicaragua and Costa Rica would not agree on a satisfactory implementation of
the interconnection it is considered to be small, given the benefits which the
project would bring to both countries. Elimination of the interconnection
would not notably affect the program's rate of return since the return on the
interconnection alone is very close to the return on the investment program
(paras. 5.07-5.09).
5. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PROJECT
Project Objectives
5.01      The project is an integral part of ENALUF's investment program.
The purpose of the major part (over 70%) of the project investment is to
complement the generation and transmission facilities provided by the eighth
power project. The bulk of the transmission investment would provide sub-
station capacity to serve the rapid industrial expansion which has resulted
from the policy of promoting Nicaragua's manufacturing sector. In addition to
the large increase of facilities serving industrial, irrigation and pumping
loads, the project would allow ENALUF and the retailers which it supplies to
provide electricity to about 400,000 additional people in Nicaragua during the
project period. The distribution component of the project would provide
exclusively for extension of service to the low-income sections of ENALUF's
concession area (para. 2.14).
5.02      The project would help the Government in developing a program to
rationalize power sector organization and would include the preparation
of a national master plan for the sector, which is urgently needed to es-
tablish priorities in its future development plans based on least cost com-
parison of alternatives. The marginal cost tariff study would enable ENALUF
to determine how the present tariff structure should be gradually changed in
order to provide for the most economical use of electricity. The consulting
services and expert assistance for management and administrative improvements,
combined with the engagement of a General Coordinator to assist the Executive
President, are expected to notably improve the efficiency of ENALUF.
Demand and Supply Forecast
5.03      Annex 13 describes the characteristics of demand by areas and the
basis for the load forecast which is given in the appraisal. The sales fore-
cast by categories to 1981 is in Annex 14. The number of clients (including
those not directly served by ENALUF) is expected to increase at about 6.4% per
annum, from 145,000 in 1975 to about 210,000 in 1981, for the whole country.
In this period ENALUF's sales are expected to increase at 12.1% per annum,
from 680 GWh to 1,350 GWh. With the forecasted tariffs, sales during the
period through 1981 to industry and irrigation are expected to continue to
grow rapidly (at annual rates of 12.3% and 15.5% respectively). Growth of
residential consumption supplied directly by ENALUF is expected to be slower
(9.1% per annum). However, because of the sales to retailers (cooperatives



- 18 -
and other distributors) unsatisfied demand by residential users would be
reduced notably since the proportion of the country's population with access
to electric service would increase from the present 41% to about 50% in 1981.
These projections are reasonable.
5.04      Annex 5 shows the energy balance to 1987, which is based on the
above forecast and, in addition, assumes sales of energy to ENEE (Honduras)
during the 1978-1981 period and purchases from ICE (Costa Rica). After
1982, purchases from Honduras are forecast on the assumption that a large
Honduran hydroelectric project will be operational in that year. However,
due to lack of firm commitments, purchases from Honduras have been excluded
from the rate of return calculations.
Low-Income Area Electrification Component
5.05      Supply of electricty in low-income areas of urban communities has
not been adequately pursued in the past. These areas are often near existing
primary distribution lines. Thus, using low-cost rural distribution tech-
niques , they could be supplied at notably less than ENALUF's normal average
cost per connection. The proposed distribution component would significantly
improve on past connection policies and practices. Appropriate criteria have
been agreed for selecting the areas which would be given priority. The
financial returns on the investments should be above 4-5%. The socio-economic
returns would be considerably higher, however, as they would include benefits
for education and security from improved lighting and increase the potential
for employment in small workshops within the areas to be served. Based on
ENALUF's initial inventory of villages and urban communities some 160 poten-
tial priority locations (housing some 60,000 people) have been identified for
this first pilot program. Annex 19 describes in more detail the methodology
to be used for selecting the areas to be connected. It was agreed that ENALUF
would submit a detailed report showing pertinent details on the areas selected
on the basis of the agreed criteria as a condition for disbursement for
this component.
Least Cost Solution
5.06      Kennedy and Donkin's feasibility study has demonstrated that the
interconnection is the least cost alternative for supplying ENALUF's system
during the periods when surplus energy is available in Costa Rica. The
interconnection would provide ENALUF with an additional source of non fuel
based energy, allowing Nicaragua to reduce its oil imports. The proposed
routing and design of the interconnection line and associated substations
would constitute the least cost alternative for all discount rates higher than
12% annually. The least cost analysis for the other physical project compo-
nents is summarized in Annex 20.
Return on Investment
5.07      A rate of return on the overall investment program, rather than on
the project alone, has been estimated in view of the complexity of the systems



- 19 -
effects, and of the difficulty in allocating the benefits (measured in terms
of revenues) provided by the project or its components. Annex 18 shows the
details of the calculations and assumptions to obtain the discount rate for
equalizing the present worth of the revenues derived from incremental sales at
1976 tariffs (as a minimum measure of benefits) and the investment and annual
operating, maintenance and general administration costs. The return on the
investment in the program would be 13.1%. If sunk costs incurred prior to
1976 are excluded, the rate would increase to 16.2%. A sensitivity analysis
shows that this return would reduce to 10.3% and 12.7%, respectively, if
investment costs are assumed to increase by 10% and simultaneously benefits
are assumed to decline by 10%.
5.08      These rates, being in line with the probable opportunity cost of
capital in Nicaragua, suggest that consumers are presently paying -- on
average -- a price that reflects incremental costs. However, imbalances
in the tariff structure should be adjusted (para. 2.16).
5.09      The actual economic return on the investment program is, however,
higher than calculated since the above does not include the indirect benefits
to industry, commerce and other large consumers whose contribution to pro-
duction would likely be lower if they would have to finance their own, higher
cost, electricity generation facilities.
6. FINANCE
SummarY
6.01      ENALUF's financial performance was poor in 1973 and 1974 due to
the 1972 earthquake and the energy crisis, which adversely affected sales
and earnings. As a result of tariff action in 1974-75, the performance of
the utility improved in 1975-1976. ENALUF's performance during the project
period, as reflected in the projected indicators listed in Attachment 1 to
Annex 16, would be satisfactory. ENALUF would earn a return of 8.5% on
annually revalued average net operating assets, and finance 22% of its large
investment program from internal resources. Annex 16 contains details on
ENALUF's finances which supplement the summary analysis given below.
Past Earnings and Financial Position
6.02      ENALUF's financial performance through 1972 was very good, and it
had no difficulty in complying with the requirement under prior Bank loans
that it earn a return of 9% on net fixed assets in operation. In 1973-1974,
the impact of the earthquake, local and international inflation, and
increased investment expenditures resulting from cost overruns on the
eighth project caused a decline in earnings and negative net cash flows.
ENALUF's returns on net average unrevalued operating assets were 4.4% in 1973
and 5.8% in 1974, and it had to borrow about US$21.5 million (C$150.3 million)
from commercial sources. To improve its financial position ENALUF hired the



- 20 -
consulting firm of R.W. Beck & Associates (USA) to conduct a tariff and re-
valuation study. The study ultimately led to implementation of a nonautomatic
fuel adjustment clause (in 1974), a general tariff increase (in 1975), a
revaluation of assets as of December 31, 1974, and significant improvement in
ENALUF's rate of return (8.4% in 1975 on revalued assets).
6.03      Overdue accounts receivable had created problems for ENALUF in the
past, and ENALUF agreed under previous loans to take all necessary action to
maintain the total amount of its accounts receivables in arrears below 110% of
the total average monthly billing corresponding to the 90 days immediately
preceding the date of calculation (Annex 16, Attachment 10, para. 15). ENALUF's
performance under this provision (which is repeated in the proposed loan
agreement) has been good.
Financing Plan
6.04      ENALUF's total funding requirements of US$286.2 million during the
project period, 1976-1980, are summarized below, together with the proposed
financing plan. Details are given in Attachment 3 to Annex 16.

/1   Excludes short-term bank borrowings.
6.05      The financing plan assumes application of the tariff policy des-
cribed in paragraph 6.07, which would result in the financing of 22% of
ENALUF'S large investment program from internally generated resources. As
noted in paragraphs 2.13 and 2.20, the Government is providing contributions
for rural electrification and geothermal development, which would account
for 7% of total requirements. The balance of these requirements would be
financed through borrowing.
6.06      The proposed Bank loan for US$22.0 million would be made to ENALUF
for a term of 17 years, including 3.5 years grace. Interest on the loan
has been assumed to be 8.5%. The proposed loan would finance US$1.8 million
of interest and other financial charges during construction on the Bank loan
in order to alleviate the heavy financial strain associated with ENALUF's
large investment program. The proposed loan also includes funding (US$154,000)
for a sector organization study (see item vi, para 4.02 (c)) to be carried out
under the direction of NPD. ENALUF would act only as disbursing agent for
this portion of the loan. The terms of ENALUF's other borrowing are summarized
in Attachment 9 of Annex 16. As noted in paragraph 2.21, studies have yet to
be completed on several large projects included in ENALUF's construction



- 22 -
program. ENALUF agreed not to undertake any major expansion project, other
than the project, without providing evidence satisfactory to the Bank that
such expansion is economically justified and that adequate financial resources
are available for carrying it out. A major expansion project is defined as
one costing more than 1% of the value of gross fixed assets in operation.
Future Earnings and Financial Position
6.07      ENALUF's projected income statements are shown in Annex 16, Attach-
ment 2. They are based on the assumption that tariffs would be set at a level
sufficent to produce a rate of return of at least 8.5% on annually revalued
average net fixed assets in operation. The Government and ENALUF have agreed
to adjust tariffs as required to meet this objective.
6.08      The forecasts show that ENALUF's finances should continue to improve
over the construction period of the project. The operating ratio would
decline from 67% in 1976 to 54% in 1980 and the debt-equity ratio would not
exceed 47/53. As under previous loans, ENALUF has agreed to retain all its
earnings for reinvestment in new facilities until the project is completed.
6.09      ENALUF's future annual debt-service coverage ratios are expected to
be between 1.49 and 1.63, which would be satisfactory. ENALUF agreed to seek
prior Bank concurrence to new long-term borrowing whenever net revenues are
less than 1.5 times the maximum debt-service requirement for any succeeding

APPRAISAL OF THE NINTH POWER PROJECT - NICARAGUA
Power Transmission Project
Empresa Nacional de Luz y Fuerza (ENALUF)
Organization of the Electric Power Sector
and Supply of Electricity
1.        Before the establishment of ENALUF electricity was supplied in
Nicaragua mainly by Private companies and entrepreneurs, in addition to some
municipalities. ENALUF grew out of an initial consolidation and merger of
several electricity companies; it was created by decree Law No. 102,
published October 23, 1954 (which was amended by decree Laws No. 86,
published April 19, 1968, and No. 656 published Novenber 21, 1974) for the
purpose of generating, transmitting and distributing electricity and
complementary activities. The Government is the owner of ENALUI which has been
formally under the control of the Ministerio de Obras Publicas (MOP) since
the 197h Constituent Law amendment. ENALUF operates, as do all other public
electricity suppliers in Nicaragua, on the basis of concessions (about 70),
granted mainly in 1957 when the Electric Industry Law was decreed.
Public Service Supply
2.        ENALUF's role as a national electricity supply undertaking was
mainly established in 1958 with the installation of two 15 MW steam electric
units in Managua and associated 69 kV transmission lines interconnecting the
isolated systems of Managua, Leon, Chinandega, Masaya and Granada; these works
were financed by the Bank (Loan 121-NI). Since then, ENALUF has continued to
incorporate  other isolated systems into what has become the National
Interconnected System (NIS) supplying the northern, central and Pacific coastal areas
which contain more than 90% of Nicaragua's population. Some towns on
the Caribbean coast continue to be served by isolated diesels. The name plate
generating capacity of ENALUF grew from 40.3 MW in 1958 to 212.5 MW in
1974 - an increase of 427%; the production of energy increased in the same
period from 60 to 764 GWh - an increase of 1173% at a remarkable growth of
17.2% per year.
3.        At the end of 1975, ENALUF's nameplate capacity had been reduced to
201.5 MW and effective capability to 193 MW due to the retirement of several
diesels, mainly at the Managua power plant, because of earthquake damage.
The effective capability included 100 NW (52%) hydro, 70 MW (36%) steam electric,
8 MW (4%) diesel, and 15 MW (8%) gas turbine. ENALUF expects the first 50 MW
unit of the Tiscuco 100 MW steam electric plant (near Puerto Somoza), financed
by Loan 840-NI, to be fully commissioned in February 1977, and the second in
July 1977. In 1975, ENALUF's gross generation was 821 GWh, of which 353 GWh (43X)
was produced by hydro and the balance by fuel burning plant. Transmission and
distribution losses and station use accounted for 141 GWh (a very reasonable
17.2%) leading to total sales of about 680 GWh. Maximum demand was about 141
MW. About 83% of these sales went to direct customers and 17% to the other
retailers in the country.



ANNEX 2
Page 2 of 3 pages
4.        ENALUF's generation and sales grew at an average annual rate of
about 12% in 1966-75 while it was extending service to new areas and whole-
sale clients. The number of direct customers rose from 51,200 to about
93,000, at about 7% per year in the same period. Excluding wholesale, per
capita electricity generation in ENALUF's concession area was about 1,250 kWh
in 1974, which was about 4 times the national average of 321 kWh; this
reflects the heavy incidence of large clients in ENALUF sales. However,
already about 60% of the population living in ENALUF's direct service area has
service as compared with about 40% in the whole country.
5.        Attachment 1 to this Annex shows the 1974 national electric energy
supply situation in detail. ENALUF owned 81% of the country's electricity
generation at year-end; this percentage will increase to 86% in 1977. The
other producers' generation is mainly based on bagasse-fired steam plant and
diesels; summarized below is the composition of installed capacity and generation:
Installed Capacity      Generation
MW        %         GWh        %
Hydro                     103       39.3      369        42.2
Steam                      93       35.5       427       48.9
Diesel                     51       19.5       74         8.5
Gas turbine                15        5.7         4        0.5
262     100.0       874      100.0
Fuel based generation is expected to increase to 70% in 1978 (Attachment 3);
thereafter, geothermal generation is expected to rapidly reduce dependency on fuel,
and generation from indigenous sources is expected to reach about 80% in 1982.
Transmission and Subtransmission
6.        ENALUF continues to extend its interconnected 138/69 kV system of
613 km (of which about 330 km are at 138 kV) and 30 substations with 558 MVA
capacity. The principal transmission lines are those which link the Centro-
america and General A. Somoza G. hydropower plants to the cities of Managua
and Leon.  ENALUF also operates the 224 km of 138 kV and 132 km of 69 kV lines
and five substations with 60 MVA of the five rural electric cooperatives. The
private companies and municipalities do not have transmission and subtransmissicn
facilities.
Distribution and Market
7.        ENALUF distributes about 83% of the electricity sold in Nicaragua for
public use to the final consumer. The five cooperatives, thirteen private companies
and three municipalities distribute the balance to about 37% of the clients in
the country as shown in the following table:

22         120              135.7             100.0
The five cooperatives and the Departments of the country they serve are:
AMERRISQUE (Boaca); CONODER (Chinandega); COERDI (Rivas); CODERSE (Las
Segovias) and CAEER (Masaya). The six major private and municipal companies
are: Compania Electrica de Carazo; Compania Electrica de Corinto;"Matagalpa
Power and Annex";Empresa de Servicios Publicos de Chinandega; Empresa Electrica
de Esteli; and Empresas Municipales de Luz y Agua de Masaya.
8.        Primarily 13.8 kV and 25 kV is used for distribution, the latter in
the low density rural areas. Future expansion is standardized at these voltages.
ENALUF's distribution design standards are modern and largely based on the expe-
rience gained with the rural electrification program carried out in 1969-1975
with US-AID financing. The overall quality of service appears satisfactory,
including that of the private companies.
9.        As the private companies apparently are able to finance their distribution
system additions from operations and without government support, ENkLUF has no
immediate plans for future acquisitions since it needs all available funds to
complete its ambitious 1976-80 expansion program. However, ENALUF plans
to increase its sales to the retailers substantially during this period and to
serve more clients directly by carrying out the first stage of the second
National Electrification Plan with the help of IDB financing. The first stage
would (at an estimated cost of about US$21 million) supply electricity to
about 22 000 clients within ten years of operation,covering an area of about
4,600 km0 with a population of about 71,000 in the Matagalpa and Rama areas
Some 260 km of transmission and 1,800 km of distribution lines with 33 MVA
of stepdown transformer capacity would be provided. The Government is contrib-
uting US$4.35 million as equity to ENALUF for the project.
Captive Plants
10.       As of early 1975 there were fifteen major and several other industrial
power plants in operation,as shown in Attachment 1, with an installed capacity
of 45.5 MW. They generated, in 1974 a total of 103 GWh,or about 12% of the total
electricity produced. About 18 MW of this capacity are in steam units at sugar
estates burning bagasse, about 3 MW are hydroelectric, and about 25 MW are
diesel. The largest non-steam electric installations are 2.4 MW of hydro by a
gold mining company, two 4.5 MW diesels by two other mining companies, 3.3 MW
diesels by a cement producer, 1.6 MW diesels by the refinery, and 1.4 MW diesels
by a vegetable oil factory. The other diesel installations are less than 1 MW each.
The probability that these plants will interconnect with PTALUF is low because
most of the plants are remote from ENALUF's system or provide process steam.

Fuel Supply and Impact of Oil Crisis
1.        Nicaragua imports all its petroleum requirements.  The present capacity
of the country's only refinery, which is owned by ESSO and located in the western
part of Managua city, is about 19,600 barrels 1/ per day (bbl/d) sufficient to
supply Nicaragua's consumption of about 14,000bbl/d now and to 1985, when petro-
leum product use is expected to reach about 17,000 bbl/d. The refinery's products
are sold by several private distributors. The Government's projection of national
consumption and refinery utilization 2/ is as follows:

This projection assumes that ENALUF's Momotombo geothermal project will produce
substantial amounts of electricity beginning in 1979- The first Momotombo unit of
35 MW is estimated to reduce fuel requirements by some 1,850 bbl/d and the subsequent
two 50 MW units bv about 2,700 bbl/d for each. On this basis, most of the fuel will
continue to be used for transport 5/ (40%) and in industry (25%).
2.        Nicaragua paid US$11.9 million equivalent for imported petroleum in 1972;
this figure increased to over US$51 million equivalent (430%) in 1974.  The follow-
ing table shows the recent approximate price development for petroleum products in
Nicaragua.
1/ 1 ton of petroleum corresponds to about 7 barrels.

Low fuel consumption in 1975 was due to high hydro production in very wet year.

ENALUF paid about US$10,2 million for fuel in 1975. The effect of the about 3.2 times
higher cost over 1973 prices for Bunker C on ENALUF's and Nicaragua's fuel bill will
be aggravated in the next few years since an increasing amount (up to about 70% in
1978) of electricity will have to come from fuel based generation.During 1976,the
price to ENALUF for Bunker C fuel remained virtually unchanged,increasing from US$/bbl
11.51 in 1975 (delivered at the Managua steam electric plant) to an estimated US$/bbl
11.60 for the last 1976 quarter. Under the new fuel supply contract with ESSO,
ENALUF expects the prices for delivery of Bunker C fuel at the 100 MW Tiscuso steam
electric plant (directly from tanker through ESSO's and ENALUF's fuel oil pipelinea
to the plant) to be as follows:

APPRAISAL OF THE NINTH POWER PROJECT - NICARAGUA
Power Transmission Project
Empresa Nacional de Luz y Fuerza (ENALUF)
Outline of Terms of Reference for a Power Sector
Organization Study for Nicaragua
General
1.        The general responsibility for the oversight of the energy and electric
power sector development has been vested in the recently created National Planning
Council (NPC). The National Planning Directorate (NPD) of the NPC is making
preparations to implement this mandate. NPD's first steps would be to try to
rationalize and strengthen the organization and planning of these sectors. As the
present electric power sector organization and policy formulation need to be
strengthened and coordination improved, the study outlined below is intended to
be executed (as part of the ninth power project) under the overall direction of
NPD with the active cooperation of ENALUF, the National Institute of Electric
Energy (NIEE), Ministerio de Obras P-iblicas (MOP) and all other Government entities
which play or may in the future play an important role in the power sector. The
organization study would provide the basis for the improvement needed in the power
sector for implementing the large projects for generation, transmission and distri-
bution of electricity presently under discussion in the Government (such as Copalar)
on the basis of priorities for national electricity supply. The priorities are to
be established with the help of the master plan which ENALUF and its consultants
are expected to prepare under the ninth project; the master plan would take into
account the regional interconnections in Central America.
Outline of Terms of Reference
2.        The proposed organization study would first establish the general purpose
and aims of the future development of the power sector in the context of the national
energy policy which has been or is being formulated and any applicable regional
considerations.  All policies established, including those stated in the short and
medium term government plans, would be initially reviewed and the priorities or
objectives commented upon.
3.        An analysis would be made of (i) the existing and contemplated legislation
(including decrees and regulations) and practices; (ii) the duties assigned to,
actually carried out by, or contemplated to be given to, the entities of the power
sector; (iii) the problems which are the result of poor coordination of responsi-
bilities and actions, insufficient definition or overlapping of responsibilities,
and lack of training and experience; and (iv) conflicting interests of the different
entities, including of the private component in the sector.
L.        Based on the analysis, practical alternatives to overcome the problems
identified or anticipated would be proposed and reviewed with the affected entities.
The purpose of the review would be to enlist an early and full cooperation of these
entities in the implementation of recommendations resulting from the analysis for

improving, in addition to the organization structure of the sector, inter--rnlity
communications, cooperation and coordination as well as administrative a,n
operational procedures and the legal framework.  Special emphasis would De g ;e..
to establishing the criteria and responsibilities of a national and nati';rTb-- e
system of electricity tariffs, taking into consideration the marginal cost - qer-ice
tariff study ENALUF will contract.
Implementation
5.         The power sector orgarn i,a:uL l1 stsudy 4ould be carried out by a consu: ting
firm or individual consultants  who xouLd be cont,fcted under terms of referer-e
developed in consultation with  ,1e 13E'ari   NPD would direct this study and for thiis
purpose prepare, as shown below-,-rafr terms of reference which it  would
develop in consultation witl MPO)M-.  ENALUI2, NIEE,  and other entities
likely to be affected.  Formafon of arm sd hoi-; working group should expedite the
preparation of the draft and prova le for an initial exchange of information and
coordination of activities while the sti'd: is being carried out.
6.         The tentative timetable for the study would be:
- Preparation of draft terms of reference
by NPD                                                 by 3/31/77
- Agreement with Bank on terms of reference
and short list of consultants                          by 5/31/77
- Invitation of consultant proposals                      by 6/30/77
- Award of consulting contract                            by 9/30/77
- Draft report of consultant                              by February 1978
- Final report of consultant                              by May 1978
- Consultaticn-. of Government and Bank                   by August 1978
- Implementation of Recommendations                       from October 1978
7.        During negotiations, NPD has agreed to the above timetable and to follow
the method described in Annex 12 of this report for employing the consultants for the
sector organization study.

ANNEX 6

APPRAISAL OF THE NINTH POWER PROJECT - NICARAGUA
Power Transmission Project
Empresa Nacional de Luz y Fuerza (ENALUF)
Interconnections with Honduras and Costa Rica;
Momotombo Geothermal Project; Hydropower Development
of the Matagalpa River (COPALAR)
Interconnections with Honduras and Costa Rica
1.        In line with Nicaragua's policy of regional integration and in order to
provide diversification of the energy supply base,ENALUF's basic transmission
expansion plans assume that the National Interconnected System (NIS) will be
operating interconnected with the Honduran system of Empresa Nacional de
Energia Electrica (ENEE) as at present and with the Costa Rica system of Instituto
Costarricense de Electricidad (ICE) in the near future.
2.        Built for 230 kV, the interconnection to ENEE which was installed
under ENALUF's eighth power project with foreign cost financing of the Bank (Loans
840-NI and 841-HO),has been in operation at 138kV since October 1976.The operation of
the interconnection with ICE is expected by mid-1979.
3.        On the basis of the interconnection with ENEE, assuming that
excess power and energy from El Cajon hydro project will be available from l982 on,
ENALUF has projected substantial interchanges over the Honduran interconnection
as shown in Annex 5. After the addition of the 135MW geothermal plant at Momotombo
during 1979-1981, the most critical year of ENALUF reliance on ENEE will be 1984
if Copalar units are commissioned from mid-1985 on.  In view of the large blocks
of power (37 to 77 M) and energy (188 to 590 GWh) projected to be imported by
ENALUF from ENEE in 1982-1986, both will have to agree on amending the intercon-
nection contract (which presently provides only for emergency interchange of
reserves and energy) for firm power and energy deliveries. The amendment is
expected to be negotiated once ENEE completes its study of interconnection
tariffs as part of updating of the feasibility studies of El Cajon.
4.        The interconnection with Costa Rica would be used mainly for off-peak
energy sales from ICE's run-of-river hydro plants. However, the Kennedy & Donkin
study has taken into consideration possible future firm power transfers in order
to maximize the economic benefits from the line. -



ANNEX 6
Page 2 of 3 pages
5.        If the two interconnections are made according to the above time-
table Nicaragua would assume early a strategic position in the interchange
transactions on a regional basis for the Central American Isthmus. In order
to take full advantage of this position (for instance as a broker of possible
future interchanges between Costa Rica and Honduras), ENALUF will need to make an early
start in training its management, system operations engineers, supervisory
staff and operators for the new conditions.
6.        In addition, the more complex operation of a multinational interconnection
will require better communication and load dispatch facilities. The facilities to be
Provided will need -to be determined on the basis of a study of alternative designs
before bid specifications can be prepared. The proposed loan provides funds for the
study and the training of dispatching manpower, in addition to funds for a national
load dispatch.
Momotombo Geothermal Project
7.        The eighth power project appraisal report (No. PU-92a, June 2, 1972)
indicated that the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) was financing
a feasibility study for a geothermal development near the Momotombo volcano
in which the Bank had expressed a "special interest" and that a 30 MW geothermal
plant might be justified in Nicaragua for the early 1980s. The UNDP
study was discontinued after the Managua earthquake of December 1972 because of
manpower and counterpart fund shortages.
8.        As result of the 1973 fuel crisis and the Bank encouragement to advance the
investigation of geothermal potential in Nicaragua, ENALUF, in early 1974, contracted
a private loan to finance the continuation of the work begun by UNDP. It engaged
the services of Electroconsult (Italy) and Foremines (France) and obtained the secon-
dement of UNDP's project manager of the discontinued project for the preparation of
a 135 MW Momotombo geothermal project. Originally ENALUF had hoped that the geothermal
project would be ready for Bank appraisal in 1975. After some initial delays and set-
backs in the drilling activities in 1975, ENALUF has now completed the feasibility
study for the first unit at Momotombo. Electroconsult has proposed the installation
of a 35 MW unit based on the presently proven amount of steam.
9.        With an annual gross requirement o f about 1600 GWh expec'ed in 1981
and hydropower facilities sufficient to produce only 350 GWh, geothermal energy
is Nicaragua's present hope for an early electric energy self-sufficiency. While
the first 35 MW unit could cost about US$52 million (excluding interest during
construction) and the second and third unit of 50 MW each, about US$47.3 million and
US$51.3 million respectively, these units would produce about 1,010 GWh and reduce
ENALUF's bill for imported fuel by some US$32.0 million annually.
10.       In order to commission the first unit at Momotombo as early as possible
(mid-1979),ENALUF and the Government are carrying out advanced negotiations for a loan
from Japan for a supplier financed turnkey installation and intend to seek participa-
tion of international agencies in the financing of the subsequent two units.
11        Because the geothermal generation would immediately displace fuel
based thermal electric energy in Nicaragua, Honduras and Costa Rica, it would
be to Ilicaraguals advantage to accelerate geothermal plant construction as
much as possible. In view of this,the Government has helped ENALUF to speed up
the drilling and exploration and is providing substantial funds from its budget
on a periodic basis, thus relieving ENALUF of the financial risks of the drilling.

12.       ENALUF has set up a special project unit for the study and preparation
of the geothermal project. Several young ENALUF engineers are assigned full-
time to the project and have been receiving university training in Italy
in geothermal subjects. To expose them to diversified practical experience in
the execution of the Momotombo project and to eventually decide on their
permanent assignments within the project,ENALUF's VicePresident for Engineering
(who continues to manage the project on a day-to-day basis himself) has been rotating
their assignment. For the benefit of the project and to free the Vicepresident
for his other management duties, ENALUF should strengthen this unit, assign a
capable project manager and make other assignments subject to less frequent
rotation.
Copalar Hydropower Development
13.       ENALUF's consultant IECO (USA) completed, in late 1975, a prefeasibilit-.-
studyfor hydroelectric development of the Matagalpa river within a medium-
term expansion plan (to 1988) for the National Interconnected System %NIS).
The Government--through its ViceMinistry for the Development of the Atlantic
Coast--has contracted a feasibility studyfor the development,which includes
the Copalar hydropower project as a main component. The feasibility study is
expected to be completed in early 1977 by a group of consultants (Canadian
International Project Management) headed by Montreal Engineering Company (Canada).
The Government has indicated that the recommended hydro projects would be built by
ENALUF and that financing would be sought from international lending agencies.
14.       In 1975, IECO recommended the Copalar hydro power project as the
technically and economically most promising scheme, consisting of:
(i) a high dam at Copalar and reservoir, with additional regulation
from an upstream dam and hydro development at Paso Real; or
(ii) a low dam at Copalar and reservoir, with two upstream dams and
regulation reservoirs at El Carmen and at Paso Real.
The Paso Real project would be similar for both alternatives. In an average
hydro year,the two dam alternative would produce 1610 GWh (1413 GWh at Copalar
and 196 GWh at Paso Real), about 18% more than the three dam alternative with
1366 GWh (850 GWh at Copalar, 317 GWh at El Carmen, and 199 GWh at Paso Real).
The two-dam alternative has the higher construction cost (about US$250 million
excluding interest during construction and price escalation) and requires that
a larger capital investment be made earlier; the construction cost for the three
dam alternative would be about 3.5% less. While it appears that the two dam
alternative may be more economical in the long run, topographic uncertainty is expect-
ed to limit the height of the high Copalar dam.
15.       Copalar could provide the indigenous energy source for the medium term
to complement the base load energy to be provided by geothermal plant and,
together with power purchases from Honduras and Costa Rica, could supply the
ENALUF system with sufficient capacity and energy to meet load growth to the
end of the 1980s.

Method to be Employed for Qontracting Banlk-financed
Consultant Services
1.       -ENALUF -  would prepare and send draft: terms of reference, a short
list of capable firms, proposal invitation, and other proposal documents for
Bank review and comments.
2.        The request for proposals would be issued to short listed
consultants on the basis of terms of reference and other proposal documents
taking into account the views of the Bank; if financial terms are requested
with the proposal, the consultant would submit them in a separate sealed
envelope which would be opened only after the proposals have been evaluated.
3.        Proposal evaluation by ENALUF -/ would generally follow the method-
ology the Bank uses and which is described in paragraplB 1.39 to 1 43 on
pages 13 and 14 of the Bank's booklet entitled "Uses of Consultants by the
World Bank and its Borrowers - April 1974." The Bank would be given an
opportunity to comment on the ranking established in order of merit.
4.        ENALUF -/ would invite the best firm tentatively selected in agree-
ment with the Bank for contract negotiations in Nicaragua; if the negotia-
tions were unsuccessful, the firm next in ranking would be asked to come
for negotiations.
5.        Contract negotiations between ENALUF 1- and the conauiltant would basically
follow the steps outlined in paragraphs 1.44 to 1.48 on pages 14 and 15
of the booklet; the Bank would then receive a draft of the negotiated contract
and terms of reference for its final review and comments; and
6.        The responsibility for supervision of the consultants services would
rest with ENALIJF _/ which would inform the Bank of progress within an agreed scope
and periodicity.

Electricity Demand Forecast
Characteristics of Demand by Areas
1.      The electric market of NIS -/consists mainly of three areas: west, central
and north. The western area includes the cities of the Pacific region where most
of the economic activity of the country is concentrated. The central and northern
areas are dedicated to agriculture and cattle raising; in these two areas elec-
tricity is used mainly for irrigation and other agricultural purposes.
2.      A main part of the industrial and commercial activity of the country is
in the greater Managua area, whereas the activity related to growing and processing
of cotton (the major source of foreign exchange for Nicaragua) is chiefly in the
Departments of Leon and Chinandega, in the most western and dry part of the country.
Some cotton is also grown in the Managua, Masaya and Granada areas. The cotton
industry is important for the electricity demand forecast because irrigation and
cotton ginning represent a very substantial seasonal load during November to April
when the harvested cotton is being processed. The annual system peak load occurs
in March/April.
3.      The central and northern areas are largely dedicated to cattle raising and
growing of coffee both of which contribute significantly to the economy of the
country. Recently, growing of rice and other agricultural products has increased
in the central area. About 65% of the electricity clients in Nicaragua are presently
served by ENALUF and, in an increasing degree, by five rural electric cooperatives
(about 20%) and some thirteen private electric power companies (about 15%); of these,
eight are major and mainly have concessions in the towns of Chinandega, Corinto,
Juigalpa, Esteli, Matagalpa, and in the Department of Carazo. The municipality of
Masaya distributes electricity in addition to water. On the other hand, the gener-
ation and transmission of electricity is mainly in the hands of ENALUF with about
99% of public supply and about 87% of total electricity generation.
Load Forecast by Supply Centers
4.      In order to predict the need for additional transmission lines and substations
for NIS, the service area is divided into 24 zones. The zones are combined according
to present and future supply centers (substations), giving consideration to existing
political divisions by Departments and to concession areas. The concessions of the
rural electric cooperatives cover very large areas, except for the first cooperative
(CAEER) in the Masaya Department. The cooperatives receive service directly from
ENALUF's high tension (138 kV) grid and own the substations, which usually step down
to 25 kV. At the end of 1974, NIS supplied 42 operating centers served from 17 sub-
stations.

5.       Future areas for rural electrification will, however, be served directly
by ENALUF. The Muy-Muy area of the Department of Matagalpa has been chosen as
the next area to be given electric service under the IDB-financed first stage
project of the Second National Electrification Plan. IDB's project also includes
extension of service to Rama in the Department of Zelaya, during the implementation
period of the proposed ninth project. The second stage would provide electrifica-
tion of the area in Jinotega and the border area of the Departments of Leon,
Matagalpa and Boaca.
6.       To make short-term sales predictions ENALUF's department of economic planning
and statistics studied, in 1974-75, the historic load development of 68 load centers.
These predictions, to 1982, were based on regression analysis by computer of consump-
tion in 1967-1974 by each client category 1/; they were adjusted for the load dis-
locations resulting from the December 1972 Managua earthquake and for the client re-
classification of late 1975/early 1976. During appraisal, this forecast was further
adjusted for the reduced growth in 1975 as result of the economic recession in
Nicaragua. But, as growth during the first three quarters of 1976 indicated an increase
of about 16% (instead of 12.1% calculated during appraisal) ENALUF has updated the
detailed forecast (Annex 14). The revised sales forecast is reasonable.
7.       The longer term predictions to 1990 made by ENALUF in 1974-75 were also
reviewed and adjusted during appraisal and are reasonable.  They are the basis
for ENALUF's present program for generating plant additions and interchanges over
the interconnections with Honduras and Costa Rica.
8.       The forecast sales were converted into electric energy requirements by
assuming that transmission losses and power station use will decline from about 19 to
17% of sales, which is reasonable and low. Using a load factor of about 65%, the
energy requirements were translated into the annual peak demands. This peak,
in turn, was used as the base for calculating noncoincident peak load of the
future supply substations. A coincidence factor of 0.7 for 1974 was projected to
increase to 0.72 for 1980. This methodology is acceptable.
9.       The details of the long-term predictions by supply centers are given
in the feasibility report for the proposed ninth power project which was prepared
by ENALUF's planning department. Annex 14 shows a summary sales forecast by
client category to 1981 as updated in accordance with paragraph 6 above.

APPRAISAL OF THE NINTH POWER PROJECT - NICARAGUA
Power Transmission Project
Empresa Nacional de Luz y Fuerza (ENALUF)
Summary of Current Tariffs in Nicaragua
ENALUF's Recent Tariff History
1.        As shown in greater detail in Attachment 1 to this Annex, average
prices per kWh declined continuously between 1966 and 1973. Between 1966
and 1972, the average price of electricity per kWh declined 17.7% (from
US$0.035 to US$0.029), with significantly larger declines for industrial and
irrigation customers (30.8% and 26.1%, respectively); in 1973, a year
of acute financial strain, the average price per kWh declined an additional
6.9%. Although the primary cause for this decline was a change in ENALUF's
sales and revenue mix - residential sales and revenue declined 25% and 23%,
respectively, from 1972 - the average price per kWh for industrial and
irrigation customers declined 1.9% and 2.7% in 1973. As a result of Bank
prompting (Annex 16), ENALUF took measures to raise tariffs in 1974 and 1975.
ENALUF's Tariff Structure
2.        ENALUF's tariff structure, which is summarized in Attachment 2,
of this Annex is designed to meet the political, economic and social
objectives of the Government to promote through low electricity tariffs,
the agricultural and industrial development of the country. For example,
the revenues per kWh for typical bills to large industrial and irrigation
users are US$0.0356 (tariff E4) and US$0.022(tariff I5), while the revenue
per kWh for a small domestic consumer (100 kWh) is US$0.089 (tariff R4).
These revenues may be compared with the expected cost (for fuel and losses
alone) from the thermal plant addition of 100 MW at Puerto Somoza of
US$0.023. There are several other tariffs which do not reflect costs,
e.g., the promotional tariffs offered milk producers (tariff E3) and
military personnel (tariff G5). Also, there are no off-peak or seasonal
charges. Attachment 3 of this Annex compares typical bills by customer
category of ENALUF.
3.        The connection policy and connection fees charged to new residential
customers are designed to discourage this type of demand. According to
ENALUF's management, it is company policy not to provide service to a
residential neighborhood if it is financed from ENALUF's revenue, unless
at least 50% of the residents are willing to subscribe and the marginal
revenues generated by the new connections in the first year equal the
cost of the connections (which the customers are obliged to meet by
making a contribution in aid of construction).  In addition to this con-
tribution, the new residential customer is required to make a deposit
equal to one month's estimated bill and to pay a connection fee.  The
connection fee ranges from a base of US$42.87 for estimated consumption
of 51 to 150 kWh to a ceiling of US$142.87 for estimated consumption of 400 kWh.
New "general" and "industrial" customers pay a flat connection fee of
US$28.57 per kVA; new "irrigation" customers pay no connection fee.



ANNEX 15

F     ;iYustment Clause
c ntly ENALUF reviews the adequacy of fuel adjustment
revenues quarterly using the formula shown below. All of ENALUF's tariffs
nrp c-11lject to adjustment for rising fuel costs as follows:
A  =    x0           1 D    I2  - 0.117, where
E
A = Fuel, and purchased energy adder per monthly billed kWh,
adjusted at beginning of each quarter in Cordobas;
B = Gallons of Bunker C fuel used by ENALUF during the 12 months
which end with the month prior to the billing quarter;
C = Energy purchased by ENALUF during the period stated for
B above;
D = Gallons of light diesel fuel used by ENALUF during the
period stated for B above;
E = kWh sold by ENALUF during the period stated for B above;
Po= Price billed to ENALUF for Bunker C fuel and its transport
by the fuel supplier during the quarter prior to the billing
quarter;
Pi= Average price billed to ENALUF for light diesel fuel and
its transport by the fuel supplier during the period stated
for Pn above;
P2= Average price paid by ENALUF for purchased energy during the
2 period stated for P above;
0
0.117 = ENALUF's base cost for fuel in Cordobas per kWh sold, based
on fuel consumption and energy sales during December 1974.
In order to avoid loss of revenue by late application of the fuel adjustment
clause, this clause will be made automatic, except that it would be modi-
fied to eliminate adjustments on account of diesel fuel price increases.
Diesel accounts for a very small portion of ENALUF's fuel bill, and this
modification would not lead to a significant revenue loss.
Honduran Interconnection
5.        The preliminary contract, signed in 1973 for interconnection sales,
provided for base prices of US$0.011 and US$0.018 per kWh for block and emergency pur-
chases of energy. These prices were subject to revision under a fuel-
adjustment clause which established ENALUF's base cost for Bunker C fuel



ANNEX 15
Page 3 of 3
at US$3.10 per barrel. As the base fuel cost has almost quadrupled,
leading to unreasonably high interchange rates, ENALUF and the Honduran
power company, Empresa Nacional de Energia Electrica (ENEE), are renego-
tiating these rates while presently operating the interconnection to result
in a zero balance over approximately each month. In the meantime ENALUJF
has made the following reasonable assumptions for the interchanges with
Honduras:

Costa Rican Interconnection
6.         The consultant's (Kennedy and Donkin - UK) feasibility study for
the proposed interconnection of ENALUF and the Instituto Costarricense de
Electricidad (ICE) provides recommendations for interchange rates and a draft
for an interconnection contract. During loan negotiations ENALUF indicated
that it had reached with ICE substantial agreement on the non-financial
parts of the contract and that interchange rates would be negotiated during
the first quarter of 1977. Meanwhile, ENALUF is assuming that it would be
able to buy energy from ICE priced at an average of Cordobas 0.12 (USe 1.71)
per kWh for the assumed annual net purchases shown in Annex 5. The
assumptions are reasonable.

APPRAISAL OF THE NINTH POWER PROJECT - NICARAGUA
Power Transmission Project
Empresa Nacional de Luz y Fuerza
1.   Financial History and Projections
Summary
1.         After  three years of financial reverses described below (see para. 3),
ENALUF's financial situation improved in 1975 by virtue of implementation of a
fuel adjustment clause in 1974 and a 30% tariff increase at the beginning of
1975. The following paragraphs describe: (a) ENALUF's earnings history (para. 3),
deteriorating financial position (para. 4) and Bank-prompted corrective actions
(para. 5) -- all these during the period 1972-1974 -- and the cost overrun on
the eighth power project (para. 6); (b) the 1975 tariff increase and future
finances (paras. 7 and 8); and (c) the study of ENALUF's insurance program
(paras. 9 and 10).

Earnings History and Financial Position
3.        A combination of factors in 1972-1974 adversely affected ENALUF's



ANNEX 16
Page 2 of 3 pages
sales and earnings: (a) the 1972 earthquake; (b) the 1973 inflation in fuel
costs together with inflation in other operating costs; and (c) slow action
in 1974 in seeking a tariff increase which was needed over and above the
extra revenues generated by implementation of a fuel adjustment clause. These
operating difficulties led to rising operating ratios (62.7% to 79.0% in
1972-1974) and declining rates of return on unrevalued assets, (9.4% to 5.8% in
1972-1974). ENALUF added to its financial difficulties in 1974 by adding to the
scope of the eighth power project (which was already experiencing substantial
cost overruns). The same year, in order to guard against major plant failure
ENALUF undertook necessary large-scale maintenance for its hydrogeneration
facilities.
4.        Because of its poor sales and earnings and increased investment
expenditures, ENALUF experienced negative net cash generation and deteriorating
debt-equity ratios (from 49/51 in 1972 to 62/38 in 1974), since it had to
borrow US$21.5 million (C$150.3 million) to finance its investment program
and working capital requirements.
5.       kfter discussions with the Bank, ENALUF hired the consulting firm
of R.W. Beck and Associates to perform a rate and revaluation study, implemented
a fuel adjustment clause (1974) and a general tariff increase of 30% (1975), and
revalued its fixed assets as of December 31, 1974.
6.        While these measures contributed to an improved operating performance
in 1975 (see below), ENALUF succeeded in closing the cash gap on the eighth
power project and related additions only by securing, with Bank assistance,
US$16.1 million (C$112.7 million) in cost overrun financing from the Venezuelan
Investment  Fund (VIF) in March  1976.   The following table compares the
appraisal project cost (US$34.7 million) and financing plan for the eighth
power project with the current cost estimate (US$59.0 million) and financing
plan.

1975 Tariff Increase and Future Finances
7.         The 1975 tariff increase permitted ENALUF to achieve in 1976 (on the
basis of preliminary data) an improved rate of return(9.3% on annually revalued
assets), operating ratio (67%), debt-equity ratio (41/59), and positive net cash
generation (US$8.66 million or C$60.6 million).
8.         The projections show that ENALUF would have to increase its tariffs
by less than 1% in 1977 and 10% in 1979 to meet its goal of earning 8.5% on
net average operating assets annually revalued. With these increases, ENALUF
should be able to maintain its debt service coverage at not less than 1.49 times
and its debt-equity ratio at not more than 47/53. The current position should
improve gradually as short-term loans and accounts payable are reduced from the
present high levels. The current ratio would increase from 0.52 in 1976 to about
1.00 in 1979. ENALUF has good banking contacts and should have no difficulty in
securing additional lines of credit, if required to tide it over periods of
temporary cash stringency (see Attachment 10, note 14).
Insurance Study
9.         ENALUF has engaged the services of a competent insurance expert who
will review the adequacy of ENALUF's current insurance program. The review
would lay particular emphasis on casualty insurance for plant and equipment. In
this connection, the study would consider the probable costs and benefits of
insuring such properties against catastrophic losses (fire, explosion, earth-
quake, etc.). Consideration would also be given to the possible alternatives
to purchasing insurance, such as self-insurance for losses due to earthquakes,
if the premiums for such coverage would be very high. This would include a
study of the advantages and disadvantages of funding a self-insurance reserve.
While an unfunded reserve would permit the company to utilize the resources
generated from the provision for investment in its utility business, it would
not provide the funds to cover losses. In assessing this alternative, considera-
tion would need to be given to whether the company could readily arrange financing
for the costs involved in repairing major damage. Moreover, even if the reserve
for self-insurance is funded, a government undertaking to provide the funds to
cover losses may be necessary, since a major loss may occur at a time when the
fund has not built up sufficiently. The accounting treatment of actual losses
which exceed the self-insurance reserve would also be studied: whether to
charge them to income in the year incurred or amortize them over a reasonable
period as part of operating expenses.
10.       The study would present concrete recommendations for insurance or
alternative provisions to cover each class of risk and would consider the cost
of implementing them. ENALUF has agreed to provide the Bank with a copy of
the study not later than ten days after the Effective Date of the loan.

Notes and Assumptions Used in Financial Projections
Income Statement
1.     For the period 1976-1981, sales of electric energy reflect ENALUF's
assumption of annual sales growth in Nicaragua of 11.4%, plus sales to Honduras for
1978-1981 (see Annexes 13 and 14). For projections of revenues, the average tariff level
has been derived from the total revenue requirements resulting from earning a return of
8.5% on annually revalued net average operating assets.  The following indicates:
(a) annual projected generation by facility plus net energy purchases
from Honduras and-Costa Rica;
(b) annual projected energy losses;and
(c)  annual net energy sales (1) in Nicaragua and (2 ) to Honduras.

General Administrative and Other Operating Costs and Expenses
6.     This category of expense consists of wages, materials, rental fees, etc., and
is expected to grow about 7% annuallly. ENALUF expects the annual rate of increase for
average salaries to be 3.4%. This projection is based on recent cost-of-living
experience and appears adequate (in the absence of major unforeseen international
inflation). In 1975, there was an increase of less than 2% in the cost-of living index
for Managua; in 1976, preliminary data for the first calendar quarter indicates an
increase of about 1%. ENALUF also expects to limit salary growth through improved
manpower utilization. The following estimates are for: (1) labor costs (total and
average per employee); (2) materials costs; (3) remaining administrative and other
operating costs; and (4) total general administrative and other operating expenses:

ENALUF has forecasted its materials expense to grow at a rate of about 17.5% annually
for 1976-1980 due to expected increases in:  (l) the number of customers; and (2)
the size of the plant account. Remaining general administrative and other operating
costs (excluding unusually high costs in 1976 for contracted services, C$5.8 million)
are expected to grow only 5.5 % annually due to ENALUF's efforts to curtail expenditure
growth in this area.

Depreciation
7.     ENALUF has estimated its weighted average depreciation expense at 2.6%
of its average annual gross plant. For major categories of ENALUF's electric
plant, average depreciation rates are: (1) steam plant - 2.78%; (2) hydro plant -
1.77%; (3) other production - 4.22%; (4) transmission - 2.51%; and (5) distribution -
3.20%. These depreciation rates were reviewed and accepted by the consulting
firm, R.W. Beck & Associates. They are substantially similar to those used in
the southwestern region in the United States.

Balance Sheets:  Assets
12.          To reflect the impact of inflation on costs for electric utility
plant, a revaluation of 52.2% at year-end 1974 was effected. Subsequent annual
revaluations reflect the following rates of inflation:  1975 - 8.1%;  1976 to 1979 - 8.0%;
1980  to   1981 - 7.0%.  The 1975 and 1976 inflation rates are derived from
preliminary data provided by the consulting firm of Whitman, Requardt and
Associates. Inflation rates for subsequent years reflect the inflation estimates
used in Bank project work for equipment as follows: for 1977 to 1979 - 8.o%; for
ij80 to 1981 - 7%.
13.     The year-by-year changes in ENALUF's plant and depreciation accounts,

1982                        856.6
14.       Cash has been maintained at a relatively low level for the
period 1976-1980 in keeping with ENALUF's recent financial history and its ready
access to short-term borrowings.
15.       Accounts receivable were estimated at about one-sixth of ENALUF's annual sales
in Nicaragua, reflecting ENALUF's collection history. Accounts receivable in arrears are
defined as GAR - B in the following formula for calculating ENALUF's arrearage index:
GAR - B
Arrearage Index =                  ,  where:
AVMB
GAR = gross accounts receivable for electric service, including promissory
notes for such service;
B   = electricity billings for 30 days immediately prior to computation; and
AVNB = average monthly electricity billings during 90 days prior to computation.
16.       Materials and supplies were estimated to decline from about 3% of average
gross assets in 1976 to about 2.5% of average gross assets in 1981. This estimate
is based on the expectation of continuing benefits from the use of inventory procedures
recommended by the consulting firm, R.W. Beck & Associates.
17.       The year-by-year changes in ENALUF's revaluation account are derived from
the difference between the revalued asset and accumulated depreciation accounts. These
changes in millions of Cordobas are shown below.

APPRAISAL OF THE NINTH POWER PROJECT - NICARAGUA
Power Transmission Project
Empresa Nacional de Luz y Fuerza (ENALUF)
Return on Investment
General
1.     The project provides for expansion of the transmission and distribution
system of ENALUF (complementary to ongoing works under the eight power project)
and for studies and training. Since the project and its segments cannot be
readily isolated from the program without having to make probably erroneous
allocations of benefits -- measured in terms of revenues from sales and client
contributions to construction -- the return on program investment has been
calculated on ENALUF's facilities to be commissioned January 1, 1977 to December
31, 1982 and not on the project.
2.     Full utilization of the incremental program facilities shown on page 3
of this Annex can be expected for 1984; the investment shown in 1975 for ongoing
projects includes all sunk cost prior to 1976 for not yet productive components.
3.     The investment cost excludes expenditures for the Copalar hydroelectric
project and the rural electrification project of IDB in the period because
benefits from these projects will begin to flow only after 1984.
4.     Purchases of power and energy from Honduras (El Cajon) after 1981 -- shown
in Annex 6 -- have not been considered due to lack of mutual commitment of ENALUF
and ENEE on firm interchanges and substituted by generation from not fully
utilized thermal plant in Nicaragua. Purchases of hydro energy from Costa Rica
have been assumed for the period after 1984 at the average annual rate of 143 GWh
based on Kennedy & Donkin's feasibility report on the interconnection component.
5.     The benefit and cost streams are shown on page 4 of this Annex for the
assumed weighted life of 35 years for the main components of the project and
program (the 100 MW generation plant of the eighth project and the 135 MW of the
geothermal project). All benefits and costs are shown in terms of end of 1976
prices.
Benefits
6.     In estimating the program minimum benefits, it was assumed that the value
of the incremental energy supplied by the facilities, provided under the program
of ENALUF's system, would at least equal the difference between the incremental
revenues and the incremental costs shown below.
7.     Revenue from incremental sales in Nicaragua was calculated in detail on the
basis of the load forecast shown in Annex 14, using tariff levels by client catego-
ries in effect in 1976 (excluding any future tariff changes) to 1982, and on a
total basis for 1982 and thereafter. Revenue from sales to Honduras was calculated
on the basis of energy which ENALUF expects ENEE to require in 1978 to 1981 as shown
in Annex 6, and which was adjusted for transmission losses and priced by ENALUF



ANNEX 18
Page 2 of 4 pages
at US45.0 per kWh at ENALUF's generation buses for the period after 1981 (assump-
tions for 1978-1981 are shown on page 2 of Attachment 10 to Annex 16) this includes
capacity cost and appears reasonable but is subject to ENEE's agreement.
8.     Fuel cost adjustment revenue shown on page 4 of this Annex is due to the
effect of the change of thermal production in the generation mix at constant 1976
fuel prices and not increases in fuel prices.
9.     Annual connection fees have been assumed as shown in Annex 16, Attachment
10 and exclude inflation.
Costs
10.    Construction costs shown on page 3 are based on the investment program
shown in Annex 8, with the adjustments described in this Annex. The costs exclude
price escalation beyond the end of 1976 and interest during construction.
11.    Fuel costs for 1976 to 1983 were calculated according to the annual dispatch
of thermal units and as shown in Annex 16, Attachment 10, at the 1976 fuel price.
For 1984 and thereafter the fuel oil was priced at US42.11 per kWh -- based on 100
MW Tiscuco steam plant operation at end of 1976 prices.
12.    Cost of purchased electricity from Costa Rica was based on annual amounts
of energy shown in Annex 6 for 1979 to 1982 and, based on the consultants' feasi-
bility report at 143 GWh/year thereafter, at an assumed cost of USJ1.2 per kWh
for run-of-river hydroelectric energy (about 60% of incremental fuel costs), which
appears reasonable.
13.    General administrative and other costs (including all operation and mainte-
nance other than fuel and purchases) are based on projections in Annex 16, assuming
an average annual increase of about 5% due to the requirements of expansion of
operations, but excluding inflationary increases for the 1976 to 1983 period; for
1984 and thereafter this cost was assumed at USJ0.76 per kWh.
Results
14.    The discount rate which equalizes the streams of benefits and costs shown
on page 4 is 13.1%. If a one-year slippage is assumed in the installation of the
geothermal units, the corresponding rate would reduce to about 12.9%. A sensitivity
analysis shows that, if investment costs are assumed to increase by 10%, the equal-
izing discount rate would be 12.0%. If benefits would be 10% lower, the rate would
be 11.4%. With both of these changes occurring simultaneously the rate would be
10.3%.
15.    If it is assumed that the load forecast includes most of the sales to be
realized from the IDB rural electrification project and the IDB project investment
is included, the equalizing discount rate would be reduced to 12.3%. Finally, if
sunk costs incurred prior to 1976 are excluded, the equalizing discount rate would
increase to 16.2% (and 14.8% for 10% higher investment costs, 14.0% for 10% lower
benefits, 12.7% for both changes simultaneously).
16.    These discount rates are in line with the probable opportunity cost of
capital in Nicaragua and suggest that -- on average -- wasteful use of electricity
and premature expansion of the system should be avoided since consumers will -- on
average -- be requested to pay a price reflecting incremental costs. (The possi-



ANNEX 18
Page 3 of 4 pages
bility of wasteful use by special categories exists, however, and is discussed
in paragraph 2.16 of the report).
Return on the Interconnection with Costa Rica
17.    The feasibility study completed in August 1976 by Kennedy & Donkin (UK)
has concluded, from a comparison of all capital and running costs associated with
the installation and operation of an interconnection of the ENALUF and ICE systems,
that total operational savings during the life of the component would produce a
net benefit in present value terms of US$10 million at an annual discount rate of
12%. The consultant estimated the rate of return on the investment at 14.9% for a
fuel cost of US$12.50 per barrel and on the basis of the 1979-1988 expected inter-
changes. This corresponds to about 12.9% for a fuel cost of US$11.50 per barrel on
which the appraisal is based.

APPRAISAL OF THE NINTH POWER PROJECT - NICARAGUA
Power Transmission Project
Empresa Nacional de Luz y Fuerza (ENALUF)
Low-Income Area Electrification
1.        ENALUF has traditionally attached the highest priority to generation,
bulk supply and sales to large industrial and agricultural consumers. Connection
of residential consumers was largely directed to middle-and high-income areas
where the utility could expect to realize a high financial return. This policy
has led to a situation in which many low-income communities (LICs). are located
near existing distribution networks without enjoying access to supply.
2.        The problem was discussed with ENALUF during project preparation and
it was agreed that a pilot program for extending supply to LICs should be carried
out over the 1977-1979 period. The program is expected to cost US$4.3 million
(in 1976 prices) which would be about 14% of ENALUF's planned investment in urban
distribution during the period. It would result in provision of service to
between 5,000 and 12,000 households in LICs which currently lack electricity,
located in the departments of Carazo, Granada, Leon, Managua, Matagalpa and Zelaya.
Compared with ENALUF's 1980 market, these new connections would account for about
4% of total clients and about 0.6% of total sales. Preliminary surveys indicate
that approximately 30,000 to 67,000 people would benefit from public lighting and
small commercial and industrial enterprises would be able to expand their activities.
This would produce such benefits as improved access to employment opportunities
within the LIC; better education, communications and security; and reduced spoilage
of food in retail establishments through availability of refrigeration.
3.        In the design, engineering and installations of the LIC distribution
component ENALUF will generally follow the standards developed under the recently
completed US-AID financed rural electrification program, which basically used single
phase distribution and provided low cost installations. The project would provide at
least: 160 km of primary lines, 109 km of secondary lines, 33 km of combined
primary and secondary lines -- consisting of poles, insulators, conductors, armatures,
and fuses and other protective equipment -- 5,125 MVA of distribution transformers
(5 kV to 50 kV each), 5,020 secondary metered service connections and 1,150 street
lights for the LICs.
4.        The methodology used for establishing the priority LICs to receive
electric service was as follows:
(i)   ENALUF prepared a list of LICs presently without electricity service;
it established analogies with similar communities nearby which received
service in connection with the earthquake reconstruction or other programs;
and it estimated the probable electricity consumption and average tariffs
on this basis using applicable population and household census informa-
tion.
(ii) A 50% saturation of potential initial connections was assumed for estimating
the projected annual sales and revenues in 1979 (the first year of operation),
the construction items with associated costs for each of the LICs, and
the implementation timetable. The range of consumption per household was



ANNEX 19
Page 2 of 3 pages
assumed to be between 18 and 60 kWh each month. Street lighting require-
ments and their costs were projected on the basis of ENALUF's existing
criteria and norms as adapted to LIC conditions.
(iii) The construction cost estimate was built up from unit costs recently
experienced by ENALUF for similar items and includes contingencies of
16% and cost of engineering and administration of 12Z.
(iv)  The incremental annual operation and maintenance expenditures include
the cost of capacity, energy consumed, operation and maintenance of primary
and secondary lines, billing and collecting. (As noted in para. 5.07 of the
text, this calculation requires an arbitrary allocation of system costs
and is therefore only an approximation).
(v)   Both the construction and incremental annual operation and maintenance
expenditures for each LIC were converted to a level annual equivalent
at a 10% discount rate for comparison with financial benefits.
(vi)  The financial benefits for each LIC were calculated from the applicable
connection fees and the projected revenues during 30 years; both were
converted to an annual figure on the same basis as the expenditures.
(vii) LICs which show a financial benefit (vi above) higher than annual costs
(v) would be the first to be included in the project's distribution
component. LICs for which benefits exceed expenditures at a 1% discount
rate would be studied in greater detail, to determine if the low return
can be attributed to ENALUF's relatively low public lighting tariffs
(see below). If this should not be the case, possible reductions in
levels of service (e.g. use of current limiters instead of meters for
residential consumers) would be considered and a more complete calculation
carried out,as shown in the Attachment,together with a survey of likely
non-residential loads. LICs showing a return higher than 10% on this
basis would receive second priority. Finally, if sufficient funds are
available, ENALUF may recommend extension of service to some LICs for
which the return lies between 1% and 10% if it can show that this will
result in better scheduling of construction. This should result, on
average, in financial returns above 4 to 5% on the low-income distribu-
tion component of the project. The socio-economic returns should be
considerable higher, for the reasons noted in para. 2.
5.        A sample full calculation for a subproject of the distribution component is
shown in the Attachment  of this Annex (for the"Barrio Solorzano")  on the basis  of
the above criteria. The calculation assumes 1977 average connections as 12.5%,
1978 as 37.5%, 1979 as 50% of the households in the community and consumption of
60 kWh/month per connection. From 1979 to 1985 kWh residential consumption is
projected to grow at 10% compounded annually. Client saturation is expected to reach
about 80% in 1985. After 1985, level consumption is assumed to the year 2009 during
the useful life of the related investment. On the basis of quantifiable benefits the
rate of return would be 6.9% for this subproject. A sensitivity analysis using a
higher consumption of 70 kWh/month per connection shows a return of 18.3%. If costs are
assumed to rise by 10% the return with a 60 kWh/month average consumption would decline
to -5.4%.
6.        ENALUF's public lighting tariff is low, resulting in a reduction in the
financial return on investment in the LIC. For example in the subproject shown in the
Attac'Lment  the return would improve from 6.9% to 11.4% if the costs and benefits

associated with public lighting are excluded.
7.        The work program and implementation schedule for this component is shown
in Annex 10 of this  report.   This and other representative information is based
on ENALUF's draft feasibility report of August 1976. ENALUF is revising the report
on the basis of Bank's comments; submission of this report to the Bank is a condition
for disbursements for this component.

APPRAISAL OF THE NINTH POWER PROJECT - NICARAGUA
Power Transmission Project
Empresa Nacional de Luz y Fuerza (ENALUF)
Least-Cost Analysis
1.        Of the project cost, about 64% (US$20.7 million) is for physical items
for which technical alternatives are possible. The feasibility report prepared
by the consultant Kennedy & Donkin (UK) recommends the interconnection
with Costa Rica as the least cost alternative to provide ENALUF with secondary
hydro energy from ICE's hydro power dominated system for cash flow discount rates
above 12% p.a. The other physical components are: transmission line and sub-
station additions; line and substation modifications and improvements; instal-
lation of capacitors; distribution component; and the national load dispatch
center. For each of these components, interrelated only through being part of
a transmission investment program, the project provides for the least-cost
alternative.
2.        The previous (eighth) project provides for the construction of the
Managua ring transmission line on the basis of an economic study which was pre-
pared by ENALUF's consultant (Electroconsult). The study demonstrated that the
least-cost alternative for delivering bulk generation to the greater Managua
area would be a 138 kV single-circuit ring around Managua (with the substations
at Managua-Los Brasiles-South-Tipitapa-Managua) providing for future connection
of new additional substations in the metropolitan area. Under this alternative
the existing 69 kV system would not be expanded. The alternative to the 138 kV
ring would have consisted of costlier radial extensions of lines at 69 kV and
138 kV leading to a less reliable transmission system and requiring more rights-
of-way for lines emanating from bulk supply stations in congested areas.
3.        ENALUF proceeded basically with the ring solution but modified it to
accommodate: (a) closing the ring through Masaya since the 138 kV Tipitapa-
Masaya-Rivas line had been interconnected at the enlarged Masaya 138/69/13.8 kV
substation; and (b) termination of the 230 kV line from the 100 MW Tiscuco Plant
at the Los Brasiles instead of the South substation. The change described under
(a) was aimed toward providing an early second 138 kV supply (in addition to
138 kV from Masaya and 69 kV from Managua) for the rapidly increasing load in
the Masaya area as a result of the dislocations caused by the 1972 earthquake.
Discussions on the interconnection with Costa Rica were just starting at the
time of these changes. In 1974-1975 the prefeasibility study of the Copalar
hydro power project (Annex 6) investigated the best transmission scheme for
connecting this new generation to ENALUF's system. The study recommended 230 kV
lines to connect Copalar and a 230 kV line to an enlarged Masaya substation
which would be connected to the Los Brasiles substation. These recommendations
for the connection of the Copalar hydro project will bereviewed in the master
plan.   The study of the interconnection with Costa Rica confirmed that the
Managua 138 kV could be operated satisfactorily after the 230 kV interconnection
line to Costa Rica is connected to ENALUF's system at the Los Brasiles substation.
At about the same time ENALUF would connect there also the Momotombo geothermal
station to the 230 kV system, requiring the installation of a second 230 kV bus.



ANNEX 20
Page 2 of 2 pages
4.        During appraisal a lower cost solution for completing the 138 kV ring
around Managua was found, e.g. by shortening the ring (see Map IBRD 3697R)
through a connection from the South substation to the Managua-Tipitapa 138 kV
line via the Oriental substation, which would be converted from 69 kV to 138 kV
supply. This change would also increase the reliability of supply in the south-
eastern metropolitan area where most of the future load growth is projected.
5.        There are no reasonable technical alternatives for the additions to
the substations (Los Brasiles, Leon, Nandaime, Matagalpa), the conversion of
the Oriental and Asososa substations, and the modifications of the smaller sub-
stations and the associated transmission line additions other than those included
under the project. The distribution component, which is included in the project
as a construction program item, would be expected to be built in accordance
with ENALUF's designs for rural electrification which have recently been developed
for low cost construction, using single phase 25 kV or 13.8 kV primary lines.
6.        Following are some general characteristics of the project components
which are not readily quantifiable but which would lead to lowering overall
costs:
(a) purchase of a few large standard size transformers for 138 kV for the
conversions would release smaller transformers for providing for load
growth at 69 kV supplied substations and parallel transformation,
which would increase reliability of supply;
(b) extensive application of capacitors would reduce losses, release line
and equipment capacity, improve service voltages, and allow for more
flexible operation of the Managua steam electric units which other-
wise would have to continue to be operated for providing reactive
power support (ENALUF presently has practically no capacitors installed
on its system);
(c) minimum possible additions would be made to substation plant, using
simplest possible switching layout based on radial distribution and
single bus arrangements; and
(d) use of metal-clad switchgear, replacing the present high cost, field
assembled indoor design, would reduce the cost for distribution feeder
switching.

APPRAISAL OF THE NINTH POWER PROJECT - NICARAGUA
Power Transmission Project
Empresa Nacional de Luz y Fuerza (ENALUF)
Training of ENALUF Staff
1.        In recent years, ENALUF's technical staff has increased its know-
ledge of planning, engineering, construction and operation, particularly of
transmission and distribution facilities. This knowledge was obtained main-
ly through participation in the rural electrification projects sponsored by
US-AID. These projects were carried out, however, mainly by consultants
and contractors.
2.        To further gain experience in project management ENALUF has chosen
to use consultants for the proposed ninth project in a way which would inten-
sify the training of its own staff. Consultants would perform their work in
Nicaragua (to the degree possible) in order to maximize direct training through
the following project groups:
(a) Substations and transmission lines: for engineering,
design, specifications, procurement, supervision of
contracts and installation work, and commissioning;
(b) Distribution: for planning, design, specifications, pro-
curement, supervision of construction and commissioning;
(c) National load dispatch center: for preparing the study
of alternative designs,specifications, bid documents
and evaluation of proposals, procurement, supervision of
manufacture and installation, commissioning and operator
training;
(d) Master plan study preparation; and
(e) Tariff study preparation.
3.        To improve training of staff not taking part in the above work and
to modernize its training methods ENALUF would develop -- in addition -- a
satisfactory training program. This would enable ENALUF to more fully utilize
its experienced personnel for middle management and supervisory positions.
To prepare and implement the training component of the project ENALUF would
set up a training unit under a full-time experienced training director who
would be hired under terms of reference acceptable to the Bank. The unit
w ould prepare the detailed training program and cost estimate by June 1977and
begin implementing it by December 1977 with the assistance of all af fected ENALUF
dependencies.
4.        The preparation of the above program would be in consultation with
the Bank and focus on:

(a) high level managers (gerentes), to prepare them for
broadening ENALUF's management base in the future
through attending courses and seminars for public
utility personnel at universities and other institu-
tions in countries with an advanced electric public
power industry. The courses would provide instruction
particularly in economic,financial and managerial matters;
(b) supervisory personnel, to instruct them in modern
practices of design, engineering, construction, operation
and maintenance of distribution, transmission and gener-
ation equipment; and
(c) technical personnel, to train them in operation and
maintenance of interconnected systems to prepare a broader
manpower base for the operation of the Honduras-Nicaragua-
Costa Rica interconnection.
These training activities would. be coordinated with any national program
available or planned, and participation would be invited from other companies,
agencies or institutions of the electric power sector requiring the special
skills to be provided in any local program which would be set up.
