NINTH POWER PROJECT (LOAN 1402-NI)
PREFACE
1.      This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Ninth Power
Project in Nicaragua, a transmission-distribution project, which the Bank
helped to finance with Loan 1402-NI ($22.0 million). The borrower was the
national power company, Instituto Nicaraguense de Energia (INK); the
guarantor was the Government.
2.      INE successfully completed the project, notwithst- Iing changes, cost
increases, and time overruns. Civil strife was the major cause of the
changes to the project, cost increases, and time overruns.
3.      Approval and signing of the loan documents occurred on April 12 and
April 22, 1977, respectively. The loan agreement became effective on October
27, 1977, three months after the original deadline for effectiveness (July
26, 1977). The final closing date was June 30, 1983, as compared with the
original closing date of December 31, 1980.
4.      The Energy Division of the Latin America and Caribbean Regional
Office prepared this report on the basis of information contained in Bank
files, information supplied by INE, and information gathered as a result o,
discussions with staff of the Bank.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department
(OE D but the project was not audited by OED staff.
Following standard procedures, OED sent copies of the draft report
to the Borrower and the Government for comments. However, none were received.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
INSTITUTO NICARAGUENSE DE ENWRGIA (INE)
NINTH POWER PROJECT (LOAN 1402-NI)
HIGHLIGHTS
1.      INK completed the project (except for the national load dispatch
center) with changes, with a delay (more than 36 months), and with a cost
overrun (12.71). Completion was effected under highly adverse circumstances
not contemplated at appraisal  -- civil strife, regional political
confrontation, and stagnating electricity sales. Due to these adverse
circumstauces, the rate of return on the investment program, of which the
project was a part, turned out to be negative.
2.      Because of political changes consequent to the overthrow of the
Somosa regime, the institution-building objectives of the project became
irrelevant. At appraisal, the inefficient management style of the former
Executive President constituted a major issue. To assist the Executive
President, who was elderly, with the performance of his duties, the Bank
conditioned its loan to the snpointment of a General Coordinator under
satisfactory terms of reference. This condition strained relations with the
Borrower without Improving the performance of the Executive President.
Eventually, this source of strain disappeared following the retirement of the
Executive President and the appointment of a more competent successor.
3.      Taking into consideration the difficult financial circumstances
consequent to the civil strife, the Bank waived the revenue covenant (which
called for a return of 8.51) for operations in 1979 and established a 5% rate
of return for 1980. INE narrowly missed the rate of return established for
1980 but complied with the revenue covenant in 1981 and 1982. Lack of
adequate finance contributed to delayed project completion.

NINTH POWER PROJECT (LOAN 1402-NI)
I. BACKGROUND
1.1      Bank Participation in Sector Financing
1.1.1    Since 1953 the Bank has made nine loans and one credit to the power
sector in Nicaragua (Annex 1). After the 1972 earthquake, IDA also made a US
dollar 52.0 million credit to the country, for reconstruction purposes, of
which US dollar 5.0 million went to the power sector. The first seven
loans helped to finance the expansion and improvement of the existing
generation, transmission and distribution facllties in the country. The
eighth loan, 840-NI (1972; US$24.0 million equivalent), and part of the
credit, 389-NI (1973, US$5.0 million), helped to  inance a steam generating
plant ane :he transmission line interconnecting the power system of
Nicaragua and Honduras and the repair and rehabilitation of existing
electrical installation damaged with the earthquakes. All the projects
mentioned above have been completed successfully, although with some delays
and cost overruns. Loan 1402-NI, helped to finance the Ninth Power Project
(primarily transmission and distribution works), which is the subject of this
report.
1.2      Sector Organization
1.2.1    After the change in Government In 1979, the power sector was
reorganized. All municipal power companies and the rural electric
cooperatives were absorbed by INE, which now also regulates the sector
and is responsible for energy planning in the country. INS absorbed also the
National Petroleum Company (PETRONIC) assuming full responsibility for the
hydrocarbons sub-sector, as well as continued with its basic role of
supplying electricity to the public.
1.3      Investment Plans
1.3.1    As a consequence of the civil strife in late 1978-1979, annual
energy demand in the National Interconnected System decreased significantly.
Consumption fell from 882 GWh in 1977 to 728 GWh in 1979. Since then, it
increased to 989 GWh in 1985. Present consumption represent a five-year lag
in demand relative to the 1979 expectation.
1.3.2    The Master Plan Study financed under Loan 1402-NI, included an
energy demand forecast. Consumption was expected to grow from 880 GWh in
1982 to 2406 GWh in 1991. Based on this demand forecast the short-term
(1982-1987) expansion program called for development of the geothermal field
at Momotombo, hydroplant studies, expansion of the 230 kV, 138 kV, and 69 kV
transmission system, and expansion of the distribution facilities.

II. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
2.1 Project Origin and Preparation
2.1.1    While supereising the execution of the Eighth Power and Earthquake
Reconstruction Projects (Loan 840-NI and Credit 389-NI), Bank staff learned
of the interest of INE in interconnecting its system with that of Costa Rica
and in expanding its transmission (138 kV) and distribution systems, which
would complement the facilities for generation and transmission built under
the Eighth Power Project. INE presented the Bank with a formal request in
May 1975. In August 1975, a foreign consulting firm provided the economic
justification for the interconnection to Costa Rica and also confirmed that
the Managua ring at 138 kV could be operated satisfactorily after the 230 kV
interconnection line to Costa Rica became connected to INE's system. A
preappraisal mission visited Nicaragua in October 1975 to prepare the
project.                                                                   1
2.1.2    During project preparation it was agreed with INE that the project
would include a pilot program for extending the supply of electricity to low
incone areas, providing service to about 12,000 households distributed in
six major cities.
2.1.3    On December 9, 1975, a Bank appraisal mission visited Managua.
Because of unresolved financial, organizational and project issues, the
mission did not complete the appraisal. On January 14, 1976, a second
mission visited Managua to complete the appraisal.  During appraisal, the
scope of the project was revised substantially from that originally submitted
by INE. The revised project excluded transmission and distribution items
(originally part of the Eighth Power Project) that it had become possible to
finance with a loan provided by the Venezuelan Investment Fund.
2.2      INE's 1976-1980 Expansion Program
2.2.1    The appraisal report (dated March 30, 1977) set forth the followitg

2.3      Project Description
2.3.1    The appraisal report defined the project as consisting of:
(a)  the Nicaraguan portion of an interconnection line to Costa Rica and
transmission and distribution works (which would complement the
facilities for generption and transmission built under the Eighth
Power Project). Specifically, the interconnec 'uri line and
transmission, and distribution works would consist of:
(i) about 145 km of single circuit at 230 kV on steel towers for
interconnection with Costa Rica;
(ii) about 9 km of double circuit and 8 km of single circuit
transmission lines at 138 kV to complete the Managua
Ring; and about 5 km of single circuit transmission line at
138 kV to connect the Sebaco-Santa Rita line to the Matagalpa
substation;
(iii) construction, addition, and/or conversion of ab3ut seven
substations of 138/13.8 kV or 138/25 kV, by adding about
122 MVA transformer capacity;
(iv) relocation of about 75 MVA transformer capacity of 69/13.8 kV
to six existing substations;
(v) installation of about eight 69 kV circuit breakers and of
protective relaying and metering equipment;
(vi) installation of about 65 MVAR switched and unswitched
capacitors to supply reactive power; and
(vii) installation of distribution lines, transformers, and
connections in low income areas.
(b)  National load dispatch center and equipment for operating the
Honduras-Nicaragua-Costa Rica interconnection and the national
system;
(c)  Services of engineering, planning, tariff consultants and of expert
advisors to assist in:
1/ The Tiscuco power plant financed by Loan 840-NI was completed. The first
unit started operations in December 1976; the second, in April 1977.
The first unit at Momotombo was comissioned in 1983 and the second unit
postponed until 1986. Copalar feasibility studies were updated by German
consultants in 1982, but due to the low growth of energy requirements,
and unavailability of financing, INE's generation development plan
postponed the scart of construction of the Copalar power plant to 1990.
2/ Transmission and subtransmission lines related to the above projects were
completed including about 60% of distribution facilities.

2.4      MaJor Covenants in the Loan and Guarantee Areements
2.4.1    Annex 2 describes the major covenants of the Loan and Guarantee
Agreements. As set forth in chapters 3 and 5, compliance by INE and the
Government with respect to operational and financial covenants was less than
satisfactory.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND COST
3.1 Negotiations, Effectiveness, and Project Start-up
3.1.1    On December 3, 1976, representatives of the Bank, INE, and the
Government completed negotiations. The Executive Directors of the Bank
approved a loan of US$22.0 million equivalent on April 12, 1977, in support
of the project (term: 17 years, including three-and-a-half years of grace;
interest: 8%).  The Bank conditioned effectiveness of the loan egreement on:
(i) the appointment of experts for procurement and training under terms of
reference acceptable to the Bank; and (ii) establishment of acceptable terms
of reference in areas identified by the General Coordinator as needing
improvement.
3.1.2    The Bank Loan Agreement did not become effective on July 26, 1977,
as expected at the time of loan signing. Effectiveness was delayed until
October 27, 1977, about 3 months late because of slow action on the part of
INE in appointing consultants.
3.2 Changes and Timetable
3.2.1    During the civil strife which ended in 1979, INE's electrical system
suffered physical damages. In order to help INE to finance part of the
reconstruction cost, the Bank agreed to restructure the Ninth Power Project
in November 1979. A new allocation of funds was made, which included two new
categories (reconstruction of civil strife damages and replenishment of
distribution inventories). Annex 3 compares actual and forecast data on
allocation of loan proceeds including the new categories.



- 5 -
3,2.2    The national load dispatch center component of the project was
dropped. This component received secondary priority after the civil strife
and only US$0.17 million were left to finance the interface equipment,
required to provide the necessary link between the load dispatch center and
the operational devices in the substations and power plants. In 1981, INE
obtained the agreement of CABEI for financing the dispatch center. At the
time of the last supervision mission (Dec. 1982), construction was expected
to be completed by the end of 1984.
3.2.3    The implementation of the low-income distribution program started
with a delay of almost one year, because of slow action by INK in defining
the list of low Income areas to be served by the project. Despite financial
difficulties, INE and the government assigned primary priority to this
component because of the social impact and importance for the country. The
Bank financed US$1.36 million in foreign exchange component and agreed to
finance up to US$0.63 million for local expenditure. Due to disruptions of
the civil strife and manufacturer delay in shipping the last portion of
equipment and materials, at the time of the last supervision mission
(December 1982), only 50X of this component was completed (290 kms of lines,
2,500 kVA in distribution transformers, and 4,900 now consumers connected to
the grid). The expected time for project completion was October, 1983.
3.2.4    Annex 4 sets forth the actual and forecast key dates concerning the
implementation of the Project. The project was completed in December 1983,
about 36 months later than expected at appraisal, The main cause of the
delay was the civil strife, which slowed procurement activities and
consultant's works on ongoing studies and which adversely affected project
implementation. Despite the delay in project implementation, power supply
was not seriously affected as the power market did not expand as rapidly as
forecast.
3.2.5    Annexes 3 and 8 compare actual and forecast data on allocation of
loan proceeds and cumulative disbursements, respectively.
3.3      Project Costs
3.3.1    Annex 5 shows tie price deflators used to deflate the current cost
of the project to constant 1976 prices. Annexes 6 and 7 compare the actual
and appraisal forecast costs of the Project in constant 1976 and current
prices respectively.
3.3.2    In current prices, the Project cost was about US$40.8 million
including reconstruction Items, etc., and about US$39.4 million excluding
reconstruction items, etc. In current prices, the forecast cost of the
project was US$36.2 million; and US$32.49 million excluding the load dispatch
center, which was not built (Para. 3.2.2.). The total cost overrun of the
project amounts to 21.31 of the original cost. This cost increase is mainly
due to: (i) increases of staff-months for consulting services related to the
Master Plan due to unfavorable local working conditions during the civil
strife and an increase in the scope of work of the studies; (ii) longer-than-
expected implementation period of the project; (Iii) higher-than-expected
cost of consultant services; and (iv) higher-than-expected costs for the
construction of the transmission lines.

3.4 Performance of Construction Contractors, Consultant and Suppliers
3.4.1    INE found the performance of most of its construction contractors to
be satisfactory. The same was true of the performance of the suppliers with
a lesser exception for two companies that failed to deliver some substation
materials as scheduled.
3.4.2    The performance of the consultants was considered satisfactory in
general, with the exception of one consultant whose performance in the
preparation of the tariff and sector studies was considered by both INE and
the Bank to be unsatisfactory. The draft report on the sector study failed
to make fundamental recommendations for avoiding overlapping responsibilities
between INE and other planning and regulatory agencies of the Government,
lacked appropriate analysis of existing INE-Government legislation, and no
fundamental recommendations were made to improve present legislation. The
study was not completed because INE felt the study was no longer needed as
the sector organizational issues, which the study was to address, were
already substantially resolved by the measures taken by the Governmeut. The
Bank agreed with this recommendation.
3.4.3    With regard to the tariff study (first version), the consultant
departed significantly from the terms of reference, particularly ignoring the
concepts of tariffs based on future long-term marginal costs.  Upon receiving
the comments of INX and the Bank, in 1981, the consultant agreed to revise
the draft version and to prepare a new report based on long-term marginal
costs. A report was finally completed in September 1985 and submitted to INE
for their comments. The Bank only received a copy of the report from the
consultants on April 18, 1986 but has not yet received INE's comments.
3.4.4    The consultant was given the opportunity to comment on the
assessment given in paras. 3.4.2 and 3.4.3 above. The following is a
transcription of the consultants' comments:
"With regard to the sector study, please recall the circumstances
during the period 1977 through 1980 in Nicaragua. The radical changes in
socio-economic-political outlooks from the Somoza regime to the present
Sandinista government and the sweeping changes put in place following the
revolution undermined the need for continuing the sector study. You will
also recall that the new Government was then looking for economy measures and
for this reason we concurred with INE and the Bank that further work be
stopped. Our firm left an outstanding receivable with the Ministry of
Planning of about US$50,000 for services performed in providing the draft
study and was willing to respond to reflect comments submitted by INE and the
Bank had the job not been terminated. Our firm was never paid the
outstanding receivable for the sector study.
"The history of the tariff study from 1981 to the present has been
one of exasperating delays caused largely by turnover of personnel within
INE. These delays were ultimately reflected in our report which reflects
data supplied by INE staff over the period 1981 through 1985. Our solution
to this problem was to give INE the microcomputer rate model developed for
the study, thereby allowing INE the capability of updating all tables,
without exception, with the most recent data available.



- 7 -
"We trust the Bank concurs that our solution of providing INE with
the rate model, thereby making the Institute self-sufficient in adapting to
changes, was the most efficacious solution possible under the circumstances.
We understand many of the marginal cost rate concepts included in our report
were reflected in INE's most recent rate study."
3.5  Maaement and Organization
3.5.1    During project preparation and appraisal, Bank staff noted
that the chief executive of the power company strongly centralized decision
making in his office3/. This resulted in management inefficiencies and
delays often hampereT the operations of the company. Bank staff initially
identified these problems in the appraisal of the Eighth Power Project (Loan
840-NI), at which time the Bank requested an organization and management
study. The results of this study were used by INE to further centralize
decision-making in the office of the Chief Executive. This only proved to be
adequate after the Chief Executive retired (para. 3.5.5).
3.5.2    To address these problems as well as other operating deficiencies of
the company (in such areas as training, procurement, construction management,
and financial control and budgeting), INE agreed to: (i) appoint a General
Coordinator (under terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank) to assist and
relieve the Executive President of a part of the burden of supervising
day-to-day operations and to assist him in the management of technical and
financial affairs; (ii) prepare and implement under the direction of the
General Coordinator programs to improve financial controls, planning,
construction management, and procurement; and (iii) prepare and implement a
training program on an agreed timetable. The General Coordinator would also
identify other areas of INE's operations which required study and examination
by consultants (para. 3.1.1).
3.5.3    The appointment of the General Coordinator was a major issue of
contention during negotiations as INE's President resented the criticism to
his performance implied by the Bank's requirement; and disagreement as to the
suitability of the candidates proposed by INE delayed effectiveness of the
loan agreement and strained relations with the Bank. The General Coordinator
was not given sufficient authority to carry out his terms of reference, thus,
the appraisal expectations of the Bank for strengthening management through
his action were not fulfilled.
3.5.4    To the extent that the Bank strongly believed that many of
management problems of INE could be traced to the inefficient style of the
chief executive, and that these managewent problems constituted a major
issue, it probably would have been better to seek the replacement of the
chief executive as a condition of the loan, aware that this could well
jeopardize the viability of the loan; or to accept the fact that Bank loans
are not suitable vehicles for solving all of the borrower's problems and do
3/ The complaints of the new Government concerning the chief executive (who
was closely connected to the previous regime) extended beyond
inefficiency (see OED Report No. 5144, dated June 19, 1984, p. 16, para.
9).



- 8 -
away with the concept of a general coordinator intending to address the
management problems through future loans at a more suitable time.
3.5.5    As a postscript, it should be noted that the chief executive
retired after effectiveness; and under his successor, management improved
considerably.
3.5.6    As a result of the appointment of the advisors in training,
procurement, finance, construction, and cost evaluation, INE's engineering,
planning and operational capabilities improved during the project
implementation stage. However, these improvements were obscured by the
advent of the civil strife in 1978 and by the significant changes that took
place in the years following the installation of the new Government. At the
time of the last supervision mission in November 1982, there were still
several unresolved issues such as excess personnel, low management salaries,
maintenance problems, and poor coordination with Government in the
formulation of INE's financial plans.
3.5.7    After the new Government took office in July 1979, the laws and
organizational structure of INE were changed. Before July 1979, the national
power company was reasonsible for the generation, transmission, and
distribution of electricity except where several private and municipal
utilities and cooperatives were involved in distribution. After 1979, the
new Government created the Instituto Nicaraguense de Energia (INE), and all
private utilities were nationalized, including the municipal and
cooperatives, and were incorporated into INE. Private utilities which were
not related to the previous regime, were adequately compensated. In
addition, INE was assigned the responsibility of planning for the energy
sector. The last supervision mission (December 1982) reported that INK.'s
activities in other energy fields outside the power sector were increasing.
INE's Financial Manager was involved in the negotiation for oil exploration
with Brazil and INE's Planning Manager was looking at coal gasification
projects.
3.6 Institution Building
3.6.1    Because of the very serious difficulties experienced by Nicaragua
during the implementation period of the project, and because of subsequent
political changes, the institution-building objectives of the project became
irrelevant. Though it could be argued that progress was achieved in the first
few years of project implementation, new problems arose after 1979 which had
not been completely solved at the time of project completion, including
excess personnel, low workers productivity, politization within the company,
and low salaries incentive to management.
3.7 Staffing
3.7.1    As shown in Annex 11 between 1980 and 1981, INE's staff increased
from 3,571 to 4,338, despite reduced investment activity and stagnant sales.
This followed significant staff increases in 1979 and 1980. The Bank
expressed serious concern in relation to this matter, and in 1982, both INE
and the Government became concerned about this trend and started to reduce
the number of personnel. The data available shows that from 1981 to 1982 the



- 9 -
number of staff dropped to 4,065, i.e., 7%. However, this did not allow the
company to achieve the efficiency standards which it had had a few years ago.
3.8 Salaries
3.8.1    Towards the end of 1979, a ceiling of C10,000 (equivalent to
US$1,000 at the official exchange rate, but significantly less at the black
market rate) per month on public sector salaries was established, while
inflation was proceeding at a rate of about 35% per year. Despite this, INE
did not adjust the ceiling until 1982, which affected staff morale, and some
senior staff left the company. The Bank strongly pressed on this issue.
In 1982, INE reacted and increased the salaries of 32 key statf. This was a
favorable development, and the Bank recommended that this be followed by
further increases, in line with company possibilities and country standards.
IV. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
4.1 Least Cost Solution
4.1.1     The project's main components were part of INE's least-cost
expansion program to meet thle expected load growth. This includes (i) the
construction of a 230 kV interconnection transmission line to Costa Rica;
(ii) completion of the 138 kV Managua ring; (iii) construction and
improvements of the 138 kV substations.   Additionally, the project included
(i) the connection of about 30,000 consumers in low income areas; (ii) the
construction of a load dispatch center, and (iii) consulting services. The
interconnection with Costa Rica was expected to provide INK with an
additional source of non-fuel-based energy, allowing Nicaragua to reduce its
oil imports. The appraisal verified that the standards and designs used by
IN8 were adequate and were the least cost alternative.
4.1.2     At the time of appraisal the project was expected to help the
Government in developing a program to rationalize the power sector
organization help to improve INE's management, administrative, and
operational capabilities through consulting services and expert assistance.
The project also included the preparation of a national master plan for the
sector.
4.1.3     The late commissioning of the facilities described in para. 4.1.1
did not adversely affect INE's service to its customers as the total energy
consumption by existing consumers dropped substantially during 1979-1981.
However, the late commissioning of the Nicaragua portion of the
interconnection transmission line with Costa Rica caused an estimated net
revenue loss of about US$2.5 million to both systems. In 1983, purchases of
electricity from Costa Rica amounted to about 300 GWh and in 1984 to 36 GWh.
4.2 Actual and Forecast Sales, 1976-1981
4.2.1     Annex 9 compares actual and appraisal forecast energy sales in
Nicaragua. Actual summary sales in 1976-1981 (4,901 GWh) were 22.3% below



- 10 -
the expected level (6,309 GWh) and in 1981 sales were 40% lower than
forecast, primarily because of the adverse economic conditions caused by the
civil strife.
4.3 Rate of Return
4.3.1     The appraisal report indicated a rate of return on the overall
investment of 13.1%. Based on actual investment costs, actual and expected
tariff levels, and actual and expected revenues and operating costs (in
constant 1976 prices), a similar analysis shows a return of -2.1 (Annex 10).
This reflects: (i) the lower than expected load growth; (ii) higher than
expected operating and fuel cost; and (iii) the lower than expected tariff
levels* A sensitivity analysis was carried out, assuming that annual
purchases of electricity from Costa Rica will increase to 315 GWh in 1988,
500 GWh in 1995, and 650 GWh in 2000 and thereafter. The analysis shows that
the rate of return would increase to 1.7%.
4.3.2     It is important to point out that the project was carried out under
very difficult circumstances, which did not resemble those expected at
appraisal. These changed circumstances adversely affected the rate of return
of the investment.
4.3.3     Because of the lack of information, it was not possible to make an
evaluation of the socio-economic impact of the electrification of low-income
communities. It is estimated that approximately 30,000 people would benefit
from public lighting; and small and commercial enterprises would be able to
expand their activities, producing benefits such as improved access to
employment opportunities within the community, better education, and
communications and security.
V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
5.1 Actual and Forecast Financial Data, 1976-1981; and
Actual Financial Data, 1982- 1983
Annexes 12 to 15 compare for the years 1976-1981 actual and forecast key
financial indicators, income statements, sources and applications of funds,
and balance sheets. This period corresponds to the period covered by the
financial forecasts set forth in the staff appraisal report; and extends one
year past the expected project implementation period, 1976-1980. The annexes
also include actual data for 1982 and 1983. The following paragraphs discuss
the information set forth in the above annexes.
5.2  Sales, Tariff Levels, and Finances, 1976-1980
5.2.1     In 1976, operating results and conditions resembled-those expected
at appraisal. Thereafter, operating conditions and results increasingly
departed from apvraisal expectation. In 1977, due to poor hydrological
conditions, INE imposed rationing and relied on a greater-than-expected
proportion of expensive thermal generation to meet demand. At the same time,
because the Government did not authorize tariff increases, including a fuel



- 11 -
adjustment clause adequate to cover the increased cost of production, net
operating income and net internal cash generation were at levels much lower
than those expected at appraisal.   Subsequently, operating results were
adversely affected by deteriorating economic conditions, including a massive
(43X) devaluation of the cordoba in 1978, and the gathering momentum of civil
strife in 1979. The following year, 1980, was a period of consolidation,
including the nationalization and integration of small rural and municipal
distribution systems. Actual sales, operating results, and investment
expenditures were at very low levels in 1980 as compared with what had been
expected at appraisal.
5.2.2     Annex 16 compares on a summary basis the actual and forecast levels
of sales, average revenue per kWh sold, operating results, and sources and
applications of funds during the years 1976-1980. Because of the economic
and political factors mentioned above, actual and forecast financial data are
not fully comparable.
5.2.3     A succession of tariff increases in 1978-1980 helped INE to
generate actual summary revenues at a level (C$2,038.8 million) modestly
higher than that expected at appraisal (C$2,002.9 million), despite a 20%
reduction in actual total sales (4,080.7 GWh) as compared with forecast
summary sales (5,103 GWh). The reduction of sales reflected the adverse
economic and political conditions. An increase (20.7%) in actual total
operating expenses (C$1,494.8 million) over the level expected at appraisal
(C$1,238.0 million) led to a 28.9% reduction in net operating expenses
(C$544.0 million as compared with C$764.9 million) and 48.3% reduction in the
level of net internal cash generation (CS$258.4 million as compared with
C$534.7 million). INE restricted the level of actual total expenditures for
construction and studies to C$808 million, 59.7% below the level expected at
appraisal (C$2003.9 million); and financed total applications, C$888.8
million with long-term borrowing (C$562.9 million), net internal contribution
to expansion (C$247.4 million), and other sources (C$78.5 million). All of
these aggregates were substantially lower than the levels expected at
appraisal (respectively C$1,418.1 million, C$443.0 million, and C$142.8
million).
5.3 Compliance with Financial Covenants, 1977- 1980
5.3.1     The Loan Agreement sets forth four major financial covenants (see
Annex 2)- namely that, INE should: (i) undertake no major expansion project
without having first furnished the Bank with satisfactory evidence with
respect to economic justification and financial resources (Section 5.04);
(ii) seek prior Bank agreement for any borrowing unless INE's gross internal
cash generation should exceed maximum future debt service by a factor of 1.5
times (Section 5.06); (iii) maintain accounts receivable in arrears below
1102 of the preceeding three months' average of overdue accounts receivable
(Section 5.07); and (iv) raise tariffs sufficiently to earn 8.5% annually on
average net fixed assets revalued annually (Section 5.08). The Guarantee
Agreement contsined a companion covenant (Section 3.02b) to the revenue
covenant of the Loan Agreement (Section 5.08).



- 12 -
5.3.2     INE complied with the project-limitation and debt-limitation
covenants (Section 5.04 and 5.06 of the Loan Agreement); but the Government
did not permit INE to meet the revenue test in 1978. In July 1979, the Bank
suspended disbursements on all loans to Nicaragua when meaningful project
activity and supervision became impossible; and in November 1979, when the
Bank resumed disbursements, it agreed to waive the arrearage-limitation and
revenue covenants in 1979 and to establish lower targets for 1980. Full
compliance was expected in subsequent years. For 1980, the revised
arrearage-limitation ratio was 150% and the lowered rate or return was 5 on
revalued assets. At the end of 1980, the actual arrearage ratio was 3801 and
the actual rate of return was 3.32. Nevertheless, because INE was making
its best effort to reduce its overdue receivables and because the Government
permitted INE to implement a substantial tariff increase in February 1981,
the Bank did not take remedial actions.
5.3.3     INKE did not revalue its assets in 1978 and 1979; but did revalue
its assets in 1980 and subsequently. The delay reflected misunderstanding on
the part of INE with respect to methodology; but the final result of the
revaluation excercise was accelptable to the Bank. Rowever, INE's auditors
did not agree to render an opinion on the revalued assets because revaluation
was not a generally accepted principle of accounting in Nicaragua. The Bank
accepted this.
5.3.4     For the years 1978-1982, INE did not comply with the covenant
requiring submission of an audited report by April following the end of the
preceding year (Section 5.02). Between 1976 and 1982, INE changed auditors
four times. The first time was 1978; but the newly selected auditor proved
to be incompetent and was replaced in 1980 after the Bank complained about
late completion of the report and deficient treatment of fixed-asset
revaluation, bad-debt expenses and reserves, amortization of deferred
charges, and other matters. The next three auditors failed to meet the
deadline for producing audited reports (April following the end of the
preceding year); and it emerged that the accounting department of INK had
developed serious personnel shortcomings. The audited reports for 1980 and
1981 complained about the failure of INE to carry out a physical inventory of
the assets of incorporated rural cooperatives or its accounts for materials,
supplies, fuel, and lubricants. Most of these problems were eliminated by
1982; but Bank staff continued to fael that the accounting department of INS
needed improvement.
5.4 Compliance with Financial Covenants, 1981-1983
5.4.1     INE complied with the revenue covenant in 1981-1982; but not in
1983. The receivables ratio was 339% at the end of 1981 and the Bank agreed
to a revised ratio of 158% for 1982, as INE was making every possible effort
to effect collections in the private sector. The Government was the major
slow payer. The receivables ratio was 214% in 1982.
5.4.2     As compared with its financial situation in 1982, INK's financial
situation at the end of project implementation (1983) had deteriorated
substantially. Its rate of return was 6.0%, its contribution ratio was only
15%, and its operating ratio was 83.8%. The one area of major improvement
was the receivables ratio, which stood at 124%.

VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
6.1 Performance of the Borrower
6.1.X    INE management and operational staff performed their duties well,
considering the very difficult conditions prevailing in the country during
the project implementation stage. Following the appointment of a successor
to the Executive President (early 1978), Bank staff judged the performance of
the new management to be very satisfactory and that the new President was
making serious efforts to address INE's management, operational, and
financial problems (paras. 3.5, 3.6, and 3.7). The new Government appointed
a new chief executive officer in 1979. Due to the difficult conditions that
followed the civil strife, at the time of the last supervision mission
(December 1982) there were still important unresolved issues (exceas
personnel, low management salaries, etc.; see para 3.54).
6.2 Performance of Bank Staff
6.2.1    The evidence clearly supports the conclusion that at appraisal Bank
staff proposed a solution (a general coordinator) which did not relieve a
difficult problem (executive inefficiency). Given the strong political
support enjoyed by the sxecutive President, the problem did not lend itself
to solution. The Bank should have either conditioned the loan to the
replacement of the chief executive or made the loan without requiring the
hiring of the general coordinator
6.2.2    Bank staff performed wel  during the execution of the project.  Bank
staff successfully assisted the b   wer in restructuring the Ninth Power
Project to meet INS's reconstructiou oviorities as a result of the damages
suffered during the civil strife, awi to provide emergency financing of local
costs for some project components.
6.2.3    INS's extremely precarious financial situation was the subject of
intensive examination by Bank staff; however, their efforts were not too
successful because of slow Government action in authorizing needed tariff
increases, reducing accounts receivables from public sector entities, and
reaching agreements to pay overdue public sector amounts.  However, the
economic difficulties then faced by the country should be taken into account
when assessing the Government performance on these atters.
6.3 Performance of the Government
6.3.1    The Government did not fulfill its covenanted obligations to: (i)
pay its bills promptly; and (ii) provide full and timely tariff increases.
These measures contributed to INE's cash-flow problems and project delays.
6.3.2    Government delayed the drafting and signing of the subsidiary loan
agreement with INe for the execution of the sector study, and therefore the
completion of the study. This study was never completed satisfactorily and
was rendered worthless after the civil strife, at which time the new
Government implemented a new sector organization.

VII. LESSONS TO BE LEARNED
7.1 Management
7.1.1    This report shares the conclusion set forth in the Project
Completion Report of the Eighth Power Project (para. 7.2.1), regarding
management. This project illustrates that, with respect to management
objectives, when faced with lack of shared interest in Improving efficiency
(para 3.5.1), the Bank should be very cautious in making new loans until
there is a more receptive attitude on the part of the borrower's management.
7.2 Project Implementation
7.2.1    At the time of appraisal, based on optimistic assumptions, the
project was expected to be completed in 3.5 years. The project was completed
in 6.5 years, 36 months later than expected during appraisal. Taking into
account the experience of the Bank in similar projects in our region (average
completion period of 6 years) as well as the very difficult conditions
prevailing in Nicaragua during the project implementation stage, it m   be
judged that INE implemented the project in a reasonable period of time. The
Bank should take past experience into account in estimating the project
implementation period.

NICARAGUA
INSTITUTO NICARAGUENSE DE ENERGIA (INE)
NINTH POWER PROJECT - LOAN 1402-NI
Major Covenants of the Loan and Guarantee Agreements
1.       The Loan Agreement 1402-NI required INE to:
(i) Carry out a rate study in accordance with a timetable acceptable to
the Bank, and shall, within 6 months of the completion of
such study, review its results with the Bank. In the event the
Borrower shall agree to introduce a new rate structure, the Borrower
shall review and agree with the Bank a timetable to put such new
rate structures into effect [Section 3.07(a) and 3.07(b)];
(ii) Manage its affairs, carry on its operations, and maintain its
financial position in accordance with sound business and public
utility practices and operate and maintain its plant in accordance
with sound engineering practices (Section 4.03 and 4.04);
(iii) Appoint a General Coordinator under terms of reference satisfactory
to the Bank, to assist the Executive President in the management of
the Borrower's technical and financial affairs (Section 4.05); INE
complied with this covenant, but in 1978 the Project Coordinator
resigned at INE's request, and the Bank did not insist on his
replacement because the coordinator was not thought to be needed
under the existing Organization.
(iv) Furnish to the Bank, not later than June 30, 1977, a detailed plan,
acceptable to the Bank, for establishing the personnel training
program under the project, and establish, not later than December
31, 1977, a Training Unit (Section 4.06);
(v) Undertake any major expansion project without having first furnished
to the Bank with satisfactory evidence with respect to economic
justification and financial resources (Section 5.04).
(vi) Obtain prior Bank Agreement to incur in any debt when revenues were
less than 1.5 times future debt service (Section 5.06);
(vii) Maintain the amount of receivables in arrears below 110X of the
total average monthly billing corresponding to the 90 days
immediately preceeding (Section 5.07). INE has not complied with
this covenant, and for 1981 the ratio was 339X. In view of the big
efforts and progress being made by INE, the Bank accepted the 182%
prepared by the Borrower;
(viii) Make adjustments in the rates for the sales of electricity as shall
be necessary to provide sufficient revenues to cover all operating
and administrative expenses, and yield a rate of return on the
annually revalued net operating assets of at least 8.5X per annum
(Section 5.08).



-17 -                               ANNEX 2
Page 2 of 2
(ix) Take all such actions naceseiry to adjust automatically electricity
to cover additional operating expenses resulting from variations in fuel
prices and Interconnection rates (Section 5.09).
2.       The Guarantee Agreement 1402-NI required the Government of Nicaragua
to:
(x)   Cause the Direcion Nacional de Planificacion (DPN) to carry out a
sector organization study in accordance with the Subsidiary Loan
Agreement (section 3.02);
(xi) Cause the Institute to enable the Borrower to adjust automatically
its electricity rates to cover additional operating expenses
resulting from variations in fuel prices and interconnection rates
(Section 3.03).
(xii)  Take all such action as shall be necessary to enable the Borrower to
make such adjustments in its rates for sale of electricity, to meet
the obligations described in para 1 (vii) above.
3.       INE's performance under the covenants (i), (iii), (iv), and (v)
described above was generally satisfactory. Performance of INS under
covenants (ii), (vi), (vii), and (viii) has not been satisfactory.
