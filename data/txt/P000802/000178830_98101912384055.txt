I. THE SETTING
1.01      A narrow enclave inside Senegal, The Gambia is among the twenty-eight
poorest countries in the world with per capita income of less than $200. 1/
Average real income per capita for its population of 546,000 has stagnated
since about 1973 at $180. The economy relies on a single crop, groundnuts.
As a result, it is subject to sharp seasonal cycles and is vulnerable to
groundnut price and yield fluctuations. As shown below, sectors other than
agriculture constitute relatively small shares of the economy.
Table 1: GDP by Sector (1977)
D Million
Agriculture                                           129.9             58.3
of which Groundnuts                             (49.9)           (22.4)
Manufacturing                                           6.0              2.7
Construction                                            9.0              4.0
Tourism and Commerce                                  40.5              18.2
of which GPMB                                   (24.5)           (11.0)
Other including Government Services                   37.3              16.8
Total                                      222.7            100%
1.02      Economic performance has varied considerably in recent years,
largely owing to groundnut developments. A real increase in GDP of 35% was
experienced in 1974 followed by a decline of 14% in 1975 and modest recovery
in 1976 and 1977. Erratic rains this past season, however, have reduced the
1978 groundnut crop by about 25% from the 1977 level. Fed by the rise in
import prices and the devaluation of the Dalasi, inflation was 26% and 17% in
1975 and 1976 respectively but tighter foreign exchange and monetary regula-
tions brought it down to 9% p.a. in 1977. Because of continued monetary
restraint and appreciation of the Dalasi, inflation is likely to continue
near international levels.
A.   Agriculture
1.03      Agriculture including groundnut production is the most important
activity in The Gambia employing 85% of the active population and accounting
for over 90% of exports. Besides groundnuts, there are a variety of minor
cash crops (cotton, limes, and palm kernels). Rice and other cereal grains
1/   The latest economic report on The Gambia, numbered 907-GM was issued on
December 12, 1975.



-2-
are traditional food crops. Food production, however, is insufficient and The
Gambia imports one-third of its cereal consumption. Over half the farmed area
is planted with groundnuts. Farms are generally small and rain-fed; produc-
tivity is low and production methods remain traditional. At the same time, a
small number of progressive farmers is diversifying away from groundnuts into
fruit and vegetables, poultry, livestock and fishing. Livestock remains
traditional and needs to be modernized. Fishing is growing rapidly and now
accounts for 8% of GDP. Most of the catch comes from artisanal fishermen and
the rest from two industrial fishing enterprises. Seventy-five percent of the
catch is consumed locally; the rest is exported to Japan and the EEC.
B.   Industry
1.04      The industrial sector can be broadly defined to include manufactur-
ing, construction, services and tourism. With the exception of tourism, the
sector consists of a few modern enterprises along side small-scale, informal
sector artisans and entrepreneurs. Modern industries are concentrated in the
Banjul area although other urban centers (Farafenni and Basse) are growing in
commercial importance.
1.05      Employment.  In 1974, employment in the urban centers was estimated
at 56,000 persons only half of whom were salaried. The other half was either
self-employed, unemployed, or working in the informal sector. The subsector
distribution of wage-earners is given below:
Table 2: Distribution of Salaried Employees
by Type of Activity (1974)
March      June       September       December
Manufacturing                     5,211      5,332         2,594           4,309
Construction                      4,951      3,998         4,182           4,748
Tourism                           1,064        327           421           1,007
Other (including trade)          13,368    12,238         10,917          13,893
24,594    21,895        18,114          23,957
As shown above, salaried employment in manufacturing, construction and tourism
is highly seasonal and peaks in the first and last quarters of the year. This
coincides with groundnut processing and the tourist season.
1.06      Modern Manufacturing.  The processing of agricultural products is
the core of the modern sector. Shelling and crushing groundnuts, soap making,
rice milling, cotton ginning and fish processing are the main activities.



-3-
The balance is limited to a few import substitution industries: beer and soft
drinks, tiles, furniture, shoes, plastics, paints, metal work, printing and
textiles. As shown below these latter activities contribute 6% to the indus-
trial sector value added and employ less than two thousand workers while
agricultural processing contributes about 92% of the sector value added and
employs over half of salaried workers.
Table 3: Value Added and Employment in Modern Industries (1975)
Value-Added       Salaried Employment
D Million    %         Number       %
Grain and Oil Processing                34.9      92        2,319        52
Fish Processing                          0.8       2          478        11
Other Manufacturing                      2.3        6       1,636        37
Total                        38.0      100        4,433      100
1.07      The Gambia Produce Marketing Board (GPMB), a parastatal with a
monopoly for processing agricultural products, is by far the most important
enterprise in the industrial sector. The two large fishing enterprises are
also majority Government-owned. Most other manufacturing establishments are
privately, Gambian-owned. The small size of the economy has had a tendency
to deter private foreign investors.
1.08      Informal Industries.  The informal sector is a substantial employer:
there are estimated to be about 5,000 artisanal enterprises half of which are
engaged in traditional handicrafts such as pottery, jewelry, weaving and dye-
ing and the other half as tailors, blacksmiths, repairmen, mechanics, and
woodworkers. Most of these activities are concentrated in Banjul and its
environs, Farafenni and Basse constitute secondary centers. Handicraft pro-
duction is typically seasonal and erratic even in peak season. Repair, metal
working and woodworking are generally full-time occupations. Workshops are
usually primitive sheds with some equipment where master craftsmen work with
three to seven apprentices. Chief among the problem frequently encountered
by artisans is the lack of credit, other difficulties include few marketing
outlets, poor production and quality control, inadequate supply of raw
materials .and the lack of trained workers. A census giving a complete
profile of the informal sector is lacking.
1.09      Construction and Housing.  From 1974 to 1977, the sector's contri-
bution to GDP increased from D4 million to D9 million. The increase in public
works, the construction of new hotels and the growing demand for private
houses gave a few Gambian-owned companies a chance to emerge from the informal
sector. There are now about three Gambian-owned firms capable of large
construction jobs, foreign-owned firms still undertake major jobs including



-4-
hotel construction. The remaining firms are petty contractors who need to
upgrade their technical skills as well as to gain access to financing for
working capital and equipment. Government has recently decided to contract
out up to 90% of all public works to private contractors.
1.10      The supply of housing has not kept pace with demand, particularly
as the Banjul area continues to grow twice as fast as the country as a
whole.  Most private residential housing is done on the home owner's account;
the owner organizes the work, buys raw materials and hires casual labor. Work
progresses only as funds are available. There is no organized flow of funds
to finance housing other than Government loans to senior civil servants. A
primary concern of Government is to formulate a policy towards housing cover-
ing appropriate land use, meeting low-income housing needs, and establishing
mechanisms to channel funds to private housing.
1.11      Tourism has been one of the fastest growing activities in The
Gambia. The number of tourists rose from 500 in 1967 to 25,000 in 1977. In
1977, gross foreign exchange earnings from tourism amounted to D9.5 million
or roughly 10% of total foreign exchange earnings. Most tourists come from
Scandinavian countries, particularly Sweden. The growth in tourism is the
result of a concerted effort on the part of Government to attract foreign
investors for hotel development and chartered tours. Most developments are
majority foreign-owned and operated, although Government has taken participa-
tions in several hotels. Further investment in tourism will be dependent,
in part, on attracting tourists from other countries such as Germany and the
United States as the number of tourists has levelled off in recent years.
Government will also have to pay greater attention in the future to the
efficient use of its resources in this sector.
C.   Prospects and Constraints
1.12      The potential for diversifying the economy, although limited,
offers The Gambia a range of investment opportunities. In the agricultural
sector, cereal grain production can be increased to reach self-sufficiency.
Fish, poultry, meat, fruit and vegetable production can be expanded to meet
the demand generated by tourists and the growing urban population. Agro-
industrial opportunities therefore exist as well for food processing, animal
feed, storage and slaughtering facilities. The urban population generates
demand for import substitutes, services and housing while increased agricul-
tural production will stimulate further demand for investments in transport,
storage facilities, repair and other related services. Finally, tourists
offer a market for traditional crafts such as jewelry, batiks and leather
work.  Farmers and local entrepreneurs suffer, however, from the shortage of
skilled labor, the lack of technical expertise, and the limited availability
of credit to take advantage of these opportunities. Moreover, the Gambian
market is too small to offer sizable import-substitution opportunities and
the wide seasonal variation in consumers' incomes (tied to groundnut sales
and tourism revenues) inhibits year-round manufacturing of consumer goods.
Finally, the vulnerability of incomes to groundnut price and yield fluctua-
tions compounds the risk to entrepreneurs.

D.   Government Development Strategy
1.13      Government, through its first five-year development plan (1976-
1980), is trying to remove the constraints facing rural and urban enter-
preneurs. It is strengthening agricultural extension services to assist
diversification efforts in food crops, fishing and livestock. Government
has stimulated tourism by providing infrastructure facilities and granting
fiscal incentives for hotel investments. It has also decided to encourage
industries which process agricultural products, generate employment, ex-
ploit national resources or substitute for imports. Foreign investors can
receive liberal incentives under the Development Act. The newly created
National Investment Board (NIB) represents Government in partnership with
private investors, advises parastatal companies and promotes new commercial
and industrial ventures. NIB has been in operations for less than a year;
so far it has focused its attention on fisheries and tourism. The con-
struction industry has also been given a boost by Government's decision
to contract out most public work projects, and the provision of technical
advice to local contractors by the Public Works Department. Aware of the
informal sector's potential contribution to economic development, Government
has sponsored the creation of IBAS to provide extension services to local
artisans and entrepreneurs.
1.14      IBAS was created in 1975 with UNDP/ILO support and Peace Corps
staffing. It has done pioneer work in bringing basic management skills to
about 40 artisans and has launched a 300-member cooperative for the market-
ing of crafts. Since artisans have limited access to bank credit, IBAS
sponsored the creation of a UNCDF-financed guarantee fund and helps its
clients to prepare loan applications.  From September to November 1977, 12
loan applications for a total of D 56,500 had been submitted to local banks.
At present, IBAS is staffed with an ILO project manager, six Peace Corps
volunteers and four counterparts. UNDP/ILO support and Peace Corps staffing
are likely to continue for three more years. To expand its number and scope
of operations, however, IBAS will receive under a renewed ILO project more
technical advisors, more counterpart staff and funds to construct and equip
two workshops for training purposes. It has also proposed building two craft
centers in the tourist area. IBAS expects, once it has fully trained counter-
parts and well established procedures, to be enacted as an autonomous agency
of Government.
E.   The Financial System
1.15      One of the major constraints still facing entrepreneurs is the
inadequate delivery of term credit by the financial system.  The financial
sector consists of the central bank, two foreign-owned commercial banks, and
the Gambia Commercial and Development Bank (GCDB). In addition to its regu-
latory functions, the central bank rediscounts trade notes (four months),
provides advances for subsistence credit to farmers (six months) and refinan-
ces crop trading advances (ten months). To reduce the seasonal expansion of
credit and to fight inflation, the central bank has recently put a ceiling on
its refinancing and introduced a liquid assets ratio for the commercial banks.
At present the central bank has no facility to provide medium and long-term
resources on a regular basis for development projects.



-6-
1.16      Standard Bank of West Africa (SBWA) and Banque Internationale pour
le Commerce et l'Industrie (BICI) run only commercial operations, Together,
they account for about a third of outstanding loans and half of total deposits.
Their loans are mostly for trade financing where their share is o9% of total
trade credit.  They have few outstanding loans for agriculture and other
sectors of the economy. In contrast, GCDB accounts for over 85% of outstand-
ing credit for agriculture, manufacturing and tourism and, in its five years
existence, has taken the lead over its two competitors. GCDB is the only bank
to have opened branches outside the Banjul area and to provide term credit,
especially for Gambian enterprises.
1.17      Credit Policies and Interest Rates.  Credit in The Gambia follows
the economy's cyclical pattern, hinged on groundnut production (Annex 1).
Before planting, farmers are provided with short-term subsistence credit to
last them through the hungry season. Prior to harvesting, traders receive
credit to build up inventories and purchasing agents receive crop financing
credit. Subsistence credit is reimbursed once the crop is sold to purchasing
agents and, other credits are reimbursed after the sale of groundnuts inter-
nationally. This credit is short-term, mostly rediscounted by the central
bank and effectively doubles outstanding credit over a six-month period.
Informal lending also plays an important role in the rural areas, especially
to complement subsistence credit provided by the central bank. Term credit
channeled through GCDB accounts for a modest share of outstanding credit
(10-18% depending on season).
1.18      Prevailing interest rates are tailored to this cycle.  As shown
in Annex 2, crop financing granted to cooperatives and private traders at 7 or
8% is rediscounted by the Central Bank at 6%. Farmers pay 15% for subsistence
credit; traders receiving commercial loans pay from 10 to 13%. Savings rates
range from 3 to 4% and up to 7% on time deposits. GCDB charges only 8% on its
term loans. These rates contrast sharply with the usurious rates charged by
informal money-lenders.
1.19      To reduce the amplitude of the credit cycle described above,
Government has decided to encourage term credit to farmers and phase-out
subsistence credit. A first step in this direction is the credit component
of the first IDA Rural Development Project which includes US$2.2 million to
supply credit-in-kind for cooperative society members. A farmer may receive
up to D 2,000 as a package consisting of seasonal credit for inputs and
medium-term credit for oxen and farm implements. IDA funds are passed on at
3% to GCU which on-lends to primary cooperative societies at 6%. The final
rate to farmers is 11%. This component is restricted to cooperative members
which represent 45% of the total number of farmers. Moreover, it focuses
mainly on groundnut farming and some cereal production and does not address
the needs of large-scale farmers diversifying into other areas.
1.20      Beyond this pilot effort, there is the need for a cohesive policy
for mobilizing savings and allocating credit for development purposes. Gov-
ernment has, in the past financed various investments in industry and tourism
directly or indirectly through GCDB, calling upon the reserves of the central



-7-
bank or GPMB. It has also granted guarantees for a number of loans made by
local and foreign banks. These investments, however, have not been subject
to proper appraisal to ensure that they are technically, financially and
economically sound. A systematic evaluation of such investment in the future
is essential to avoid possible misallocation of scarce resources. Moreover,
when GCDB is used as a channel for public investment, adequate resources and
guarantees should be made available.
1.21      To facilitate the provision of term credit, a number of policy
issues still have to be resolved. First the phasing out of subsistence credit
requires a concoininitent development of rural savings. Not only is a network
of branches across thle counitry necessary, but savings instruments also have to
be made more attractive by raising interest rates. The structure of interest
rates has remained unchanged since 1971 and is well below rates in other coun-
tries. Second, to meet the credit needs in various sectors, special funds
have been proposed for agriculture, fisheries, industry and housing. To avoid
profusion and duplication, these funds should be consolidated within GCDB and
a committee would make overall credit allocations. Housing deserves specific
attention and government should formulate a policy towards housing including
mechanisms to channel funds to private housing. Third, GCDB needs to be
assured of an adequate flow of term resources. Possibilities under considera-
tion include rediscounting of term credit by the central bank, allocating part
of the central bank's profits on a regular basis to GCDB, consolidating con-
tractural savings (pension funds, insurance company) and tapping excess
liquidity in the economy. Finally, GCDB is called to play a dominant role
as a development institution; it is therefore important to strengthen its
organization and management and to develop its project appraisal capability.
Although the resolution of these issues will take time owing to their far-
reaching implications, the Bank can influence their outcome by working closely
with GCDB and Government under the proposed project.
II.  THE GAMBIA COMMERCIAL AND DEVELOPMENT BANK
A.   The Institution
2.01      Created in 1972 with UNIDO assistance, GCDB is the first and only
Gambian-owned bank in the country. As a combined commercial and development
bank, it offers a full range of banking services, and finances trade, in-
dustry, agriculture, and tourism as well as other sectors, In 1977, its
assets amounted to D 40 million which makes it the largest bank in The Gambia.
Three branch offices are in operation and two more will soon be opened. GCDB
has become the main financial institution in The Gambia to grant term credit,
and the only one to offer banking services outside Banjul.
2.02      Ownership and Legal Structure.  GCDB was established by an act of
parliament as a statutory company. It was incorporated with unlimited liabi-
lity to gain acceptance in the international financial community despite its



-8-
small original capital base of D 300,000. Its share capital, which has since
been increased to D 1 million, is subscribed by Government (52%), GPMB (16%)
and GCU (32%).
2.03      Board of Directors.  GCDB's Board consists of seven members:  the
managing director, three private individuals representing Government, and the
managing directors of GPMB, GCU and NIB. The chairmanship has recently become
vacant and is expected to be filled shortly. The Board meets on average once
a month to consider all loans above D 50,000. It has delegated powers to
approve credits under this limit to a credit committee composed of the Bank's
managing director, the two senior departmental managers and the chief account-
ant. Although the Board represents a wide range of interests, its contribu-
tion to GCDB's policy formulation could be increased by including among its
members persons with industrial experience.
2.04      Management.  The present Managing Director has been with GCDB since
1972. Despite his lack of banking background, he has developed a broad under-
standing of GCDB's operations. In 1972, UNIDO provided two experts to estab-
lish policies and procedures for GCDB's commercial and development operations.
These experts were replaced in 1975 by their counterparts who, although they
had no previous banking experience, had quickly mastered their responsibili-
ties. GCDB's senior management is competent but thinly spread given the
bank's rapid growth since its inception five years ago.
2.05      Organization and staffing.  GCDB is organized into three major
divisions (accounting, commercial, and development) and two support units
(inspection and administration). Out of a total staff of 125, there are only
12 professionals. Few have prior banking experience. Half the bank's person-
nel work in the commercial division, which is the mainstay of GCDB's opera-
tions, while the development division is the smallest unit in GCDB with only
four professionals. To cope with the anticipated growth in development
lending, GCDB intends to hire four additional project analysts (two experts in
agriculture, one in fisheries and one in business administration). This
recruitment will bring staffing to an adequate level for the expected amount
of development lending. GCDB does not presently have an engineer on its staff
(see para. 3.07). Improvements in GCDB's organization and an increase in
staff are hampered, however, by GCDB's inadequate premises. Its present
building was never designed to handle banking business and is now overcrowded.
Since rental space is not available in Banjul, GCDB plans to build new offices.
2.06      Training.  As a young institution, GCDB recognizes the need to
build up the financial and managerial skills of its staff as well as to train
new staff. It finances on its own and with CFTC assistance a program of
short-term assignments in financial institutions abroad, mostly in Ghana,
Pakistan and Great Britain. To strengthen middle management and its account-
ing section, GCDB also plans to send junior professionals for business training
and a few staff members to gain professional accreditation in accounting (para.
3.07).



- 9 -
2.07      Policies.  GCDB's objectives and policies are broadly governed by
its Act and By-laws and the Financial Institution Act.  The central bank
regulates GCDB's liquidity position, reserves policy and overall indebtedness.
These policies and regulations conform generally to those applied by most
banks, although they focus more on commercial than development lending. GCDB
is entitled to grant loans and advances, issue guarantees and letters of
credit, take equity participations, deal in foreign exchange, and accept
deposits. Since there are no specific clauses regarding development lending,
GCDB has agreed to draw up a policy statement governing the terms and condi-
tions of such lending, including investment standards, rescheduling, collat-
eral and security requirements, procurement practices, treatment of foreign
exchange risk and long-term borrowing capacity. GCDB's present exposure limit
(D 550,000) is 25% of its unimpaired capital and reserves or three times the
individual sub-borrower's net worth. An exception is made if the sub-loan
is guaranteed by the Government or if sufficient security is available.
2.08      Interest Rates.  In line with present Government policies, GCDB
charges only 8% on its development loans and 7 to 8% for crop financing while
it charges 10 to 13% for commercial transactions. The rate on development
lending is clearly out of line with market conditions. To bring the cost of
GCDB's development lending up to a more reasonable level, taking into con-
sideration inflation and other rates charged locally, an increase to 11% is
proposed under the project (para. 3.05).
2.09      Procedures.  For most development projects, GCDB's appraisals
are sufficient and complemented by frequent on-site visits during project
implementation. Nevertheless, because it lacks technical expertise, GCDB
is not in a position to assess the merits of complex projects itself and
relies on local engineering consultants and promoter feasibility studies.
Most of GCDB's loans are secured by a mortage on land, a pledge on fixed
assets or a personal guarantee. Standard legal documents are inappropriate
and rarely used; the quality of GCDB's legal work could be greatly improved
if GCDB hired a lawyer on its staff instead of depending on an outside firm
(see para. 3.07). Procurement and disbursement procedures are simple but
adequate: quotations are sought from local and foreign suppliers and dis-
bursements are made directly to suppliers and contractors when possible.
These procedures, however, are not always followed.
2.10      Control and Accounting.  Despite the recent creation of the Inspec-
tion Unit, GCDB's system of internal control remains weak: there are cases of
disbursements in excess of authorized amounts and retroactive approvals. The
accounting system was poorly designed initially and is now overburdened: the
rate of errors is increasing, bank statements are delayed and management
information is poor. Moreover, its bookkeeping, by not separating outstanding
principal from interest in arrears, does not give an accurate description of
the bank's financial position. In each of their annual reports, the auditors
(Peat and Marwick) have made detailed recommendations to GCDB's management on
necessary improvements. However, progress in improving both the accounting
and management control system has been slow and a major rehabilitation is
provided for under the project (para. 3.07).

B.   Operations and Financial Performance
2.11       Commercial Operations.  Commercial transactions represent 75% of
GCDB's activities and account for 90% of its revenues. GCDB's commercial
department handles 10,000 current and savings accounts, executes the bank's
foreign exchange transactions and provides short-term loans for trading,
subsistence credit and crop financing. To finance these operations, GCDB
relies on its retained earnings, deposits and the central bank rediscount
facility. Its wide range of commercial operations and broad client contact
gives GCDB a base from which to identify and expand development operations.
2.12      Development Operations.  All of GCDB's medium- and long-term lending
is done through its Development Fund, which is maintained as an account
clearly separated from its other operations. For its development lending,
GCDB can use its share capital as well as resources accumulated in the Fund.
These resources include specific appropriation from profits, and borrowings
from the central bank, Government entities, and external sources. Most of the
resources allocated to the Fund are tied to specific projects. As of June
1977, the Development Fund's resources were as follows:
Source of Funds                        Amount        Interest Rate        Maturity
D'OOO               %

GCDB has recently received a D 500,000 contribution under an EEC project to
set up a revolving fund for fisheries as part of its development operations.
It has also received a loan from DEG for DM 500,000 to finance GCDB's loan to
the new brewery.



- 11 -
2.13      As of June 30, 1977 outstanding development loans were as follows:
Number      Amount      _
D'000
Agriculture                                 37            590      8
Fishing                                     52             60      1
Industry                                     6          1,569     22
Tourism and Services                         7          3,794     52
Public Transport                             1          1,241     17
Total                                103          7,254    100
Although loans for fisheries and agriculture account for 86% of the number
of loans outstanding, they only represent 9% of the amount outstanding.  On
the other hand, four loans account for 88% of the outstanding development
portfolio. These loans are for a hotel (D 3.5 million), a local wood and metal
working firm (D 800,000), a printing firm (D 755,000) and the public trans-
portation company (D 1.2 million). The eleven remaining loans are in favor of
a variety of small-scale enterprises (restaurant, laundry, bakery, metal
working). Annex 3 gives a detailed breakdown of loans outstanding.
2.14      Until June 1977, GCDB's only equity investment was a 97% holding in
its subsidiary, the Gambia Insurance Company (GIC). After severe losses and
some management difficulties in its initial years, GIC improved its operations
and showed a profit of D 22,000 in 1976. Recently, GCDB purchased 7% of the
capital of a new brewery and 28% of the capital of a printing firm. GCDB's
policy is to take equity investments in certain cases to ensure Gambian
participation.
2.15      Quality of Portfolio.  Arrears of principal and interest represent
only 1.1% of GCDB's development portfolio. The portfolio affected by arrears
is D 241,000 or 3.3% of the total portfolio. Most of the 53 loans affected by
arrears are fisheries loans. Arrears are generally for one or two monthly
installments and are not significant. None of the major development loans has
fallen into arrears yet (because of grace periods or rescheduling), but these
loans should be watched closely: the hotel and the transport loans are
questionable but the Government, which promoted the projects, provided the
necessary resources and guaranteed the loans. The wood and metal working firm
is encountering difficulties, but has received UNIDO assistance in production
and accounting. The printing firm also faces production and pricing problems.
So far provisions have been made only for one development loan of D 15,000.
The overall level of provisions against doubtful loans on both commercial and
development loans stands at D 1.8 million or 6.5% of GCDB's total outstanding
portfolio and is considered adequate by the auditors.



- 12 -
2.16      Financial position and Performance.  GCDB's financial position is
sound (Annex 4). As of June 30, 1977, the total debt/equity ratio is 14:1
and the term debt/equity ratio is 2:1. GCDB's income statements (Annex 5)
show that profits are substantial. In 1976, net profit reached 48% of equity
owing to exceptional foreign exchange earnings. In 1977, profits represented
27% of GCDB's equity. Commercial operations including foreign exchange deal-
ings are the major source of revenues. Expenses have grown moderately in
relation to the bank's increase in assets, but a 40% increase in interest paid
in 1977 over the previous year reflects the more stringent credit policy of
the central bank. Finally, GCDB distributes no dividends and has used its
earnings to build up adequate reserves and to increase its capital base.
C.   Prospects
2.17      Development lending is restricted to GCDB's own funds and resources
available to the Development Fund. Since most domestic resources have been
earmarked for a few specific projects sponsored by Government, GCDB has been
unable to satisfy the growing demand for development loans. Its current pipe-
line of projects comprises 50 projects for D 2.4 million most of which are
agricultural (Annex 6). Moreover, many entrepreneurs, aware of the shortage
of term resources, have not bothered to make loan applications. The Govern-
ment with GCDB as the likely intermediary is also considering some large agro-
industrial and import-substitution projects such as a lime plantation and a
building materials project. Based on this pipeline, GCDB is expected to
approve D 3 million in development loans in 1978, with approvals growing at
about 10% per year thereafter.
2.18      Financial Forecast.  The financial forecasts for the years 1978 to
1982 (Annexes 7 to 12) are based on GCDB's prospects for expanding its devel-
opment lending and the likely growth of the commercial portfolio. These
projections show that, until mid-1980, GCDB will need D 14.0 million in
long-term resources. It would be met by internally generated funds (D 8.4
million) and the proposed credit (D 5.6 million). After that date, a resource
gap of D 4 million will develop. GCDB would then have to find additional
borrowings (D 3 million) and increase its capital by D 1 million to maintain
a reasonable debt/equity ratio. GCDB's financial position is expected to
remain sound throughout the forecast period. Since GCDB does not distribute
dividends, annual profits will be allocated to reserves and retained earnings;
the term-debt/equity ratio stays below 3:1 and the total debt/equity ratio
stays around 13:1 which is adequate. Based upon conservative assumptions
which anticipate higher cost of funds, increased provisions expenses and
modest foreign exchange earnings, profits remain stable. They decrease
slightly, however, relative to net worth (from 18% in 1978 to 10% in 1982).

III. THE PROJECT
A.   Concept and Objectives
3.01      Evolution.  As early as 1969, World Bank missions visited The
Gambia to explore industrial prospects and the demand for long-term financ-
ing. Given the small size of the country and its limited prospects, it was
generally concluded that a multi-sectoral approach through a single inter-
mediary was best suited to meet the credit needs of the economy. Since its
creation in 1972, GCDB had become the major source of development lending
especially for agriculture and industry. It had, however, exhausted its term
resources and, as a young institution, it needed further technical assistance.
A reconnaissance mission in December 1976 identified the potential for a
project. GCDB was subsequently appraised in November 1977 for a proposed IDA
Credit of US$3 million.
3.02      Objectives.  The project is designed to support The Gambia's efforts
in diversifying and broadening Its economic base. As described in Section I,
one of the major constraints to overcome is the weak financial intermediation
in The Gambia. Government has diverted scarce public savings into question-
able ventures. Moreover, inadequate banking structures and credit policies
failed to attract sufficient resources for productive investments. Accord-
ingly, the project's objectives are to provide needed term resources and to
build-up GCDB as a viable financial intermediary.  The project will also offer
the opportunity to advise Government at its request on appropriate credit and
savings policies, including interest rates and resource allocation.
3.03      To achieve these objectives, the project comprises the following
components: credit to artisans and entrepreneurs, technical assistance to
GCDB, construction of GCDB's office building and a study of housing needs
and financing.
B.   Description and Special Features
3.04      Credit to Artisans and Entrepreneurs.  US$2 million of the IDA
Credit proceeds would be on-lent to GCDB as a line of credit to finance
economically and financially sound investments in the following areas:
a. Small-scale Enterprises. At least US$400,000 of the line of
credit would benefit small-scale, labor-intensive investments defined as
projects with assets of less than US$55,000 (maximum sub-loan of US$50,000)
and creating jobs at a cost below $4,000. GCDB will be authorized to fi-
nance 90% of the investment cost of such projects; IDA will refinance 100%
of GCDB's loans. Typical investments would include traditional crafts, wood
and metal working, bakeries, tailoring, repair and maintenance activities.
b. Medium-scale Industries. Up to US$600,000 of line of credit
would benefit medium-scale industries defined as enterprises requiring
long-term credit from $50,000 up to GCDB's present exposure limit (about
US$250,000). GCDB is expected to finance up to 75% of investment cost for



- 14 -
new projects and up to 90% for expansion projects. IDA would refinance direct
and indirect foreign costs. Its contribution would represent about 70% of
subproject costs. Investments now under considerations include groundnut
shell briquettes to replace charcoal, animal feed, laterite bidding blocks,
PVC products, wood and metal working and additional investments in fisheries.
c. Agriculture and Agro-industries. US$1 million would be allocated
to finance agriculture and agro-industries. To complement the credit com-
ponent of the Rural Development Project, GCDB under this project would limit
its financing to the following areas:
(1) Diversification efforts such as: orchards, vegetables,
poultry, livestock;
(2) Purchase of equipment for rice cultivation, processing and
marketing;
(3) Ancillary agricultural services (transport, storage facili-
ties); and
(4) Processing of agricultural products (fruit, vegetable,
and meat processing).
Since GCDB does not have strong in-house technical capabilities, it would
work closely with the Ministry of Agriculture and extension services to im-
prove technical appraisal and supervision of subprojects. Sub-loans would
range up to GCDB's present exposure limit (about US$250,000). IDA would re-
finance the direct and indirect foreign costs which on average would represent
67% of total subproject costs.
3.05      Terms and Conditions proposed for all sub-loans financed under the
line of credit are as follows:
a. Maturities would range from 2 to 15 years. Averages are expected
to be about five years for agriculture and SSE investments, and eight years
for medium-scale investments.
b. The interest rate to all final sub-borrowers would be 11% p.a.
This rate, a three point increase above GCDB's current development rate, is in
line with GCDB's current commercial rates and the rate charged agricultural
sub-borrowers under the first Rural Development Project. This rate would also
give GCDB an adequate spread to cover its administrative expenses. Finally,
it is slightly above the current inflation rate estimated at 9% and, given the
prospects for inflation, is expected to yield a positive real rate of return
over the life of sub-loans.
c. GCDB would calculate the internal financial rate of return for
all its sub-projects; for import-substitution sub-projects, it would also
calculate economic rates of return.



- 15 -
d. Foreign exchange risk would be borne by the Government without
an additional fee to the sub-borrowers.
e. The first five subprojects in each category would be submitted
to IDA's aproval. Subsequently a free limit of $50,000 for individual sub-
loans, with an aggregate free limit of $600,000 would be set.
f. GCDB would limit its long-term borrowing to four times its equity
plus unimpaired reserves.
g. The line of credit would be on-lent by the Government to GCDB
at the World Bank rate prevailing at the time of approval for fifteen years
after three years of grace. No commitment fee would be charged GCDB and
repayment would be on a fixed amortization schedule of equal, semi-annual
payments of principal and interest.
3.06      With the proceeds of this line of credit, GCDB should be able to
create about 700 jobs by financing roughly 29 agricultural projects, three
agro-industrial projects, 44 small-scale enterprises and 3 medium-scale
investments over three years. Table 4 below shows the financing plan which
could be expected for subprojects based on GCDB's past experience.

3.07      Technical Assistance to GCDB.  The technical assistance component
of the proposed project would aim to improve GCDB's accounting system and to
strengthen its project appraisal capability. Short-term accounting specialists
would be engaged for twelve man-months to review existing banking practices

and accounting procedures, design a new accountin;g system and propose new
procedures. The new system would be implemented by a financial advisor to the
chief accountant for two man-years. To equip GCDB with proper appraisal and
follow-up procedures for its development loans, the project would finance
three man-years for a technical advisor trained in engineering and experienced
in financial analysis. In addition to participating in project appraisal,
the advisor would be responsible for drawing up a procedures manual and pro-
vide in-house training to the staff in the Development Division. The tech-
nical advisor would be engaged before March 31, 1979 and his two counterparts,
a technician and a financial analyst, would be hired by GCDB by June 30, 1979.
To complement these activities, the project also includes an allocation of
$50,000 to sponsor internal staff training and courses abroad. To complete
the institution building effort, GCDB will complement its present by-laws
with a comprehensive policy statement governing its development lending.
Adoption of such a statement by GCDB's Board would be a condition of credit
effectiveness. It will also improve its legal procedures by adopting a
standard loan agreement by September 30, 1978 and by hiring a lawyer on its
staff as and when necessary. IDA would cover the foreign costs of training
and technical assistance, while GCDB would bear local costs (housing, trans-
port, subsistence). Government would finance these expenses directly out of
IDA Credit proceeds rather than on-lend them to GCDB as part of the line of
credit since repayment of these expenses would constitute a large share of
GCDB's earnings from its development lending.
3.08      Construction of GCDB's Office Building.  The inadequacy of its
present quarters, and the lack of office space in Banjul, justify GCDB's
decision to build new offices. If GCDB is to improve its operations, and to
expand its staff, it will clearly need suitable facilities. Preliminary
drawings call for a building of 30,000 square feet at a cost per square foot
of D 83 (including contingencies) for a total cost of about D 2.5 million.
To finance the building, GCDB has already allocated D 800,000 of its retained
earnings and expects to obtain D 600,000 from the Government pension fund.
There is a shortfall of D 1.1 million which GCDB cannot finance on its own
given its planned branch expansions nor are there other local sources of
finance available. The construction component of the proposed project of
$500,000 would therefore be sufficient to complete GCDB's financing plan.
Given the lack of office space in Banjul, GCDB is contemplating adding two
additional floors to the building for rental purposes until needed by its own
staff. This appears to be a sound financial proposition but would only be
done if sufficient financing is available. Funds for this component would be
on-lent by the Government at standard Bank terms as part of the line of credit
to GCDB. Design standards and costs as well as the final contract will be
subject to IDA approval.
3.09      Study of Housing Needs and Financing.  No institutional housing
credit is currently available to individuals except under a Government loan
scheme for its employees. GCDB, as the primary financial intermediary in The
Gambia, will ultimately be responsible for providing housing credit. Before
any financial involvement by GCDB, however, it is necessary to have a better
knowledge of the housing sector and to formulate appropriate policies and



- 17 -
procedures. This project provides eight-man months of short-term consultants
to study housing needs in The Gambia and means of financing. Consultants will
be responsible for evaluating potential demand for housing credit, and will
advise Government on suitable housing policies, review alternative means of
financing, and advise GCDB on necessary credit mechanisms. The housing study,
being of broad interest, will be carried out by the Ministry of Economic Plan-
ning and Industrial Development (MEPID). The project would finance foreign
costs; Government would finance any local costs (transport, subsistence).
C.   Project Costs and Financing
3.10      The project will cost US$4.5 million inclusive of taxes (US$0.5
million), of which US$3.3 million is foreign exchange. The proposed IDA
Credit of US$3 million would cover 90% of total foreign costs and would cor-
respond to 75% of project costs, net of taxes.
3.11      Project costs are summarized in table 5 below:

D.   Project Implementation
3.12      GCDB will be the primary agency responsible for project imple-
mentation. In executing the project, GCDB will coordinate closely with
the following organizations:
a.   IBAS to identify, appraise and supervise small-scale
subprojects. The project requires that small-scale
investors receiving a sub-loan below D 10,000 will
necessarily be assisted by IBAS. GCDB would agree to
meet regularly with IBAS to review the status of IBAS
assisted and GCDB financed subprojects.
b.   the Ministry of Economic Planning and Industrial Develop-
ment to identify and appraise medium-scale subprojects
that receive GCDB financing and a development certificate
or a Government guarantee. GCBD would also be involved
with the Ministry for the housing study.
C.   The Ministry of Agriculture to identify, appraise and
supervise agricultural subprojects.
3.13      Since construction is not a usual component of IDF projects,
assistance will be sought within the Bank to review the design, bidding
documents and final contract for the building and to supervise imple-
mentation.
3.14      Monitoring.  GCDB would be required to submit to IDA quarterly
operational and financial reports covering usual DFC information. These
include financial statements, arrears and resource positions, operations
(approval, commitments, disbursements), annual reports and audits. In
addition, GCDB would furnish information on staff training, and its coor-
dination with other project related organizations. Data on the economic
characteristics of firms financed under the project will be collected by
GCDB during subproject appraisal and follow-up.
3.15      Consultants.  IDA will approve the qualifications, terms and con-
ditions of advisors and short-term consultants financed under the project.
Provision has been made to finance five man-years of advisors and 20 man-
months of short-term consultant estimated at an average cost of US$5,625
<           per man-month, plus US$1,035 per man-month for travel and subsistence.
3.16      Procurement.  The purchase of equipment and goods under the line
of credit is not suitable for international competitive bidding, given the
nature and small size of subprojects to be financed and goods to be procured.
GCDB is expected to follow local procurement procedures which are adequate
to ensure that goods and services are suitable and reasonably priced. For
construction of its office building, GCDB will follow international competi-
tive bidding procedures in accordance with World Bank guidelines. The Gambia
is eligible for a 7-1/2% preference in favor of domestic contractors.



- 20 -
3.17      Disbursement.  Disbursement would be made on the following basis:
(1) Subloans to (a) Small-scale enterprises, 100% of GCDB's
subloans; (b) Medium-scale enterprises, 100% of foreign
expenditures and 70% of local expenditures; (c) Agri-
cultural enterprises, 100% of foreign expenditrues and
70% of local expenditures.
(2) GCDB's office building, 45% of total expenditures.
(3) Technical assistance and staff training for GCDB,
100% of foreign expenditures.
(4) Consulting services for the housing study, 100% of
foreign expenditures.
Disbursements under all categories would be fully documented. However, for
subloans below the free-limit, IDA could, if satisfied with GCDB's performance
following normal disbursement procedures, allow disbursements against certi-
ficates of expenditure, the documentation of which would be retained by GCDB
and inspected during supervision missions. Annex 13 gives the estimated dis-
bursement schedule.
E.   Benefits and Justification
3.18      The project is expected to generate the following benefits in
The Gambia:
a.   Productive Investments.  The project will result in the
implementation of about 80 financially and economically
viable subprojects, representing an investment of US$2.8
million in agriculture and industry. By supporting invest-
ments in diverse activities, the project will contribute
to the reduction of the country's dependence on groundnut
production.
b.   Employment Creation.  Based on past experience, the line of
credit is expected to create 700 jobs at an average cost per
job of US$4000; two hundred of these jobs will be in the
small-scale sector where average cost per job is expected
to be US$2200.
c.   Institution Building.  The institutional improvements in
GCDB to be achieved under the project such as better trained
staff, improved organization and control, adoption of sound
financial, legal and operational policies as well as improved
physical facilities will increase GCDB's overall efficiency
and the quality of its investments.



- 21 -
d.   SSE Assistance.  By making credit available to SSE, the
project will complement IBAS' efforts to upgrade local
artisans and entrepreneurs thereby contributing to in-
creased productivity and improved technical and management
skills.
3.19      Risks.  The small size of the Gambian market, the seasonal varia-
tions in consumers' incomes and the vulnerability of the economy to groundnut
price and yield fluctuations are not conducive to investment and there is the
risk that investments may not materialize as quickly as expected. GCDB's
development lending is to increase at about 10% per year. This is a realistic
growth rate, given GCDB's present pipeline of agricultural projects. More-
over, IBAS is expected to generate a sufficient number of small-scale invest-
ments and the strengthened technical capability within GCDB should help the
promotion of viable medium-scale investments. These investments will help to
diversify GCDB's portfolio which up to now has been concentrated in a few
enterprises. When fully disbursed, the line of credit will represent 23% of
GCDB's development lending.
3.20      The project's success will also be dependent on effective coor-
dination among the various agencies involved: IBAS, the Ministry of Economic
Planning and Industrial Development and the Ministry of Agriculture. GCDB
will have to rely in part on their staff for technical support in areas where
it is not practicable for GCDB to develop its own expertise. In the past,
however, GCDB has developed good working relationships with these agencies
and cooperation is likely to continue on the same basis. Furthermore, both
IBAS and the Ministry of Agriculture's extension services are being strength-
ened under separate internationally-financed projects. GCDB will therefore
benefit from these improvements.
IV. RECOMMENDATIONS
4.01      This report recommends an IDA Credit of US$3 million.  GCDB would
receive US$2.5 million as a line of credit on-lent by the Government to
finance building construction and its development operations. Of the remain-
ing US$500,000, the Government would grant US$440,000 to GCDB to finance
technical assistance and allocate US$60,000 to the Ministry of Economic Plan-
ning and Industrial Development to finance the housing study.
4.02      During negotiations, agreements were reached on the following
matters:
a.   The Government agreed to:
(1) on-lend credit proceeds to GCDB (paras. 3.05 and
3.08; Credit Agreement, Section 3.01);
(2) provide GCDB with adequate resources and guarantees
for Government-sponsored projects that are channelled
through GCDB (para. 1.20; Section 3.04 of Credit
Agreement); and



- 22 -
(3) carry out the study of housing needs and financing
under the Ministry of Economic Planning and Industrial
Development (para. 3.09; Section 3.01(e) of Credit
Agreement).
b.   GCDB agreed to:
(1) accept lending terms and conditions to sub-borrowers
(para. 3.05; Section 3.09(a) of Project Agreement);
(2) finance local costs of technical assistance and
appoint counterparts (para. 3.07; Schedule 2 of
Credit Agreement);
(3) adopt a policy statement governing its development
lending approved by its board and acceptable to IDA
(para. 3.07; Section 5.01(c) of Credit Agreement);
(4) meet regularly with IBAS to review the status of
IBAS-assisted and GCDB-financed SSE subprojects
(para. 3.12; Section 3.02(c) of Credit Agreement);
(5) coordinate with the Ministries of Agriculture and
Economic Planning on sub-project appraisal and
supervision (para. 3.12; Section 3.02(a) and (b)
of Credit Agreement);
(6) submit for IDA's approval the design, costs, financing
plan, bidding and procurement procedures of its new
office building (para. 3.08; Section 2.03 of Project
Agreement); and
(7) adopt a standard loan agreement acceptable to IDA for
its development loans (para. 3.07; Section 2.11(a) of
Project Agreement) and make satisfactory arrangements
to improve the quality of its legal services (para.
3.07 ; Section 2.01(b) of Project Agreement).
4.03      Condition of effectiveness is approval by GCDB's Board of a devel-
opment policy statement.
4.04      Other conditions are as follows:
a.   approval by GCDB's Board of a standard loan agreement
by September 30, 1978 (Section 2.11(a) of Project
Agreement);
c.   engagement of a technical advisor by March 31, 1979 and
appointment of suitable counterparts by June 30, 1979
(Schedule 2 of Credit Agreement).
4.05      With the above conditions fulfilled, the proposed project will
be suitable for an IDA credit of US$3 million.
