PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
THE GAMBIA - RURAL AND URBAN ENTERPRISES PROJECT
(CREDIT 814-GM)
PREFACE
This Project Completion Report (PCR) relates to IDA Credit
814-GM, Rural and Urban Enterprises Project, approved ou May 25, 1978.
During project implementation the line of credit was reduced in order to
provide additional funds to the other project components. The credit was
fully disbursed by September 30, 1984.
The PCR was prepared by the Western Africa Projects Department,
besed on data received from the Cambia Commercial and Development Bank
(GCDB), Staff Appraisal Report No. 1947-GM, supervision reports, legal
documemts, project correspondence files and other documents relevant to
identification of a second IDF line of credit for Gambia. No separate
mission was undertaken to prepare this PCR.
In accordance with the revised project performance reporting
procedures this report has been read in the Operations Evaluation Depart-
ment (OED) but the project was not audited by OED staff. The draft
Completion Report was sent to the Borrower for comments. The Borrower's
comments have been taken into account in finalizing the report and are
reproduced as an Attachment.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
THE GAMBIA - RURAL AND URBAN ENTERPRISES PROJECT
(CREDIT 814-GM)
HIGHLIGHTS
The main objectives of this Credit were (a) to provide foreign
exchange resources for financing small- and medium-scale enterprises
including those in the rural sector; and (b) to stredagthen the institu-
tional capacity of The Gambia Commercial and Development Bank (GCDB) so as
to make it a viable development finance institution. The Credit of $3.0
million was approved in May 1978 and declared effective in September 1978.
It consisted of three components: (a) a line of credit for GCDB;
(b) technical assistance to GCDB which included funds for a study of
housing needs in The Gambia; and (c) funds towards the construction c08ts
of a new office building for GCDB (paragraph 4.01).
The utilization of the line of credit component started well,
with the line being fully committed by mid-1982.  During project implemen-
tati.a a reallocation of funds reduced the line of credit to $1.3 million
from the original $2.0 million. The balance went to the other components
to help meet GCDB's needs for increased tecnnical assistance (which
totalled $0.6 million) and the significant cost overruns of the GCDB office
building (paragraph 4.09).
The project's achievements fell far short of expectations. The
line of credit financed 54 enterprises instead of the 79 expected during
appraisal. Subprojects created 550 jobs at an average investment cost per
job of $10,877 instead of the projected 1,025 jobs at an average investment
cost per job of $4,974. Actual data, as of December 30, 1984, were avail-
able on a sample of 47 enterprises. Out of the 47, 34 are operating at a
loss and 32 are operating at not more than 20% of installed capacity.
Although the project was successful in transferring resources to 54 small-
and medium-scale enterprises, the majority of these enterprises are neither
financially nor economically viable (paragraph 4.10).
The objective of building GCDB into an effective Development
Finance Institution (DFI) was also not achieved. GCDB is at present in
disarray, both from a financial and an organizational standpoint. With
excessive portfolio arrears on non-performing loans, GCDB is currently
insolvent and has serious liquidity problems. Its accumulated financial
losses exceed its net worth by four times, and its current liabilities are
twice its current assets. Apart from exogenous factors such as the general
econonic slowdown, GCDB's financial predicament was also attributable to
weaknesses in its management ard organization. It has incurred excessive
short-term borrowings. Its project supervision and loan collection are
deficient, as are its recording and accounting systems. Although the
experts financed under the technical assistance component generally



- iv -
performed satisfactorily, their contributions were far below the magnitude
of GCDB's requirements for external technical assistance. Furthermore,
some of their recommendations were not implemented by GCDB, partly due to
GCDB's shortage of qualified staff (paragraph 3.01).
Although the specific objective of constructing GCDB's office
building was achieved, its implementation was hindered by delays and
significant cost overruns. After successive modifications in design, the
GCDB headquarters building in Banjul opened on February 18, 1984 at a cost
of $3.8 million instead of the $1.1 million originally estimated. Further-
more, it is questionable whether a public sector financial institution
operating in a small, poor developing country such as The Gambia required
as expensive an offlce building (paragraph 4.19).
GCDB is currently in great need of financial and organizational
restructuring, an endeavor on which it is embarking with IDA's continuing             4
assistance. A comprehensive Action Program has been formulated at IDA's
urging and is under implementation by the Government and GCDB (para-
graph 3.16).
The following conclusions and lessons can be drawn from the
project's experience:
(a) The large dose of external technical assistance (US$632,810)
to GCDB funded under the project was ineffective, partly
because GCDB did not have the minimum internal capacity (in
terms of management and staff) required to derive its full
benefits;
(b) The poor performance of small-scale enterprise (SSE) sub-
projects was partly due to the lack oa any effective system
of technical assistance/extension services to them. This in
turn was attributable to the fact that the Indigenous
Business Advisory Service (IBAS), the agency set up to
provide technical/management advice to SSEs, was not
assisted by or otherwise involved in the project. Success-
ful implementation of an SSE project requires an integrated
package of financing and technical assistance to enterprises
before and after they are launched;
(c) The implementation of the line of credit might have been
more successful, especially in terms of selection of sub-
projects, if it had been extended also to the two commercial
banks operating in the country, under some apex arrange-
ments, instead of being confined to a single intermediary,
GCDB;
(d) The project may have achieved greater success if it had been
preceded by adequate sector work leading to the inclusion in
project design of a minimum policy package covering the
financial/industrial/SSE sectors. This would also have
improved the performance of assisted enterprises; and



v
(e) A first-time borrower which was also a weak and evidently
poorly managed intermediary such as GCDB required more
intensive supervision than the Division was able to provide,
although it is not clear to what extent this would have
affected the p;oject's actual implementation.  As early as
1980, supervision reports had pointed out serious problems
(high arrears, insolvency, operational deficiencies,
unfavorable economic environment), but stopped short of
recommending an Action Program containing remedial actions
to arrest the deterioration of GCDB's situation.
The above lessons should be taken into account in designing a new
IDF project in The Gambia.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
RURAL AND URBAN ENTERPRISES PROJECT
Credit 814-GM
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      World Bank missions visited The Gambia as early as 1969 to assess
industrial prospects and the demand for long-term financing. Given the
small size of the country and its limited prospects, it was concluded that
a multi-sectoral approach through a single intermediary was best suited to
meet the credit needs of the economy. Since its creation in 1972, the
Gambia Commercial and Development Bank (GCDB) had become the major source
of development lending especially in agriculture and industry. At the time
of appraisal GCDB had exhausted its term resources and as a young
institution, it needed further technical assistance. A Bank reconnaissance
mission in December 1976 identified the project. GCDB was appraised in
November 1977 and an IDA credit of $3.0 million was approved on May 25,
1978.
II. THE ENVIRONMENT
2.01      The Gambia is a small but densely populated country occupying a
narrow strip of land bordering the Gambia River and surrounded on three
sides by Senegal. The population (696,000 in 1983) is predominantly rural,
and about 80% of the work force is engaged in agriculture and animal
husbandry. Income per capita was estimated at US$290 in 1983. The Gambian
economy is traditionally centered on the production of groundnuts, its
major foreign exchange earner. Despite the importance of agriculture in
terms of the work force engaged, its output in relation to GDP has declined
since the mid-1970s and represented only 25% in 1983/84. The trade and
transport sector, reflecting the historical role of The Gambia as an
entrepot for neighboring countries together accounted for about 35% of GNP
in 1983/84. Government services and construction accounted for another 18%
and 8%, respectively. Although the share of the manufacturing sector in
GDP is still very small, it has increased from 3.7% in 1974/75 to an
estimated 6.0% in 1983/84.
2.02      Since the late 1970s the agricultural sector has been stagnating
due to successive droughts and fluctuations of international groundnut
prices. Between 1975/76 and 1981/82 the Gambia's terms of trade declined
by 50%. The Government's doubled capital investment program, which started
in 1974/75 under the First Five Year Plan, entailing heavy foreign
borrowing, resulted in little growth of real output. Debt service and
recurrent cost obligations related to the investments of the late 1970s
created severe pressure on government budgetary resources already reduced
by economic stagnation. Consequently, since the late 1970s The Gambia has
suffered severe balance of payments deficits, near exhaustion of foreign



- 2 -
reserves, a severe reduction in the government's capacity to finance its
development expenditures, and a fall in domestic savings to negative
levels. In 1982 and in early 1984 the Government introduced economic
stabilization programs supported by IMF Standbys, which included strict
fiscal and monetary measures. In February 1984 the Dalasi was devalued by
25% against the pound sterling. 1/
A. The Industrial Sector
2.03      The industrial sector in The Gambia is divided into three sub-
sectors: the formal manufacturing sector, which comprises mainly medium-
and a few large-scale enterprises; the informal sector, which comprises
establishments having fewer than five employees, including small-scale
manufacturing and handicrafts, and the construction sector. Manufacturing
as a whole is estimated to provide employment to slightly over 5000 work-
ers, most of whom are concentrated in the Greater Banjul area. Another
5000 persons are estimated to be engaged in construction.
2.04      At present there are over 40 industrial enterprises in The Gambia
classified as medium- and large-scale establishments. Sixty percent of
these, however, employ between 5 and 20 workers and only three employ more
than 100 workers. The largest, the government-owned Gambia Produce Ma-ket-
ing Board (GPMB) employs over 1500 people, and axperiences wide
fluctuations in its payroll relative to the groundnut production cycle. In
addition to groundnut processing activities, the GPMB is engaged in cotton
ginning, rice milling, and palm oil production. Most other medium- and
large-scale enterprises in The Gambia are in agro-processing and food
related activities (fish processing and freezing, rice milling, bakeries,
soft drinks and brewery). A few enterprises are engaged in wood products,
chemicals, plastics and metals. The Government has a large share in
several of these manufacturing activities. Altogether, around 70% of
output from registered manufacturing establishments is attributable to
Government and quasi- Government establishments. The Government-owned
industries have at best had mixed success. Banjul Breweries, the second
largest establishment, has reported loss83 since its inception. The Fish
Marketing Corporation, the third largest parastatal, went bankrupt.
Although for most of its existence, the GPMB has been quite profitable, it
accumulated substantial losses from 1981 to 1983, due to fluctuations in
groundnut production and prices.
2.05      Small-scale manufacturing, wh-ich includes handicrafts, is
dominated by self-employed entrepreneurs working alone or with one or two
apprentices. This sector plays a crucial role in the economy as a source
of employment and income. It is fstimated that in the Greater Banjul area
1/   D 5.0 - 1 pound sterling.  The effective conversion rate against
the U.S. dollar in October 1984 is D 3.75 - US$1.00.



alone, over 2200 persons are employed in small-scale production activities
(tailoring, leather work, carving, carpentrv, batik making, gold and
silversmithwork) amounting to 40% of total recorded employment in the
manufacturing sector. Construction is carried out by both the public
sector, particularly the Public Works Department (PWD), and private con-
tractors. Foreign firms have handled the majority of larger civil work
projects as the capacity of most local contractors is constrained by
shortage of capital and skilled labor, as well as lack of equipment and
construction materials, most of which is imported.
2.06      The expansion of industry in The Gambia is constrained by numer-
ous factors: the small size of the domestic market, which limits the scope
for import substitution, the scarcity of domestic raw materials, the
limited availability of credit, the shortage of local technical expertise
and management, an absence of private domestic initiative in the industrial
sector, and the vulnerability of incomes to groundnut price and yield
fluctuations. However, there is some potential for diversifying the
economy, which offers a range of investment opportunities, particularly for
small and medium entrepreneurs. In the agricultural sector, cereal and
grain production could be increased to reach food self-sufficiency. Fish,
poultry, meat, fruit and vegetable production could be expanded to meet the
demand generated by tourists and the growing urban population. Agro-
industrial opportunities, therefore, exist in food processing, animal feed,
storage and slaughtering facilities. The rapid growth of the urban
population (estimated at 10% p.a.) will generate increased demand for
import substitutes, services and housing, while increased agricultural
production will stimulate further demand for investments in transport and
storage facilities, repair and other related services. Tourism, which is
steadily increasing, also offers a growing market for traditional crafts.
Finally, sub-regional and regional cooperation under the Economic Community
of West African States (ECOWAS) and The Senegambia confederation should
further encourage the growth of local industries by opening larger markets.
2.07      Government Objectives and Development Strategy.  The Government's
principal objectives for the manufacturing sector as stated in the Five
Year Plan 1981/82 - 1985/86 are: (a) to improve the balance of payments by
stimulating export-oriented industries and selected import substitution
industries; (b) to expand employment opportunities in the manufacturing
sector; (c) to encourage private initiatives for the sector's development;
and (d) to contribute to the reduction of rural-urban migration by expand-
ing opportunities in the provinces.
2.08      To achieve these objectives the Government has introduced a
number of incentives, particularly for the private sector. Under the
Development Act of 1973 generous tax concessions have been granted to
encourage industrial development (i.e. exemption from customs duties, an
income tax holiday for up to eight years etc.). In 1976, with the assis-
tance of ILO and UNDP, the Indigenous Business Advisory Service (IBAS) was
set up under the Ministry of Economic Planning and Industrial Development
(MEPID). IBAS provides technical and business management advice to small
Gambian entrepreneurs and businessmen. It also provides loan guarantees



- 4 -
for those clients who cannot provide the normal collateral to the banks
when securing loans and gives small loans from a Government revolving fund.
There has, however, been a drop in the flow of resources to IBAS since
1980/81, which has seriously curtailed its activity.
2.09      An Industrial Development Unit (IDU) was recently set up in
MEPID, whose aim is to undertake industrial planning and to identify,
appraise, and promote industrial projects to be undertaken both by the
private and public sector. IDU also encourages joint ventures with outside
partners. The unit's initiatives have already met with some success with
the recent implementation of a number of new projects (a tannery, a clay
brick factory, a car battery factory) some in joint venture with foreign
entrepreneurs (Senegalese and European).
2.10      The Government is also trying to create a pool of technical
skills in The Gambia. Secondary technical schools and vocational schools
are being developed. A Management Development Institute wae recently
established under an IDA-financed education project.
B. The Financial Sector
2.11      The fina4ncial sector consists of the Central Bank, the Govern-
ment-owned Gambia Commercial and Development Bank (GCDB) established in
1972, and the Agriculture Development Bank established in 1982, two
foreign-controlled commercial banks (the Standard Chartered Bank of Gambia,
and the International Bank for Commerce and Industry), a postal savings
bank, two insurance companies (one Gambian, the other foreign) and the
Social Security and Housing Finance Corporation (SSHFC). Although they are
not financial institutions, GPMB and the Gambia Cooperative Union (GCU)
carry out some financial activities, especially in agricultural credit.
GCDB is the country's largest financial intermediary. The bulk of term
lending in The Gambia is undertaken by GCDB and the cooperatives; the
latter under the aegis of the GCU. The Agriculture Development Bank has
already exhausted its equity in loans which are not being repaid. The
private commercial banks undertake very little term lending, concentrating
almost exclusively on the financing of import trade and seasonal credit to
licensed buyers for the commercialization of groundnuts. These banks tend
to hold large, secure liquid balances with the Central Bank (40% of their
assets), or make deposits directly in GCDB. In contrast, about 75% of
GCDB's assets consists of loans and advances to local business, overdraft
facilities of the state enterprises, development credits for agriculture
and industry, and the accounts of GCU, which is the main conduit for
agricultural credit in the country. The reason for this pattern of savings
and lending has less to do with interest rate policies--which generally are
positive in real terms and offer quite attractive spreads to intermediar-
ies--than with the risks and difficulties of undertaking project finance in
the country.
2.12      The Financial Sector Review.  In the absence of adequate Govern-
ment policies and of fiscal prudence in public spending, debt recovery
deteriorated throughout the country. The Bank, therefore, decided to



- 5 -
undertake a study of financial institutions and their interactions to
identify appropriate measures to serve as a basis for any future IDF
lending. A review of the financial sector was carried out by a Bank
mission in May 1983. The mission's main findings indicate that in order to
rehabilitate and develop the financial sector, measures would be required
(a) to address the very serious arrears and 1efault problems faced by the
banks and financial institutions; (b) to improve and restructure the
capital and accounts of the state-controlled financial institutions; and
(c) to invest more in the development of the institutions themselves, by
improving management and by training staff. The report's findings have
been discussed with the Government whose response has been positive.
III. THE GAMBIA COMMERCIAL AND DEVELOPMENT BANK (GCDB)
A. The Institution
3.01      GCDB was created in 1972 with TNIDO assistance and is one of the
two Gambian-owned banks in the country. Following the Government's
ambitious development efforts and the creation of a large number of
parastatals, GCDB's activities during the IDA project implementation period
went beyond the scope foreseen during appraisal. GCDB now offers a wide
range of banking services which include both commercial and development
financing of trade, industry, agriculture and tourism. GCDB has five
branch offices and is the major source of institutional term credit.
B. Organization and Management
3.02      GCDB's Board of Directors consists of seven members:  the manag-
ing director, three representatives of the Government and the managing
directors of the Gambia Produce Marketing Board (GPMB), the Gambia Coopera-
tive Union (GCU) and the National Investment Board (NIB).
3.03      The current Managing Director has been with GCDB since 1972.  At
the time of appraisal senior management of GCDB was considered competent
although somewhat thinly spread given the bank's rapid growth since its
establishment.
3.04      GCDB is organized into three major departments--accounting,
commercial and development and two support unics, administration and
inspection. It employs 125 staff including 12 professionals. Half of
GCDB's personnel are with the Commercial Department which is the mainstay
of GCDB's operations. The Development Department employs only four profes-
sionals. During early project implementation years GCDB faced not only
inadequately trained staff but also inadequate offices. The project under
review included allocations for staff training and for building more
suitable headquarters for GCDB.



-6-
C. Operations 1978-1984
3.05      Commercial.  Commercial transactions represented 75% of GCDB's
activities and accounted for 90% of its revenues. The Commercial Depart-
ment handles savings accounts, executes foreign exchange transactions and
provides short-term loans for trading, subsistence credit and crop financ-
ing. These operations are financed mainly by GCDB's retained earnings,
deposits and the Central Bank's rediscount facility.
3.06      Development, GCDB's medium- and long-term lending is financed
through a development fund, an account kept separate from its other opera-
tions. In addition to the development fund GCDB can use its share capital
for development financing.
D. Financial Performance, 1978-1984
3.07      GCDB's financial performance during the project implementation
period was very poor. Although assets almost quadrupled between 1978 and
1984, this was mainly due to significant increases in short-term loans and
advances. GCDB experienced a continued growth in outstanding credit and
heavy reliance on Central Bank refinancing which grew from D. 5.0 million
in 1978 to D. 93.0 million in 1984.
3.08      GCDB's financial position continued to deteriorate mainly because
of excessive short-term borrowings, high arrears and low loan collections.
Its profitability during this period also progressively worsened. During
1982, 1983 and 1984 GCDB operated at a loss which, by end of 1984, reached
Dalasis 20.2 million. GCDB's continued decline in profitability has eroded
its equity base. Since July 1980, IDA has been pressing GCDB for an
increase in capital and for stronger internal controls. The 1981 increase
of D. 1.0 million in paid-up capital was not adequate. GCDB's
shareholders, including the Government, had serious financial constraints,
and GCDB was then reluctant to open share-holding to potential
participants. Furthermore participation by foreign shareholders had been
ruled out by both The Gambian authorities and the management of GCDB.
However, in June 1985 GCDB's paid-up capital was increased to D. .5 million
and the GCDB Act was amended to increase the authorized capital and to open
up shareholding to new domestic and foreign, private and public
shareholders.
3.09      GCDB's financial position as of June 30, 1984 is given in Tables
1, 2, and 3.  2/   It shows that GCDB is both illiquid and insolvent.  Its
current liabilities are almost twice its assets, its accumulated losses
four times its paid-up capital and reserves and its total liabilities
amount to D. 191.1 million, compared to a loan portfolio of D. 121 million.
2/   Audited accounts for Fiscal Year 1985 are not yet available.



- 7 -
3.10      About half of GCDB's loan portfolio is guaranteed by the Govern-
ment. Principal and interest in arrears as a percentage of total Govern-
ment guaranteed loans outstanding were reduced from 84% in June 1983 to 27%
in March 1985 due to Government assumption of a loan granted to the Gambia
Cooperative Union (GCU) at Government behest. However, arrears on the
remainder of GCDB's portfolio (i.e. not Government guaranteed) are much
higher (loans to area councils: 104%, and loans to the private sector:
79%). More details are given in Table 4.
3.11      GCDB's poor recording system and deficient accounting procedures
make an accurate review of its portfolio impossible. Other institutional
and staffing problems have also contributed to GCDB's current financial
disarray. The contract of the first accounting expert financed by IDA had
to be terminated prematurely due to disagreements between the expert and
GCDB's management. It took GCDB about 18 months to replace him in late
1981. A badly needed commercial bank manager could not be identified. The
management of the Development Bank Unit remained weak, project supervision
and loan collection were deficient and the recommendations of an
IDA-financed project appraisal expert (1979-1982) were not fully imple-
mented, partly because of a lack of follow-up by management, and partly due
to the shortage of experienced personnel. During this time, GCDB complete-
ly lost control over its finances. Loan arrears kept increasing to exces-
sive levels. Since 1981, the external auditors drew management's attention
to the need to implement better financial controls and since 1982, they
recommended a provision for bad debts of D 20 million; however, management
failed to act immediately on the former and rejected the latter recommenda-
tion. GCDB also failed in 1982 to act on an IDA request to carry out a
full portfolio review and to make adequate provisions on the basis of such
a review. When the revIew was finally carried out in 1983-84, the required
level of provisions for bad and doubtful debts was so high that it
increased the GCDB's prior year loss from D 1.9 million to D 20.2 million.
3.12      GCDB is currently in breach with almost all Gambian banking
regulations regarding minimum reserves, liquid assets and equity capital as
well as with the IDA financial covenant requiring that its debt:equity
ratio do not exceed 4:1. In 1984-1985 GCDB was able to continue operations
only because the Central Bank of Gambia (CBG) accommoo.tel its current
financing needs. However, as of June 1985, its borrowingz from CBG amount-
ed to Dalasis 111.2 million for which CBG keeps debiting GCD.'s overdrawn
current account with interest rates between 5% and 10% per annum.
3.13      GCDB's management has in the past attributed the bad quality of
its portfolio to : (a) poor performance of the Gambian economy especially
the agricultural sector; (b) tight financial position of many public
corporations borrawing from GCDB; and (c) Government pressure to extend
credit to several large farmers who did not reimburse their loans.
However, it now recognizes that GCDB's problems cannot be blamed solely on
external factors. Its management admits that its own deficiencies have
been a major factor for GCDB's current predicament and is trying to correct
its past mistakes. Lending by the Development Banking Unit was suspended
in 1984; directives have recently been issued to the effect that



- 8 -
disbursements can only be authorized by the Managing Director and for
credits that are properly documented; a team of four assistants to the
Chief Accountant has been appointed to work exclusively on the reconcilia-
tion of nostro and branch accounts and a Loan Recovery Unit has been
created where six officers cooperate with three external lawyers in enforc-
ing loan repayment through legal action. While modest improvements have
been achieved, GCDB still has to resolve other problems such as staff that
is badly paid (salaries are fixed by Government), low staff morale, and its
inability to fire unqualified employees and recruit more experienced
persons independently without prior approval by the Government.
E. Prospects
3.14      GCDB is in a state of organizational and financial disarray.
Operating policies and guidelines for internal procedures and financial
controls largely do not exist and where they do, they are not being used;
branch and nostro accounts have not been reconciled regularly; credit
documentation is incomplete and the management information system is highly
deficient. The position of the Commercial Bank Unit's manager has been
vacant for a long time, and conflicts exist between the Managing Director
and his deputy, the manager of the Development Bank Unit. The bank has
been used by Government as a window for financing politically motivated
projects for which CBG funds and Government guarantees were readily avail-
able and which were approved by GCDB almost automatically. Most of these
loans are now in arrears. GCDB managers have often authorized disburse-
ments in the absence of adequate appraisal reports, loan and security
documentation. The Board of Directors seems to be inactive and has obvi-
ously neglected its control function over management. Employees have taken
advantage of weaknesses in internal controls and perpetrited frauds which
went undetected over longer periods and resulted in substantial losses to
the bank. Clients have also started to exploit the situation, and willful
defaults are common.
3.15      Against such a background IDA missions visited Gambia to discuss
with Government, GCDB and CBG, GCDB's problems and options available to it
in the context of a possible second ID? project (Credit 814-GM was closed
in June 1983). The most recent such mission (August 1985) outlined two
basic options: to liquidate GCDB or attempt to salvage it through an
emergency financial restructuring. The Government chose the second option
because of (a) GCDB's importance within the financial system, (b) the
negative effect of a liquidation on public confidence in the banking system
as a whole, and (c) the potential dependence of the banking system on two
foreign institutions (Standard Chartered and BICI).
3.16      A comprehensive financial and organizational restructuring plan
for GCDB has been formulated and agreed upon by the Government, GCDB and
CBG. The implementation of this plan requires the dedication of GCDB's
management and staff and their strong commitment and seriousness to come to
grips with its problems. It appears doubtful whether GCDB's situation can
be significantly improved (short of replacing its top management), without



placing expatriate experts in key executive positions including that of
Deputy Managing Director and heads of some departments. 3/
IV. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives
4.01      The project's main objectives were:  (a) to provide term finance
to productive small and medium enterprises in The Gambia; and (b) to build
up GCDB as a viable financial intermediary. In addition, the project was
expected to provide an opportunity to advise Government on appropriate
credit and financial policies, including interest rates and resource
allocation.
4.02      To achieve these objectives the project included the following
components:
1.   Credit to Artisans, Entrepreneurs.  $2.0 million to be onlent to
GCDB as a line of credit to finance economically and f4nancially
viable enterprises as follows:
(a)   $400,000 to benefit small-scale labor intensive enterprises
defined as those having assets of less than $55,000 and
creating jobs at a cost below $4,000.
(b)   $600,000 to benefit medium-scale enterprises defined as
requiring long-term credit from $50,000 up to GCDB's
exposure limit of $250,000.
(c)   $1,000,000 to finance agriculture and agro-indestry.  GCDB
was to work closely with the Ministry of Agriculture and
extension services to improve technical appraisal and
supervision of subprojects in this sector.
2.   Technical Assistance to GCDB.  $500,000 for the following:
(a)   Twelve man-months of accounting specialists to design a new
accounting system for GCDB.
(b)   Three man-years of a technical advisor (i) to equlp GCDB
with proper appraisal and follow-up procedures for its
development loans; (ii) to draw up a procedures manual, and
(iii) to provide in-house staff training.
3/   See footnote under para 4.17.



- 10 -
(c)   Staff training and courses abroad ($50,000).
(d)   Eight man-months of short-term consultants to study housing
needs in The Gambia. Consultants were responsible for (i)
evaluating potential demand for housing credit, (ii) for
advising Government on suitable housing policies, and (iii)
for reviewing alternative means of financing and advising
GCDB on necessary credit mechanisms.
3.   Construction of GCDB's Office Building.  $500,000 was allocated
to supplement financing of GCDB's new office building. Existing
premises were inadequate and the construction of a suitable
building was justified, given the lack of office space in Banjul.
4.03      The terms of GCDB's subloans would range from 2 to 15 years with
an average of 5 years for agriculture and eight years for medium-scale
investments outside agriculture. The interest rate of 11% p.a., which was
3 percentage points above GCDB's 1978 rate was considered adequate to cover
its administrative expenses.
4.04      The line of credit was expected to create 700 jobs by financing,
over three years, a total of 79 subprojects (29 agricultural, 3 agro-indus-
trial, 44 small-scale enterprises and 3 medium-scale investments). The
foreign exchange risk was borne by the Government at no fee to sub-
borrowers.
B. Project Implementation
4.05      As the intermediary for the line of credit, GCDB was expected to
coordinate closely with (a) the Indigenous Business Advisory Service (IBAS)
to identify, appraise and supervise small-scale subprojects; (b) the
Ministry of Economic Planning and Industrial Development to identify and
appraise medium-scale subprojects and (c) the Ministry of Agriculture to
identify, appraise and supervise agricultural subprojects.
4.06      In terms of commitment of funds, the line of credit component got
off to a good start, and was fully committed by mid 1982. The pipeline of
projects was substantial but GCDB's internal capabilities were inadequate
to cope with a large number of subloans. During project implementation
there was a realization that the technical assistance planned for GCDB
during appraisal was insufficient in relation to GCDB's actual require-
ments. To allow for additional technical assistance, a reallocation of IDA
funds was made, which reduced the line of credit and increased the techni-
cal assistance component to $702,100 from the $500,000 originally ear-
marked. The component for financing GCDB's office building also encoun-
tered serious technical and financial problems. The effectiveness of the
implementation of these three components is assessed in the following
paragraphs.



- 11 -
C. Institutional Performance - Compliance with Financial Covenants
4.07      GCDB's compliance with the project's covenants has not been
satisfactory. Throughout project implementation GCDB failed to ensure
availability of adequate legal services to enable collection of overdue
payments from delinquent customers and has been forwarding its audited
accounts with considerable delays of one year or more, while the Project
Agreement required that reports be submitted no later than four months
after the end of the fiscal year (section 3.02).
4.08      In 1983 two more covenants were added to the list of non-compli-
ance: namely, failure by GCDB to (a) protect itself agalnst foreign
exchange risk as required in the Project Agreement, Section 3.07, and (b)
to limit its term borrowings to four times its equity base as required by
IDA.
D. Utilization of the Credit
4.09      The following is a comparative table summarizing appraisal
estimates and the actual disbursements of IDA funds following reallocation:

TOTAL                3,000,000            3,000,000
4.10      The line of credit financed a total of 54 subprojects for a total
of $1,572,182. Of these, 43 subprojects (80% by number accounting for 54%
of amount) were in the agriculture sector, 9 in the manufacturing sector
accounting for 45% of the total amount of the credit. The balance of the
line of credit (1%) financed two subprojects, a garage and a tailor. Based
on actual data, the subprojects created a total of 550 jobs at an average
investment cost per job of $10,877. (On the basis of subproject appraisal
estimates these 54 subprojects were expected to create 1,025 jobs at an
average investment cost per job of $4,974.) 59% of the total number of
subprojects created jobs at an average investment cost per job of $1,000 to
$4,000. About 72% of the line of credit financed rural projects and 72% of
the enterprises assisted were new entities. (For more details see
Table 8.)



- 12 -
4.11       Performance of Subprojects.  GCDB submitted actual information
on a sample of 47 enterprises (out of 54). Although the accuracy of these
data may be questionable it is the only information available on the
current situation of these enterprises. In retrospect GCDB's appraisal
estimates may have been over optimistic. Out of the 47 enterprises in the
sample, 34 are operating at a loss. The bulk of them, 32, are operating at
not more than 20% of installed capacity and 27 are making annual sales of
less than D. 9,000 compared to the 6 expected to do so at the appraisal
stage. One enterprise, the Taranga Mineral Water, which was expected to
make annual sales of D. 1.5 million, is now operating at 5% of installed
capacity and at a loss of D. 5,000 (Table 11).
4.12      GCDB was asked but did not submit to us actual information on
National Partnerships Enterprises which received the largest subloan
(US$379,122) under the line of credit.
4.13      There were several reasons for the bad performance of subpro-
jects, including the country's adverse economic conditions, exacerbated by
poor harvests. Similar to our experience with small- and medium-scale
enterprises (SMEs) in other West African countries, the state-controlled
promotional agencies, in this case IBAS and the Ministry of Agriculture,
failed to assist GCDB in the appraisal and supervision of SMEs and
agricultural projects respectively as expected in the Staff Appraisal
Report. This was partly due to the agencies' limited resources. GCDB's
own appraisal and supervision capabilities were severely deficient and no
doubt were largely responsible for the subprojects' poor performance.
4.14      Technical Assistance and Training.  The implementation of this
component has also been unsatisfactory. The IDA-financed advisors/experts
did not always receive the full cooperation of GCDB's management. As men-
tioned earlier, the first accounting expert quit prematurely because of a
disagreement with GCDB's management and was only replaced 18 months later.
The advisor to the Development Department performed well, but his recommen-
dations were not always implemented by GCDB, one reason being its shortage
of staff. In a number of cases he was refused access to documents critical
to his work. This review was intended mainly to assist in reconciling
inconsistencies between authorized loan amounts and disbursed amounts,
which IDA missions noted sometimes were as much as 200%. In addition to
the lack of full cooperation by management, the advisors had to train staff
who were ill-prepared to absorb the training planned for them.
4.15      During project implementation it became clear that the technical
assistance provided for accounting procedures review would not be adequate
to bring about the necessary improvements in GCDB's accounting and commer-
cial departments. Funds were, therefore, re-allocated from the line of
credit to extend the services of the accounting-administrative advisor.
However, although this advisor's recommendations were found acceptable by
GCDB's management, the reforms were implemented only partially and at a
slow pace because of the low educational level of GCDB's bookkeepers and
clerks.



- 13 -
4.16      In addition to on-the-job training the IDA project provided funds
for a training program for GCDB staff in Gambia and abroad on project
appraiZal techniques and other relevant subjects. The appraisal technique
course was administered by Bradford University of the U.K. Although this
training had some positive results, much remains to be done in this area.
4.17      At present, GCDB's internal capabilities remain very weak in most
operational areas, such as overall management, accounting, appraisal and
supervision. It is now doubtful whether GCDB can significantly strengthen
its internal organization without appointing expatriates in some key
executive positions. In retrospect, therefore, the project's technical
assistance has achieved little, partly on account of GCDB's lack of a
minimum internal strength (management and staff) to enable it to derive
full benefits from, and to internalize, the external technical assistance
it received. 4/
4.18      The housing finance study was completed in December 1979.  It was
considered of high quality, and its recommendations went beyond the provi-
sion of housing finance to include institutional strengthening of the
Ministry for Local Government and Lands (MLGL). The Western Africa Urban
Projects Division (WAPUR) was consulted at all stases during the
preparation of the study. In August 1980 an urban sector review was
carried out and in 1984 an Urban Management and Developtent project was
approved. Among other objectives, this project proposed to strengthen
MLGL.
4.19      The GCDB Office Building.  Implementation of this component
proved most difficult. Construction of the office building was scheduled
to start in late 1978, but, because of design problems, delays in preparing
necessary documents, and disagreements between the architect and the
contractor, did not start until 1981 and was not completed until December
1983. The new GCDB building opened officially in February 18, 1984.
4.20      According to Western Africa Education Division (WAPED)
architects, the original drawings for a 6-story building were
over-ambitious, the proposed technology and materials were likely to result
in delays, involved the most expensive type of foundations without adequate
4/   The Borrower expressed reservations about our previous proposal for using
expatriate bankers in key executive positions including that of Managing
Director. We consider our criticism of GCDB's existing maragement as being
warranted by GCDB's actual performance. However, in recent discussions
with the Gambian authorities following the previous draft PCR, the World
Bank has agreed that, in order to preserve the Gambian character of GCDB,
the necessary strengthening of its management could best be achieved by
placing expatriate bankers at executive positions below that of the
managing director.

investigation of the site's subsoils, and ignored important safety
features. By March 1979 delays and modifications increased the cost
estimates of the construction by 50% over the original amount. In mid-1979
a new architect was hired to make the necessary modifications as
recommended by WAPED.
4.21      The modified drawings which were available in mid-1980 were
reviewed by IDA and found satisfactory. Again delays followed in the
selection of the contractor. Although construction started in early 1981,
by August, the site was a big hole filled with rain water. Serious dis-
agreements developed between the contractor and the architects, who were
dissatisfied with the slow progress and with the lack of day-to-day super-
vision and construction. In October 19{31 the architects requested and
obtained termination of their contract with GCDB. From 1982, progress of
the construction is not documented in as much detail as in the preceding
years. However, GCDB did have great difficulty finding sources willing to
finance the shortfall in the revised financing plan, which cost overruns
brought to $3.8 million. The IDA amount of $725,718 was disbursed in 1982
when the shortfall was met by a loan from the Social Security and Housing
Finance Corporation.
V. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED
5.01      The main objectives of the project as described in paragraph 4.01
were not actieved.  Although term resources were provided, the project did
not succeed in strengthening financial intermediation as originally hoped
nor in financing economically and financially viable enterprises. The
project did not succeed in building GCDB into a viable financial inter-
mediary. As mentioned earlier in this report, GCDB is facing serious
difficulties. The actual performance of subprojects financed has been
generally very poor. Lastly, the financing of GCDB's office building was
completed only after significant delays and cost overruns. (The project
did give IDA the opportunity of a dialogue with the Government on a range
of policy and institutional issues which is still on-going, although the
outcome remains to be seen.) The following conclusions and lessons can be
drawn from the project experience.
5.02      The large dose of external technical assistance (US$632,810)
provided to GCDB under the project was ineffective, partly because GCDB did
not have the minimum internal capacity (in terms of management and staff)
required to derive its full benefits.
5.03      The poor performance of SSE subprojects was partly due to the
lack of any effective system of technical assistance/extension services to
them. This in turn was attributable to the fact that the Indigenous
Business Advisory Service (IBAS), the agency set up to provide techni-
cal/management advice to SSEs, was not assisted by or otherwise involved in
the project. Successful implementation of an SSE project requires an
integrated package of financing and technical assistance to enterprises.

5.04      The implementation of the line of credit might have been more
successful, especially in terms of selection of subprojects, if it had been
extended also to the 2 commercial banks operating in the country, under
some Apex arrangements, instead of being confined to a single intermediary,
GCDB. 5/
5.05      The project may have achieved greater success if it had been
preceded by adequate sector work leading to the inclusion in project design
of a minimum policy package covering the financial/industrial/SSE sectors.
This could also have had some effect on the performance of assisted
enterprises.
5.06      A first-time borrower which was a weak and evidently poorly
managed intermediary such as GCDB required more intensive supervision than
the Division was able to provide, although it is not clear to what extent
this would have affected the project's actual implementation. As early as
1980, supervision reports had pointed out serious problems (high arrears,
insolvency, operational deficiencies, unfavorable economic environment),
but stopped short of recommending an Action Program containing remedial
actions to arrest the deterioration of GCDB's situation.
5.07      The above lessons should be taken into account in designing a new
IDF project in The Gambia.
5/  The Borrower expressed reservations about our view as outlined in this
paragraph, on the grounds that "Lending in developmental areas is usually
carried out by a Government financed/subsidized institution, as such
lending carries greater risks than normally acceptable". We disagree with
this view. Recent World Bank experience in a number of African countries
indicates that the active involvement of commercial banks in developmental
financing, including lending to SSEs, is an objective both achievable and
eminently desirable. We strongly believe that even "developmental
financing" has to be done in conformity with sound financial principles.

IN CONFIDENCE                                                        5th May, 1986
REF: GM 115
Dear Sir,
Project Completion Report on The Gambia -
Rural and Urban Enterprises Project (Credit 814-GM)
We thank you for your letter dated March 4, 1986 forwarding a copy of the
draft Project Completion Report on The Gambia - Rural and Urban Enterprises
Project (Credit 814-GM) for our comments. We note that a copy of the Report
has also been forwarded to, among others, the Gambia Commercial and Development
Bank (GCDB) for their comments. We believe that the GCDB, which was fully in-
volved in the utilisation of the IDA line of credit of $3 million to which the
Report relates, will provide you with detailed comments on the various sections
of the Report.
2.    In so far as the Central Bank is concerned, we feel that the Report
highlights vividly the difficulties that result from the injection of relatively
large amounts of capital in developmental areas where managerial skills and
eflected technical know-how are in short supply.  While we are in broad agreement with
R;lected most of the conclusions enumerated in Part V of the Report, we have some reserva-
in par&.  tions in respect of the conclusions in paragraph 5.04.  Lending in developmental
5.04,foot areas is usually carried out by a Government financed/subsidised institution,
*  as such lendings carry greater risks than are normally acceptable.  Commercial
banks, particularly foreign banks, generally would not undertake such develop-
ment lending unless the loans are guaranteed by Government or the financing
agency. The three commercial banks might, of course, have provided very useful
input on the difficulties to be confronted in implementing such a financing pro-
ject.
3.    We also find it difficult to agree with the views expressed in paragraphs
3.16 and 4.17 of the Report in regard to the existing management of the CCDB.
Reflected The Report states that it is doubtful whether GCDB's situation can he signifi-
in para. cantly improved without a change in its existing management team and without
3i16 far._putting expatriate experts in key positions including that of Managing Director.
note 3    We feel that restructuring the bank using expatriate management personnel would
and para. change the nature of the 'Gambian bank' and would also unfairly suggest the
4.17,foot- management team guilty of incompetence, at best. If the bank is to be salvaged,
note 4 we are of the view that it should be by Gambians - the present Managing Director
*  and his 'effective' executives - supported by experienced expatriate hankers who
can provide on-the-job training for these executives, where necessary. In
this way not only would the bank be salvaged, but experienced management per-
sonnel would ',- 'saved' and given further useful training. Tn such circumstances.
it would be a condition that technical/policy advice could not be ignored by
the management without reference to either the bank's Board of Directors or the
Minister of Finance.

4.    Some of the minor discrepancies observed in the Report are listed below
for your attention:
2.11  - The GCDB and the Agricultural Development Bank are both owned by
Government and parastatal organisations. Government owns 52 per
Text                    cent of the equity in GCDB and 51 per cent in the Agricultural
amended                 Development Bank.  The balance equity is owned by parastatals.
- 'Standard Bank of Gambia' should read 'Standard Chartered Bank
Gambia Ltd'.
- International Bank for West Africa ceased to do banking business
in The Gambia in December 1985. A note is necessary in view of
the reference to two foreign banks at 3.15 and 5.04 as against
three foreign banks at 2.11.
Text           3.01  -  GCDB is not the only Gambian owned bank.  Agricultural Develop-
amended                 ment Bank is also Gambian owned.
- GCDB is not the only banking institution operating outside Banjul.
Standard Chartered Bank Gambia Ltd and the International Bank for
Commerce and Industry also operate outside Banjul.
Text aoended
3.08  -  GCDB's paid-up capital was increased to D5 million in June 1985.
- GCDB Act has been amended to increase the authorised capital
and to open up the shareholdings to new domestic and foreign,
private and public shareholders.
Text modified 3.09  -  Total liabilities seem to be D191.1 million and not D19.1 million.
