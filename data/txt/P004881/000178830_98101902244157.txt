EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
BANOUE ALGERIEN'NE DE DEVELOPPEMENT FOR AN INDUSTRIAL CREDIT
PROJECT WITI; TIIE GUARANTEF OF THE
DEMOCRATIC AND POPTlLAR RFPUF,LTC OF ALGERIA
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Banque Algerienne de Developpement with the guarantee of the Democratic
and Popular Republic of Algeria for the equivalent of U7S$40.0 million to hielp
finance lending for industrv.   Amortization would conform substantially to the
aggregate of the amortization schedulles applicable to the specific investment
projects financed out of the proceeds of the loan, witlh a maximum period of
15 years for individual investment projects. The interest rate would be
8-1/2 percent per annuim.
PART I - ThE ECONOMY
i.        tui economiiic report entitled "conomic Development and P'rospects of
Algeria"' (155-AL) was distributed to the Executive Directors on June 4, 1973.
An economic mission visited Algeria in April/May 1974 and returned in September
to complete a review of the country's second Four-Year Plan (1974-77). Its
report will be issued shortly. Country data sheets are attached as Annex I.
3.        In 1?6', Algeria's Revolutionary Council defined the fundamental
objectives which the country intended to pursue during the period ending
1980. These are: (i) to expand and organize the productive base enabling
the economy to reach, by about 1980, a stage of self-sustained growth with
full employment; (ii) to achieve economic independence, which implies that
the country would rely first on its own resources for development, although
international economic relations would be expanded and diversified; and (iii)
to improve income distribution, particularly among regions. These objectives,
and the strategy which has evolved towards their implementation, take into
account the country's physical and socio-economic potential, and form a set
of coherent choices to which the leadership is deeply committed.
4.        To attain the objectives defined in 1966, Algeria has adopted a
long-term strategy with four main aspects. The first is industrialization,
which is viewed as the principal means of achieving the long-term growth and
employment objectives, as the scope for expanding agriculture rapidly is
limited by physical and social constraints. Several essential functions are
assigned to industry in this perspective: to produce and process natural
resources, particularly the sizeable reserves of hydrocarbons (oil and gas),
for export to earn foreign exchange; to produce modern equipment for use in
all economic sectors; and to provide essential consumer goods required to
raise the living standards of the population. The second aspect consists of
structural institutional changes which are viewed as the means of keeping the



economy in Algerian hands amd of imparting dynamism to investment and produc-
tion. The main structural reforms are the application of central planning
to the economy as a whole, the expansion of the role of public enterprises in
industry and services, the Agrarian Revolution involving land and livestock
redistribution to poor farmers and the introduction of cooperative management
in agriculture, decentralization in favor of local government, and the parti-
cipation of workers in the management of state enterprises. The third aspect
is the acceleration of training and education to meet the skilled manpower
needs of the economy, improve employment opportunities, and develop an authen-
tic Algerian culture. The fourth aspect is the adoption of austerity in con-
sumption so as to generate national savings for investment and avoid excessive
recourse to external sources.
5.        In the seven years 1967-73 which constituted the first phase of im-
plementing the above strategy, structural reforms and investment were pushed
with vigor. The Government acquired nearly complete control of economic ac-
tivity through the systematic nationalization of foreign assets, including
those of foreign oil companies, and through the creation and expansion of
public enterprises. Total investment increased from 15 percent of GDP in
1966 to nearly 40 percent in 1973, public sector investment rising from 9
percent to 36 percent with more than half going to industry. In agriculture,
farms left vacant by departing foreigners in 1962 (about 2 million hectares)
have been managed by their workers under central planning and control, and
since 1971 the private sector (about 5 million iiectares of cultivated land
and 20 million hectares of steppe pasture) has been progressively brought
under the provisions of the Agrarian Revolution. Education and training were
rapidly expanded and improved. The school population rose from 1.5 million
in 1966/67 to 2.9 million in 1973/74 while the education and training sys-
tems were progressively modified to improve their efficiency, their relevance
to economic needs and their accessibility to the largest number of Algerian
children and workers.
6.        However, Algeria's strategy also yielded some less satisfactory
results. First, the real growth of output was below target (about 6 percent
per year as against a target of 9 percent) in the 1970-73 period, mainly be-
cause of delays in implementing many projects or in bringing their output to
design capacity, and due to poor agricultural performance. Second, the sec-
toral imbalance in investment caused bottlenecks in lagging sectors such as
construction, transportation, communications and housing. Third, while un-
employment in non-agricultural sectors declined from 27 percent in 1966 to
12 percent in 1973, the number of emigrated workers increased to about 440,000
in 1973 when emigration was officially stopped. In agriculture, production
performance, especially of state farms, has fallen short of expectations and
has been accompanied by an increase in underemployment; about 9 percent of
the agricultural labor force was officially considered to be "seriously under-
employed" in 1973 compared with 4 percent in 1966. Thus, in 1973, providing
jobs for unskilled labor continued to be a worrisome problem in Algeria,
while the shortage of skilled and experienced nationals was a primary res-
traint on investment and efficient management. Fourth, due to sharp differ-
ences in sectoral and regional development, disparities in income levels and



- 3 -
living standards have persisted; for instance in 1973, per capita consumption
was estimated at $130 on average in rural areas compared to $450 in urban
areas. The differences are smaller than in many other developing countries
due to the strong income and price controls and substantial free social
services; they are nonetheless keenly felt in the country.
7.        The large increase in oil prices during the last quarter of 1973
boosted Algeria's receipts from its main export product, crude oil although
crude oil output and exports declined in quantity by about 10 percent between
1973 and 1974, due to production difficulties in the last four months of 1974.
Thus export receipts from hydrocarbons rose from $1.4 billion in 1973 to an
estimated $4.3 billion in 1974. The additional $2.9 billion ($190 per capita)
which Algeria has derived from hydrocarbons in 1974 have greatly improved the
balance of payments. Despite a steep rise in the import bill due to sharp
increases in import requirements in volume (30 percent) and prices (35 per-
cent), Algeria has been able to repay in advance a part of the commercial
bank loans it had contracted earlier, and to increase its foreign exchange
reserves by about $550 million during the year. There has been a corres-
ponding improvement in the domestic financial situation, particularly in the
position of the Treasury which captures most oil revenues, but due to import
price rises and domestic pressures, price inflation has accelerated to a rate
probably exceeding 10 percent per year. The financial improvement has been
accompanied by an acceleration of GDP growth in 1974. The decline experienced
in crude oil output was more than offset by the sharply increased level of
investment, new output from industrial projects and the recovery of agricul-
tural production from the low level of 1973. Real GDP growth is estimated
to have been around 7 percent, and due to the gain in terms of trade and
the oil price increase, gross domestic income rose by 30 percent. With the
liberalization of consumer goods imports, private consumption increased by
an estimated 17 percent.
8.        The improvement in Algeria's financial situation and prospects has
led the Revolutionary Council to accelerate the pace of development and struc-
tural reform during the second Four-Year Plan (1974-77). The plan estimnates,
on the basis of implementation capacity likely to be available, that total
investment should reach at least DA 85 billion ($20.4 billion)in 1973 prices
during the 1974-77 period, and thus be about 2.3 times larger than during the
1970-73 plan. The plan also specifies a higher (maximum) investment target of
DA 110 billion ($26.4 billion), with supplementary projects to be undertaken
if implementation capacity can be raised above the estimated level. The share
of industry and hydrocarbons in total investment would decline to 44 percent
in 1974-77 from 54 percent in 1970-73, while the relative importance of other
sectors would increase. The share of agriculture would remain roughly con-
stant at 13 percent of total investment, with an average annual rate of growth
of agricultural production at 5 percent over the second plan period. Sizeable
allocations are made for regional development. Based on the expected outputs
from sectoral development programs, the plan's target for GDP growth is set
between a minimum (11.2 percent a year) and a maximum (12.5 percent a year),
which correspond to the two levels of investment. The projected growth of
investment and output would, according to the plan, create enough new jobs to



- 4 -
improve the employment situation substantially. The plan estimates that the
unemployment rate in non-agricultural sectors would decline to around 4 per-
cent in 1977, while there would be a marked reduction of underemployment in
agriculture.
9.        The plan also provides for an acceleration of consumption growth
and a reduction of regionaL disparities. It estimates that private consump-
tion should rise by 11.3 percent a year in 1974-77, compared to a growth rate
barely equal to that of population (3.3 percent) in 1970-73. On a per capita
basis, the growth rate of private consumption would be higher in rural areas
(9.6 percent a year) than in urban areas (5.5 percent a year) as a result of
increases in expenditures on rural development and social services. While
the plan projects import requirements to rise at constant prices by 21 per-
cent a year in response to the rapidly rising demand for investment and con-
sumption, it expects export receipts to be large enough to leave a small sur-
plus on goods and non-factor services for the 1974-77 period as a whole. Thus,
the plan does not anticipate any foreign exchange constraint, nor any diffi-
culties in domestic financing. HIowever, it does foresee that the resource
balance would deteriorate after 1974 and turn into deficit by 1977.
10.       From the viewpoint of physical implementation capacity the minimum
targets for investment, GDP growth and employment appear to be within reach,
and the new orientation of the development strategy in favor of lagging sec-
tors and regions, is highly desirable in view of the difficulties that have
appeared with past heavy emphasis on industry. Hlowever, the estimate of im-
plementation capacity on which the plan's investment target are based implies
that short-cuts will continue to be taken in the preparation of many projects
with adverse consequences for implementing them and bringing them to planned
output. In part for this reason, but also because of the high proportion of
projects with long gestation periods in the investment program (e.g. hydro-
carbon production, petrochemicals, and heavy metal, mechanical and electrical
industries), the delay between investment and the accrual of benefits is ex-
pected to lengthen temporarily. Indeed, the Incremental Capital Output Ratio
(ICOR) implied by the plan's minimum projections of investment and output
tends towards 5.0 by the end of the plan period compared to less than 4.0 on
average in the 1967-73 period. Further, while the employment situation will
probably improve substantially between 1973 and 1977, the investment cost
per additional job is high. On the basis of Plan estimates in 1973 prices,
it is about $38,000 in 1973 prices in the non-agricultural sectors, and around
$25,000 in agriculture (counting the reduction of agricultural underemploy-
ment). At the same time, and in spite of the large planned effort to accel-
erate further education and training, the supply of skilled nationals will
continue to be significantly sniort of projected needs at the high, and es-
pecially at the middle, levels of qualification.   The Government is taking
a number of measures to alleviate the problems created by this situation,
including the introduction of improved financial and other procedures to
bring about better operational results on the part of enterprises, and the
extensive use of international cooperation for helping in project implemen-
tation and carrying out extensive on-the-job training of nationals. It ex-
pects that the management of assets should improve progressively after the



- 5 -
current plan period when the supply of skilled nationals would catch up with
needs and the beneficial effects of organizational improvements are increas-
ingly felt.
11.       While the planned growth of investment, output and private consump-
tion will lead to rapidly rising import requirements in 1975-77, there is an
unusually wide margin of uncertainty surrounding the prospects for hydrocar-
bon export receipts which are to finance most of these requirements. This
uncertainty concerns the strength of external demand for crude oil and na-
tural gas, the policies that Algeria and other OPEC countries may follow
concerning the volume and prices of oil production, and the technical problems
still being encountered in oil production and large-scale gas liquefaction for
export. For instance, whereas the 1974-77 plan expected that during the plan
period Algeria's crude output would rise by 4.7 percent per year and the pur-
chasing power of Algerian crude on international markets would remain at the
level reached at the end of 1973, these crucial assumptions have not been
borne out by developments in 1974 and early 1975 due to technical and eco-
nomic factors. Crude oil output has declined to an annual rate of 45 million
tons in early 1975 compared to 50 in 1973, because of technical difficulties.
The realized price of crude exports has also declined from an average $13 per
barrel in early 1974 to $12 in early 1975, while Algeria has experienced an
increase in import prices of the order of 35 percent. Thus, the purchasing
power of Algerian crude in terms of its import prices has fallen in this pe-
riod by more than 30 percent. Meanwhile Algeria has continued to implement
the high investment strategy of the plan, implying a rapid increase in import
requirements. As a result of these developments, the external resource bal-
ance, which experienced a surplus of about $220 million in 1974, may show a
deficit tentatively estimated at more than $1 billion in 1975. To finance
this deficit and keep reserves at the level needed for confidence and liquid-
ity, Algeria is planning to borrow up to $2 billion from external sources in
1975. Depending on the level of hydrocarbon export receipts in 1976 and 1977,
Algeria may have to reduce substantially the growth of investment and private
consumption from the high annual rates planned for the 1974-77 period so as
to keep import and external borrowing requirements within manageable limits.
While Algeria's economic and financial prospects are particularly difficult
to forecast beyond 1977, since these will depend on uncertain domestic and
external factors (mainly the rate of investment, its efficiency, and the
level of hydrocarbon export receipts), it seems likely that Algeria will
continue to have sizeable external borrowing requirements until the early
1980's, when the large export projects concerning gas and petrochemicals
are expected to make a substantial contribution to export receipts.
12.       Algeria's total external debt, outstanding and disbursed, was about
$3.2 billion ($5.0 billion including undisbursed) at the end of 1973, and
declined somewhat in 1974 since the country made advance repayments on some
of the loans contracted in 1972-73 with foreign commercial banks. Debt serv-
ice, excluding these advance repayments, is estimated to have fallen from



- 6 -
11.3 percent in 1973 to 9.5 percent in 1974 of export of goods and non-factor
services. It is projected to rise to about 15 percent of exports in 1977.
In later years, depending on the investment strategy which Algeria may choose
and the level of hydrocarbon export receipts, the ratio would rise further in
a range comprised between 15 and 19 percent of exports by 1980. It would fol-
low a declining trend in the 1980's when the large gas and petrochemical proj-
ects generate increasing exports. Algeria's external borrowing needs are large
in the next few years, but can be acconmmodated in view of the considerably en-
hanced capacity to carry debt which it has acqluired as a result of the new
relationship between the prices of hydrocarbons and other commodities in world
markets, and of the long-term prospects for gas and petrochemical exports.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
13.       Lending to Algeria resuned in FY73 and, to date, the Bank has lent
$182 million for five loans in transport, power and education. Annex II con-
tains a summary statement of Bank loans as of April 30, 1975, and notes on
the execution of ongoing projects. To date, disbursements have been low
($4.3 million) mainly reflecting the fact that loans to the railways and
power sector, as well as the port loan, were declared effective only with
considerable delay. Increasing familiarity with Bank procedures is expected
to lead to a better record on this account.
14.       Bank lending to Algeria initially focused on infrastructure proj-
ects to alleviate the serious constraints that an inadequate infrastructure,
in particular transport, imposed on the development of productive sectors.
In the future, activities will be broadened to focus on technical assistance
and institution-building in an attempt to improve returns on investments and
to spread the benefits of growth. The Bank's project lending would emphasize
the value of thorough project preparation and support the Government's efforts
to increase the efficiency of economic institutions. The two projects being
presented this Fiscal Year, for industrial credit and rural development, are
the first steps in this direction; thus the proposed industrial credit opera-
tion aims at improving the quality of project preparation while the rural
development project being presented simultaneously would develop institutions
to serve the agricultural sector. Over the next two years, Bank lending would
continue to broaden this effort and envisages follow-up projects to the pro-
posed project as well as projects in education, industry, transport, rural
development and agricultur-l credit.
15.       In connection w:i:h the Bank's proposed lending program substantial
technical assistance may be needed and requested by the Government; a joint
Bank/IMF technical assistance mission visited Algeria in the spring of 1974
at the request of the Government to study the financial planning system, and
in late 1974 the Economic Development Institute held a course in Algeria deal-
ing with various aspects of financial planning at the central government,
banking and project levels. Considerable interest was shown by the author-
ities in this course, and at their request, the EDI is planning to organize
a program of courses over the next two years with the Government bearing the
cost.



-7-
PART III - THE SECTOR
16.       The industrial sector, including hydrocarbons, in Algeria accounted
for more than half of GDP and total investment in 1974. The bulk of indus-
trial activity takes place in the hydrocarbon sector, followed by manufactur-
ing and construction. In manufacturing, food processing, textiles and leather,
and chemicals are of importance. The sector is controlled by the State through
a network of State Enterprises (see para. 18) which together own nearly all
industrial assets. The private sector is largely limited to textiles, leather
and small-scale construction.
17.       The creation of an integrated and diversified industrial sector
based on the utilization of available natural resources is seen by Algeria as
the key to the country's development effort. Hence the emphasis of industrial
policy, as formulated in multiannual plans, has been on the establishment of
basic industries (hydrocarbon, steel, plastic, fertilizers), and investments
of high priority in the fields of processing (metal, electrical products,
tractors, construction materials) and light consumer goods industries. In
addition, policies under the new 1974-77 Plan lay stress on the development
of small and medium-size industries at the regional level within the frame-
work of a Regional Industrial Development Program (RIDP), making for a more
rational utilization of local hum,an and natural resources. In implementing
these policies, the niain objective has been a rapid physical build-up of an
industrial production structure. Criteria of returns on investment, effi-
ciency in production and pricing policy have played a secondary role. Not-
withstanding a certain measure of waste and inefficiencies, as well as im-
balances in the productive capacity of various industries due to this ap-
proach, Algeria's industrial development policy has radically changed the
structure of the economy which, at independence, was largely agricultural.
18.       All major industrial sub-sectors are controlled by State Enterprises
combining production and distribution functions and generally enjoying a mono-
poly on foreign trade. These enterprises operate under the guidance and super-
vision of the Ministry of Industry and Energy. It defines general policy
guidelines for the enterprises and sees to their implementation; it approves
organizational changes, makes appointments to senior positions, determines
annual and multiannual investment programs before their transmittal to the
Secretariat d'Etat au Plan (SEP) - the central planning authority - where
investment decisions are centralized, and determines the allocation of profits
in cooperation with the Ministry of Finance. Financial control is exercised
by the Ministry of Finance and the banking system. State Enterprises lack
financial autonomy; under the concept that they are an instrument of the
State's economic policy and as such are financed by the State and provide
finance to the State, all cash generation by the enterprises is turned over
to the Treasury, or placed in Government bonds. lience they are fully depend-
ent on credit to finance their investments and current operations. Investment
financing is provided by the Banque Algerienne de Developpement (BAD) which is
the only source of long-term investment loans in industry, and three state-
owned primary (i.e. commercial) banks for short- and medium-term credit. The



- 8 -
primary banks also check the actual financial performance of enterprises
against their quarterly or annual operating budgets. BAD and the Treasury
intervene if an enterprise shows losses or chronic liquidity problems. Such
an intervention may take the form of a "restructuration", an "assainissement"
or an increase of working capital through the extension of low-interest, long-
term loans. A "restructuration" comprises debt rescheduling and interest ad-
justments, while an "assainissement" restructures the financial obligations
of an enterprise in line with its investment, production and sales programs
in order to enable it to operate on a financially viable basis.
19.       The construction materials industry.   The construction materials
industry is one of the priority sectors in Algeria given the existing, and
rapidly widening, gap between supply and demand for construction materials
coupled with the rapid growth of Algeria's population; housing, schools, and
other social and industrial buildings are in acute shortage. The insufficient
local production of construction materials has been, so far, the main con-
straint to construction, in spite of Algeria being rich in all basic raw
materials needed.
20.       The sector is presently dominated by two large State Enterprises
(Societe Nationale des Materiaux de Construction, SNMC, and Societe Nationale
de Constructions Metalliques, SNMetal). Though they will carry the bulk of
the construction materials investment program, the Plan also gives an important
role in the sector to smaller public enterprises to be set up by local adminis-
trations (Wilayate) under the recently launched Regional Industrial Develop-
ment Program (RIDP). This program is intended to encourage the industrializa-
tion of the least advanced provinces, the creation of industrial jobs away
from the three major industrial centers, and the more rational utilization of
available human and natural resources to meet local needs. RIDP projects will
be decentralized and scattered throughout the country, will generally be of
moderate size, relatively labor intensive, and technologically uncomplicated.
They promise to be of high economic value and to supplement significantly the
Government's efforts towards agriculture-based rural development.
21.       The development of the sector's production capacity is belhind sched-
ule with only somewhat over half of tlhe planned increase being attained during
the course of the 1970-73 Plan. The main causes of the difficulties experi-
enced in expanding production have been inadequate project preparation and
supervision owing to inexperienced staff and leading to underestimation of
project costs; difficulties in formulating adequate financial plans and weak
planning of implementation schedules resulting in lack of coordination with
domestic and foreign suppliers.
22.       The aim of Algeria's planners is to reach, by 1980, an equilibrium
between domestic supply and demand for construction materials and a major
investment effort is underway to achieve this objective.   Compared to invest-
ments in the course of the 1970-73 Plan, which amounted to about DA 1 billion
for construction materials projects, new investments in the 1974-77 Plan are
expected to amount to at least 7 times as much. In terms of value added, SNMC



- 9 -
alone is expected to more than quadruple by 1977, compared with 1973, and the
entire branch is expected to triple in the period. Over the same period,
SNMetal plans to invest DA 1.0 billionin construction material plants and the
implementation of the RIDP will require investments of some DA 1 billion.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
23.       A detailed description of the project is given in the report en-
titled "Appraisal of an Industrial Credit Project to Banque Algerienne de
Developpement", Report No. 782-AL of June 10, 1975, which is being distributed
separately. The loan and project summary are attached in Annex III. The
Government requested Bank assistance to BAD in April 1973. The appraisal of
the project is the result of several missions to Algeria between October 1973
and March 1975. Negotiations were held in June 1975 and the Algerian delega-
tion was led by Mr. Rachid Hassam, Director of the Treasury and included
Mr. Ali Kara-Mustapha, President General Manager of BAD.
The Project
24.       The proposed project would respond to the Government's growing
desire to strengthen financial controls on investment decisions, in order to
minimize misallocations, waste and imbalances in the economic structure. The
government has shown increasing interest in a more systematic application of
economic, financial and technical appraisal criteria and the related methodo-
logy to the selection and implementation of investment projects. It wants
the Banque Algerienne de Developpement (BAD) gradually to take on a larger
responsibility in these respects and has asked the Bank to support BAD by
extending to it an industrial credit, coupled with a technical assistance
program, intended to upgrade BAD's project appraisal and supervision capabili-
ties. The long-term objective would be to place BAD in a position to provide
the Government with an independent judgement on projects in the industrial
sector.
25.       At present, as a result of an insufficient number of qualified ex-
perts BAD has limited responsibility. Its main function is to assure long-
term financing for projects approved by the central planning authorities;
this function includes preparation of financial plans, provision of long-term
funds and foreign credits, and supervision of project implementation and dis-
bursements. However, BAD is not involved fully in the appraisal of projects,
which are generally prepared by the State Enterprises and the technical min-
istries, nor does BAD give the go-ahead for the industrial investments; that
function is vested in the Plan Secretariat. BAD has limited resources and
little experience in actual project evaluation and monitoring.
26.       The proposed loan would aim at assisting BAD in upgrading its
appraisal and supervision standards, and in expanding its influence over in-
vestment decisions in Algeria. This process is likely to require many years



- 10 -
and will involve substantial recruiting and training problems. In addition,
BAD will need to prove to the decision-makers that its new role can be bene-
ficial to the economy. However, with the declared support of the Algerian
authorities, and the assistance of the Bank, BAD should be able to attain,
within a reasonable period of time, adequate standards of project appraisal
and supervision which should help BAD to reach, within the Algerian economic
system, the standing it needs to increase its role and to effectively improve
the quality of decision-making. While the experimental nature of the project
has to be recognized, the cooperation received from both the Government and
BAD in the preparation and definition of the project would seem to ensure
that its objectives will be achieved. Should expectations be met, BAD would
merit continued Bank supporl in future years.
27.       The construction materials industry   would be the focus of the pro-
posed loan because (a) it has priority in Algeria's economic development ef-
fort, and (b) it offers BAD the opportunity to develop project appraisal and
supervision expertise over a reasonable large number of sub-projects that do
not present exceedingly complex technical difficulties. The selection, ap-
praisal and supervision of individual subprojects would be confided to BAD,
but would be closely monitored by the Bank.. A special Unit has been created
for this purpose within BAD, with a view to eventually expanding its project
appraisal and supervision function to other types of projects. The Unit would
undertake detailed appraisals of subprojects to be financed under the proposed
loan, including in particular an analysis of their technical, financial and
economic viability, of marketing and management aspects, and of the credit-
worthiness of the enterprises to whicti sub-loans would be made. The policy
and operating guidelines agreed for the project (Schedule 3 of Loan Agreement)
provide that sub-loans will normally be approved only for projects which have
an internal financial rate of return of not less than 9%, an. economic rate of
return of not less than 8% and where financial projections show that it will
be possible to maintain adequate working capital and debt service coverage.
28.       The Unit, though small at the beginning, will he staffed with econ-
omists, one or more engineers and financial analysts of sufficient experience
and training. In addition, two experienced staff members of the Bank will be
seconded to BAD and assigned to this Unit to lhelp in appraising projects, to
advise on methods and policies and to train staff. UNDP has indicated in-
formally that it would favorably consider a Government request for finan(cing
for the seconded staff. Institut National de la Productivite et du Develop-
pement Industrial (INPED), an agency under the Ministry of Industry and Energy,
would assist BAD in the technical/market/training review and preparation of
subprojects to be financed under the project. INPED is receiving substantial
foreign technical assistance and has the qualifications to accomplish this
role.
29.       The proposed loan of $40 miillion, would finance part of the foreign
exchange component of selected construction material projects over a period
of about two years, starting mid-1975. Proceeds from the loan would be on-
lent at a minimum annual rate of 10 percent, with the foreign exchange risk
being borne by the sub-borrowers. The proposed loan amount has been arrived
at taking into account the estimated appraisal capabilities of the Unit to be



- 11 -
established in BAD and the objective to give it as wide an experience as pos-
sible in project appraisal of both state enterprises and RIDP projects. The
amounts allocated to subloans to be made by BAD under the project would be
limited to $5 million per subproject for SNMC and SNMetal, and to $2 million
per project for RIDP. SNMC and SNMetal would be the final recipients of about
50 percent of the proposed loan, while the other 50 percent would be for RIDP
projects. These amounts should cover 5-10 subprojects sponsored by the two
State Enterprises and 15-25 subprojects with the RIDP. All sub-loans would
be submitted to the Bank for approval. A small portion of the loan (up to
$100,000) would be available to BAD to finance the foreign exchange cost of
the consultants' services to strengthen its accounting procedures and train
auditors. The term of the loan will be determined on the basis of the com-
posite maturities of BAD's subloans, which will not exceed 15 years.
The Borrower
30.       The proposal to lend to BAD arises from the Bank's desire to have
as close a relationship with the executing agency as possible in order to
help strenghten the institution generally, as well as reinforce the work and
status of its appraisal and supervision unit. BAD is a State Enterprise fully
owned by the Government; it functions to a large extent as administrator of
Algeria's capital budget outside agriculture. Its total assets amount to
over DA 9 billion (US$2.3 billion); it has an annual lending program well in
excess of one billion US dollars equivalent for the 1974-77 period. Its long-
term investment loans generally provide about 40 percent of the cost of indus-
trial investments. Of the rest, 30-35 percent is made up of medium-term loans
provided by the primary banks while the balance - 20-30 percent - is financed
with foreign suppliers credits. Over 50 percent of BAD's lending is directed
to oil, natural gas and steel mills followed by the electrical and construction
materials industries. Financially it is a channel for Treasury funds; its
responsibility is limited, since its solvency is assured by the Treasury, and
its creditworthiness rests upon that of the Government. Interest rates and
credit terms are controlled by the Government; BAD's long-term industrial loans
in local currency are made at a rate of 5.75 percent for a period of up to 20
years. On foreign exchange loans, however, interest rates reflect actual cost
plus a small margin to cover administrative expenses.
31        The financial structure of BAD is essentially made up of its bor-
rowings from the Treasury (DA 7.2 billion at June 1974) and of outstanding
long-term loans to public enterprises (DA 8.4 billion). Liabilities also
include foreign borrowings of DA 802 million (June 1974). BAD's equity amounts
to only DA 213 million.   It also has quasi-equity of DA 1,031 million related
to the public funds managed on behalf of the Treasury. The current ratio is
very comfortable, being well above 2:1, and the debt service ratio coverage
is roughly at the 1:1 level. BAD's profitability is low compared to the size
of its loan portfolio due to the narrow spread (u.75 percent) between its bor-
rowing and lending rates which are both fixed by the authorities with a view
to keeping financial charges as low as possible.



- 12 -
32.       Total arrears of principal and interest overdue by more than six
months on BAD's own portfolio amounted to DA 106 million (1.3 percent) in
June 1974. Portfolio affected by these arrears amounted to DA 0.8 billion or
9.7 percent of total portfolio. The procedures for rescheduling or restruc-
turing industrial debts described in para. 18 avoid actual losses. However,
the administration of these procedures are cumbersome and subject to substan-
tial delays. Thus, arrears in BAD's portfolio are more a reflection of
administrative bottlenecks than of BAD's exposure to real risks. BAD, as far
as its fiduciary creditworthiness is concerned, carries practically no risk.
33.       Audit.  BAD is audited by the Inspectorate of the Ministry of
Finance.  However, in view of the envisaged new appraisal and supervision
objectives of BAD, the Government and BAD have agreed during negotiations to
have inspectors of the Ministry of Finance audit BAD's financial accounts
once a year, with particular focus on the following: the quality and accuracy
of accounting methods; the proper use of funds; the status of arrears and
remedies to be applied; and the financial situation of borrowers. For the
latter two points the focus will be on loans for projects financed with Bank
funds. This review is considered by the Government, BAD and the Bank as a
major step to familiarize, for the first time, BAD and its auditors to the
objectives of an audit conducted in accordance with generally accepted ac-
counting principles. A small provision in the proposed loan amount would be
available to BAD to strengthen its accounting procedures (see para. 25).
34.       Organization.  The Ministry of Finance formulates BAD's policies
while its Board acts as an administrator. The Board is chaired by the
General Mlanager, and includes his deputy, the Director of the Treasury and
representatives of the Central Bank, the Plan Secretariat, and the three
primary banks. The control ministry of the enterprises being discussed at
any given meeting is also represented. In addition, the Minister of Finance
may send his personal representative to any meeting.   The General Manager who
is nominated by Presidential decree on the proposal of the Ministry of Fi-
nance, is responsible for all operations and implementation of the Board
decisions. Mr. Ali Kara Mustafa has been BAD's President since May 1973.
BAD has a staff of 225 of which 75 can be considered professionals.
35.       With a staff of this size, and a relatively thin management struc-
ture, BAD cannot look into all the details of its sizeable investment program.
Until recently, top management was overburdened and could not devote suffi-
cient attention and time to matters of policy, training and organization.
Increasingly, however, middle management (composed mainly of eight Assistant
Directors) has been able to take a more active and responsible role and the
management situation is improving. Nevertheless, BAD's staff has little ex-
perience in project appraisal and supervision. There are no engineers and no
market analysts, and expertise in financial analysis requires strengthening.
Since 1973, BAD has been increasingly concerned with training its staff in
project appraisal and financing matters. Several training programs have
recently been conducted and BAD has benefitted from EDI courses held in
Algeria and in Washington.

36.       Benefits and Risks.   This first operation with BAD will have, in the
short run, a limited impact. The immediate purpose of the project is to help
BAD develop the capacity to employ sound appraisal techniques and to demonstrate
their merits and role in decision-making. To this extent, the project carries
good prospects of success because of the subsector chosen, the relative sim-
plicity of the projects envisaged, the support of the Government, and the
limited scope presently proposed. Over the long run, it is hoped that the
project will lead to more widespread use of sound appraisal techniques in BAD
and in project evaluation in Algeria generally. Although the practical pros-
pects for a broader demonstration effect are difficult to assess, and the
existence of a major risk that the project may have only a limited impact must
be recognized, on the basis of the dialogue already well established between
the Algerian Government, BAD and the Bank for this project, it seems reasonable
to expect that the project may open the door to a wider role for BAD over the
longer run, including a much closer association with the Algerian decision-
making process for investments.
37.       Whatever its wider impact may ultimately be, the project can be
expected to result in important sector-specific benefits because of its em-
phasis on the construction materials sector, which stands as one of the key
industrial sectors in Algeria given the rapidly rising demand for construction
materials for dwellings, schools and industrial buildings; it is a sector in
which many of the most basic products cannot be imported, either because there
is no industrial market for them or because it is not economical to transport
them over any but short distances; and finally, the projects in this sector
(especially, but not exclusively, those of RIDP), are generally of smaller
size, more labor intensive, and geographically more decentralized than those
of other industrial branches. For all these reasons, investment projects in
the sector can be expected to yield a high economic return, as well as to
generate important social and regional benefits.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
38.       The draft Loan Agreement between BAD and the Bank, the draft
Guarantee Agreement between the Democratic and Popular Republic of Algeria
and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Sec-
tion 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a draft resolution
approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately.
39.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Loan 912-AL    Highway ProJect; US$18.5 million Loan of June 19, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
The highway improvement works and procurement of project equipment
are progressing well. Due to the Government reassessment of highway develop-
ment priorities, the preinvestment studies were delayed. However, the coor-
dinating consultants are now appointed, feasibility study consultants will be
selected shortly and the studies are expected to start about September 1975.
Loan 913-AL    Education Project; US$6.0 million Loan of June 19, 1973;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976.
Implementation of this project initially suffered delays due to
ineffective liaison with the Bank. The Government has now appointed a liaison
officer and communications were improved. No withdrawal applications have yet
been presented to the Bank.
Loan 995-AL    Port Project; US$70.0 million Loan of June 10, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978.
Work is progressing satisfactorily, and consultants are supervis-
ing construction. The Loan only recently become effective following the con-
clusion of a special agreement between the Algerian Government and Kreditan-
stalt fur Wiederaufbau, to which effectiveness of the Bank loan was linked.
In May a disbursement application for US$11.6 million was received; it is
presently being processed in the Bank.
Loan 996-AL    Railway Project; US$49.0 million Loan of June 19, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978.
The physical execution of the project is being carried out on time.
Maintenance of locomotives and rolling stock has still to be reorganized in
order to achieve agreed operating targets. Consulting studies financed under
the loan should help SNCFA to improve the availability of locomotives and
rolling stock in the near future.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of reports in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation
of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Loan 997-AL    Power Project; US$38.5 million Loan of June 10, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1978.
The project is showing reasonable progress, although some delays
have occurred in evaluation and award of main contracts. Difficulties have
arisen between the borrower and the management consultants which may lead
to a transfer of part of the assignments to another management consultant.
