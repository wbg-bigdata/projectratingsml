PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ALGERIA - INDUSTRIAL CREDIT PROJECT TO
BANQUE ALGERIENNE DE DEVELOPPEMENT
(LOAN 1158-AL)
HIGHLIGHTS
Loan 1158-AL was a pilot project which aimed at building up BAD's
inflluence over the public investment system through improved appraisal and
supervision standards. This influence was expecced to result in the course of
this project and for a small tranche of the BAD financing program in an
increase of efficiency in project design and of the profitability of the state
or regional enterprises so financed. If this limited approach was successful,
an ecpansion of this role over a larger part of BAD's financing could then
have been envisaged, including through a second Bank Loan.
The project was primarily based on the creation of a Project Unit in
BAD which would appraise and supervise investment projects to be financed
under the loan. These sub-projects were exclusively selected in the
construction materials sub-sector which had key priority in Algeria's
Development Plans.
The loan did not aim at influencing BAD's overall financial and
lending policies. On the other hand, during this project most of the initial
effort focussed on the creation of the Project Unit, its staffing, training,
operational policies and work program. It was clear from the start that the
main issue to be faced would be BAD's decision power with respect to
investment. BAD had no final authority over the investment syseem and the
Government was not ready to invest this authority upon BAD until BAD had
demonstrated its ability to pass an appraisal judgement on the investment
projects it was financing.
While this project had considerable support from the Ministry of
Finance, other units in the Government and in the public sector enterprises
were not yet convinced that such attempt to promote BAD into a powerful
development bank was appropriate. As a result, through its ececution the loan
had uneven results. Only part of the objectives were achieved. Twelve
sub-projects have been properly appraised and financed. Also, about 20 to 30
staff members of BAD received at one time or another a training of high
quality in project appraisal. Nevertheless the main objective of the project
to demonstrate the merit of sound appraisal techniques was not achieved.
The project had no influence on Algeria's investment decision-mtaking
process. Throughout its implementation, this project confirmed that the
design envisaged for it was not appropriate in this particular context.
Perhaps an approach whereby the Bank would have been more directly involved
with the appraisal of sub-projects could have been more successful; and the
Bank experience in a situation of this type was very limited.

A1GIMLA - INDUSTRIAI CREDIT PR.OJECT TO
BANQUE ALGER1E1I E DE DEVELOPPERIENT
(LOAN 1158-AL)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.       Banque Algerienne de Developpesent (BAD), a State Enterprise fully
owned by the Algeri.an Governnent, was created in 1963 to implement the
investLment programs of the Algerian Government and to assure adequate terua
financing for all approved capital investments undertaken in Algeria, except
prLncipally ia the agriculture and housing sectors.  The 1971 reform of the
financial sector gave SAD an essential role in (i) preparing the financial
plan for investment projects after they have been approved by the Central
Planning AuthoTity (Mxnistry of Planaing); (ii) providing mainly from
Government resources the long-term financing requirements for productive
investment; (iii) making available foreign credits through direct financing or
credit guarantees; and (iv) supervising disbursement for investments.
2.       This Projecc Completion Beport (PCR) reviews the performance under
loan 158-AL approved iaJ June 1975.  Given the special character of this
project and its uneven perform'aace, as weLl as insufficient data on the
results of sub-projects fiarnced under the loan, chis PCR pays particular
attention to the major issues faced by this project and to the lessons the
Bank may draw froan this experience.
LI.  TIHE ECONOMIC ENVIRDOMENT
3.       The AlgerLan industry in the seventies has been characterized by the
concentration of the productive enterprises under State ownership.
Concentration was enhanced by a centrally planned econamic management where
industry had the lioals snaret in the L970-73 and 1974-77 pLans, industrial
investment represeated 54X ard 44% of total investment, respectively.  This
ambitious program, financed by oil and gas exports, aimed at achieving imiport
suDstitution, employment creatioa and regional balance.
4..      Quantitative iavestaent and productLon targets were initially given
*         pri3orLty over efficiency and f inancial return.  While realization of massive
increases in industrial mavestment was a very remarkable achievement,
considerable imbalances and financiaL waste accompanied the Lmplementation of
the plaas.  In many sub-sectors (e.g. construction iAdustry) investment
targets were not met, creating major bottlenecks throughout the economy.
These difficulties received in the early seventies growing attention from the
authorities and particularly the Ministry of Finance. The 1971 financial
reform aimed at instituting financial,d&-cipLine in the State Enterprises.
BAD was given the responsibility to control Long-term investment decisions.
1oiever, little was accomplished by rhis reform es*entialLy because neither
BAD nor the Treasury were given any real authority in the investment decision
process. In addition, BAD did not have the expertise ia project appraisal and
supervision n2ecessary to influence the decision process.

3.       Ia considerina, this project, special attention was given to the
construction materiaLs sub-sector, e:-cluding cement and glass, as one area oi
induscry having top priority.  This acrivity was indeed a key to the entire
industrial and social sectors where growth was constrained by the irnability oa
this sub-sector to rneet demand. Proauction of building materials was divided
among two large State Ertterprises ( SLTC and SU Metal) and a few small regional
pubLic sector construction snterprises whose creation or expansion were given
special emphasis ia order to foster regional industrial as well as social
(schools, hospitals, housing) development.  major managerial, technical and
financial weaknesses afected the entire 3ector.

b illion per annunr.  i,uring che sevencias BAD's rinanclai size continued to
grow very rapicly.  rocal assecs of about DA 14 million in 1974 reacned
DA 154.7 million at the end of 1981, including direct loans outstanding for
DA 131 million.  Profitability has not been a main objective of BAD; nowever,
a smalL accounting profit has been registered every year.  In 1932, net
profits amounted to DA 55.2 million or 3.5b7 of total assets and 11.3Z7 of net
worth. The quality of BAD's portfolio has always been difficult to assc d9
given the lack of financial discipline in State Enterprises, the guarantee of
the Treasury to procect 6AD against financial losses, and BAD's lack of
supervision of irs clients and the general weakness of auditing scandards in
the public sector firms.  BAD's creditworthiness was and remUains a function of
Algeria's credit.  A summary of BAD's financial situation ia 1974 (the year of
this loan appraisal) and in 1980 and 1981 is given in Annexes I and II.
7.       BAD staff resources have remained unrelated to the volume of
financing it has channelled.  In 1974, it had only 75 professionals and a
relatively Chin management structure. There has been little staff expansion
since then.
S.       In spite of the objective set for this loan (Loan Agreement, Section
4.O2 and Supplemental Letter No. 2) to introduce auditing standards within BAD
which would gradually enable BAD and the Treasury to assess che
creditworthiness of BAD's clients, little was accomplished in this respect. A
number of Scate Enterprises financed by BAD faced repeated financial
difficulties.  Mhe financial review made by the Bank in 1980 identified the                    ,
main causes of these recurring difficulties as due to managerial weakness,
Lack of skill and experience of the labor force, inefficiencies in operations,
iaadequate investment programs (inLeluding unrealistic finaancial plans), price
fixing leading to iaadequate cash flows. BAD had little influeace over these
problems.  The responsibility for bailing out State Enterprises encountering
suc4 difficulties was with che Treasury which, from time to time undertook a
financial restructuring of the enterprise in nmajor difficulty. It is not
clear, however, this led to a permanent solution to the financial structural
problems faced by the enterprise. A major restructuring operation took place
in 1980-81 and is reflected in BAD's 1981 accounts (Annex II).



9.       Overall, the Bank loan did not aim at influencing BAj's financial and
lending policies.  The objective of improving BAD's awareness of the operating
risk of its loan portfolio through improved annual audits was not really
achieved and in retrospect was somewhat questionable as long as BAD itself was
not accountable for such risk.
IV. ThE PROJECT
A.   bjectives
10.      This project has been presented to the Board of Lhe Bank as a pilot
operation (see later para 34). The loan hlad very unusual features and
constituted for the Bank as well as for Algeria an experiment.
11.      First, BAD could not be considered as a development bank in the sense
traditionally accepted by the Bank.  tsAD's relationship with ttie Treasury was
that of a cashier.  Its resources were directly received from budgetary
allocations or, for foreign resources, as part of Algerta's borrowings in the
capital market. BAD's lending risk was also fully borne by the Treasury. BAD
had no real impact on the design, purpose and return of the projects it
financed; furthermore, it had no influence on the management, policies and
operation of the State Enterprises.  Finally, it had no appraisal staff and no
influence on sectoral policies.
12.      Secondly, the Bank had little experience with lending to financial
institutions in centrally planned economies like Algeria where inefficiencies
were in large part overcome by Algeria's oil and gas revenues. In such
environment the traditional measure of investment selection based on market
forces and financial and economic returns were not fully consistent with the
strategy and policy of the Government in the seventies.
13.      Thirdly, while there was no doubt that the construction building
material sector was a key sector to industrial and social development, the
Bank had no detailed knowledge of the sector, of policies needed for its
orderly development and of its institutional requirements. No detailed
analysis took place ro support this loan and to give it the character of a
sub-sector loan.
14.      The AlgerLan Government asked the Bank to prepare this pilot project
9          as a compromise between the well established DFC model supported by a large
number of the World Bank Group loans and credits and Algeria's own investment
financing system.  It was felt that the introduction of IBRD's appraisal and
supervision standards as a condition for BAD financing of a selected number of
cases would have economic and institutional results on these cases worth the
experience. In light of this experience, further developments would then be
envisaged which would gradually turn BAD into a more autonomous DFC. In this
process, much depended on the goodwill and determination of the various agents
involved, namely:
- First, the Ministry of Planning and the Ministry of Industry (for
large construction materials projects) and the hiniatfy of Interior



-4-
as well as the Regional Governments (for small regional construction
marerials projects). It was essetitial tnat eachi accept to submit
their projects to BAD's appraisal standards;
- Second, BAD itself - BAD was required to build ex nihilo a project
appraisal department (the "Unit") staffed wicn abouc ten financial
economisrs and cechnicians and at least two expacriate advisors
selected from World Bank staff, able to guide tne Unit in this new
role and train their counterpart over a period of 2-3 years. The
Technical AssLstance package necessary to scasr, traini and advise
this Unic was financed by U!DP uLder a  r1eCC (.kLG/75/003) for wnici
the Bank was the e:cecutin,, en,rc.
15.      This determination of the participants in ;4..e scna.ne 'gas riJ.'itly
viewed as the crucial element in maxing the projecr v\iabLe.  .t negotiations
and durLng project preparation, s -ron, a3.3suranus  ,re   ;i O' the of 
in this respect.  With hindsight, ict Ls apparenc, tloWnever, Lna c the Treasury,
BAD and the Bank moved too quickly from tiae stage of preparation to the stage
of implementation of this project.  In retrospect, it woul,i seem that, given
the novelty and complexity of this loan tor all parties involved, a transition
phase should have been envisaged before Board presentation.  The Bank and BAD
should have tested more specifically the implications of this project on
practices, institution and decision-making in order to apply the discipline
underlying it. This test could have been performed if, for example, some of
the sub-projects had been pre-appraised or even fully appraised jointly by BAD
and the Bank before approving the loan itself, so tnat policy issues as well
as institutional macters would nave been analyzea concretely and cested before
committing the Bank and the Government to finance the project.
B. implementation
16.      The implementation of the loan went through three major phases.  (i)
Organization of BAD's appraisal and supervision Unit.  (ii)  Commitment of
part of the line of credit and appreciation of difficulties to achieve the
objectives of the loan.  (iii)  Negative conclusions and closing of the loan.
L7.      The first phase covered the period 1975-76.  Some unforeseen
difficulties of a force majeure nature prevented the BanK from identifying
promptly Bank staff members qualified and willing to take up the two posts of
advisors to the Uait.  During that period, BAD appoiated a part-time acting
Director for the Unit and assigned to it cwo or three junior financial
analysts with limited experience. Some investment possibilities were
identified with SN4C and SN k4etal.  Nevertheless, following the departure of
the Sinister of Finance who had given considerable personal support to this
project, neither BAD nor the authorities seemed prepared to establish the Unit
along the lines spelled out ia Schedule 3 of the Loan Agreement. The Bank's
senior staff advisor took his post in March 1976 only.  Though considerable
efforts were made by the Bank to identify within its staff a second advisor,
this was unsuccessful.
18.      By end-1976, without strong support from BAD management, the project
came to a near standstill.  The BSak indicated to the. Government that under



these conditions the undisbursed amount of the loan would have to be
cancelled.  In reaction to that proposal, the Treasury made a major effort to
review with BAD's management, the Ministries involved and with the Bank the
issues affecting the implementation of the project and to seek solutions.  The
Government then requested the Bank to postpone any closing action; the
Treasury gave the Bank strong assurances that BAD would revive the project in
line with the objectives ag:eed initially.
19.      This action gave tangible results.  In 1977, a permanent and
qualified Director of the Unit was recruited, the Unit itself was staffed with
about 10-12 members, the UNDP financed advisor's contract was extended for one
year. The pipeline of projects both from SNMC and SN hetal and from the
Regional program was firmed up. Also, since the search for a technical
advisor had railed 1/, an alternative solution was found (to be financed under
the UND? Project) according to which an industwial economist acceptable to BAD
and LBRD would perform in BAD a series of frequent missions (every 2 or 3
months) to train the staff of the UnLt in appraisal and supervision inethoas
and assist them in the appraisal work of sub-projects to be financed under the
loan. This expert would also bring along foreign consultants to review the
technical evaluation of sub-projects. Ihis encouraging effort cont2.nued
through 1978 and led to commitsents aaounting to $38.9 million, covering 12
sub-projects under the loan, including 2 projects from SNMC, I for SN hetal,
and 9 ii various Wilayate. A review of this portfolio is given in Annex III.
20.      The basic policy problem of the role of BAD remained, however, all
along. This became clear in the light of discussions with BAD and Government
officials in the course of Bank supervision missions, especially when the
possibility of a second loan to BAD was explored by the Gover.iment. BAD's
response to the Treasury pressure exercized in 1977-78 had been quite
satisfactory in the narrowly defined context of the Bank loan, namely the
processing of a limited number of sub-projects under the $40 million limit of
the Bank loan. (In relative financial terms this was a minuscule amount in
BAD's lending program.)  In a larger sense, i.e. the expansion of appraisal
and supervision criteria exercized under the Bank loan to other, if not all,
BAD projects not financed with Bank fuads, BAD was not prepared to engage
itself in that direction. The detailed reasons for this actitude were never
explicit but a combination of factors certainly played an important role,
including the change of BAD's President and of the Director of the Treasury
who had both been involved from the inception of this loan in 1973. Also, at
that time (1978) the Governaent iadicated its intention to study the
possibility of undertaking a basic reorganization of the Financial Sector
which might include considerable cnanges in BAD's role and institutional
structure. In these circumstances, the initial objectives to turn BAD into a
sort of industrial DFC for Algeria had to be set aside.  In addition, as soon
as the loan was nearly fully coomitted, BAD's support to the Unit was
1/  The initial proposal to use the technical services of INPED (a public
sector engineering consultant) was not practical and was then abandoned.
Under this project, INPED was only involved with the feasibility of a few
regional sub-projects.



-6-
considerably reduced. Staff was gradually assigned to other departments and
by early 1980 nearly no capability was leit in the Unit even to supervise the
conatruction of the 14 outstanding sub-projects.  Unhder these circumstances,
it became impossible for the purpose of this PCR to obtain relevant
information on the outcome of these sub-projects, their construction or
operational8 scatus and their impact in the economy.
21.      After mid-1979 (when che expacriate advisor left), and given the
general lack of support for this project, Bank missiwns to supervise BAD
became less frequent than in the past.  The Bank turned most of its attention
Co the Financial Sector Review which the Minister of finance had asked the
sank to undertake in order to advise the authorities on alternative ways to
improve Lnvestment planning and financing in Algeria and to reformn the bank-ing
system in order to permit greater discipline in the system.  It was rightly
felt that a general reform of the financial system could eventually lead to
_Lructural changes which would really address che investment decision issues
and give the financia' insticutions a handle on the financial and econom=c
aspects of these Lnvescments and of the sponsor firms.  As far as Loan 1153-AL
was concerned, when SEMC indicated, earLy 1980, that it would not use most of
the Bank loan for sub-projecr El Milia (A-1), at BAD 's request $4 million was
cancelled from the loan.  Later on, when it became clear by end-1981 that
several sub-projects were suffering from major delays in procurement, the Bank
and the Government agreed that there was no point in extending the closing
date.  Another $6.4 million was cancelled.  The Treasury and BAD would find
alternative source of financing to complete the sub-projects started under the
BanrK loan and still under construction.
C. Use of Bank Funds
22.      In order to diversify the experimental aspect of this loan, two
objectives were proposed with respect to the application of Bank funds to the
construction iaaterLals seccor. The loan was divided Lato two tranches of
$20 million each, the first one to be reserved for projects of the two State
Enterprises engaged in ttkis sector, SNAC and SN Metal, the secoad to projects
sponsored by the regional authorities (Willayate and their sub-divisions).
State Enterprise projects were expected to be large ones with an upper limit
of DA 100 million of total investment cost; the regional projects were to be
smaller with an upper investment cost limit of DA 20 million.  Sub-loans for
each category were also limited to ¢5 and $2 million respectively .1/ in order
to process a sufficiently large number of sub-projects. Appraisal criteria
were spelled out in some detaiL in the Loan Agreement (Schedule 3), including
minimum financial and economic rates of return of 9 arnd d;, respectively.
23.      After the revitalization of the project and the strengthening and
staffing of the Unit in 1977, a major and co   endable effort was made by the
tlait to promote the Bank line of credit, especially in the provinces.  This
effort led to the build-up of a well diversified pipeline out of which some 18
I/  An exceptiou to the  n5 million limit was authorized.for. subS-project A-.20-
the Bank approveq financing up to $6.5 million fo.r this sub-project in
order to cover the tocal estimated foreign exchange needs of the contract
without having recourse to suppliers' credits.



-7-
sub-projects were selected as likely to meet acceptable appraisal standards.
Out of this, the 12 projects listed in Annex III were financed with banx funds.
24.      Only three projects originated from SNLC and SN Metal.  Thus the
limit of $20 million allocated to these two enterprises was not reached. This
can be attributed in large part to the reluctance of these enterprises to
subject themselves to the appraisal scrutiny of the World Bank project with
BAD and their easy access to suppliers' credits. In the provinces,
encouraging prospecLs for a constructive appraisal dialogue were noted in some
Wilayate, such as Constantine.
25.      Overall, the appraisal reports prepared and submitted by the Unit
were of good quality. Financial and technical aspects were particularly well
covered. Important weaknesses affected the market study due to considerable
lack of data, especially at the regional level. The major weakness of these
reports was the inability to assess the managerial and organizational aspects
of the sub-projects. At the stage of their feasibility studies, the
management of these public sector projects had yet not been appointed. Also,
the continuity of these appointments was under question.
26.      While all sub-projects financed under the loan met the criteria of
financial and economic returns, all cases reflected Algeria's industrial
investment problems. These projects were very expensive and highly capital
intensive. Given Algeria's preference for turnkey contracts and the delavs in
completiiig the basic infrastructure (roads, electricity, water, etc.), bids
received from foreign firms were very high as compared to similar projects in
neighboring countries. The investment cost per job created under the loan was
in turn eAtremely high (reaching nearly $10,000 per job created for all 12
sub-projects and $120,UOO for the 3 projects of SNMC and SN Metal).
27.      As noted earlier, since the Unit has been practically dissolved in
1981, no data has been made available by BAD on the actual construction and
performance of the sub-projects or the companies sponsoring them.
CONCLUSIONS
28.      This project nas been an ambitious experiment which was motivated by
the magnitude of Algeria's investment program and the desire to introduce a
measure of fiaancial discipline in the State Enterprises. Some 12
sub-projects were financed under the loan, and a number of BAD staff received
training. Good advice was givea to the enterprises sponsoring the
sub-projects. But the main objectives of the project, namely to demonstrate
the merit of sound appraisal technique was not achieved. The project had no
influence on the investment decision-making process. In addition, given the
unsufficient monitoring of construction and implementation of the sub-projects
by BAD, it is impossible to assess the benefits achieved by this loan in the
construction materials sector.
29.      In a larger sense, the difficultLes encountered and discussed very-
frankly over the years between the Government and the Bank led to an awareness



-8-
of the dimension of the investment problems and of the potential role of the
banking system in this process. It is no doubt this diaiogue which induced
the Government to ask the Bank to present its views in the form of the 1980
Financial Sector Report entitled.  "Enterprise FLnancing and the Banking
Sector" (September 1980, No. 2981-AL).  This report helped the Government in
introducing in 1981 a number of important institutional reforms in the iManking
sector, although not to the extent the report recommended.
30.      As a result, BAD) was specialized in the financing of only larger
industrial projects while the responsibility for regional development projects
was transferred to CPA, one of the primuary banks.  No basic structural change
in BAD's methods, staffing, appraLsal and supervision stanaards seem to have
taken place yet. It is therefore too early to assess the impact uf chis
reform.
31.      The Bank and BAD have drawn imporcant lessons from the history and
outcome of this loan. This was clearly acknowledged oy tne Government and the
Bank during the First Country Implementation Review .la November 1981. The
minutes of the meetings which then took place paid special attention to the
degree of preparation of Bank projects.  It was agreed that in the future
loans would be negotiated and presented to the Board of the Bank only after
the design for the main components and procurement have made substantial
progress. In cases such as BAD where the financial institution does noc have
significant autonomy in the decision to finance investments, the normal
expectation that DFCs adequately appraise and supervise the implementation of
sub-projects was not fulLy verified at the time the loan was negotiated or
approved. As noted in para 15, in such cases, the Bank should have
co-appraised sub-projects with the financial intermediary to ensure that
financ.ag of such projects proceed only if a number of minimum conditions are
met to make the projects viable.  In this process, the Bank could enter in
direct negotiations and agreement not only with the rLnancial intermediary but
also with the investor. This, of course, limits the number of projects which
can be financed and also limits the role and responsibility oF the fiaancial
intermediary. It avoids, however, the type of uncertainty and ot risk in
meeting loan objectives.
