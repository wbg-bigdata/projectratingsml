F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (from Program Document)
Building on six preceding PRSCs, PRSC7 is the third and final operation in a
programmatic development policy lending series to support Uganda's third Poverty
Eradication Action Plan (PEAP). The PRSC has been a core element of the Bank's
support for Uganda, supporting four pillars of the PEAP: Economic Management (pillar
1); Enhanced Production, Competitiveness and Incomes (pillar 2); Good Governance
(Pillar 4) and Human Development (pillar 5).


  Note: Results indicators are presented more comprehensively in Text Tables 5, 6, 7, 8
and 9, and are arranged according to program pillar. In the tables below, the final actual
value for the indicator is recorded for PRSC 7 only, as it is the final operation in the
series.

(this section is descriptive, taken from other documents, e.g., Program Document/ISR, not
evaluative):

1.1 Context at Appraisal
(brief summary of country macroeconomic and structural/sector background, rationale for Bank
assistance)

The second series of Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSC 5-7) was implemented in 2005 in
the context of strong macroeconomic growth and political stability. Since 1986, Uganda had
benefited from almost two decades of continuous per capita income growth. In the 1990s, this
broad-based growth accelerated, with real annual per capita GDP growing by an average of 3.2
percent. While economic growth slowed somewhat prior to the start of this series of operations in
2005, it was still strong at 4.5 and 5.8 percent, respectively, in 2003 and 2004, and per capita
GDP growth was 1.2 percent and 2.4 percent in those years. Consistent implementation of stable
macroeconomic management and pro-poor, market-friendly, structural policies underpinned
Uganda's economic success. This trend continued during the subsequent period of PRSC 5-7. In
those years real GDP grew on average by 8.1 percent per annum and real GDP per capita by 4.8
percent.
The rapid and broad-based economic growth helped the official poverty rate decline from 56
percent in 1992 to 39 percent in 2003. The 2005/06 National Household Survey measured a
further poverty rate decline to 31 percent in 2005. While more recent estimates of poverty rates
are not yet available ((with the exception of the Northern region), in light of the sustained and
significant real GDP per capita growth during the second series of PRSCs it is very likely that the
poverty rate continued to decline in this period. Non-income measures of welfare also improved
for all groups over the period. Net primary enrolment rates for girls in the poorest quintiles
increased from 41 percent in 1992 to 77 percent in 2002/03, with progress in both rural and urban
areas. The proportion of poorest households with access (within 3 km) to a primary school
increased from 82 percent to 89 percent over the same period. Access to safe drinking water rose
from 50 percent in 1999/00 to 61 percent in 2002/03. These results were achieved despite a
number of shocks, including prolonged drought, a severe energy shortage, and the adverse impact
of high and volatile oil prices. Notably, despite these shocks the macroeconomic environment in
Uganda remained largely stable.
Politically, Uganda had also entered a period of stability. Since the National Resistance
Movement (NRM) led by Yoweri Museveni, took power in 1986, Uganda embarked on a
sustained period of economic and political renewal, including pro-market reforms and political
liberalization. Following the expulsion of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), northern Uganda
is secure and there have been no major security incidents since 2006. While the area has missed
out on two decades of growth and poverty reduction, economic activity has resumed. Finally,
there has been a move towards multi-party democracy, with multi-party elections held in 2006,
although there has been no change of power through elections.

The country's remarkable growth performance, however, has not resulted in a significant
structural transformation of the economy. Compared with other countries that have experienced
such long episodes of sustained growth, Uganda remains more reliant on subsistence agriculture
and correspondingly less on high-productivity manufacturing. Despite the overall decline in
poverty, there was also a steady increase in urban-rural and regional inequality. The Gini



                                                  1
Poverty Reduction Strategy Credits 5-7: Implementation Completion and Results Report


coefficient1 increased from 0.35 in 1997 to 0.41 percent in 2006, reflecting, in part, the pattern of
growth in the country which created opportunities in urban areas in the center and west, while
leaving behind wide stretches in rural areas and the north and east. In particular, war-affected
northern Uganda has the country's highest rate of income poverty. While poverty reduction in
the northern region was marginal until 2005, the regional poverty rate declined further in recent
years - from 61 percent in 2005/06 to 57 percent in 2008/09. However, it is still almost three
times that of the Western region (2005 estimate).

The PRSCs were the Bank's principal tool for supporting Uganda's economic transformation and
its poverty reduction efforts. PRSC 5-7 were implemented in support of Uganda's third Poverty
Eradication Action Plan (PEAP-3), approved by the Cabinet in November 2004. 2 PEAP-3
restated Uganda's ambition to become a middle income country within 20 years, and set out
targets for key "strategic results" in income poverty and inequality, improved human
development, and increased GDP growth.3

PRSC 5-7 followed the first series of PRSCs (PRSC 1-3), which were implemented in support of
PEAP-2.4 PRSC 4, originally envisaged to be the first operation in a second series of PRSCs (i.e.,
PRSC 4-6), beginning in 2005, was in fact implemented as a stand-alone operation and the last of
the series of PRSCs in support of the second PEAP.5 This second series of PRSCs built directly
on the first series of operations. They extended the earlier focus on health, education, and water
sector programs (since PRSC 1); public sector management and anti-corruption and a rural
growth agenda (since PRSC 2); and gender, infant, and maternal mortality, and results orientation
(PRSC 4). PRSC 5-7 continued support in these areas, while deepening the emphasis on growth
through further elaboration of the rural development agenda, and through policies that supported
non-farm employment and income growth. The PRSC program was at the center of the Bank's
support for Uganda as spelled out in the Uganda Joint Assistance Strategy (UJAS), a harmonized
program of donor support linked to the third PEAP and developed jointly with Uganda's
development partners (DPs) in 2005. In reflection of the mutuality of these documents, the UJAS
was presented jointly to the Board with PRSC 5.

The first two PRSC operations (5 and 6) in this programmatic development policy lending series
were both one-year, single tranche operations, with disbursement taking place at project
effectiveness based on the Government's satisfactory accomplishment of prior actions. PRSC 7

  The Gini coefficient is a standard measure of income inequality, which considers the distribution of national income
among the population. This indicator ranges from zero (perfectly equal income distribution) to one (one household has
all of the income). Uganda's level of inequality is about average for Sub-Saharan Africa non-mineral exporting
economies.
2
  The PEAP is Uganda's Poverty Reduction Support Program (PRSP). The first PEAP, prepared in 1997, provided the
model for the PRSP approach and received international praise. The first PEAP was revised and updated in 2000
(PEAP II) , and again in 2004 (PEAP III, covering the period 2005 to 2008). PEAP III was extended for two years, to
June 2010, owing to delays in preparing its successor, the National Development Program.
3
  The joint Bank/Fund assessment of the PEAP III concluded that it "constituted a comprehensive and well-balanced
strategy to achieve accelerated growth and poverty reduction," while candidly recognizing the challenges facing the
country. Joint IDA-IMF Staff Advisory Note, Report No: 32698-UG, p 8.

  PRSC 1 (FY2001) was a credit for SDR 116.2 million ($150 million equivalent; PRSC 2 (FY2003) was a credit for
SDR 102.2 million ($150 million equivalent); PRSC 3 (FY2004) was a grant for SDR 106 million ($150 million
equivalent); and PRSC 4 (FY2005) was a grant for SDR 102.6 million ($150 million equivalent).
5
  It was originally intended that PRSC 4, 5, and 6 would be aligned directly with, and provide support to, the
implementation of the third PEAP. The preparation of that PEAP was delayed, however, and PRSC 4 was
implemented as a follow-on to PRSC 1-3 and in alignment with the second PEAP in order to ensure the continuation of
predictable resource flows to the budget, while also ensuring that the medium-term program supported by the PRSC 4,
5, and 6 would be consistent with the third PEAP.

was designed as a two-tranche operation over two years in order to adapt to the delay in replacing
the third PEAP with the Government's follow-on program, the National Development Plan
(NDP) and to ensure better alignment with this plan. The two-tranche design was also intended
to facilitate harmonization with other development partners' budget support and alignment with
the government budget cycle.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The original PDO for the PRSC 5-7 was: "The proposed grant/credit is a core operation to finance
implementation of selected strategic objectives of Uganda's Poverty Eradication Action
Plan/Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PEAP/PRSP). The PRSC has been a core element of the
Bank's support for Uganda, supporting four pillars of the PEAP: Economic Management (Pillar
I); Enhanced Production, Competitiveness and Incomes (pillar 2); Good Governance (Pillar 4),
and Human Development (Pillar 5)." The overriding theme of the series was to support the
Government in providing better services and to create a better policy environment for economic
growth and poverty reduction.

PRSC 5 had a limited number of PDO indicators:

        Maintain macroeconomic stability consistent with rapid private sector-led growth and
        sustained poverty reduction, as measured by GDP growth and inflation. (Fiscal deficit as
        a percentage of GDP was also added under PRSC 6).
        Better educated Ugandans via increased primary enrollment, as measured by primary
        enrollment for boys and girls.

In addition, there were two intermediate outcome indicators:

        Increased access to credit, as measured by credit to the private sector as a percentage of
        GDP.
        Pupil:teacher ratio lowered and pupil:classroom ratio lowered.

During PRSC 5 implementation, the Bank was still working to ensure that the results framework
for the PRSC series was fully aligned with the PEAP-3 matrix, as was requested by the
Government of all donors, and the Government was still in the process of defining medium-term
outcomes. Consequently, a more comprehensive set of PDO indicators was established under
PRSC 6 and PRSC 7. Accordingly, under these operations, three more PDO indicators were
added, for a total of five:

        Private investment as a share of GDP.
        Public financial management (PFM) strengthened, as measured by the percentage of
        ministries/local governments preparing regular financial statements in accordance with
        financial regulations.
        Healthier Ugandans, as measured by percentage of children immunized (DPT3) and
        percentage of deliveries in health care centers.

In addition, under PRSC 6 and PRSC 7, the two intermediate outcome indicators above (i.e.,
access to credit and pupil:teacher/classroom ratios) were dropped, and the following was added:

        Reduced corruption, as measured by the Transparency International Corruption
        Perceptions Index.


                                                  3

1.3 Revised PDO (if any, as approved by original approving authority) and Key
Indicators, and Reasons/Justification

There were no revisions to the PDO. A number of the indicators, however, were modified
between PRSC 5 and PRSC 6, as discussed below in Section 3, Relevance of Objectives, Design,
and Implementation).

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved):

This series of operations supported four out of five pillars of the Government's third PEAP. As
the strategic objectives below show, the policy areas of PRSC support varied widely from
fiduciary strengthening to improved water supply and sanitation and from social service delivery
to improving the business environment.

PEAP Pillar 1: Economic Management. The strategic objective was to maintain
macroeconomic stability consistent with rapid private sector led growth.

PEAP Pillar 2: Enhance Production, Competitiveness And Incomes. Strategic objectives
supported by the PRSCs were: (i) efficient and competitive private sector; (ii) increased and
more efficient agricultural production, including increased marketing and increased access to land
titling; (iii) strengthened environment and natural resource management, including improved
forest resources and water resource management; and (iv) strengthened financial sector in support
of increased production of goods and services.

PEAP Pillar 4: Good Governance. Strategic objectives supported by the PRSCs were: (i)
strengthened legal and justice systems, including increased efficiency in commercial justice; and
(ii) strengthened public sector management and accountability, including PFM and procurement,
reduced corruption, improved public sector performance, and strengthened Local Government
(LG) system for service delivery.

PEAP Pillar 5: Human Development. Strategic objectives supported by the PRSCs were: (i) a
better educated society, including increased access to and quality of primary, secondary and
tertiary education; (ii) healthier Ugandans, including improved utilization and quality of health
care, improved access to maternity services, improved family planning, and improved children
access to immunization care; and (iii) improved water and sanitation systems, including improved
access to safe water supply and sanitation and improved water facilities maintenance.

1.5 Revised Policy Areas (if applicable)

There were some revisions in the policy areas. As discussed below, the GoU shifted its emphasis
from service delivery to infrastructure (roads and energy) during the latter part of the series to
reflect the growing acuteness of transport and energy constraints on development, as was
documented in the 2007 Uganda Country Economic Memorandum (CEM). The objective
"strengthened legal and justice systems" (Pillar 4) was dropped under PRSC 6. Also under PRSC
6, the objective of "strengthened public sector management and accountability" was tightened to
"public financial management strengthened." In addition, the objective of "strengthened
environment and natural resource management" (Pillar 4) was dropped under PRSC 7.

1.6 Other significant changes
(in design, scope and scale, implementation arrangements and schedule, and funding allocations)

There were a number of significant changes in the funding allocations for these operations, as
well as to the date of effectiveness of PRSC 7:

    (i) The financing for PRSC 5 was reduced by 10 percent (from US$150 million to US$135
    million) because the prior action on budget execution was only partially met. This reduction
    was consistent with the principles agreed to between the GoU and its DPs.6

    (ii) Financing under PRSC 6 was similarly reduced to $125 million (from a base amount of
    $150 million), again owing to the fact that some earlier envisaged prior actions were only
    partially met, chief among them the budget prior action because the public administration
    expenditure and defense expenditure ceilings were again breached in FY2006/07 and
    FY2007/08.

    (iii) Although PRSC 7 was originally designed as a single credit operation, it was
    subsequently divided into an exceptional two-tranche operation, combined with an increase in
    total funding to US$200 million, thereby enabling two separate tranches of SDR62.5 million
    (US$100 million equivalent) for FY2007/08 and FY2008/09, respectively. The rationale for
    this change was twofold: it would facilitate budget planning for FY2008/09 by improving the
    predictability of PRSC resources, and it would also align the PRSC better with the new Joint
    Budget Support Framework (JBSF), thereby enabling the next PRSC series to fully conform
    to the Paris Principles of donor harmonization. 7 Notably, a two-tranche operation also
    enabled the Bank to signal more clearly that the amount of the first tranche had been reduced
    to US$100 million (from US$150 million) owing to relatively weak performance in meeting
    the prior actions, as the public administration expenditure ceiling was again repeatedly
    breached and the amendment of the Public Procurement and Disposal of Assets (PPDA) Act
    (for the first tranche) was significantly delayed.

    (iv) The delays by the GoU in approving PRSC 7 necessitated an extension in effectiveness
    (the Board date of approval was May 2008, but approval by Parliament did not occur until
    December 2008). As a result, the predictable disbursement of the US$100 million first
    tranche into the FY07/08 budget was not achieved.

    (v) Finally, for the second tranche of PRSC 7, there were again delays by the Government in
    submitting the proposed amendments to the PPDA Act to Cabinet. (The revised Act was
    submitted in February 2009, and reviewed by Cabinet in July 2009, rather than January 2008,
    as initially conceived under PRSC 6, and subsequently revised to September 2008 by the
    GoU.) Consequently, the second tranche of PRSC 7 was released in September 2009, rather



6
  Under the "Principles for Determining Prior Actions" developed between the GoU and DPs under PRSC4, there were
three possible responses when prior actions were not satisfactorily met: (i) a reduction in support; (ii) a delay in the
program, and (iii) the release of the credit in tranches. These principles were complementary and subordinate to the
agreed "Partnership Principles between Government of Uganda and its Development Partners," signed in 2003.
7
  Previous PRSCs tended to disburse toward the end of the respective budget year to retroactively finance spending
that had already taken place.


                                                           5
Poverty Reduction Strategy Credits 5-7: Implementation Completion and Results Report


    than as expected in November 2008, thereby again usurping the objective of a predictable
    disbursement of funds.

Initially, the amount of funds was expected to be on the order of US$450 million for three years
(average of US$150 million per year); as a result of these changes, actual support was US$460
million over four years (average of US$115 million per year). Thus, while the amount of
assistance provided in each operation was reduced owing to poor performance, the total amount
disbursed under the series was actually larger than anticipated, owing to the two tranches
provided under PRSC 7 and the decision to increase (and decrease) each tranche.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Program Performance (supported by a table derived from a policy matrix)

Triggers/Prior Actions: Table 2 lists the prior actions for each of the three PRSC operations.
There were 11-12 prior actions for each operation. These prior actions were developed jointly
with the GoU in close cooperation with Uganda's other DPs. As seen in the table, a number of
prior actions were delayed or only partially met, and consequently, as discussed above, funding
was reduced for each PRSC. While the prior actions presented to the Board for PRSC 5 were
largely unchanged from those agreed to by the Government and DPs, the triggers for PRSC 6 and
7, by contrast, became tighter and more specific when they were turned into prior actions.

           PEAP Strategic Objective 1.0: Macroeconomic Stability Consistent with Rapid
           Private Sector Led Growth

 Macroeconomic performance remained strong under PRSC 5-7, particularly in light of the
 effects of a severe drought in 2005 and the global economic crisis. Table 3 shows strong (but
 declining) growth throughout the PRSC 5-7 period as well as strong GDP per capita growth
 (despite rapid population growth rates). Inflation spiked to 14.2 percent (compared to 6.8
 percent in 2006/07) as a result of the international surge in food and fuel prices, but is projected
 to fall to single digits in 2009/10. Private investment as a share of GDP grew by almost two

percentage points between 2002/03 and 2008/09 (using comparable series), while public
investment was basically steady. The fiscal deficit as a percentage of GDP fell from 8.5
percent in 2006/07 to 4.4 percent in 2008/09. The budget approved for 2008/09 was consistent
with medium-term growth objectives, and also significantly increased the expenditure on
growth-enhancing infrastructure.

In addition, external debt to GDP fell sharply in 2006/07 and has been maintained at below 20
percent of GDP. The shift in priorities toward roads and works is evident in the data as the
share of budget increased from 10.1 percent in 2005/06 to 18.5 percent in 2008/09. At the
same time, health and education combined fell from 30.8 percent to 26.1 percent of total
expenditures. It should be noted that while shares of health and education declined, real
absolute levels of expenditures increased.

PEAP Pillar 2: Enhanced Production, Competitiveness and Incomes

           PEAP Strategic Objective 2.1: Efficient and Competitive Private Sector

In order to promote the private sector and reduce the share of bank assets held as government
securities, private sector access to credit was to be expanded. Under the PRSC 5-7, credit to the
private sector as a share of GDP rose from 8.8 percent in 2006/07 to 11.8 percent in 2008/09, and
private investment as a share of GDP rose modestly from 17 percent to 19.1 percent8 in the same
period.

The PRSCs also supported a national trade policy to maintain a liberalized trading environment, a
Medium-term Competitiveness Strategy and a Plan for the Modernization of Agriculture (PMA)
among other initiatives. A key achievement under this objective was the establishment of the
Credit Reference Bureau (CRB), which provides borrower credit histories to banks, thus, greatly
facilitating the lending process. Prior to the CRB it was very difficult for banks to establish the
creditworthiness of individuals. Another highlight was the Mortgage Act, passed in 2009, which

aimed at improving the functioning of the real estate market. Key legislation aimed at improving
the investment climate through reducing the costs of entry and exit of firms included the
Companies Bill and the Insolvency Bill. Both were drafted, approved by Cabinet, but have not
yet been passed by Parliament. They are delayed considerably, but are expected to be passed in
2010.

        PEAP Strategic Objective 2.2:            Increased and More Efficient Agricultural
        Production

PRSC support for agriculture was based on the very broad Plan for the Modernization of
Agriculture (PMA), a multi-sectoral policy and institutional framework put in place in 2001 to
address constraints to production, incomes, and competitiveness in rural areas. Beginning with
PRSC 3, the prior actions for rural development were based on the undertakings agreed at the
PMA Joint Annual Review. As the scope of constraints to be addressed under the PMA was
very large, the PRSCs focused on a narrow set of high priority undertakings. The two main
achievements under the PRSC 5-7 were the establishment of the National Agricultural Advisory
Services (NAADS) and the establishment of a new and significantly reformed National
Agricultural Research System (NARS). The NARS was also successfully decentralized with the
objective of carrying out research that was more relevant to particular agricultural areas.

The recently completed ICRs for NARS and NAADS estimate benefit cost ratios of 6.2 and 2.17,
respectively, demonstrating that the two programs implemented in the agricultural sector as part
of PRSC 5-7 generated significant benefits to the Ugandan households in terms of producing high
yielding relevant technologies, increased agricultural productivity, and higher household incomes.
Specifically, NAADS farmers experienced 27.4 percent increase in real wealth per capita
compared to non-members in NAADS sub-counties and a 70.9 percent increase relative to other
group members in non-NAADS sub-counties.

Moreover, thanks to the policy dialogue taking place under the PRSCs, and in an effort to
continue with the momentum of the above reforms introduced in the two programs during the
PRSC 5-7 period, NAADS and NARS have recently been combined into one multi-donor
financed project - the Agricultural Technology and Agribusiness Advisory Services (ATAAS)
project  mainly to exploit the natural advantages of the linkages and complementarities between
research and agricultural extension services. ATAAS also forms a critical agricultural
productivity enhancing component of the sector wide Development Strategy and Investment Plan
(DSIP), for which the Government successfully took the lead in mobilizing donor support. DSIP
has recently been endorsed by the African Union's Comprehensive Africa Agriculture
Development Program (CAADP) and several DPs as the main framework for developing the
agricultural sector in Uganda during the next five years. The rest of the DSIP agenda, excluding
the ATAAS, contain issues pertaining to institutional reforms, the agro-processing and marketing,
the quality and regulatory functions, and the pest and disease control issues that could not be
resolved during PRSC 5-7 because of the coordination challenges experienced during the PMA
implementation process.

Other important actions were the development of an agricultural marketing and agro-processing
strategy; establishment of standards to facilitate trade in maize and beans; submission of a Land
Use Policy to Cabinet; strengthening the basis for a stronger foundation for tenure security for
women; the finalization of the Environment and Natural Resources Strategy and Investment Plan;
a Livestock Census (completed in 2009), the Agricultural Census (to be completed in 2010), and
completion of the Agricultural PER, all of which are important to policy making. By PRSC 7 it
was decided to focus on some lagging areas -- improved resource utilization, and irrigation and

agricultural marketing -- which the Bank team judged had high potential to improve growth and
reduce poverty. These initiatives were supported by the Agricultural PER, a National Water for
Agricultural Production SIP to be submitted to Cabinet, and by the establishment of an
agricultural market information system.


PEAP Pillar 4: Good Governance

In order to create a better policy environment for economic growth and poverty reduction, a core
focus of PRSC 5-7 was on supporting actions under Pillar 4, Good Governance. This included
actions to strengthen commercial courts, public financial management, budget reporting, public
procurement, public sector management and accountability, and the framework for
decentralization. Assessment of Government performance proved challenging because of lack of
consistent indicators and action.

        PEAP Strategic Objective 4.4: Strengthened Public Sector Management and
        Accountability

This strategic objective covered public financial management, procurement, and anti-corruption
measures, as discussed below.

Public Financial Management (PFM) Strengthened: PRSC 5-7 played a critical role in
moving the PFM agenda in Uganda forward. PFM conditions were designed in a programmatic
manner from PRSC 1 through PRSC 7, and improved PFM was a core component of PRSC prior
actions. The first series of PRSCs focused on improving the PFM regulatory framework. 9
Actions taken under PRSC 5-7 were focused on addressing the areas of concern identified in the
November 2005 Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) report. Modernization
of this framework has been supported through updating systems and capacity building at the
MOFPED. The Integrated Financial Management System (IFMIS) was implemented in all 18
central government ministries and nine local governments. This implementation moved
government accounting toward International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) and
improved cash, commitment control, and accountability mechanisms. Restructuring the Office of
Accountant General and making it operationally independent was also a key step to improving
PFM. Equally important, the Office of the Accountant General's has been restructured and has
greatly improved its capacity, with an increase from only a handful of certified public accountants
at the beginning of the program to more than 100 CPAs currently. Further progress in PFM is
supported by the Government's Financial Management Accountability Program (FINMAP).

Moreover, there have been improvements in Government institutions' audit performance and in
the timely submission of financial statements. In 2008/09, 40 percent of the Government
institutions audited achieved clean audits; nonetheless this represents a significant improvement
since 2005/06, when only 21 percent (18 out of 85) achieved clean audits. Similarly, the number
of institutions receiving only a "qualified" rating dropped from 68 percent in 2006/07 to 57 in
2008/09. Equally significant, almost all central ministries are now producing their annual
financial statements on time; again, this represents an improvement since 2005/06 when only fifty
percent of central government ministries (including MOFPED) submitted their annual financial

 Including the Public Finance and Accountability Act of 2003, establishing a coordination mechanism to guide and
monitor PFM reforms, and ensuring that annual budget execution reports provide details of actual expenditures and not
only budget releases.


                                                        16

statements late. Despite these improvements, work remains to be done, as there are still instances
when expenditures are approved when a contract is not in place, thus undermining the purpose of
IFMIS, which is to track the flow of money through the Government. The recurrent
overspending on non-priority sectors such as public administration indicates that further work on
PFM is needed.

Nonetheless, the 2008 PEFA assessment noted significant improvements in PFM since 2005,
particularly in the areas of internal and external audit, the budget preparation process, budget
classification, and comprehensiveness of budget documentation. In addition, while there is a
need to further strengthen local government financial management systems, reporting has
improved and 99 percent of ministries and local governments are now preparing end-of-year
financial statements. Areas which received lower marks in the PEFA report included quality and
timeliness of annual financial statements, the transparency of inter-governmental fiscal relations,
and the extent of unreported government operations. Nonetheless, despite the somewhat mixed
performance on the core PEFA ratings, 10 Uganda scores highly among African countries (7 out
of 40), indicating the substantial progress that has been made on PFM reforms.11 This progress is
one reason why the 2010 CAS states that the PFM focus going forward will be on the increased
use of country systems.

Notwithstanding these achievements, weak control and compliance mechanisms continue to
constrain policy effectiveness and fuel inefficiencies and corruption.

Procurement: An important achievement of the procurement component was the preparation of
amendments to the Local Government Bill that harmonized procurement practices at the local
level with that of the central government level, with ninety-two out of the ninety-three LGs
establishing contract committees (the successor to tender boards). Despite this important
achievement, progress on procurement was problematic under both PRSC 6 and PRSC 7.
Procurement reform was a critical, cross-cutting part of the PRSC strategy as it was linked to
improving budget execution, achieving value for money, and reducing corruption. Public
procurement accounts for about 60 percent of the budget. Prior actions under PRSC 5 and PRSC
6 focused on a review of the procurement law, procurement planning, and the follow-up of
procurement planning. Because public procurement often resorted to the provisions for waiver of
competitive bidding, leading to a fall in compliance with established procedures under PRSC 5
and 6, 12 PRSC 7 prior actions focused on strengthening the procurement law, building
procurement capacity, and developing a more effective method of conducting regular
procurement audits. The reorientation of Government policy to focus on infrastructure also
underscored the importance of strengthening the procurement framework. Accordingly, the PRSC
7 prior action focused on (i) revamping the public procurement legal framework (the Public
Procurement Law and its Regulations) in order to close gaps that enabled discretionary action and

categories.

   In addition, government spending for the 2007 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) revealed
numerous loopholes in the PPDA Act which needed to be addressed. At that time, the PPDA was in many cases put
under pressure to authorize non-competitive procurement methods, thereby compromising its ability to conduct
independent audits of those procurements.

corruption, and (ii) ensuring the establishment of functioning procurement and Procurement
Disposals Units (PDUs) in Government bodies.13

The original prior action on the draft changes to the PPDA Act and Regulations was supposed to
have been completed by January 2008 for the first tranche of PRSC 7. This prior action was not
met,14 and it became a prior action for the second tranche.15 While the Government anticipated
that the draft amendments would be submitted to Cabinet in September 2008, progress was
slower than expected and it was not until February 2009 that the technical mission reached
agreement with the PPDA on a set of actionable indicators to assess procurement compliance
under the Act. In order to offset the weak progress on the revision of the procurement law,
however, the Government agreed to conduct an additional review by the PPDA of contracts to
assess whether they were procured according to the new law. 16 The proposed amendments were
subsequently submitted to Cabinet and reviewed in July 2009. On the basis of this submission,
the Bank notified the Government in August of that year that the prior actions for the second
tranche release had been met.

At the Cabinet level, however, three elements had been introduced in the draft amendments to the
procurement law: (i) land procurement was excluded from the PPDA; (ii) the PPDA was allowed
to waive competitive procurement; and (iii) a Force Account was introduced, giving local
governments the option of bypassing standard procurement procedures. These changes
compromised the procurement principles of transparency, equal value and value for money in
public funds, and weakened the act rather than strengthening it. The Bank expressed serious
concern to the GoU about these changes; nonetheless the second tranche was disbursed according
to schedule in September 2009 as it was judged that the prior action required only that the
amendments be submitted to Cabinet, not that they be acceptable to the Bank.17

The status of the PPDA Amendments continues to be an outstanding issue between the Bank and
the GoU specifically on the unrestricted use of force account. Following discussion with the
Government and the DPs, the GoU has subsequently assured the Bank that a revised amendment
to be submitted to Parliament  or the associated regulations to the Bill  will meet best practices.
Currently, PRSC 8 board presentation has been delayed until FY11 to ensure that the outstanding
procurement act loophole is closed.

Reduced Corruption: Despite a strong anti-corruption framework, Uganda has had difficulty
translating its anti-corruption laws into practice and there has been a perception in recent years of




13
   Staffing of the local procurement offices (establishing procurement disposal units) lagged behind schedule. Only 50
percent of LGs had recruited officers at all levels, below the target of 70 percent
14
   The January 2008 PRSC 7 mission established that the quality of the draft amendments prepared by PPDA was not
acceptable to the Bank. At that point, the Government set up a technical working committee to take over the
preparation of the amendments.
15
   The other two requirements for release of the second tranche were: (i) maintain a stable macroeconomic
environment; and (ii) approve a 2008/09 budget consistent with PEAP 3 and its medium-term growth objectives.
16
   A 2008 review of public procurement contracts showed that out of 200 contracts, 74 percent had not fully met at least
one of the seven criteria for full compliance with established procedures. By value, over 80 percent were non-
compliant with at least one criterion.
17
   The original prior action (for the first tranche) required that the draft revisions would be subject to the review and
comments of the Bank and approved by Cabinet, not simply submitted to Cabinet. The revised prior action for the
second tranche release dropped the requirement that the amendments be subject to Bank review and Parliamentary
approval, apparently because the Bank became part of the technical working committee proposing the amendments.


                                                          18

increasing corruption at all levels.18 The key achievements in fighting corruption supported by
the PRSC series included the implementation of the National Anti-Corruption Strategy (NACS),
which covered cross-cutting public service reforms; the above discussed reforms in PFM and
procurement; development of the Whistleblower Protection Act and revision of the Leadership
Code Act; implementation of the National Integrity Survey (NIS) by the Inspector General of
Government (IGG); establishment of a Special Anti-Corruption Division of the High Court
(opened December 2008). In addition, a joint Government/DP task force was set up to develop
mechanisms to reduce corruption and the governance-related case backlog in the IGG's office
and judiciary. 19

The Bank was upfront and direct in identifying the need to address corruption, and broadened the
PRSC dialogue to tackle corruption through a multi-pronged approach of enhancing
accountability (PFM and procurement), programming for better value for money (sector reviews),
and facilitating enforcement (case backlog management, special anti-corruption court). This
focus sought to reorient the anti-corruption agenda by linking it to practical measures such as
improved PFM, procurement and management of payroll, as well as by strengthening the hands
of the IGG and anti-corruption part of the Judiciary. These measures were designed to deter,
rather than absolutely eliminate corruption. Overall however, there has been little progress with
regard to reducing corruption as indicated in the Transparency International Corruption
Perception Index, 20 the National Integrity Survey III [2008]; the slow and limited Government
response to grand corruption cases, and frequent reports of corruption in the service sectors which
continues to threaten public service delivery in health and education (discussed further below).
The demand side measures against corruption in PRSC 6-7 (including efforts to involve the
public in the fight against corruption) are medium- to longer-term in nature, making it too soon to
fully assess the effectiveness of those efforts.

PEAP Strategic Objective 4.4.3 -- Improved Public Sector Performance

Improved public sector performance  and therefore strengthened efficiency in public service
delivery  was impeded in Uganda by weaknesses in public administration and public sector
management. 21 Service delivery in health, education, and infrastructure was being increasingly
squeezed by rising public administration expenditures, particularly employee-related
expenditures.22 The creation of new districts (discussed below) also added new challenges, and a
number of "one-off" events contributed to the growth of public administration expenditures,




18
   As noted in the Bank's 2010 Country Assistance Strategy "petty and high level corruption re prevalent and affect
every institution in the country." Uganda ranked 130th out of 180 countries in Transparency International's 2009
Corruption Perception Index, below many other African countries.
19
   There were several high profile corruption cases under PRSC 5-7, none of which has been resolved to date.
20
   The results of the Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index started at 2.5, increased to 2.8 and fell
back to 2.5 (with a higher number indicating lower perceived corruption).
21
    The challenges facing Uganda in terms of better public sector performance and better efficiency in public service are
indicated by the relative weakness in Uganda's CPIA ratings. Uganda performs considerably better than average for
IDA countries (and the Africa region) on economic management, but only average or even below average on service
delivery; PSM; efficiency of revenue mobilization; and quality of public administration, and transparency,
accountability, and corruption.
22
   "Employee-related costs have been the main driver of spending within recurrent expenditure, and now comprise a
significant share of total spending, amounting to about 51 percent of total spending...Real wages in fact grew by 6.6
percent in the period 1998/9 to 2005/6. The number of civil servants rose by 2.4 percent, giving real growth in the
wage bill of 8.7 percent, compared with growth in real spending of only 1.1 percent." Uganda: Fiscal Policy for

including amending the constitution in 2005, holding national elections in 2006, and hosting the
CHOGM in 2007.

There were prior actions relating to improved public sector performance under each operation,
but PRSC 5-7 had only a narrow agenda and limited success on this complex area. Under PRSC
5, the GoU committed to developing an updated pay reform strategy and target salary adjustments
for the public service, and the Cabinet approved a new policy in August 2006. Under PRSC 6,
the Government committed to a wage bill study to identify the policy and strategic measures
needed to control the size of the public service, achieve efficiency in wage bill stabilization,
enable implementation of the pay reform policy, and eliminate the public service pension arrears
in the medium to long term. This work informed further work on pay reform under PRSC 7.
The prior action under PRSC 7, however, regarding satisfactory progress in the implementation
of the new phase of the Public Service Reform Program (PSRP) was only partially met, although
the GoU did successfully adopt some measures to improve payroll management, including
identifying "ghost workers" and purging them from the payroll, and introducing disciplinary
action against those responsible for perpetuating these workers. Overall, however, progress was
limited by the larger challenges of finding adequate resources to achieve long-term pay targets,
while creating a right-sized civil service that is both well-remunerated and provides high quality
services. Further, as indicated in the PER, limited transparency and accountability for resources
and service delivery was quite evident in the social sectors caused in many instances by a limited
public service performance management system.

PEAP Strategic Objective 4.4.4.--Strengthened Local Government System for Service
Delivery

While the Bank had been involved in decentralization reforms in Uganda since 2000,23 Bank
efforts under the PRSC 5-7 focused on strengthening local government (LG) capabilities to
improve service delivery in support of PEAP III.24 LGs play significant roles in the provision of
basic public sector services such as primary education and primary health care; thus weaknesses
in decentralization affect service delivery. The decentralization of roles and responsibilities to
LGs, however, had proceeded more rapidly than did the building up of the necessary capacity to
handle those responsibilities, and the PRSCs sought to address this gap. Moreover, with the
introduction of multi party politics in 2005, the decentralization policy agenda became
increasingly affected by political considerations, and several policies were introduced that
weakened LGs. In particular, the GoU abolished the graduated tax (which had constituted own-
source revenue for local governments), 25 created more districts, and began to pay LG executives
from the consolidated fund. There was also pressure from sector ministries to meet sector targets,
which resulted in increased sector conditional grants to LGs for the delivery of specific sector
outputs and targets. As a consequence, instead of rising, the percentage of LG own source
revenues as a share of the LG budget fell from 6 percent in 2002/03 to 3 percent in 2008/09, far
short of the goal of 9 percent. In addition, the percentage of transfers as a share of the LG budget
that was conditional rose from 94 percent in 2002/03 to 95 percent.


23
   Through the first and second Local Government Development Projects (LGDP I & II) that supported the Ministry of
Local Government and Local Government Finance Commission, provided development and capacity building grants to
local governments, and supported enhanced LG revenues.
24
    PRSC-supported reform efforts were also complemented by other Bank measures to address decentralization,
including the Local Government Development Project and the Local Government Management Project.
25
   The graduated tax had accounted for about 80 percent of LG locally generated revenue. The abolition of the graduate
tax and the introduction of new districts in 2005 and 2006 created a LG funding gap of around Ush 84 billion per year
in 2006 prices. Uganda: Fiscal Policy for Growth, PER 2007, ibid, p 10.

The PRSCs introduced measures to offset the 2005 elimination of the graduated tax. Prior to its
elimination, this tax had provided local governments with locally generated revenue equivalent to
5 percent of their total revenue and provided un-earmarked funds to the local governments.
Elimination of the tax was contrary to the spirit of decentralization, and as a consequence, local
governments became dependent on the largely conditional central government transfers for 95
percent of their budget, with a resultant reduction in accountability to local citizens, while also
undermining effective frontline service delivery by local governments. Accordingly, two
alternative sources of revenue for LGs (namely, a local service tax and a hotels tax) were
developed and approved by Cabinet (a prior action), and the MoFPED also provided additional
revenue to offset these revenue losses (also a prior action). This prior action was only partially
met, however, as implementation required an act of Parliament before this measure could become
effective. Additional sources of revenue were also created through passage of the LG (Rating)
Act. This Act paved the way for valuing and, therefore, taxing commercial and industrial
property both in rural and urban areas. These new local revenue sources only partially offset the
revenue losses from the elimination of the graduated tax, however. In 2008/09 the new taxes
brought in less than one tenth of what the graduated tax raised in 2004/05.

LG capacity was also negatively affected by the fact that only 35 percent of established posts
were filled. The PRSC 7 supported actions to enhance LG staffing and succeeded in raising local
staffing from 35 percent to an average of 46 percent for established posts. However, this progress
has been subsequently undermined by the creation of new districts, that reflects an act of
Government, rather than a failing of the PRSC.

Finally, a number of institutional and policy measures were introduced under PRSC 6 and 7.
Under PRSC 6, the Ministry of Local Government (MoLG) was restructured (under PRSC 6) to
create two Directorates (one for LG administration and one for LG inspection) and five
commissioners (this was a prior action). This restructuring was approved by the Cabinet, and the
total number of staff has been increased from 122 to 164, thereby addressing the Ministry's low
capacity and helping it to deliver on its mandate. Finally, a new Physical Planning Bill was
prepared and submitted to Cabinet to repeal the Town and Country Planning Act (also a prior
action). Under PRSC 7, the Cabinet approved the new Physical Planning Bill in January 2008,
followed by Parliamentary approval in April 2010.

PEAP Strategic Objective 5.1--Better Educated Society

The main issues for education were gender disparities at post primary levels, stagnation in
primary completion rates, and regional inequalities, including educational delivery in the North.
However, there were also critical issues of poor quality and achievement of literacy, as well as
teacher absenteeism, which also needed to be addressed. The complications of decentralization
also made the delivery of education more challenging. In order to ease the overload on the
education system from both the Universal Primary Education (UPE) and, later, Universal
Secondary Education (USE) initiatives and rapid population growth, the PRSC series supported
an increase in the number of teachers, textbooks, and classrooms. To improve the quality of
learning, the GoU continued to focus on improving the conditions of teacher service,
constructing more classrooms, developing customized performance targets for head teachers and
their deputies to improve school-level supervision, and reducing teacher absenteeism.

The results in the educational sector under these operations were generally positive (see Table 4).
Primary enrollment rates for boys and girls exceeded the PEAP target. Efforts to increase the
number of teachers on payroll reached 99.4 percent of the approved ceiling; however, the target

teacher: pupil ratio was not met because the increase in the number of pupils was greater than
anticipated. The pupil: classroom ratio also improved, falling from 85:1 in 2004/05 to 72.1 in
2008/09, and there were also improvements in the ratios in some of the targeted districts where
classrooms were in short supply; in other targeted districts, however, progress fell short owing to
the fact that teachers' houses were constructed instead of additional classrooms. In addition, the
creation of new districts out of the existing ones also delayed construction as new administrative
systems had to be set up. Literacy and numeracy rates rose significantly during 2003-07, and
may reflect in part the fact that the earlier target of a pupil: textbook ratio was reached under
PRSC 5. Literacy for boys and girls increased from 34 percent upon primary completion to 44.5
percent and in numeracy from 20.5 percent to 41.4 percent.

Less positively, completion rates for boys fell over the period, and while it increased for girls, it
fell short of target. A diagnostic study identified the following causes: (i) high drop-out rates
(about 7 percent); (ii) high repetition rate (15 percent); (iii) inadequate school-level supervision;
and (iv) inadequate involvement of other stakeholders, such as communities. In addition, the
FY2008 PER in education revealed high inefficiencies and wastage of public finances,
particularly through high teacher absenteeism; inequitable teacher deployment, insufficient spread
of instructional materials, and weak governance structures at the school levels that hinder the
quality of service delivery. While a number of ideas to improve teacher absenteeism were
discussed during PRSC 7 preparation (e.g. punitive pay for absent teachers, differential pay for
teachers who are consistently present), these were not implemented at the time.

The intensive dialogue with Government under the PRSCs also led to the enactment of the 2008
Education (pre-primary, primary and post-primary) Act, to give full effect to Government's
education policy and delivery structures.

PEAP Strategic Objective 5.2--Healthier Ugandans

Reforms in the health sector under PRSC 5-7 took place in the context of the first Health Sector
Strategic Plan (HSSP) (2001/01 to 2005/06, commencing with PRSC 1) and the second HSSP
(2006/07 to 2010/11). The reforms aimed to provide Ugandans with a minimum package of cost-
effective health care interventions targeting major causes of disease through a Sector Wide
Approach (SWAp).

Only two HSSP indicators were moving in a positive direction at the beginning of the PRSC 5-7
series (i.e., in 2006/07 compared with 2004/05). These include the percentage of deliveries in
health facilities (which rose from 25 percent to 32 percent in that period), and couple years of
protection (a measurement of contraception rates, which rose by approximately 53 percent to
357,021). Outpatient utilization (at 0.9 percent) and the percentage of health centers without drug
stock-outs was unchanged (at 35 percent), however, and the percentage of pentavalent vaccine
(DPT) coverage fell slightly (from 89 to 87 percent). With the exception of couple years of
protection, none of the HSSP indicators for which data were available met the Government's
2006/07 target.

Table 5, which shows the GoU's indicators used to track infant and maternal mortality rates,
indicates that progress in the health sector continued to be slow between 2007/08 and 2008/09.
While all the indicators indicate some positive progress, progress in four of the five indicators for
which data are available fell short of the target,26 including the DPT3 immunization rate and the
percentage of women whose deliveries were in health facilities. Only the couple of years of
protection exceeded the target.

Similarly, there was positive performance in six of the seven PEAP indicators used for assessing
the management and provision of health care service delivery (see Table 6). The number of
districts in which village health teams were established and operationalized (42) far exceeded the
target (13). Similarly, there were gains in improving HIV/AIDS service delivery, with the
percentage of health facilities focused on the prevention of mother to child transmission
(PMTCT) increasing (to 68 percent  a rise of 23 percent over 2007/08 and well above the target
of 50 percent). Likewise, the share of health center fours (HCIV) offering HIV/AIDS care with
anti-retroviral therapy services improved. Less positively, however, there was a two percent
decline (to 26 percent) in the percentage of health care centers with no stock-outs of tracer drugs,
well short of the 35 percent target, and below the 35 percent achieved in 2006/07.

While some improvements in the health sector were made under the PRSCs, some areas
worsened (e.g., stock outs), and the key indicators tracked under the PRSCs (immunization rates
and percentage of deliveries in health facilities) fell short of PRSC targets. It is highly unlikely
that Uganda will meet the health-related MDG targets, and as noted in the 2010 CAS, despite
some progress in recent years, "Uganda's health outcomes remain poor...and the health sector
suffers from inadequate funding, understaffed health centers, health worker absenteeism, and
waste in drug supply." As with the 2008 PER on the education sector, the PER on health (FY09)
revealed huge inefficiencies and the wastage of public finances, particularly as result of health
care absenteeism rates and weak drug procurement and supply management. In addition,
pilferage of medical supplies has been reported and may have contributed to the high rate of


26
   A target for the percent of under fives that were malnourished is included in the survey but no data for 2007/08 were
available as these data are collected through the Demographic Health Survey (last conducted in 2006, with the next
survey due in 2011).


                                                          23

stock-outs. This is as much a sector governance problem, as a health care problem, with both
outright corruption and "quiet corruption" undermining positive health outcomes. 27

In addition to sector governance problems, stagnation in health sector performance during this
period coincided with the decline in funding to the sector and alleged corruption in the
management of grants for the Global Fund on AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and the Global
Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization. In addition, a shift in overall Government priorities
occurred at the same time with increased attention and resources being moved to infrastructure
development while it initiated its "value for money" efforts in social sector service delivery. The
Government has since, however developed a framework for the management of the DP projects,
the Long-Term Institutional Arrangements. The new arrangements are consistent with the
Partnership Principles (2001) and Paris Declaration on Harmonization and Alignment of
development partner support and describes processes and measures to align and mainstream
programming and management of DP projects to national processes and systems, thus ensuring
coordination and sustainability of programs.

  As noted in the 2010 CAS, "Uganda suffers from pervasive `quiet corruption'  the failure of public servants to
deliver goods or services paid for by the government  such as unchecked teacher and health worker absenteeism,"
which often has "deep long-term consequences for households, farms, and firms."

PEAP Strategic Objective 5.3--Improved Access to Safe Water and Sanitation Services

There was good progress on access to safe water (see Table 7). For rural water supplies, the
sector recorded 63 percent access in 2007 (up from 55 percent in 2000), compared to the 77
percent PEAP target and the 62 percent MDG target. While the number of water sources that
were functional missed the target of 85 percent, there was strong improvement (from 70 percent
to 83 percent). Less positively, 71 percent access was achieved in urban water coverage,
compared to a PEAP target of 77 percent and a MDG target of 77 percent; nonetheless, this
reflects steady growth over the 60 percent urban access achieved in 2002.

Other progress in the sector included transferring to district governments budget resources for
rural water supply and achieving a 90 percent resource utilization; the achievement of all
benchmark and service delivery targets; a substantial increase in the number of water points; and
gazetting 80 small towns for urban water and sewerage facilities and placing them under a regime
of six cluster private sector management contracts.28 Thanks to the implementation of incentive-
based area performance contacts by the National Water and Sewerage Corporation (NWSC),
more than 15,000 new water connections were made annually, many of which were for poor
families in compliance with the pro-poor connection policy (in FY2006/07, this rose to 24,000
new connections). Equally noteworthy, the NWSC is one of the few public utilities in Africa that
covers operating costs and makes a provision for depreciation.

Finally, as a result of the PRSCs' insistence on value for money and PET studies, the need to
improve governance in the water sector also became apparent. Subsequently, a Water and
Sanitation Sub-sector Working Group on Good Governance was formed and an action plan on
good governance was prepared to improve transparency and accountability. Analytical work

  The scale of private sector water management using local Ugandan operators places Uganda as a leader in this kind
of innovation in Africa.

(including a baseline survey on integrity in the sector) has been carried out,29 which has resulted
in the revision of the Water and Sanitation Sub-sector Good Governance Action Plan for 2009-
2012. The working group is following up the implementation of the action plan and this process
is being monitored in the JBSF matrix.

While progress on access to sanitation fell short of target, important gains were nonetheless made,
including a 12 percent increase in rural access to sanitation and an 8 percent increase in urban
access. At 73 percent, urban access exceeds the MDG target of 72 percent while rural access at
68 percent falls short. Similarly, the pupil:latrine ratio worsened, from 61:1 in 2006 to 69.1 in
2007. Stronger progress was inhibited by a lack of attention to sanitation as a priority, financial
constraints, high investment costs, and insufficient human resources, among other factors.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation

There were a number of a factors affecting implementation, as discussed below.

Quality of the Background Analysis: There was substantial ESW from the outset of the series
with the main diagnostics from the PERs, CFAA, CPAR, and LGIF, along with national and
other development partner analyses. This ongoing analytical work has fed directly into policy
dialogue and government reform actions. In support of Pillar 1, the 2005 PER covered the
linkages between the budget and the re-orientation of the pro-poor growth strategy and service
delivery, and examined how the PEAP could be better reflected in the budget. Similarly, the
2007 Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) helped the government shift toward investments
to accelerate economic growth and structural transformation by recommending a prioritized and
consistent set of policy actions, investments, and interventions to remove likely obstacles to
growth and structural transformation.

For PEAP Pillar 4, the Bank completed a Diagnostic Trade Integration Study (DTIS) in 2005/06,
and these recommendations were converted into a time-bound action plan under the leadership of
the Ministry of Trade, Tourism, and Industry in late 2006. Financial sector discussions have been
informed by the Financial Sector Assessment Update of 2005, while the study "Reform
operations for public service pension fund in Uganda" has underpinned dialogue on public sector
pension reform. A Gender and Growth Assessment (GGA) was completed in 2006 and provided
specific policy recommendations to strengthen women's economic empowerment; a GGA


29
  These baseline studies have been a useful mechanism to create awareness among policy makers on citizens'
perceptions on government services. In addition, they are important for M&E and provide a useful tool to measure
change over time.


                                                      26

coalition (comprised of civil society and private and public organizations) was established to
advocate implementation of those recommendations. Support for PEAP Pillar 4 was also
informed by the Public Financial Management Performance Report and Updates of the CIFA
Action Plan (2006). In the education sector, the education sector wide efficiency study, the
national assessment of progress in education, and the diagnostic study of the causes of low
completion rates helped to deepen the policy dialogue on actions for accelerating progress in
indicators like primary completion rates. Finally, there were also other studies completed on
education, health, and water and sanitation to inform the human development component
supported by the PRSCs. 30 This voluminous analytical work was successful in identifying
detailed measures needed to address a broad range of issues in the PEAP.

Program Design: Program design affected the implementation of the program; however, to
avoid redundancy, this is discussed in Section 3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and
Implementation.

Introduction of the Multi-Party System (2005). This political change ushered in a new
political environment of policy-making. While a positive democratic trend for the country, this
change meant that patronage, populism, and party funding became increasingly more important
factors in determining the feasibility of reforms than they were under the first series of PRSCs
and there has been an increase in ad hoc policy changes, and weakened sector governance (e.g.,
from absenteeism). In addition, Parliament has been more active as it now includes genuine
opposition, while technocrats have less power to design policy than in the past.

Factors Complicating Service Delivery at the Local Level: Local governments are responsible
for the provision of basic public services, but several policy reversals hindered service delivery
under this series of operations , including:

         Proliferation of districts. From 2004 to 2009, more than 25 new districts were created,
         bring the total to 90. This has further stretched the already limited implementation
         capacity of districts. While these districts were created ostensibly to improve service
         delivery, they have, in fact, increased the amount spent on salaries and administration
         costs, further reducing the resources available for service delivery.

         Elimination of the graduated tax. As noted, the elimination of the graduated tax in 2005
         has reduced the funds available to local governments for discretionary expenditures, and
         was inconsistent with the objective and spirit of decentralization. As a result, local
         governments have become dependent on non-discretionary central government transfers
         with a resultant reduction in accountability to local citizens, and again undermining
         effective frontline service delivery by local governments.

         Increased percentage of conditional grants. In FY06, 65.6 percent of total local
         government financing was in the form of tied sector conditional grants. By FY10, the




30
    Other ongoing analytical work informing these operations included a Bank/Fund Debt Sustainability Analysis
(2007), the 2008 PER on education and the 2009 PER on health; a Financial Sector Assessment Update (2005); a
Public Financial Management Performance Report and Update of the CIFA Action Plan (2006); and a Poverty and
Social Impact Assessment on lands in northern Uganda. Under the human development component, there were, inter
alia, studies on teacher recruitment/retention; procurement system in the National Medical Store; and value and money
tracking studies to investigate the high costs of deep boreholes and piped water schemes.


                                                        27
Poverty Reduction Strategy Credits 5-7: Implementation Completion and Results Report


        proportion of conditional grants had risen substantially, further reducing the ability of
        local governments to program resources effectively.

        Reduced transfers to local governments. Central government real per capita transfers to
        local governments have fallen by 13 percent between FY03 and FY08. Furthermore,
        transfers to local governments (as a percentage of public expenditures), have declined
        from approximately 47 percent in FY02 to about 22 percent in FY09. As a consequence,
        an increasing proportion of local government resources are being spent on non-
        discretionary wages and salaries.

Risks and Mitigation Efforts: The risk analysis in the Program Documents categorized (i) risks
that reflected (the broader context in Uganda, and (ii) those risks that pertained in particular to the
PRSC reforms. The overall risks were presented in the Country Assistance Strategy (UJAS).
The broad risks and their mitigation measures included:
Poor mortality and reproductive health outcomes. These are essentially two separate but related
risks. High infant mortality and maternal mortality, and a high fertility rate posed serious
challenges to the success of the PRSC-supported program. Mitigation measures on the
government's side included a multi-sector taskforce that was analyzing the determinants of infant
and maternal mortality and the fact that the population secretariat was looking at measures to
address population questions, in addition to the actions proposed in the third PEAP. More
concretely, this risk was addressed by the fact that the fiscal sustainability risks associated with
population growth were addressed in the PERs, the CEM, and influenced dialogue with the
government on fiscal policy, education, and public service reform. Other than the Infant and
Maternal Mortality Rates Task (IMMR) Force, however, there is still no mechanism in place to
promote multi-sector efforts in health.
Uncertainty arising from political transition to a multiparty system. In July 2005, Ugandans
voted to restore multi-party politics and Parliament voted to lift the two-term limit for the
President. The anticipated risk of increased patronage, policy reversal, and ad-hoc policy
interventions materialized. These risks were mitigated to some extent through continued
strengthening of institutions with respect to anti-corruption, PFM, and public service reform, as
well as improved transparency in the budget.
Continued conflict in northern Uganda. The internal security situation in the North improved so
this risk did not materialize. While regional disparities remain high, the situation has stabilized.
The Bank continues to work with other partners to continue to support the provision of better
social services in the areas ravaged by war and insecurity.
Poor governance. While measures to strengthen governance were achieved, the perception that
corruption is rising has damaged Uganda's credibility with the public and DPs with no real
improvement in the corruption index. Mitigating measures included the Bank's work with
Government and DPs to support the implementation of the national anti-corruption action plan, as
well as through procurement, PFM reforms, and empowerment of enforcement agencies.
Weak institutional and public sector capacity, particularly at sub-national levels. Uganda needed
to address the pervasive public sector weaknesses, particularly at the district levels. Strong
ownership of the PEAP agenda by the entire public sector and civil society, and ongoing public
sector reforms including pay reform, would contribute to sustained improvements in public
capabilities. Public service reform was addressed, but the core issue of inadequate incentives and
in particular weak accountability structures and their enforcement persist.




                                                  28

Exogenous shocks, arising from adverse weather patterns or terms of trade. Uganda is reliant on
agriculture for the most of its GDP and exports, thus weather- or terms of trade-related shocks
posed the potential for serious negative impacts on the country's GDP and the balance of
payments. The GOU has pursued sound macroeconomic policies and structural and institutional
reforms aimed at improving access to markets and enhancing competitiveness, and these have
helped offset the impact of exogenous shocks. Through the PMA, Government also sought to
enhance production, competitiveness, and incomes of the rural poor who are the most vulnerable
to these shocks.
In addition, there were several risks that were identified that were specific to this series of
operations. These risks and their mitigation measures included:
Risk of slow progress in the implementation of public service reform. Slow progress in
implementation of the public service reforms was an identified risk that materialized and, because
of its cross-cutting nature, undoubtedly had an adverse impact on outcomes. While the payroll
cleaning exercise was successful, the main measure of pay reform achieved minimal progress.
Impacts were felt most palpably in absenteeism in the education and health sectors, but are harder
to prove in other areas. It can be said, however, that the same weak incentives in the public
service persisted throughout the PRSC 5-7 series.
Risk of poor Government coordination of the implementation of the PEAP and PRSC. The reform
program contained multiple elements that required coordination and follow-up across sectors and
agencies. Weak institutions, duplication of effort, and poor inter-sectoral linkages made it
difficult to ensure well-coordinated implementation of previous PRSCs. While the new
Government-wide PEAP coordination arrangements were expected to mitigate these risks, the
various committees and technical groups associated with PRSC and PEAP met infrequently
during the PRSC 5-7 period, mostly while PRSC missions were taking place.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

M&E Design: The PRSC 4 established a rolling three-year program of support during 2004/05-
2006/07, including a results framework. In developing the PEAP policy actions and results
matrix, the Government retained the key elements of the PRSC 4 results matrix, but made it more
comprehensive to cover all five Pillars of the PEAP, while at the same time entering into an
agreement with donors (Partnership Principles) which asked the donors to have their results
matrix to be subsets of the PEAP matrix. With the help of a Bank-supported consultant, this
matrix was to be streamlined into an M&E system called the NIMES; in the process, however,
many indicators were added irrespective of whether or not the statistical system was able to
generate the data, with the end result that a majority of the indicators did not have either a
baseline or target, were poorly defined, or were unsupported by any means of data collection.
This hampered M&E, as data were not available to assess program progress on many of these
outcomes.
In accordance with a GoU request, the Bank relied upon the PEAP matrix and its indicators for
the PRSC 5-7 results framework. Outcome indications were selected from the full PEAP matrix
to monitor progress on specific areas supported by the series of PRSC prior actions. While the
results framework for PRSC 5 was detailed and included many indicators with baseline and target
values, in a number of cases the indicators were not specific, measurable, attributable, relevant or
time bound (SMART); however, these weaknesses in the results framework can be traced directly
to the overall monitoring framework for the PEAP. (For example, the timeframe for a number of
indicators was not relevant to the PRSC series because data were collected only every five years;
e.g., maternal and child mortality and child malnutrition were initially selected as program
indicators). Because of the limitation of the indicators for PRSC 5, there was a major refinement


                                                 29
Poverty Reduction Strategy Credits 5-7: Implementation Completion and Results Report


in the composition of indicators in PRSC 6 and 7 (this is discussed further below in Section 3.1,
Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation).
M&E Implementation: An annualized policy action matrix for PEAP 3 was used to monitor the
achievement of measurable targets and progress toward agreed PEAP outcomes. Biannual Status
Reports and the Annual PEAP Implementation Reviews (APIR) served as a structured M&E
monitoring process to guide policy analysis, budget prioritization, work planning, performance,
and DP dialogue. M&E was also conducted through annual sector review performance reports
and periodic survey data (e.g., UNHS 2005/06 and DHS 2006). The reliance on national surveys
for implementation reflected weaknesses in the Government's M&E. As noted in the
Government's National Development Plan (NDP, 2010/11-2014/15), "the existing M&E
strategies conceived to enhance governance and public service delivery have not yet fully led to
the development and institutionalization of the necessary monitoring and evaluation function in
the public sector. This has led to over reliance on national surveys and censuses by Uganda
Bureau of Statistics (UBOS) as the main source of reliable data for national sectors and Local
Governments."

M&E Utilization: The M&E system was not sufficiently operational for tracking and reporting
on outcomes and results and providing feedback to both Government and DPs. According to the
Government's NDP, the "the current national M&E arrangements are weak and comprise only a
few functional systems at sector level. They are characterized by fragmentation; duplication;
weak co-ordination; lack of a clear results chain; poor definitions, tracking and reporting of
outcomes and results; use of different formats and approaches with no common guidelines and
standards; lack of national ownership; inadequate feedback and sharing of results across
Government and other stakeholders; poor use of the data generated; problems related to capacity
and resourcing; and are donor driven."

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):

The next series of PRSCs is under preparation. This series (PRSC 8, 9, and 10) is the first to be
developed jointly with a group of nine other development partners under the Uganda Joint Budget
Support Framework (JBSF), While this series will follow up on many of the areas of PRSC 5-7,
the core objective is to improve the efficiency and equity of public service delivery. It is also
expected to be better synchronized with the Government budget cycle. Although the original
anticipated approval date for PRSC8 was 2010, Board presentation has been delayed until 2011 in
order to address the loopholes in the procurement act (discussed in Section 2.1 above)

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)

Consistency with Government Priorities: In light of the fact that the PRSCs were core
operations supporting the objectives of Uganda's PEAP, these operations were highly
relevant to Government priorities. To ensure alignment with country-owned priorities, the
process by which the PRSC program implementation was tracked was based on reviews of
government sector strategies. The annual sector reviews embodied country ownership,
transparent processes, joint analytical work, and improved dialogue.




                                                 30
Poverty Reduction Strategy Credits 5-7: Implementation Completion and Results Report


Moreover, the core focus of PRSC 5-7 remained highly relevant, even as Government
priorities shifted. Roads and energy were becoming increasingly binding constraints to growth.
With the help of analytical economic and sector work, particularly the 2007 CEM which provided
the main analytical work during the PRSC 5-7 series, the Government moved to address these
constraints, even though it meant a temporary shift in emphasis away from social service delivery
and social sector budgets, which PRSC 5-7 had emphasized. PRSC 7 responded to the new
priority of infrastructure while retaining most of the initiatives in its original concepts of
governance and service delivery. Such flexibility is inherent to PRSCs and was properly
consistent with the need to respond to the changing needs of the client in accordance with the
analytical findings of the CEM.

The GOU had the stated, if ambitious, objective of becoming a middle income country in 20
years. The activities supported by the PRSCs were generally consistent with that objective. One
essential area could have been given more attention in order to have any reasonable prospect of
reaching that goal. With projected populations of 39.3 million and 103.2 million by 2015 and
2050, respectively, without a higher priority placed on reducing the fertility rate to lower the
population growth rate to well below the current 3.2 percent, reaching that goal might not be
feasible. As noted, the Bank consistently emphasized (through the CEM, PERs, etc.) that this
trend, if continued, would impede government objectives regarding poverty and growth.

 Program Design: The scope of the program was ambitious, wide-ranging, and multi-faceted;
this complexity was not aided by several design weaknesses, including:

 Complex Monitoring Framework: These operations had several inconsistencies with best
practice Bank design, although these can be predominantly traced to the design of the PEAP 3
matrix itself. As noted, the GoU had requested that the DPs use the PEAP matrix for M&E
purposes; however, the consultant provided by the Bank was not effective at developing a
meaningful matrix, and accordingly, under PRSC 5 the Bank was still working to align its result
framework with the PEAP matrix. Alignment was difficult, however, because the PEAP
quantitative monitoring matrix contained over 100 strategic results and strategic objectives, yet
over half the outcomes and indicators (65 out of 120) were left blank, and many of the targets for
those indicators that were identified were also unspecified. Consequently, the Program
Document for PRSC 5 did not contain a unified results framework showing clear linkages
between objectives, prior actions, outcomes, and targets.31 Rather there were two matrices: one
showing the results and policies, and a second, quantitative monitoring matrix showing outcomes
and targets (although many of the outcome indicators were left blank because they had not yet
been identified by the Government). As a consequence, it was difficult to derive the direct
linkages between actions and outcomes.

This was amended by PRSC 6 (and PRSC 7). These PDs contained a Policy and Results Matrix
(Annex 2) which more clearly showed the linkages between the PEAP objectives, the PRSC prior
actions, and PEAP outcomes and targets.32 While use of the PEAP results framework under



31
   A change in TTL at the time of PRSC 5 negotiation also did not help in the development of a realistic matrix for that
operation.
32
   To prevent these weaknesses in the forthcoming NDP, the Bank Uganda team has held multiple discussions with the
Ministry of Finance, Uganda Bureau of Statistics, and DPs to ensure that the M&E framework for the NDP will include
more focused sector priorities, clear linkages to budget formulation and accountability for results, a reliable supply of
statistics through annual surveys, and impact evaluation and analyses to inform policy adjustments during
implementation.


                                                          31
Poverty Reduction Strategy Credits 5-7: Implementation Completion and Results Report


PRSC 5 was consistent with the Bank priorities of promoting ownership, this objective conflicted
 owing to the weaknesses of the PEAP results framework  with the Bank's need to monitor
outcomes and results.
An additional design inconsistency was that, there were no targets for FY2008/09, although the
re-design of PRSC 7 into a two-tranche operation meant that the operation would provide support
to the FY2008/09 budget. Again, this weakness is directly due to the PEAP itself, as the lack of
targets for that fiscal year was directly attributable to the fact that the PEAP 3 was intended to be
implemented only over the period FY2004/05-FY2007/08, and was only later extended for an
additional two years (owing to delays in the development of the NDP).

Number of triggers/prior actions: The ambitious nature of the program led to a large number of
triggers/prior actions for each operation in contrast to what is recommended by best practice; for
example, PRSC 7 contained over 25 actions and measures, which arguably may have diluted
attention from key priorities and made it difficult to assess overall progress.33 It also increases
the likelihood that implementation delays in one area may impede reform progress in other areas
as the transition to the next operation is delayed. It should be noted, however, that prior actions
were also chosen in conjunction with Uganda's other DPs.

Reliance on sector reviews: Prior actions for key service social sectors under the PRSCs  and
the determination as to whether "satisfactory progress" was made in these sectors -- were linked
to the annual sector reviews, which were established ministerial processes involving ministry
staff and development partners. The sector review process was built upon a series of technical
reviews, design reviews for sub-sector issues, consultations for drafting sector budgets, as well as
surveys and management information systems to gauge progress regularly. Using these inputs,
these annual Sector Reviews assess the performance for the previous year, identify gaps and
decide on priorities for the following years. In practice, this process tended to be not particularly
rigorous and most of the triggers did not refer to any specific indicators, but the sector reviews are
nationally driven and the DPs had little voice or leverage over them (although they did reserve the
right to draw their own conclusions regarding the Government's performance). Again, the
Bank's commitments (beginning under the preceding series of operations) to use national systems
as much as possible, involved a trade-off whereby the rigor of the assessments was somewhat
reduced. Nonetheless, the team continued to make clear to the Government the Bank's
discomfort as to how national assessments were made, and the 2008 and 2009 PERs on education
and health served as realistic, fact-based inputs into the sector policy dialogue.

Complementarity with Other Bank Programs: The PRSCs were designed to facilitate reforms
and complement the implementation of sector-specific projects under each Pillar. Under Pillar 4
(Governance), for example, PRSC efforts to improve governance, fight corruption, and increase
efficiency in the public sector was were complemented, inter alia, by the Second Economic and
Financial Management Project (EFMP II), the Second Local Government Development Project,
and the Local Government Management and Service Project (with a component for Financial
Management and Accountability  FINMAP).34

Donor Harmonization: This series of operations was implemented in the context of increased
donor harmonization as exemplified in the Uganda Joint Assistance Strategy Paper (UJAS)



33
   PRSC 5 had 11 triggers/prior actions; PRSC 6 had 12; and PRSC 7 had 11.

the Program Document for PRSC 7.

developed in 2005 between seven key DPs to support the PEAP 3. 35                  Although donor
coordination and alignment had been growing since the late 1990s, 36 the UJAS marked the
formalization of a harmonized approach of assistance centered on the government's poverty
reduction strategy in the PEAP. The PRSCs, including PRSC 5-7, have played an important role
in strengthening donor harmonization.37 DPs participated actively in PRSC discussions. The
AfDB participated in the pre-appraisal and appraisal missions for PRSC 7, and has formally
indicated its intention to use the PRSC framework as a basis for its multi-year Poverty Reduction
Support Loan. Finally, the PRSC 7 prior actions were included in the interim Joint Assessment
Framework (JAF) used by a number of DPs (in addition to the quantitative indictors jointly
agreed among development partners).            There was also close cooperation with the Fund.
Throughout the second PRSC series, the IMF and the World Bank collaborated closely,
particularly in the areas of public financial management, financial sector and debt sustainability.

Lessons from the Previous PRSC Series: The design of PRSC 5-7 took into account lessons
from PRSC 1-4 as well as those from a global stocktaking of PRSCs (2005). The global
stocktaking identified four areas of needed focus for PRSC 5-7: flexibility; donor harmonization;
resource predictability; and increased country ownership. The stocktaking of PRSCs 1-3
recommended that future PRSCs should (i) focus more on income generation; (ii) clarify a
graduated response especially in the case of reforms being off-track; (iii) avoid being overloaded;
(iv) take into account the weak capacity of local governments; and (v) identify and measure
results. The PRSC 5-7 series attempted to address some of these challenges. PRSC 5 increased
the focus on income generation and growth by addressing issues related to the implementation of
the Plan for Modernization of Agriculture (PMA) as well as gender issues related to growth.
PRSC 5 also continued work on a graduated response mechanism, with an increasing focus on
using the proposed PEAP implementation review to provide a common assessment framework.
Recommendations that proved difficult to follow through on were overloading the operation and
synchronizing the PRSCs with the GoU budget cycle (resource predictability); however,
synchronization was achieved by the end of PRSC 7 through the two-tranche disbursement.

Implementation completion reports (ICRs) for the first series of PRSCs (1-3) also raised the
issues of absorption capacity and fiscal sustainability, the tendency for PRSCs to set ambitious
long-term goals, and the need to assist GoU in developing long-term financing strategy. The
ICRs also suggested increasing resident technical expertise that would provide support during
implementation. This was addressed by locating core task management and sector specialists in
the country office to allow continuous consultation with GoU and its DPs. Finally, the
Government's assessment of PRSC 4 noted a number of weaknesses in that operation (and the
preceding operation); many of these were addressed in the preparation of PRSC 5 and 7.38

   The initial seven partners were: the African Development Bank, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, the
United Kingdom, and the World Bank Group. Five DPs signed up to the UJAS in 2006: Austria, Belgium, Denmark,
Ireland, and the European Commission.
36
   Including the establishment of joint sector working groups, the development of sectorwide approach programs
(SWAps) and pooled funding mechanisms, joint missions, silent partnerships, and joint analytical work and advisory
services by development partners. These shared approaches led to the signing of the Partnership Principles in 2003,
and culminated in the UJAS in 2005.
37
   Nonetheless, a review of the UJAS concluded that transaction costs were not reduced and was not an effective
operational tool.
38
   These included measures to align the PRSCs to the budget cycle and, for PRSC 6 and 7, to review the prior actions
and achievements under the previous five PRSCs so as to enhance the focus and realism of the reforms supported by
the operations. PRSC 4 Implementation Completion Report, Report No: 35569, June 30, 2006.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives
(including brief discussion of causal linkages between policy actions supported by operations and
outcomes)

The assessment of whether PRSC 5-7 achieved its PDOs is based primarily on the results
framework developed under PRSC6. This results framework was better suited to enabling
measurement than the initial PRSC5 program targets which, as discussed, were drawn directly
from the Government's PEAP indicators, consistent with the Bank prizing ownership. At the
same time, while improving the framework, it stayed true to the objectives of PRSC5 and the
PEAP and remained internally consistent. Nonetheless, the revised framework could not fully
escape the weaknesses and limitations of the Government's PEAP design, as will be seen below
as some data on indicators proved to be unavailable or otherwise incomplete. In the face of such
gaps, the assessment further adjusted the framework to use other criteria for assessing whegther
objectives had been achieved.

While the detailed assessment of whether these operations achieved their PDOs is largely based
on the policy and results matrix for PRSC 6 and 7 shown in Table 8 below, it is pertinent when
assessing a series of Poverty Reduction Support Credits to also take into account higher-level
outcomes such as per capita income growth and poverty reduction. As part of the evaluation
framework used in this ICR, these indicators are therefore also used in the assessment beyond the
formal indicators in the program documents. During the period of PRSC 5-7 real GDP per capita
grew on average by a healthy 4.8 percent per annum. While more recent estimates of poverty
rates are not yet available (with the exception of the Northern region), in light of the sustained
and significant real GDP per capita growth during the second series of PRSCs it is very likely that
the national poverty rate continued to decline in this period. The poverty rate in the North did
decline from 61 to 57 percent over the period.

Judged more narrowly by table 8, the achievement of program development objectives was mixed
and on balance moderately satisfactory. The economic management objective and enhanced
production, competition and output objectives were satisfactory. The economic management
objective of a reduced fiscal deficit was nearly met, as the fiscal deficit was reduced from 11.3%
of GDP in 2005 to 8.9 percent in FY08/09, just 0.7 shy of the target. Increased private sector
competitiveness was achieved, as private investment as a share of GDP rose from 17 percent to
19.1 percent (using the old national accounts GDP series), slightly exceeding the goal of 19.0
percent.

In the broad area of increased and more efficient agricultural production, six indicators were
used to monitor progress. Several outcomes were identified to measure increased market
orientation, including the percentage of agricultural exports as a percentage of agricultural GDP,
the increased marketing of agricultural production, the value of fish exports, and the percentage
of farmers with access to improved agricultural technologies. As seen in the table, nearly all of
these showed progress over the baseline. While the increased marketing of agricultural products
showed only a modest 1.5 percent increase, agricultural exports as a share of GDP rose by 5.7
percent (there were no PEAP targets for these indicators). The agricultural research system
(NARs) was successfully decentralized, meeting the objective of carrying out research that was
relevant to specific agricultural areas. While neither the volume of fish exports nor farmer access
to technology met the PEAP targets, it should be noted that the targets in the PEAP matrix were
in general set optimistically high; moreover, the value of fish exports increased nearly threefold,
and there was a fourfold increase in farmers' access to technology (as measured by the extension
of NAADS services). (A final indicator  the percent of land under forest cover  apparently


                                                 34
Poverty Reduction Strategy Credits 5-7: Implementation Completion and Results Report


registered a modest increase from 24 to 25 percent, short of the target of 27 percent, but data on
this outcome may not be reliable; moreover, this policy area was dropped under PRSC 7.)
Overall, there was reasonably good progress in this pillar although some targets were ambitious.

Progress in the area of good governance was mixed. PFM was strengthened, as 99 percent of
Ministries/LGs prepared regular financial statements in 2008/09, up from only 51 percent in 2004,
and performance was satisfactory. Reduced corruption  as measured by the Transparency
International Corruption Index 39 however, was not achieved, as the ranking was unchanged.
However, the dialogue on procurement reform proved to be very difficult. The proposed
amendments to the PPDA Act could undermine reform progress and remain a challenge in the
ongoing policy dialogue. Under the objective of improved public sector performance, there were
also mixed results. There is still a lack of linkages between ROM and OOB and agreeing on a
framework for integrating these systems is a prior action for PRSC 8; however, the percentage of
citizens reporting satisfactory public service may have exceeded the target.

As judged by the indicators, performance under the objective of strengthened local government
system for service delivery was less satisfactory. Instead of rising, the percentage of LG revenues
as a share of the LG budget fell from 6 percent in 2002/03 to 3 percent in 2008/09, far short of the
goal of 9 percent. This shortfall is attributable to the abolition of the graduated tax. In addition,
the percentage of transfers as a share of the LG budget that were conditional rose from 94 percent
in 2002/03 to 95 percent. In fact, given these challenging trends, the prior actions for PRSC 6 and
7 focused on the need for Government to identify alternative sources of revenue for LGs.
Achievements under the PRSCs include the GoU's continued compensation to LGs for the loss of
the graduated tax, including the passage of the Local Service and Hotel tax, support to LGs to
implement the LG (Ratings) Act, and the provision of additional funds to enhance the
unconditional grant for wages. These measures helped counteract the weakening funding base for
the local government system for service delivery (but not the weakening accountability link to
local taxpayers) by providing LGs with alternative sources of revenue -- however, these transfers
were not treated as LGs own source revenues for the outcome indicators of the PRSC.

Under human development, the quality of primary education as measured by the percentage of
primary 3 pupils achieving the desired levels of competency in literacy improved by 10.5 percent
to 44.5 percent between 2003 and 2008/09, broadly meeting the goal of 45 percent. While some
improvements in the health sector were made under the PRSCs, the performance of the health
sector can be assessed to be only moderately unsatisfactory because both immunization rates and
percentage of deliveries in health facilities  while showing improvements -- fell short of targets.
Finally, water and sanitation access showed important progress, with a 10 percent increase
between 2002/03 and 2008/09 in rural and urban access to safe water, meeting the targets of 65
percent. Access to sanitary facilities improved in both rural and urban areas, rising from 56
percent to 68 percent in rural areas, and 65 percent to 83 percent in urban areas. Seen all together,
there was reasonably good progress in this pillar.

Overall, progress in terms of this set of outcome indicators was mixed, but a preponderance of
targets were met (private investment, NARS implementation, PFM, safe water, education), and
the targets for the fiscal deficit and deliveries in health care centers were nearly met. Three
indicators had no targets but showed gains (marketing of agricultural production, agricultural
exports, and access to sanitation), while five were not met (corruption, share of LG revenue as

share of budget, conditional transfers to LG budget, rationalization of structures, and DPT3
immunization). Two more indicators  fish exports and farmer access to technology (NAAD)
did not meet their targets, but increased nearly threefold and fourfold, respectively.

Linkage between the Bank's interventions and outcomes: As budgetary assistance, the PRSC-5-7
funds did not earmark specific activities to be financed, so it is not possible to establish a direct
causal linkage between the Bank's assistance and specific outcomes. Moreover, it is not possible
to disaggregate the impact of this operation from that of other Bank projects, other donor efforts,
and Government initiatives. Budgetary support clearly helped the Government to fund poverty
reduction efforts (e.g., building additional classrooms); while the sequenced set of reforms
embedded in prior actions moved the reform agenda forward (e.g., PFM), while the PRSC
mechanism enabled a continuation of the ongoing policy dialogue between the DPs and the
Government that helped to support reform progress.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
(combining relevance, achievement of PDOs)
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

By their nature, PRSCs are complex and wide-ranging programs covering a number of objectives
which are not necessarily equal in their importance. This complexity makes the evaluation of
PRSCs more difficult than many Bank operations, particularly as each operation builds on the
previous, and because the program may proceed unevenly simply due to the difficulties inherent
in moving the reform agenda across a broad range of areas. Accordingly, an overall outcome
rating reflects both the relevance of the objectives/design as well as the achievement of
development objectives in terms of both quantitative (as in Table 8 above) and qualitative
performance. The justification for this rating is provided by looking at outcomes under each
PRSC, in addition to the achievement of PDOs as discussed above:

PRSC 5: For PRSC 5, macroeconomic performance was largely satisfactory although GDP
growth at 4.9 percent was somewhat less than targeted owing to chronic power shortages and
high petroleum import prices, and inflation (at 5.3 percent) was somewhat higher than desirable.
Credit to the private sector as a share of GDP began to rise. There was satisfactory progress
towards the end-of-project target on primary enrollment. Performance in the education sector
was satisfactory, while credit to the private sector showed a steady growth, indicating that the
end-of-project target would be reached. All prior actions were met, with the exception of the
budget ceiling for public administration and security. This performance is combined with the fact
that these operations were highly relevant to the Government's development priorities.

PRSC 6: Performance on the macroeconomic and private investment objectives was largely
satisfactory, although the inflation target was exceeded owing to the impact of global oil prices.
Credit to the private sector as a share of GDP continued to rise. The MoLG was successfully
restructured. The organizational structure of the Accountant General's Office was revised, paving
the way for financial management reforms such as IFMS, and in accordance with sector work
conducted for the CEM, the GoU adopted an appropriate shift in priorities to energy and roads to
address these constraints on growth. A number of prior actions were only partially met, however,
including implementation of the public procurement reforms and the budget ceiling for public
administration and security. The operation remained highly relevant.

PRSC 7: Macroeconomic management was effective, despite exogenous shocks, and the
2008/09 budget was consistent with medium-term growth objectives and significantly increased
expenditures on growth-enhancing infrastructure. Credit to the private sector as a share of GDP
continued to rise, and the banking sector became more competitive. The establishment of the
Credit Reference Bureau greatly facilitated the lending process. Private investment as a share of
GDP also increased, while the pay reform strategy was developed and an exercise to clean the
payroll of ghost workers was implemented.

By the end of this series of operations, significant PFM strengthening had also been achieved, as
indicated by the 2008 PEFA assessment. The IFMIS was implemented in all eighteen central
government ministries and nine local governments; the number of government institutions
receiving a clean audit grew to 40 percent, up from 21 percent at the beginning of the series; and
almost all central ministries produce their annual statements on time, in contrast to the 50 percent
that did so at the beginning of the series. In the agriculture sector, the successful decentralization
of the agricultural research system (NARS) enabled research to be carried out that was relevant
to specific agricultural areas, and there was an increase in farmers' access to technology (as
measured by the extension of NAADS services). These two programs generated significant


                                                 39
Poverty Reduction Strategy Credits 5-7: Implementation Completion and Results Report


benefits to the Ugandan households in terms of producing high yielding relevant technologies,
increased agricultural productivity, and higher household incomes. Moreover, the extensive
policy dialogue taking place under the PRSCs led to the development of the ATAAS project to
exploit the linkages and complementarities between research and agricultural extension services.
This policy dialogue also catalyzed the formulation of the sector-wide DSIP, which was endorsed
by the CAADP and several DPs as the main framework for developing Uganda's agricultural
sector during the next five years. In addition, the education sector literacy targets were reached,
and the dialogue with the Government under the PRSCs culminated in enactment of the 2008
Education Act.

Although LG procurement was aligned with that of the central government, the dialogue on
procurement reform proved to be very difficult. The proposed amendments to the PPDA Act
could undermine reform progress and remain a challenge in the ongoing policy dialogue.
Although there was progress in a number of health sector outcomes, many fell short of targets and,
stock outs in particular have continued to worsen. By the end of the series, it was clear that
important progress had been made on water and sanitation outcomes, which are an important
contributor to the improved health of Ugandans, and a comprehensive program to improve
governance in the water sector was introduced. Corruption overall remained an issue, however,
with no net improvement in the Transparency International's annual survey results, although a
number of measures were introduced to better address this issue (PFM, strengthening the IGG
and the anti-corruption part of the judiciary). A number of other areas of institutional
strengthening also occurred (discussed further below).

Overall rating: These operations were clearly highly relevant to the Government's development
priorities. Performance under PRSC 5 was satisfactory, but was somewhat less so under PRSC 6
and 7. While there were select reform shortfalls and several outcome indicators had not been met,
these operations achieved a number of important achievements as reflected in other outcome
indicators as well as high-level indicators. On balance, the progress warrants a rating of
moderately satisfactory.




3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(if any, where not previously covered or to amplify discussion above)

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The orientation toward service delivery in the PRSC series aimed to reduce poverty.
Improvements in education and water and sanitation indicators show positive gains in terms of
those aspects of poverty. Macroeconomic growth in Uganda has over the last decade been
correlated with a decline in poverty, and GDP and per capita income growth continued to be
strong under this series of operations. While it is probable that this growth also had a positive
impact on poverty in general, there were no new poverty line data developed during this series of
operations, and an evaluation cannot be made at this time on these operations impact on overall,
or regional income-based poverty.

In terms of gender impact, gender  and the gender-related issues of population growth, and
infant and maternal mortality  were cross-cutting issues emphasized in the second PRSC series ,



                                                 40
Poverty Reduction Strategy Credits 5-7: Implementation Completion and Results Report


and there was a substantial gender component to the reforms introduced in the context of PRSC
5-7. A number of gender-focused measures were introduced in the program supported by the
PRSCs, including:

        The gender and equity budget guidelines prepared by MOFPED have been attached to the
        Budget Call Circular each year since 2004/05,
        In early 2006, MOFPED commissioned a "Gender and Growth Assessment" (GGA),
        focused on identifying legal and regulatory obstacles to women's entrepreneurship, and a
        Gender and Growth Coalition (comprised of civil society, public, and private
        organizations) was established to actively lobby for the implementation of its
        recommendations. GGA recommendations were also incorporated into Uganda's Private
        Sector Development Strategy 2005-2009, and have led to re-drafting of several related
        laws.
        Awareness campaigns on women and land issues were conducted and sensitization
        campaigns for land managers commenced.

More specifically, the PRSC series targeted an increase in enrollment of girls in primary schools
as well as in primary completion rates. Both improved significantly with girls' primary
completion rate slightly exceeding that of boys. Gender and equity budget guidelines were also
implemented in five sectors along with recommendations of the Gender and Growth Assessment.
Results indicators were not available for these activities, though the PD for PRSC 7 reported
overall progress as "mixed".

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
(particularly with reference to impacts on longer-term capacity and institutional development)

The GOU increased its capacity to address corruption with the creation of the Anti-Corruption
Division of the High Court (ACD) and the Anti-Corruption Institution (ACI). The Accountant
General's office was able to function more independently and equipped with more than 100 CPAs
(compared with only 5 at the beginning of the program) and the IGG was strengthened.
Improvements in PFM and procurement also increased institutional capacity and transparency in
government operations, and the flow of money through the government can be better tracked
while procurement practices at the local level are now aligned with those at the central level.
Legislative achievements such as the CRB will improve the climate for businesses and consumers.
The MoLG was restructured and staff was added, thereby strengthening its capacity. LG staffing
was also strengthened with the help of the PRSCs from an average of 35 percent to 46 percent,
(although the subsequent expansion of districts has undermined this improvement).

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
None.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

There are a number of risks to development outcomes. These include the upcoming election in
2011, and unfavorable demographic trends which threaten fiscal sustainability and service
delivery. The public sector is weak, undermining implementation capacity and effectiveness,



                                                 41
Poverty Reduction Strategy Credits 5-7: Implementation Completion and Results Report


and PERs in education and health have revealed high inefficiencies and wastage of public
finances. Recurring overruns in public administration continue to constrain the expansion of
services and investment, and often take away resources mid-year from ongoing programs.
Improving public sector quality will require politically difficult civil service reform in order to
both reduce and redeploy the workforce while also addressing the dual challenges of improving
remuneration and strengthening the quality of public services.

The weaknesses in public sector capacity are aggravated by governance challenges. Although the
Government has made some progress in highlighting corruption involving use of public funds,
investigations and prosecutions have been slow and under-resourced. Corruption continues to
undermine public confidence, wastes scarce resources and reduces the impact of government
programs. Limited progress on governance is also undermining the service delivery, particularly
in the education and health sectors, that is necessary if further poverty reduction is to occur.
Weaknesses in decentralization also negatively affect service delivery, and the creation of more
districts, if continued, will further exacerbate this problem. Finally, the recent discovery of oil is
the proverbial "two-edged sword"  it provides substantial opportunities for positive economic
growth and poverty reduction, while also creating macroeconomic, political, and governance
challenges.

There are a number of factors that offset these risks. While the upcoming election may threaten
reform progress, Uganda's track record is that Parliament tends to catch up on the backlog of
legislation after elections. Important gains have been made in PFM, and these are probably
sustainable if follow-up support enables further progress, (and this support is expected under
PRSC 8). Moreover, these PFM gains are an important and necessary (although not sufficient)
condition for improved service delivery. The amendment to the procurement act (assuming the
version passed or the associated regulations meet best practice) could improve governance and
value for money in public funds with strong enforcement. Elements of second generation public
sector reforms were launched with the introduction of the results oriented management and the
adoption of a wage reform policy that has been partially implemented. Institutional reforms 
such as strengthening the IGG  are difficult to reverse, and oil revenues, if used wisely, can
support needed public infrastructure investment in key areas such as electricity and road
transportation that currently are barriers to growth and investment.            Improvements in
infrastructure will further bolster growth in an economy that has shown resilience to exogenous
shocks. Finally, the continued involvement of the Bank  through a third series of PRSCs, among
other operations  and Uganda's DPs will enable further dialogue in support of reform progress,
and the sequential nature of reforms continued in the PRSCs will build on  and thereby sustain 
recent outcomes.

Notwithstanding these potentially offsetting factors, there are several trends that are corrosive to
effective service provision and continued poverty reduction. These include growing expenditures
on public administration, the continuing creation of new districts, limited action on reducing
population growth, and pervasive corruption -- all of which are demonstrably undermining
service delivery across a wide range of areas. Until there are public sector management reforms
to improve efficiency and reduce the fiscal leakages that undermine public sector effectiveness,
further indications of improved governance, or additional strengthening of PFM given the advent
of future oil revenues, the risk to development outcome for all three PRSCs must be rated as
significant.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

The Bank followed several good practices in design. The PRSC operations were highly relevant
to Government priorities and were complementary with other Bank programs. The Bank also
carried out ample analytical work to assess most of the priority issues in the PEAP and to back up
the PRSC-supported program. Bank Good Practice Principles on Conditionality were referred to
explicitly in PRSC 6 and 7 program documents, with an explanation of how they these principles
were satisfied. Finally, Bank design was also commendable in that the Bank made clear up front,
beginning in PRSC 5, that weaker performance would have consequences in terms of reduced
levels of assistance, without prejudging performance under the subsequent operation.

Nonetheless, there were four weaknesses in program design that affect the ratings for quality of
entry. These were: (i) the unmanageable set of indictors and results framework for PRSC 5; (ii)
to a lesser extent, the reliance on sector performance reviews to assess progress; (iii) the
ambitious scope of the PRSCs; and (iv) the inadequate focus on addressing corruption as a cross-
cutting issue, rather than simply a sector issue. While the indicators and results framework was
driven by the Bank's desire to support the Government's ownership of the program by relying on
government systems and standards  as well as in response to pressure by the donors for greater
harmonization and ownership -- it was clear at the time that these indicators would not be suitable
for measuring performance in accordance with Bank assessment requirements, and the Bank
should have been more active in pointing out weaknesses in the results framework; notably, this
weakness in quality at entry was also not helped by a change in TTL at the time of PRSC 5
negotiation. Moreover, the Bank team was not well served by poor output by the initial
consultant brought in to streamline the PEAP matrix and create realistic outputs and indicators,
although the team overcame this shortfall, creating a credible matrix for PRSC 6 and 7.

With regard to the reliance on sector performance reviews to assess progress, the Bank should
also have been more assertive in pointing out the weakness of relying on an assessment of
"satisfactory performance" in the joint sector review process with participation by Government,
development partners and NGOs. These reviews were not particularly rigorous, and given the
size of the review process (more than 100 individuals were involved), the fact that Government
had a central role in assessing its own performance as well as the fact that significant amounts of
donor assistance were tied to the findings of these reviews, it was unlikely that anything other
than "satisfactory" progress would be found by these reviews. As a consequence, the sector
reviews did not provide satisfactory indication of progress in meeting prior actions. The use of
the sector review process was driven, however, by the Bank's commitment (under the previous
set of operations) to use national systems as much as possible, and the Bank did use the 2008 and
2009 PERs on education and health as realistic inputs into the policy dialogue.

Another weakness of program design was its ambitious scope across a wide range of sectors and
policy areas. While all the areas covered by the PRSCs are arguably important to poverty



                                                 43
Poverty Reduction Strategy Credits 5-7: Implementation Completion and Results Report


reduction and growth in Uganda  as well as integral to the PEAP  it made the PRSC operations
a complex program that probably exceeded the capacity and/or the commitment of the
Government, as well as making it difficult to monitor performance, and arguably should have
been fewer areas of reform and fewer prior actions.

With regard to procurement, the design of PRSC 7 can be faulted, however, with regard to the
drafting of the second tranche prior action regarding procurement. As noted, the original prior
action required that the draft revisions would be subject to review and comment by the Bank, not
simply submitted to Cabinet. During the negotiations the wording was revised, dropping the
requirement that the amendments be subject to Bank review, and simply requiring that the
amendments be submitted to Cabinet. As a consequence, there was no assurance of quality or
that best practice would be met, and for technical reasons the Bank had to go forward with the
second tranche of PRSC 7, even though the changes to the PPDA Act were not acceptable. This
was unfortunate, and more careful drafting of the prior action (or less optimism that the Cabinet
would not make changes to the Act), would not have effectively forced the Bank to reward poor
performance. Finally, the issue of corruption as a cross-cutting issue, rather than a sector issue,
was not adequately addressed by the Bank (or by the DPs in their joint assistance strategy). By
focusing on corruption as a sector issue (e.g., the well-known staff absenteeism in the health
sector), PRSC 5-7 did not recognize that it was an issue cutting across individual sectors where
the accountability system in public service had to be addressed.

While the results framework was subsequently improved for PRSC 6, given the weaknesses in
initial program design for PRSC 5 and the design problem with the prior action on amending the
procurement law under PRSC 7, Bank performance in ensuring quality of entry for this series of
operations is rated moderately unsatisfactory.

 (b) Quality of Supervision
(including M&E arrangements)

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Overall, coordination was good, and there was progress toward coordination of the major
development partners. The ICRs for PRSC 1-3 and PRSC 4 suggested increasing resident
technical expertise to provide support to the PEAP implementation. This recommendation was
incorporated under the second series of operations, as the Bank accordingly located the core task
management and sector specialists in the country office, enabling a year-round consultation with
the GoU and its DPs. Having made clear up front that weaker performance would have
consequences in terms of the level of assistance, disbursements were reduced accordingly under
all three operations. Moreover, the practice of using "two-pagers" to summarize background,
indicators actions and results for individual program components was effective and appreciated
by implementing agencies. It was a good vehicle with which to coordinate and keep track of the
many facets of the PRSC series.

The Bank showed an ability to learn as it went along and adapt the program accordingly. As
energy and roads constraints threatened to halt economic growth, the Bank showed flexibility and
reacted well to the urgent need to temporarily shift course; the Bank also conducted sector work
for the CEM which outlined how to address the constraints. The Bank could have proceeded on
the course envisioned at the outset of the next PRSC series, but appropriately advised a course
change before the constraints became more costly, and growth was maintained since the shift in
policy. Also, when adverse policy changes took place, such as the abolition of the main own
revenue source for local governments (the graduated tax) which weakened their financing base


                                                 44
Poverty Reduction Strategy Credits 5-7: Implementation Completion and Results Report


and local accountability links, the Bank ensured that the program included new measures that
partially counteracted the negative effects.

Despite the efforts to align the PRSC series with the Government budget cycle, this alignment
was not achieved until PRSC 7, and during the ICR mission, the GOU repeatedly expressed the
difficulties caused by this misalignment and that it was important to correct this problem in the
next series. This alignment was achieved, however, and the delay in alignment was not due to
program design or implementation but was the result of the Government's own action, primarily
delays in approving PRSC 7 and moving forward on procurement.

In the program documents, the Bank admirably did not shy away from addressing the issues of
governance and public management. With regard to procurement, the Bank made quite clear its
opposition to the problematic changes to the PPDA Act. However, it might have done better on
supervision in this area. The Bank was surprised by the Cabinet's changes to the PPDA Act,
despite the long period of time the Government spent drafting the changes (nine months) and the
delay (five months) before the Cabinet reviewed those changes. Given these long delays, the
Bank should have been following this issue more closely and might not have been caught
unaware by the strong opposition by some within the Government to strengthening the PPDA.

Still, it seems appropriate on balance to rate Bank supervision for PRSC 5, 6 and 7 as moderately
satisfactory.


(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Ratings: Moderately satisfactory

The Bank team worked diligently and contributed to a number of important achievements. Given
their wide-ranging and complex agenda, the PRSCs were not perfect in design or performance,
but the reform agenda largely moved forward on many fronts. Thus, the overall performance is
rated as moderately satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

In terms of putting together a meaningful and detailed program of activities, the GOU performed
well. Development of PEAP-3 was participatory, and there was strong ownership of the program
among government and civil society. The GoU rightly pushed for alignment with the budget
cycle and worked well with development partners, including the Bank. It also established a
process at individual line ministries to design and review progress in sector development plans.
The Government should also be commended for maintaining macroeconomic growth and stability,
particularly in the face of exogenous shocks. Credit to the private sector as a share of GDP rose
under PRSC 5-7, and private investment as a share of GDP also increased. PFM was
strengthened, LG procurement was aligned with that of the central government, and the CRB was
established. In addition, the pay reform strategy was developed and an exercise to clean the
payroll of ghost workers was implemented. Education targets were largely met, and the GoU
adopted an appropriate shift in priorities to energy and roads from the PEAP emphasis on service
delivery.

There were, however, a number of actions which undermined the Government's performance,
and reform implementation declined between PRSC 5 and PRSC 7, as shown by the increasingly
poor progress in meeting prior actions under each successive PRSC. In areas where Government
commitment was high  such as water -- there was satisfactory progress, but in some other areas
Government commitment appeared weaker. Despite the revision of the targets and indicators that
took place between PRSC 5 and PRSC 6, a number of the targets was still not achieved. The
Government consistently did not meet the prior action on limiting supplementary requests to
Parliament by the security and public administration sectors, notwithstanding the fact that it was
clear that such action would result in a reduction in funding from the Bank and DPs. The
continued creation of new districts has undermined the delivery of basic social services as well as
PRSC efforts to improve LG staffing capacity, while the elimination of the graduated tax has
further exacerbated LG's ability to provide such services, particularly in the context of high
administration burdens which consume a large and growing proportion of total expenditures.
Progress on procurement was problematic under PRSC 6 and slowed still further under PRSC 7.
Moreover, delays in submitting the PPDA Act to Cabinet weakened the predictability of
disbursements (under both PRSC 7 and the upcoming PRSC 8), and undermined the
Government's broader objective of strengthening harmonization and predictability. The erosion
in the quality of health services because of lack of resources is also contrary to the objectives of
the PRSC-supported program,

Government performance under these operations declined over the course of PRSC 5-7. It was
essentially fully satisfactory for PRSC 5, but declined under PRSC 6 and weakened still further
under PRSC 7. Consequently, Government performance on average overall is rated moderately
satisfactory.


(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating:
According to ICRR Guidelines, in cases "where the Government and the implementing agency
are indistinguishable, particularly for DPL operations, only an overall rating is necessary." As
the Office of the Prime Minister (OPM) led the implementation of the PRSC-supported


                                                 46

program, 40 there is no separate rating of the implementing agency, and the Overall Borrower
Performance is evaluated in Section (c) below.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

As overall borrower performance is rated based on the combined ratings of the Government's
performance and the Implementing Agency's performance. As these two are indistinguishable,
the ratings from Section 5.2(a) above are also the overall rating.

6. Lessons Learned
(both operation-specific and of wide general application)

There are a number of lessons learned from this series of operations. A number are specific to
this series of operations, while two relate more generally to Bank guidelines.

The lessons that are specific to this series of operations are:

1. The PRSCs are an excellent vehicle for dialogue, not only between the Government and
Development Partners, but also between the Ministries. This is a well-known benefit of
PRSCs, but it bears repeating. The ministries reported widely that the PRSC series created a
valuable forum to discuss cross-cutting issues such as issues related to public service reform and
decentralization. The ministries also expressed that their cases could be better heard in inter-
ministerial, multi-donor settings. As noted, some of the most significant outcomes achieved
under PRSC 5-7 (e.g., in agriculture and education) occurred as a result of the policy dialogue
process.

2. Indicators that are only partly SMART are not much use in measuring results. In the
PRSC series, most of the indicators missed some element of the SMART criteria, all of which are
critical for indicators to be useful. For example, if an indicator is attributable, but not time-bound,
then it cannot be useful to measure results of a program. Conversely, an indicator may be time-
bound, but too general to be attributable to the activity whose results are being measured. While
the indicators for PRSC 5-7 were driven by the Government's results framework and Bank's
desire to foster ownership, the Bank should have recognized that these were not suitable for the
Bank's goal of measuring results.

3. A more systematic response mechanism needs to be devised to deal with cases of partial
or late implementation if alignment to the budget cycle is to be achieved. PRSC 7 was
modified in a rather ad hoc way and was split into two tranches in order to reward
implementation of many of the triggers, but also to allow additional time to fulfill the remaining
conditions in the area of procurement. It turned out to be the wrong decision in hindsight because
the implementation was at odds with the spirit of procurement reform. A systematic response
mechanism that includes a reduction in funds might also take into account the impact on the
"non-offending" sectors.

4. Triggers that refer to satisfactory implementation of sector strategies are difficult to
track effectively to determine whether to proceed to the next operation. While such triggers

allowed the PRSC-supported program to expand its coverage and rely more directly on GOU-
developed strategies, they made tracking of the activities more challenging. The process that was
established for determining whether sector progress was satisfactory was too subjective and often
did not sufficiently closely relate to the specific underlying measures on which the Bank was
focusing. The inherent bias of the process was shown by the predictable dynamic where the
government was usually on the side of a satisfactory rating of progress, while the donors on the
other were arguing for a less than satisfactory rating.

5. Democracy complicates the reform environment. As Uganda has moved towards multi-
party government, the influence of civil service technocrats has declined as Parliament has
become more active and as reform implementation is increasingly subject to political calculation.
While the move to increased democratization is a welcome development, it can potentially slow
the pace of reform and indicates that donors may need to be less ambitious with the pace and
scope of reform progress.

6. Poverty reduction is a complex effort with many overlapping and interdependent
elements. The PRSCs have been a good mechanism for addressing poverty reduction in many
countries by focusing on reform actions across a variety of areas. Uganda is making good
progress in reducing income poverty, although challenges remain. However, another critical
element of poverty reduction is improving people's lives in basic areas such as health and
education through the better provision of services. If service delivery is compromised or
undermined by government action it calls into question whether programs are too diffuse in their
focus and whether the agenda should be more focused on those areas supportive to service
delivery.

7. While broad, "Christmas tree"-type policy operations are valuable at capturing a wide
variety of needed initiatives, they do come at a cost. PRSC 5-7 were clearly this type of
complex program, and one disadvantage thereof is that the lagging parts of the program tend to
get an inordinate amount of attention and may hold up and even damage other activities that
might otherwise perform better and move faster. The entire operation lost resources because of
weak implementation in a few areas. Accordingly, a tighter focus may lead to more meaningful
and deeper implementation and greater reform sustainability. This assumes, however, that reform
is taking place in a robust and favorable policy environment.         In a deteriorating policy
environment, however, a wide-ranging program with a significant number of prior actions can
serve to preserve (and build on) reforms that have been previously undertaken, and provide a
significant number of gauges measuring the Government's overall commitment to reform.

8. Development is a complicated task and many issues (such as procurement) are
particularly difficult. Nonetheless, there is frequently a concern that a policy operation that
"takes its time" and which needs to advance incrementally may be viewed internally by the Bank
as simply repeating actions of the prior credit. One solution might be that gradations should be
better specified and nuanced, and actions and targets better calibrated, so that it will be clear that
the policy agenda is moving forward while also moving at a rate where there is sustained
government ownership and an actual ingraining of the policy reform. At the same time, the Bank
may also need to better temper its ambitions about the pace and scope of reform that can
realistically be achieved each year, recognizing that many reforms will be incremental, rather
than substantial.

The lessons that are Bank-specific are:

1. There is an inherent and internal contradiction between Bank objectives for DPLs. The Bank
prizes ownership, which means that PRSC program targets should be closely aligned with
Government poverty reduction programs and indicators. Yet the Bank also prides itself as an
objectives and measurement oriented institution. This leads to a conflict in that the objectives of
the borrower's program may not be properly correlated with outcomes and indicators that are
measurable, yet the ultimate assessment of those operations is supposed to take place in
accordance with those indicators. Additional guidance from the Bank on this issue would be
helpful for both country teams and ICR assessors.

2. Finally, the quality of national M&E frameworks supporting poverty reduction efforts (and by
extension, PRSCs) tends to be very weak. Yet the Bank chooses to evaluate the success of its
programs in accordance with those frameworks. In order to reconcile the objective of ownership
with the objective of measurement, the Bank must provide more effective assistance to
Governments to support the design, implementation, and utilization of findings from those M&E
efforts.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION AND RESULTS REVIEW OF PRSC 5-7
REPORT

1.0.    Background:

1.1     Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) is a World Bank financial
              instrument used for budget support operations in the
        implementation of     Government Poverty reduction strategies.
        Uganda pioneered the use of budget support operations known as
        Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs) in the World Bank.

1.2     The 1st PRSC for Uganda was approved by the World Bank in May
        2001, the 2nd PRSC in July 2002, the 3rd PRSC in September, 2003
        and the 4th PRSC in July, 2004. The size of each of the four credits
        was US$ 150 million. The four PRCSs selectively supported
        Government's Poverty Eradication Action Plan (PEAP) which was
        prepared in 1997 as the over-arching document setting out
        Government poverty reduction strategy. This document was
        subsequently reviewed in 2000, with far broader consultation,
        including a participatory poverty assessment to ascertain the views
        of the poor themselves. The PEAP was built around the 4 Pillars
        namely:

        (i)     Economic growth and transformation

        (ii)    Good Governance and Security

        (iii)   Increasing the ability of the poor to raise incomes

        (iv)    Increasing the quality of life of the poor.


1.3     PRSCs were designed to do programmatic lending to support policy
        and institutional reforms that support the achievement of the
        country's Poverty Reduction Strategy, usually presented in the
        form of a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). The PRSCs
        have been designed as a series of annual credits supporting a
        three-year rolling program of reforms.

1.4     The specific objectives of the Uganda PRSCs are to:

        Improve public service delivery



                                                 55

        Strengthen government processes and systems, while avoiding
        parallel donor systems

        Improve predictability of resource flows, and

        Reduce transaction costs of aid delivery, as compared to
        transferring a similar level of resources through a series of project.

2.0.    The 3 year (2004/05  2006/07) PRSC Reform Programme

        During the PRSC 4, a rolling three year PRSC reform programme
        was established. The PRSC 5-7 series was planned to support the
        implementation of Uganda's 3rd PEAP.

        The PRSC 5, 6 and 7 was intended to support the following four
        Pillars (1, 2, 4 and 5) of the 5 Pillars of Uganda's 3rd PEAP:
        - Economic management to maintain macro economic stability

        -   Enhance production, competitiveness and incomes

        -   Strengthen legal and justice systems, public sector
            management and accountability to improve good governance

        -   Extend the earlier focus on health, education and water sector
            programmes.

2.1 Economic Management

During this period, the economic growth performance remained strong
due to sound macro-economic management. In FY 2006/07 the economy
grew at 6.7%, one percent higher than the FY 2005/06 and slightly off
the expected target of 7% p.a.

The government continued with its sound macro economic policies aimed
at poverty reduction. Despite the challenges of high population growth,
the economy registered positive trend in growth. PEAP targets were met
and impressive with average growth over the period 2004/05- 2006/07
at 8.1% per annum; a 15% increase above the target of 7%. There was an
increase in investment to about 23.3% of GDP in 2007/2008. However,
this increase in aggregate ratio has been driven by a rise in private but
not public investment.

Inflation was contained at low level, at about 5%, albeit with periodic
fluctuations arising from variations in agricultural production and
international oil prices.     In 2006/07 FY, headline inflation rose
moderately to 6.8% and underlying inflation to 7.8%, as a combination of
higher world oil prices and domestic general price levels.

A competitive exchange rate to support export growth was maintained
in most part of the period. Appreciation pressures were experienced in
2007 resulting in the appreciation of exchange rate from Shs. 1,900/= to
1,600/= per dollar but with the intervention of the Bank of Uganda the
exchange rate depreciated again to Shs. 1,950/= per dollar.

The adoption of flexible exchange rate prevented fluctuations in export
earnings and aid inflows from having significant effects on domestic
money supply. There was little change in the interest rate received by
bank lenders, so private investment was not left out. The PEAP was more
focused on cumulative impact of the reforms introduced before PEAP
such as low inflation, competitive exchange rate, privatisation and
market liberalisation which were maintained under PEAP and as it
turned out these were responsible for the rise in private investment.

2.2 Production, Competitiveness and Incomes

The Plan for Modernization of Agriculture (PMA) and the Medium Term
Competitiveness strategy were the key policy instruments for delivering
the 2nd Pillar of the PEAP.
The focus was to enhance agriculture and rural development and create
a favourable environment that supports Private Sector growth and
development. Implementation of PMA was partial, focusing on its first
two pillars, research and extension. PRSC support focused largely on
institutional development which helped to generate a wide range of new
technologies in crops, livestock and fisheries. In addition, through
NAADS, a nationwide system to transfer technology to farmers at all
levels was put in place.
However, in spite of this effort, agriculture growth continues to lag
behind the growth of the economy. The sector is subject to price and
weather shocks and fluctuations in agriculture induce similar fluctuation
in the overall economy. Most of the agriculture continues to be for
subsistence with limited market surpluses, with exception of coffee, tea
and cotton which account for about 9% of the value added agriculture.
Generally, the impact of NARO and NAADS on transformation of
traditional agriculture, including productivity increases, remains
undefined.
The percentage of households below the poverty line is lowest among
those engaged in crop farming. The decline in the percentage of
households below the poverty line was highest for those engaged in non-
crop agriculture (livestock, fisheries and forestry etc.). Since the majority
of Ugandan smallholders are engaged in crop farming, the limited decline
in the percentage of households below the poverty line in the crop
subsector may reflect the perceived slow rate of growth of the agricultural
sector.

Poverty Reduction Strategy Credits 5-7: Implementation Completion and Results Report


Hence, the World Bank support for improving the income of the poor
through agriculture productivity remains unclear. Support was too heavy
on institutional building with limited evidence on the realization of
poverty reducing objectives.

Improving Business environment:

PRSC support improved private sector development by reducing
administrative constraints to doing business.
For example, although financial intermediation and interest rates remain
high, credit grew fast, leading to substantial financial intermediation.
However, availability of long term financing remains limited, and reform
in pension system is still behind schedule.
On transport, there were substantial improvements in road network
through repair and maintenance, although the cost of transportation
continued to be a major constraint to business.

On energy development, the country experienced acute shortage in
supply of electricity resulting in load shedding. The slow economic
growth during the PRSC 5, 6 and 7 is partly attributed to the energy
crisis the country experienced during the period. Although there have
been efforts to generate more electricity through thermal, the sector is
encumbered by the high cost of power generated and inefficiencies in the
system which continued to impact on tariffs.
Overall, Uganda has not made any major gains in improving business
environment since 2000. The Institutional Investor Country Credit
rating showed marginal improvement. The political Risk Rating and the
Doing Business Ranking placed Uganda at 118 of 178 in 2006. The
worst rankings were on registering property at 163 and getting credit at
158. Protecting investors at 122 and starting business at 114 ranked
around the average. Therefore, based on the Country's performance, any
support for the regulatory environment has not led to substantial
reductions in the cost of doing business in Uganda.

2.3 Governance objectives:

The PRSCs provided the framework for addressing cross-cutting Public
Sector Management reforms targeted at increasing accountability,
reducing corruption and thereby improving public service delivery. The
efforts also focused on the reform of Public Procurement, Public Sector
pay, personnel management and accountability and implementation of
results-based management in Public Service.
Although accountability has improved, it has not significantly reduced
the perception of corruption and the effectiveness of Government is
perceived not to have improved. The WBIs control of corruption indicator
had Uganda still ranked at 147 out 201 in 2006.


                                                 58
Poverty Reduction Strategy Credits 5-7: Implementation Completion and Results Report


Implementation of results-based management was limited by capacities
in MDAs to institutionalize results-based approach to public service
management. Hence use of PRSC does not seem to have facilitated
Governance reform. The direct links between the Bank support and the
outcomes were not clear.

2.4 Human Development

The evidence generally show that the general budget support operations,
including the PRSCs contributed to a major expansion of basic service
delivery at sub- national level in education, health and water and
sanitation.
The expansion was largely pro-poor and equitable; although it was offset
by weak service quality and limited impact on important outcome
indicators.

Education

The PRSC proved beneficial in education, especially in supporting
teacher recruitment, classroom construction and text book publishing
and distribution, all of which have impacted on the improvement of
access and quality of education.
Results on learning outcomes were mixed:
Proficient in literacy at P3 improved from 39% in 2005 to 48% in 2007,
while at P6 it improved from 30% to 49%. Proficient in numeracy
stagnated at 45% at P3 but improved at P6 from 33 to 41%. However,
dropout rate and repetition rate remained a huge challenge.

Health

Overall results of the health sector were not encouraging. Drug stock
outs continued to be the norm, staffing of health centres stagnated at an
insufficient level, HIV prevalence rate showed signs of increasing from
6.2% to 6.4% in 2006/07, and coverage of immunization dropped from
89% in 2004/05 to 82% in 2006/07. There was also lack of impact of
health services expansion on key outcome indicators, in particular
maternal mortality and associated factors such as total fertility rate and
family planning uptake.

Water and Sanitation:

With respect to water and sanitation, both rural and urban access to safe
water showed major improvements. However, there was lack of progress
in sanitation provision and hygiene mitigation which had negative effect
on child and maternal mortality.



                                                 59

Nevertheless, the PRSC support contributed improved access and
equitable coverage in health, education and water supply and sanitation.
The key concerns are quality of services and weak role played by the
PRSCs as the instrument of delivery.

3.0        Lessons Learnt

    i.       The PRSC 5-7 was not well integrated with Government
             coordination systems, in particular, the Institutional
             Framework for Coordinating and Monitoring of Policy and
             Programme Implementation in Government. This coordination
             mechanism would have greatly improved dialogue between
             technocrats and the political leadership.

    ii.      In PRSC 5-7 the identification, appraisal and pre-appraisal
             meetings would be scheduled at a short notice unlike the PRSC
             3 and 4 which had a calendar that was followed and made
             planning easier.

    iii.     PRSC was focusing mainly on implementation of prior actions
             irrespective of whether outcome indicators were being achieved.
             This was partly because in PRSC outcome indicator targets
             were not developed unlike the JBSF with indicator targets and
             actions.

    iv.      There was less interaction with sectors and Development
