I. THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR
A. Economic Setting
1.01      Honduras is one of the poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere
with a per capita income of US$565 in 1980. Although the population density
of 30 per square kilometer is low, the population is growing at a rapid
rate of 3.4% per year. A large number of the 3.7 million Hondurans live in
poverty, particularly in rural areas, and about one-half of the population is
without safe water and three-quarters without electricity. The adult literacy
rate is 57%. The economy is still based predominantly on agriculture and
forestry, which contribute one-third of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and four-
fifths of exports, and provide two-thirds of the employment. The country's
extensive pine forests, which are the largest in Central America, are one of
its most important resources, but the lax control of their exploitation has
resulted in some depletion of these resources.
1.02      The long-term growth of the economy has been slower than in other
Central American countries. However, while the Honduran real GDP growth of
3.7% annually 1/ during 1950-75 was inadequate to substantially raise the
living standards, it has shown a remarkable growth rate in the last few years,
reaching 7.7% p.a. during the 1976-79 period. The most important growth
factors were exports and investment; the former resulted mainly from the
recovery of banana production after the 1974 hurricane and an increase in the
value of coffee exports, and the latter from rapid expansion of private
investment, and the large and aggressive government development and investment
programs, which laid the basis for much improved longer term growth prospects.
1.03      In 1980, however, the Honduran economy slowed down.  Real GDP growth
is estimated at 2.5% a year because real exports and investment lost their
dynamism. Transitory difficulties with banana production, a slower expansion
of coffee production, and a continued decline of lumber exports explain the
deceleration of the growth rate. Private investment was adversely affected by
political events in Nicaragua and El Salvador, high interest rates abroad,
and tight credit. The consumer price index rose at an annual rate of 18.8%,
compared to 8.8% in the previous year, with above average increases in the
price of beans and corn, which are the basic foods of the poor. The sharp
acceleration of inflation eroded real wages, in spite of a 1980 increase in
the minimum wage and general wage increases. In addition, the current account
of the balance of payments 2/ showed a deficit of over US$300.0 million in
1980, or 12% of GDP. Import growth significantly exceeded export growth,
mostly due to a 55% increase in the value of imported oil and large imports
of capital goods. Net official foreign exchange reserves declined by about
US$60.0 million to US$110.0 million (about one month of imports CIF), in spite
of large inflows of foreign official capital.
l/   This was only slightly above the 2.7% rate of population growth in the
1950-75 period.
2/   The balance of payments position of Honduras traditionally depends
on the exports of a few commodities (bananas, coffee, lumber, beef,
sugar). Recently, coffee exports have become as important as bananas,
and the share of total exports represented by bananas has dropped
from 75% in 1950 to 25% in 1980.



1.04      The government's financial position also deteriorated in 1980.
Current expenditures of the central government increased by about 30%, effec-
tively offsetting the revenue impact of a 1979 tax reform. Furthermore, some
public enterprises confronted serious financial difficulties, because they
followed lax wage and expenditure policies, failed to take appropriate tariff
or price actions, and/or became involved in unprofitable activities. These
difficulties created additional financial pressures on the central government
in 1980, which are expected to continue in 1981. Weak public finances brought
about a large increase in the use of domestic credit by the public sector
and a tightening of credit to the private sector.
1.05      In the next few years the government is likely to continue its
aggressive development policies and programs, and a relatively favorable
growth scenario is possible for the 1980s. Although the outlook for 1981-82
is less optimistic, real GDP growth could be about 4-5% a year during 1981-85.
The government-s strategy is to support both industrial and agricultural
growth with large infrastructure investments and expanded credit availability,
and accelerate the implementation of social projects. However, for these
plans to be implemented, the government needs to strengthen the financial
position of the public sector and restore private sector confidence. In April
1981, the government took measures to improve its finances by increasing sales
and import taxes. In addition, the government plans, under the renewed
Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangement with the IMF, to restrict current
expenditure growth, improve tax administration, raise rates for services of
public enterprises, reduce the size of the overall public sector deficit, and
reduce Central Bank (BCH) credit to the government. Furthermore, BCH freed
interest rates on savings deposits (the only deposit interest rate which
remained fixed), and provided commercial banks with adequate spreads for
loans financed with foreign credit.
B. Main Features and Structure
Industrial Growth and Structure
1.06      Manufacturing accounted for about 17% of GDP at factor cost
and employed about 12% of the working force in 1979. Moreover, it expanded
rapidly, averaging 9.6% annually during 1975-79, which sharply contrasted with
the slow real growth (3% per year) of the 1960-75 period. During the 1960s,
import-based industries (including some new industries producing detergents,
cosmetics, metal products and plastic) developed at a faster rate than the
local input-based industries. However, this trend did not continue into the
1970s, and traditional consumer goods industries, such as food products,
beverages, tobacco, footwear and apparel, and intermediate goods, such as
lumber and cardboard boxes, are now leading industrial growth. The production
of heavy intermediate and capital goods remains minimal (Annex 4, Table 1).
1.07      During the 1960s, industrial value-added grew by only 3.8% a year,
at approximately the GDP growth rate. This resulted from the small size of
the domestic market, lack of infrastructure, and the inability of domestic
firms to take full advantage of the opportunities offered by the creation in
1961 of the Central American Common Market (CACM). While CACM intra-regional



-3-
trade, the bulk of which was in manufactured products, increased rapidly from
US$30.0 million in 1960 to US$252.0 million in 1968, Honduran exports to the
CACM only grew from US$8.0 million to US$30.0 million, and the Honduran share
of intra-regional trade dropped from 27% to 12%. Honduras withdrew from the
CACM following the conflict with El Salvador in 1969, and in 1973 signed
bilateral agreements with each CACM country, except El Salvador. The bilateral
agreements, which provided for partial restoration of free trade along CACM
lines, have offered certain advantages to Honduras, which was permitted to
charge tariffs on some manufacturing goods from CACM countries.
1.08      Reduced competition from other CACM imports coupled with the renewed
granting of industrial investment incentives, which triggered a process of
modernization and expansion of industrial capacity, led to faster industrial
growth (6% p.a. in value added during 1970-74 and 9% p.a. during 1975-79).
This growth rate, however, decreased to about 6% during 1979-80 because of
political uncertainties in the region. In spite of the advances of the 1970s,
Honduran industry is still at a relatively early stage of development.
Traditional consumer goods account for a large share of value added (55% in
1960 and 64% in 1980), but some consumer durables products are being manufac-
tured. Capital goods still contribute minimally to industrial value added.
Industrial Imports and Exports
1.09      With its relatively small industrial base and small domestic market,
Honduras has to import a wide range of manufactured products for which local
production would not be economic. In 1960, approximately 41% 1/ of the
domestic demand for manufactures was met by imports, with consumer goods,
intermediate goods, and capital goods and transport equipment, representing
each about one-third of total manufactured imports. By 1980 consumer goods
imports represented about 17% of manufactured imports, intermediate goods 40%
and capital goods and transport equipment 43% (Annex 4, Table 2). Although
Honduras was succesful in substituting some imports of consumer goods, the
shift in relative shares is explained also by the increased value of inputs of
intermediate products, which resulted from the sharp increase in petroleum
prices, and by the large increase in capital goods imports associated with the
rapid expansion of private and public investment during 1976-79.
1.10      Manufactured exports (which include processed agricultural products)
in constant 1966 lempiras, grew at an average annual rate of 13.6% p.a.
between 1960 and 1970, at 14.6% between 1970 and 1974, and at 13.3% between
1975 and 1979. During the 1970s, the proportion of consumer goods exports
in total manufactured exports (mostly processed foods, and in particular
processed meats, sea foods and refined sugar) increased significantly. On the
other hand, the share of intermediate wood products (particularly sawmill
products) dropped from 42% in 1970-74 to 29% in 1975-79. This downward trend
continued in 1980 when intermediate wood products represented only 18% of
1/   This ratio increased to about 55% during 1970-1980 as a result of
large growth in domestic demand for intermediate and capital goods and
for consumer durables not manufactured in Honduras.



-4-
total manufactured exports (Annex 4, Table 3). With the completion of two
large government-owrned sawmills in the Olancho area during 1982-1984, however,
this trend should be reversed.
lo1L       The proportion of manufactured exports in domestic manufacturing
productioni increased from about 10% in 1960 to about 27% average during
1970-74, and again to an average of about 38% during 1975-79. As a result,
the trade deficit for traditional manufactured consumer goods decreased
significantly during the period and became a surplus in 1980 mainly because
of increases in exports of processed foods.
1.12       The proportion of HonduranL manufactured exports to other CACM
countries remained approximately constant, at about 25%, during the 1960s.
However, following the withdrawal from the CACM in 1969, the proportion of
Honduran manufactured exports to CACM averaged less than 5% between 1970 and
1974. After 1974, the first year in which the bilateral agreements with
Nicaragua, Guatemala and Costa Rica became fully operational, manufactured
exports to the CACM increased substantially, to over 20% in 1976-79. In
addition, a major structural transformation has taken place. Once a major
supplier of agricultural products to the rest of the region, Honduras slowly
became an exporter of manufactured products, which by 1979 represented over
80% of Honduran exports to the CACM. Currently, however, Honduras is facing
difficulties to export to some CACM countries because of their economic and
political situation.
ManufacuigEpomn
1.13       Structure,  Employment grew faster than the Honduras population
growth rate between 1960 and 1980. During 1960-1970, employment in firms with
five or more employees (the factory sector) increased from 14,900 in 1960 (or
2.8% of the total labor force) to 25,500 in 1970 (or 3.6% of the labor force),
equivalent to a growth rate of about 5.5% p.a. However, employment in firms
with less than 5 workers grew at an annual rate of only 3.5%; as a result, the
overall manufacturing employment grew by about 4.3% a year, somewhat above the
country's population growth rate. During 1970-1980, employment in firms with
five or more employees increased more rapidly than in the previous decade,
with employment growth averaging 7e3% a year.  As a result, total employment
in these firms doubled to about 51,600, or about 5% of the total labor force.
Growth in employment in firms with less than 5 workers, however, continued to
be slower (4.3% per annum), so that the overall growth rate of employment
averaged about 5.6% a year, which is significantly above the country's popula-
tion growth rate.
1.14       The subsectoral composition of factory employment changed somewhat
during the 1960s and early 1970s, reflecting the shifts in industrial
production. Based on the latest industrial survey, which was taken in 1975,
the categories which contributed the most to employment were: food processing,
beverage and tobacco (35.0%); wood and paper products (19.1%); and textiles,
clothing and leather (16.9%). Approximately 52% of all manufacturing employ-
ment creation took place in large faLctories with over 100 workers, which are
large for Honduras, compared with only 30% of employment creation which took
place in factories with less than 50 employees.



1.15      Labor Force Training.  Compared to the other CACM countries, the
labor force in Honduras is less skilled, partly because the adult literacy
rate is only 57%, but also because vocational training systems, despite the
program being undertaken by the National Institute for Vocational Training
(INFOP) (para. 1.16), are not highly developed. On the other hand, wages in
Honduras are low relative to its major trading partners (Table 1.1). These
relatively low labor costs, coupled with political stability in the last few
years and comparatively good management-labor relations, help to keep Honduras
reasonably competitive in the CACM context, and may be a key consideration for
promoting manufactured exports to third market countries.

1.16      Formal technical training in the manufacturing sector is carried
out by INFOP, while some informal training is provided by several secondary
vocational schools. The Bank has been instrumental in assisting Honduras to
develop its vocational training system through INFOP. Under the First Education
Project (Loan 954/Cr.452-HO) approved in December 1973, two vocational training
centers were built and equipped in Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula. The basic
objective of the two vocational training centers is to complement the skill
training program of INFOP with major emphasis on the industrial sector. The
training centers offer courses at apprenticeship, basic skill and skill
upgrading levels, as well as in-plant training. Additionally, to promote
in-plant training, the Tegucigalpa center identifies training needs, plans and
implements the programs, institutes certification techniques and establishes a
placement service. INFOP's annual output in these centers has increased from
333 graduates in 1973 to 8,548 in 1979, of which about 60% represented in-plant
training graduates.
Size and Distribution of Enterprises
1.17      Most industrial enterprises are relatively small.  The 1975 indus-
trial census lists 849 firms with more than 5 employees (the factory sector),
which generated about 80% of total manufacturing value-added and employed
37,000 workers. Out of the 849 firms in the factory sector, about 10% had
more than 100 employees, accounted for 54% of output, and 52% of factory
employment (Table 1.2). An additional 34% of the firms provided 40% of the
output and contributed 35% of employment. The remaining 56% of the firms
accounted for just 6% of the output, but contributed 13% of employment. Total
fixed assets per firm for the latter group is less than US$50,000. The
proposed loan contains features to ensure that these firms would be benefited
by the project (paras. 3.38 and 4.02).

1.18      Of the 849 firms with 5 or more employees, 56% had less than
20 employees, and about 90% had less than 100; almost two-thirds were family-
owned and only 20% were incorporated. Most of these firms were located in the
country's two largest cities, Tegucigalpa (32%) and San Pedro Sula (39%).
Artisan and very small enterprises (employing less than 5 workers each) con-
tributed US$25.0 million to total manufacturing value-added. Although they
employed some 37,000 workers, a large proportion of them worked in family
concerns without formal remuneration.
1.19      A significant modernization of productive capacity and the establish-
ment of larger and more efficient factories took place in the 1960s and 1970s,
which resulted in a reduction of the share of firms with less than five
employees in manufacturing value-added from 42% to 20% between 1960 and 1975.
These trends have been accompanied by significant rises in labor productivity
in the food, beverages, tobacco, textiles, and clothing subsectors, where a
six-fold increase in value-added has been achieved with only a doubling of the
work force. This trend towards larger factories and higher productivity is
partly a consequence of diversification into more capital intensive products
and the growth of export-oriented industries, such as meat packing, sugar, and
textiles, which have to be quite large in order to be competitive. Neverthe-
less, the average capital intensity of the Honduran factory sector (capital
per worker ratio of US$7,500 equivalent in 1975) is low by Latin American
standards. Data on 210 firms covered by the Central American Agreement on
Fiscal Incentives, representing over 60% of industrial value added, show little
change in the composition of the industrial sector in 1977 compared to the
1975 industrial census. Approximately 39% of all enterprises had net worths
of less than US$200,000, and only 29% had net worths of over US$800,000
(Table 1.3).

C. Industrial Policy
Industrial Development SSrLtgye
1.20      The National Planning Council (CONSUPLANE), in consultation with the
Ministry of Economy and the Central Bank, has prepared an Economic Development
Plan for 1979-83. This plan, which aims at maintaining a fairly high rate of
economic expansion coupled with an improved balance of payments performance
and a better distribution of economic benefits to the poorer groups of the
population, envisages continuing heavy public investment in infrastructure and
in the social sectors while giving more emphasis to rapid yielding investment
projects in the productive sectors. Industry has been assigned a leading role
in achieving rapid growth of value added, exports, and employment. These
overall objectives are still maintained in the updated 1981-82 program.
121      The primary targets established in the 1979-83 Economic Development
Plan for industry are: (i) real growth in industrial value added of 9% p.a.,
whereby industry would increase its contribution to GDP from about 17% in 1977
to 19% in 1983; (ii) manufactured exports growing by 15% p.a. in current US
dollars with the proportion of domestic value-added in exports progressively
increasing; and (iii) more rapid development of labor-intensive small- and
medium-sized enterprises. To achieve these targets the plan envisages: (i) a
more selective import-substitution strategy focusing on efficient industries
in the intermediate goods and metal working fields; (ii) increased promotion
of exports outside the CACM; (iii) promotion of industries in which Honduras
has a comparative advantage, in particular those which use raw materials from
forestry and agriculture; and (iv) increased credit and technical assistance
to small- and medium-sized industry (SMI). The latter objective would receive
special emphasis under the proposed loan.
1.22      A law to promote the development of small-scale and artisan industry,
which was enacted in 1978, extended to small enterprises the benefits of the
industrial incentive legislation, and confirmed the government's intention to
provide financial and technical assistance to the sector. Subsequently, the
government has upgraded its Centro de Desarrollo Industrial (CDI), which has
been providing technical assistance largely to artisans, in order to enable
CDI to provide such services to small-scale enterprises (SSEs) in the future.
The First Industrial Credit Project provided financial and technical assistance
to a number of SSE's through CDI and some commercial banks (paras. 3.20 and 3.31).
Industrial Incentives
1.23      By far, the most important policies affecting the manufacturing
sector since 1960 have been those determined by Honduras participation in the
CACM. The main policy instruments have been the Central American Agreement
on Fiscal Incentives to Industrial Development (CAAFIID) and the Common
External Tariff (CET). Both of these instruments were designed to support a
strategy of regional import substitution within the CACM.  After its withdrawal
from the CACM in 1970, Honduras reduced or cancelled some of the investment
incentives, but they were largely restored after Honduras signed bilateral
agreements with all CACM countries except El Salvador. Under the CAAFIID,
which superseded industrial incentive legislation enacted separately by the



CACM countries shortly before 1960, qualifying industrial firms were granted
exemptions for up to 10 years from income taxes and from tariffs on imported
equipment and raw materials and other inputs.
1.24      Maximum benefits were provided to Group A companies that produce
industrial inputs and capital goods, as well as consumer goods industries that
use raw materials and intermediate products, at least 50% of which are of
Central American origin. Lesser benefits were provided to Group B companies
producing high domestic value added products, but depending to a significant
extent on imported inputs. Lowest benefits comprising a 3-year exemption from
tariffs on imported equipment and raw materials, were provided for Group C
companies, which are those not qualifying as Group A or B but judged to be
economically desirable in view of their domestic value added, balance of
payments and employment impacts. Various modifications have been made to the
incentive package during the 1960s and 1970s, but the basic characteristics
remain the same.
1.25      While the effect of the incentives program in encouraging industrial
investment has been important overall, there appears to be a growing consensus
among CACM countries that in addition to the high cost of the present fiscal
incentive system (much of the investment would very likely have taken place
anyway), there are basic weaknesses with this approach to industrial develop-
ment. 1/ The Bank's 1980 study 2/ of industrial development policies in the
CACM, highlighted the following weaknesses: (i) the incentive system has
tended to encourage investment in industries not appropriate to the resource
endowment of the region, with low value added and high import and capital
intensity; (ii) the basic operational characteristics of the systel, a contract
providing tariff exonerations on imported inputs to a specific firm for a
fixed period of time while its output is protected from external competition,
does not encourage the establishment of industries with long-term economic
viability; (iii) vested interests are created to find means to perpetuate
these diseconomies, as can be seen from the experience with the numerous
extensions of exonerations. Under the proposed project, the subproject review
process would pay particular attention to the economic efficiency of invest-
ments contemplated, regardless of the incentives they might receive.
Tariff Policy and Protection
1.26      Tariff policy in Honduras is closely related to liberalization
of intra-regional trade and the establishment of the Common External Tariff
(CET). With the exception of certain agricultural products and some consumer
durables, all of the CACM imports from outside the area are included under the
CET. The tariff for each item has two parts, one ad valorem and the other
specific by unit of measurement; while the full ad valorem equivalent of the
1/   While this problem is recognized in Honduras, pending a revision of
the regional system, the authorities have been reluctant to take
action because of strong competition for investment by the other
CACM member countries.

on the Common Market," dated September 29, 1980.



- L0 -
tariff is related to actual price levels, recent inflation has probably
substantially reduced the overall tariff system impact since the second compo-
nent of the tariff has not been adjusted. The CET followed the basic structure
of national tariffs in the region with higher nominal protection for final
consumer goods than for capital and intermediate goods.
1.27      Although nominal tariffs for industrial inputs vary substantially
between products, with subsector averages ranging from 10% to 150%, average
tariffs for most subsectors are below the 35% level. The average nominal
protection rate 1/ of about 22% (weighted by the gross value of domestic
production by subsectors) in Honduras is quite low, and somewhat lower than
those of the other CACM countries. Effective protection rates are somewhat
higher, particularly for those subsectors with high nominal rates of protection
(i.e. luxury items, processed agricultural products, seafood, wood products,
clothing, textiles, soaps and detergents). However, most of these same
subsectors are responsible for much of the increase in manufactured exports
(para. 1.10), indicating that available protection has not been utilized in
many instances. With some exceptions Honduras' tariff structure has not
encouraged production of goods on an uneconomic scale and at prices which are
substantially above international levels. The bulk of industry is still based
on the processing of local inputs, some of which are exported in the world
market, and competition within the region and the restricted purchasing power
in the domestic market have largely prevented industry from taking undue
advantage of protection levels.
Export Promotion
1.28      The bias towards regional import substitution in the CACM trade
policy is one of the most important constraints on the growth of industrial
exports outside the area. The structure of CET, combined with the granting
of duty exonerations under the industrial incentive agreement, has resulted
in a pattern of protection which is excessive for traditional consumer product
industries and discriminates against those producing intermediate and export
goods. Thus, traditional industries (such as textiles, clothing, shoes and
leather) recorded substantial output increases in the first years of the CACM
development, but did not establish external export markets during this time.
1.29      This emphasis on import substitution, while valid in the initial
stage of industrial development in the region, has encouraged individual
enterprises to produce a broad range of products in accordance with regional
demand patterns, rather than a few items, which could be produced in large
amounts and thus be competitive in the international markets. In addition,
an important consequence of the emphasis on import substitution has been the
lack of export marketing skills, necessary for export promotion. While there
has been a recent mood of protectionism in the industrialized countries, there
1/   In April 1981, the Government (for fiscal purposes) raised import tariffs
by 5% of CIF prices for most intermediate and capital goods and 10% for
consumer products, including goods from CACM countries with which
Honduras has bilateral trade agreements.



- 11 -
has been also a growth in their imports of consumer goods. Honduras and the
remaining CACM countries have not participated in this growth to the extent
possible under their current conditions of production. Moreover, there
appears to be considerable scope for the CACM countries to penetrate into
international markets even where quotas are imposed.
1.30       Even during the period of maximum intra-regional trade expansion in
the early 1960s, various CACM officials had recognized the need for broad
export development strategies. However, partly as a result of the post-1969
CACM difficulties, a program for formulating a common regional export incentive
policy was discontinued and it was decided to leave these programs to national
initiatives. At present, all countries except Honduras have established
export promotion agencies to assist exporters of non-traditional products to
find markets and to attract foreign investors who would produce for export.
In addition, other CACM countries provide export incentives which are more
generous than in Honduras (such as tax credits to exporters). All CACM
countries and Honduras reimburse duties paid on imported inputs for the
manufacture of export products--duty draw-back. However, such a measure has
limited usefulness as an incentive, since it essentially provides exporters a
supply of inputs at the same prices that their external competitors pay.
The administrative complexities of the operation of the draw-back system are
another reason for the low degree of its effectiveness in the CACM countries.
1.31      The Honduran Government is presently attempting to establish a more
systematic approach to export promotion.  In view of Honduras' current
economic situation (increasing balance of payments deficit and decreasing
international reserves), and the apparent unwillingness of CACM countries, at
this time, to formulate a common regional export incentive policy, the imple-
mentation of an effective national export promotion strategy has become
increasingly important. The government has prepared an initial draft of an
export promotion law which the Bank, in close cooperation with the IMF, has
reviewed and given comments. The current draft law needs to be improved in
several areas including: (i) the fiscal incentives are based on the FOB value
of the increments of exports rather than on value added; and (ii) the negative
impact on central government's finances, which would put in jeopardy the
Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangement with the IMF. Furthermore, there is
a need to properly address one of the most critical aspects of export promotion
which is the scarcity of export financing. During loan negotiations assurances
were received from the government that before taking any action concerning
incentives for the promotion of exports, the government shall afford the Bank
all reasonable opportunity for exchanging views on such incentives.
Outlook for Industrial Growth and Investment
1.32       Favorable overall growth prospects are foreseen for Honduras in the
1980s. The large government investment effort is expected to greatly accel-
erate growth by the mid-1980s, and together with the good prospects for
increasing exports, particularly in food products, wood 1/ and paper products,
1/   It is anticipated that wood products would double in volume once the
two new sawmills become fully operational in 1982 and 1984.



- 12 -
significant growth rates of about 7-8 percent p.a. in value added may occur
in the mid to late 1980s. The near-term outlook, however, is less optimistic,
because of the political climate in the region, the decline in coffee prices,
the limited liquidity of the banking system, and high interest rates. Private
investment is the most uncertain element for the next few years. On one hand,
the limited increase in domestic credit during 1980 was mostly siphoned to the
public sector; this, together with a reduced exposure in Central America by
foreign commercial banks, high interest rates abroad, and political uncertain-
ties in the area, had negative effects on private investment in 1980. Addi-
tionally, the government's industrial investment corporation (CONADI's)
support for large private projects may have peaked since most of them have
been completed and CONADI's severe financial difficulties effectively limit
its capacity to enter new operations on a sound basis (para 3.35). On the
other hand, the government's program for 1981-82 under the EFF arrangement
(para 1.05) should help increase credit availability for the private sector
(if public finances strengthen), increase investor confidence and provide the
right environment for private sector growth. Greater participation of the
private sector is essential in the medium term because the expansion of the
public sector in the last few years is taxing its personnel and finances.
Nevertheless, it must be recognized that the industrial outlook will continue
to be influenced for the next few years by the political situation in Central
America, and private investors are likely to remain relatively cautious.
CACM
1.33      With respect to the future of the CACM, recent political upheavals
in the area have clearly affected trade relations among countries. These
events raise serious questions concerning the political viability of the
integration movement. However, it can be argued that strong economic interests
in the CACM have been created which are likely to continue to exercise pressure
to maintain, in some form at least, these arrangements. It is necessary to
devise an industrial strategy for the countries of the CACM, which would
stimulate production and export of manufactured products (particularly of
resource-based items) to markets outs:ide the region. In this regard, the
revision of the policy instruments of CACM is essential to permit them to play
a proper role in this process. While there is growing support among the CACM
countries for a reappraisal and revis-ion of policies and strategies, it may
take some time for firm decisions to be taken. In the interim, investment
would be directel zo those accivities in which the CACM countries have compara-
tive advantages and can be individual:Ly comDetitive.
1.34      While the precise nature of the gains from the current stage of
integration are difficult to measure, it is clear that there has been a
substantial increase in the degree of interdependence among the CACM countries.
A series of positive results from the regional integration efforts can be
identified: an expansion of market size has made possible the growth of a
number of local industries which individual national markets could hardly
have supported, and has encouraged some degree of intra-industry special-
ization; encouragement to the development of technical and managerial skills
which can provide the basis for further growth; and important improvement
in regional infrastructure which has in turn generated better national links.

II. THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM
A. Banking System
2.01      The banking system in Honduras is comprised of BCH, 15 commercial
banks and financieras, 1/ 3 development banks (CONADI, Banco Nacional de
Desarrollo Agricola--BANADESA, and Banco Municipal Autonomo--BMA), 9 specialized
credit institutions (mostly mortgage banks), CDI and Corporacion de Desarrollo
Forestal (COHDEFOR). Of these entities, all except BANADESA, BMA and the
specialized credit institutions are involved at present in financing industry.
BCH
2.02      BCH was established in 1950 as the government's central bank and
fiscal agent, with responsibility for formulating and implementing monetary
policy and for supervising the banking system. The BCH is generally regarded
both within and outside Honduras as a professional, well-managed and adequately
staffed organization. In recent years, BCH has taken an active role in
economic development, policy formulation, planning and financing. 2/ It is
operating a guarantee fund for small-scale industrial lending (para. 3.37)
and an export rediscount line. In addition, BCH has assumed responsibility
for administering the Bank Group's four Livestock and Agricultural Credit
Projects, as well as the First Industrial Credit Project and the tourism credit
component of the Tourism Development Project. Under the proposed project, BCH
would continue its role in channeling term financing to the Honduran industrial
sector (paras. 3.03 and 4.02).
BANADESA
2.03      BANADESA (formerly Banco Nacional de Fomento, BANAFOM) with assets of
L288.0 million as of December 31, 1980, is the second largest bank in Honduras
(Annex 4, Table 5) and until 1977 was virtually the country's only source of
industrial term credit to SMI.   Founded in 1950 mainly as an agricultural
bank, it became involved in industrial financing and in operating agricultural
marketing and storage facilities as part of its agricultural price stabiliza-
tion activity. By 1975, the bank had acquired an industrial portfolio of
L12.6 million (out of a total portfolio of about L131.9 million), mostly of
medium- and small-size loans, of which about one-third were in arrears. Most
of the small loans had been guaranteed by BCH's small industry guarantee fund
(para. 3.37). In early 1977, the BCH, on behalf of the government and along
with BANADESA's new management, undertook a review of the range of the insti-
tution's activities and capabilities. As a result, it was decided that
BANADESA should focus its resources on its expanded agricultural development
responsibilities and phase out other activity. Thus, the bank's industrial
lending activities ceased in July 1977 and a phase-out was begun of all
1/   Including Financiera Hondurena (Banfinan), which went bankrupt in 1980.

agricultural marketing and storage functions. BANADESA provides a major
portion of Honduras's institutional financing for agriculture and for small-
scale farmers. BANADESA's total portfolio was about L198.0 million as of
December 1980, and it currently has financial difficulties mainly because of
a high level of portfolio arrears and limited efforts to collect.
Commercial Banks
2.04      The 15 commercial banks and financieras (3 of which are foreign
owned) form the core of Honduras' financial system. As of December 31, 1980,
they held 66% of the financial system's assets (excluding the BCH) of L1.5
billion and accounted for almost two-thirds (L191.0 million) of total new
industrial credit. In the past three years, industrial credit, on average,
accounted for about 20%. of the commercial banking system's outstanding total
loan portfolio. Commercial banks are engaged mainly in short-term lending
activities. In 1970, loans for less than 18 months accounted for more than
67% of resources loaned while longer term loans with maturities of 4 years
and over accounted for only 17% of the total (Table 2.1).   By 1975, this
situation had changed appreciably and loans of over 4 years represented 26% of
total lending. The trend has continued with the increased availability of
longer term resources to commercial banks, such as under the First Industrial
Credit Project.

2.05      Several large banks, of which the largest and most important are the
Banco Atlantida (ATLANTIDA) and Banco Capitalizadora Hondurena (BANCAHSA),
have traditionally dominated commercial banking activity (Annex 4, Table 6).
However, in recent years, reflecting BCH's efforts to increase competition in
commercial banking, important changes have occurred giving the banking system
a broader base, an enlarged clientele, and an improved geographic spread. As
a result, the number of commercial banks has increased by 40% (three specialized
credit institutions became commercial banks in 1971 and 1976, a new commercial

bank was established in 1974, and a second one in 1979), the system is channel-
ing an ever-increasing amount of resources into the productive sectors (agri-
culture and industry) (Table 2.2), and the smaller banks have grown at a
faster rate than the larger ones. These changes within the banking system,
even in a short period, are quite significant. Thus, between 1975-80, while
ATLANTIDA's overall industrial lending had increased substantially, its share
of the market declined from 35.7% to 14.7% of total industrial lending. Two
other large banks, BANCAHSA and Banco Financiera Hondurena also experienced a
large market share decline (from 25.1% to 5.0%) during the same period, as did
the three banks with foreign ownership, whose industrial lending share fell
from 19.5% to 13.5%. 1/ Seven smaller banks and one financiera are rapidly
growing in importance and have increased their share of new industrial lending
from 10.8% in 1975 to 22.0% in 1980.   With high competitive pressure and
relatively low lending limits, 2/ the commercial banks have actively sought to
broaden their SMI clientele.
1/   The importance of the larger banks, particularly of one of the three
foreign owned banks, is underestimated since they also provide a substan-
tial amount of guarantees for dollar financing of industrial clients by
foreign banks.
2/   Commercial banks are not permitted to have loans outstanding to a single
enterprise greater than 20% of their equity. Thus the maximum size loan
for the smaller 8 of the 15 commercial banks (including Banfinan) ranges
from US$270,000 to US$990,000 equivalent, with an average for all the
commercial banks of about US$1.0 million equivalent, as of December 31,
1980.

Other Financing Institutions
2.06     Other institutions financing industry in Honduras are CDI, COHDEFOR,
and CONADI which are discussed in paras. 3.30 to 3.36, and the Central
American Bank for Economic Integration (CABEI). CONADI, the government indus-
trial development institution created in 1974, has become the most important
source of financing to the industrial sector, accounting for about 41% of
industrial lending and 10% of total lending of the financial system. Currently
CONADI has financial problems and its lending level for the next 1-2 years is
expected to be very modes:i (paras. 3.34 to 3.36). CABEI, although not part
of the Honduran banking system, has been active in financing Honduran
industry. CABEI was founded in 1961 as the bank for economic integration of
the Central American region, with headquarters in Tegucigalpa. Since its
inception, it has made 72 loans totaling US$36.5 million to the manufacturing
sector in Honduras, for projects with a total cost of US$123.8 million. The
subprojects financed are large, with an average loan size of about US$500,000,
and an average subproject investment of about US$1.7 million. For the next
2-3 years, CABEI's industrial financing in Honduras is expected to be modest,
taking into consideration also that larger private subprojects requiring CABEI
financing are not ready for implementation.
B. Monetary Policy and Mobilization of Resources
Background and Objcctives
2.07      Following the rapid expansion of export earnings in 1976, increased
domestic savings were supplemented by substantial foreign borrowings, resulting
in a significant rise in credit during the 1976-1978 period. This favorable
situation, however, changed in mid-1979. The growth of financial savings
weakened, partly as a result of political uncertainties and low domestic
interest rates. Foreign medium- and long-term borrowing from commercial
banks was limited by the desire of foreign commercial banks to limit their
exposure in Central America and by sharply rising foreign interest rates,
thus eliminating or reducing considerably the spread with which domestic banks
could operate. As a result, the banking system found itself in a liquidity
squeeze, which led to a decline in credit to the private sector. By 1980
total credit growth became negative in real terms. This reduction in real
credit adversely affected private sector activities. However, the situation
is expected to improve as a result of the program agreed with the IMF
(para. 1.05) and the new Central Bank's policy on interest rates (para. 2.09).
2.08      Monetary policy in Honduras has traditionally focused on three
principal objectives: (i) maintaining the stability of the lempira within a
system of free-currency convertibility; (ii) seeking to achieve equilibrium in
the balance of payments; and (iii) keeping the domestic inflation rate at
or below the level in the US, Honduras principal trading partner. These
objectives have been pursued by modifying legal reserve requirements on
deposits, regulating the percentage of commercial bank lending for a particular
purpose, limiting discount and rediscount facilities mainly to agricultural
crop and export financing, and levying surcharges on imports of non-essential



- 18 -
items. Partly as a result of these government policies, the historical rate
of inflation in Honduras, as measured by the consumer price index, has been
low compared to many other Latin American countries, and the US dollar-lempira
exchange rate has remained at 2:1 for the past two decades. The annual
average increase of the consumer price index rose from 3.4% in 1970-1973 to
7.7% in 1976-1979. In 1980, inflation rose to 19% as a result of the substan-
tially higher prices of imported goiods, triggered in part by the new round of
oil price increases, and because production of basic grains has not kept pace
with rising demand.
Interest Rates and Financial Resources
2.09      Interest Rates.  While in the 1960s interest rates were modified
infrequently, in the 1970s interest rates have played a more important
role in monetary policy. The maximulm interest rates on productive loans, 1/
which were constant between 1967 and 1971, were raised substantially from 8%
to 11% in two adjustments (in 1972 and 1974) and were changed again in 1980
and 1981.  Interest rates on loans for consumption or commerce, however, had
been increasingly restricted sinc-e 1974 when the free market rate was replaced
by a 13% ceiling interest rate. In the face of a 66% increase in banking
liquidity between 1975 and mid-1977, the BCH raised legal reserve requirements
on all bank deposits, from 25% to 30%, thereby increasing the cost of resource
mobilization by the banking systesm, and reducing incentives to raise long-term
funds. In 1978, 1979 and 1980, the lending rates were raised (Annex 4, Table 8).
Ceilings of 11% and 14% established in 1978 and in 1979, respectively (which
in practice were much lower), on deposit interest rates, hampered the mobiliza-
tion of domestic resource. In addition, a lending rate ceiling (16% prior to
March 1980 and 19% thereafter) caused difficulties to local commercial banks
in obtaining foreign commercial borrowing. As part of the financial program
developed with the IMF, interest rates were freed on saving deposits (the only
deposits with fixed rates), and a maximum spread of 3.5% above the external
borrowing cost was allowed on loans of commercial banks which were financed
with foreign credit (Table 2.3).
1/   Loans to expand or improve output of agriculture and industry, which
must constitute not less than 70% of commercial banks' lending, while
lending for commerce and trade or consumption may not be more than 30%.

2.10      Deposits.  The government's past policy of setting interest rates for
time deposits to yield savers positive returns on average, together with an
effective resource mobilization by the commercial and housing banks, was
successful particularly in 1974-78 when deposits, in nominal terms, grew at
about a 22% annual rate. A substantial part of this high growth was due to
increased time deposits (with maturities of three months to one year), which
grew at about a 25% annual rate (Annex 4, Table 7). Mobilization of deposits
denominated in foreign currencies during this period also grew at about 32%
p.a. However, the growth rate of domestic currency deposits dropped substan-
tially (to 11%) during 1979-80, as a result of the negative interest rates (in
real terms) paid on deposits, the political uncertainty in Central America and
higher interest rates paid abroad. In addition, the mobilization of foreign
medium- and long-term financial resources by the system 1/, which, in real terms,
had declined by 18% between 1978-79 continued to decline by 6% in 1979-80,
further reducing the availability of resources. Foreign borrowings by domestic
commercial banks declined by 51% in 1978-79 and 38% in 1979-80. Central Bank
credit, however, increased by 58.3% annually during this period providing some
liquidity to the banking system. Approximately 31% of this Central Bank credit
was provided to Financiera Hondurena for emergency financial assistance,
with an additional 40% of the credit equally divided between BANADESA, SOGERIN
and Occidente, mostly to cover required reserve deficits with the Central Bank.
1/   Excluding BCH.

2.11      Short-term foreign borrowing by domestic banks is strictly limited
to the short-term financing of exports of coffee, cotton, tobacco and other
major agricultural or seafood products. With previous authorization from BCH,
banks could have obtained long-term resources abroad, but were (until May
1981) restricted to the stipulated interest rate lending ceilings. This, in
the context of the unusually high irLterest rates prevailing during the past
year in the international markets, discouraged commercial banks from borrowing
abroad, which partially explains the sharp decline of foreign bank borrowing
of 38% between 1979-80 by local c:ommercial banks. It is expected that the
new measures taken by BCH (para. 2.09) will assist the banking system in
mobilizing both domestic and foreign resources.
2.12      Internal Resources.  Internally generated resources of the banking
system have been progressively declining in importance as deposits have
expanded. Capital and reserves of the banking system amounted to L103.1
million (20% of total resources) in 1971 and L293.5 million (13%) in 1980.
However, commercial banks and other financial institutions are providing an
important part of CONADI's capital, since, in addition to the government's
capital contribution, CONADI receives contributions from each bank and
insurance company in an amount equal to 10% of their capital and reserves.
These contributions receive preferred 6% shares in CONADI. In addition, as
quasi-equity, CONADI receives an anrnual contribution of 10% of total import
duties or income taxes exempted by the government from industrial enterprises.
Contributing industries receive non-negotiable 6% interest-bearing certificates
repayable by CONADI in 20 years, with 3 years of grace.
2.13      Rediscounts.  The BCHs several rediscounting facilities are playing
increasingly important roles in providing the seasonal liquidity needed to
finance inventories of export conmodlities, such as sugar, coffee, tobacco,
and seafood products, as well as to meet some of the more urgent short-term
needs for productive financing of agriculture and, to a lesser degree, industry.
The BCH's general rediscount facility was established by law to rediscount
short-term commercial bank loans for productive purposes and meet short-term
liquidity requirements, while the special rediscount facilities are linked to
short-term financing of basic conmodities.  Rediscounts outstanding to the
banking system rose from L35.8 million in 1972 to L168.0 million in 1979.
BCH-s rediscount rates range from 7-8% for short-term loans for productive
purposes, 9% for short-term loans to commerce, 8-9% for longer term loans for
housing, and a varying rate for liquidity purposes (i.e to enable banks to
meet current commitments). In the past, BCH has relied on the ad hoc estab-
lishment of special rediscount facilities and on quantitative restrictions on
these or on the general rediscount facility to channel credit in accordance
with the overall objectives of development and monetary policy.
C. Financing of Industry
2.14      During 1975-80, about 20% of total credit from the banking system to
the private sector was channeled to manufacturing. The share of loans to
agriculture and livestock decreased from 31% in 1975 to 27% in 1980, while



- 21 -
that for construction and real estate maintained its 19% share during this
period, and lending for services, commerce and consumption rose from 30% to
34%. Overall banking credit and industrial credit rose by 15% and 27% average
p.a., respectively, in nominal terms during 1975-80.
2.15      Internally generated resources of the enterprises have traditionally
been the major source of funds for the financing of industry. Until 1971,
equity, undistributed profits, and depreciation reserves provided over two-
thirds of resources, while loans and credits accounted for less than one-third
of financing requirements. This is reflected in the average total debt/equity
(D/E) ratio for industry, which was a very low 0.48:1 in 1971. In recent
years, however, principally because of the high annual average growth of the
industrial sector and borrowings, the D/E ratio of industrial firms has risen
rapidly and the overall D/E ratio for industry increased from 0.72:1 in 1975
to 1.22:1 in 1977 (Table 2.4).

2.16      The balance sheets for two sample-surveys of the industrial sector
in 1975 and 1977 (Table 2.4) show that only 35% and 44%, respectively, of
liabilities were for medium and long-term obligations. There is also clear
evidence 1/ that the larger Honduran industrial firms (with assets over
1/   Central Bank Survey of Commercial Banking System, 1978.



- 22 
L750,000) have had greater access to long-term credit than smaller firms,
whose ratios of long-term to total obligations averaged only about 14% (com-
pared to the larger firms which have ratios of about 37%). This result,
however, is not surprising, since lending to small-scale enterprises tends to
be costly to commercial banks, givern that loan amounts are usually small and
the cost of appraisal and supervision is relatively high. In addition,
small enterprises often cannot proviide the necessary collateral, further
hindering their access to longer term financing. Under the First Industrial
Credit Project, larger spreads were provided to commercial banks for loans to
small scale industries; this practice would be continued under the proposed
project. In addition, the regulations governing the guarantee fund in BCH
have been modified to make it more flexible and attractive to commercial banks,
thus eliminating the second constraint to lending for small-scale enterprises
(para. 3.38).
D. Industrial Investment and Credit Demand
Industrial Investment
2.17      Investment in industrial f'ixed assets by firms employing five or
more workers grew by about 7% pex year in real terms during 1965-70, but
investment growth declined during 1971 and particularly 1972, partly as a
result of the removal or reduction cif investment incentives by Honduras
following Honduras' withdrawal from the CACM.  When these incentives were
partially restored, following the signing of bilateral treaties with Guatemala,
Nicaragua and Costa Rica in 1972-73, investor confidence increased and a
number of projects which had been postponed were implemented. In 1973, invest-
ment increased by 22% in real terms over the depressed level of 1972. A
higher level of investment in fixed assets in factories (averaging about
US$20.0 million annually in constant 1966 prices) was maintained during 1974
and 1975. Important new investments were begun in four new sugar mills, and
significant modernization and capacity expansion took place in meat packing,
beverages, textiles, sawmills, and plastics during 1973-75 (Annex 4, Table 9).
In 1976-79, growth of new industrial investment averaged about 14% a year,
reaching a level of about US$55.0 million equivalent in 1979. Preliminary
data show an investment level of about US$61.0 million in 1980. The largest
investments during this period took place in sugar mills, sawmills, non-metallic
minerals, food processing, beer, textiles, and to a lesser extent in plastics
and metal.
2.18      Overall the growth rate (in real terms) of industrial investment
over 1972-79 reached 7.8% per annum, which was just slightly above the 7%
annual growth rate in real industrial output over the same period. Since part
of this investment was for modernization and replacement of existing plant,
the growth rate of productive capacity has tended to lag behind increases in
industrial production, with the result that capacity utilization is estimated
to have risen from about 50% in 1968 to about 77% in 1977-80.



- 23 -
2.19      Direct foreign investment has not yet played a very important role
in Honduras' industrial development, despite the availability of significant
investment incentives and the virtual absence of restrictions on private
foreign investment, with the exception of the forestry and wood products
sector. Foreign firms, however, have located in the more developed countries
of the region.   As a result of the 1974 restrictions on forestry and wood
products, some foreign investors were required to divest themselves of their
ownership in enterprises involved in the export of lumber and resin, or
reduce their ownership participation to not more than 49% in enterprises
involved in large-scale wood products manufacturing.
Credit Demand
2.20      Taking into account the fluctuations in investment values, which can
be expected due to the "lumpiness" of some projects, the GDP and investment
growth rates during the last 6 years, and the GDP growth rate projected for
1981-85, it is estimated that investment in fixed assets during the next
4 years would average a real growth rate of about 4% p.a., 1/ with a similar
structure of investment as in the last 5 years (i.e. 50%, 42% and 8% in
traditional consumer goods, intermediate and capital goods, respectively).
Assuming an annual inflation rate of 12% for the next 2-3 years, this would
correspond to an average annual investment level of about US$80.0 million, in
current terms. This figure is consistent with a recent survey conducted by
the National Industrial Development Fund (FONDEI) to determine the potential
demand for FONDEI financing. The survey, which covered 7 of the major
financial intermediaries, showed a pipeline of about 250 small- and medium-
sized industrial subprojects requiring a total investment of about US$60.0
million over the next 2 years (para. 3.23).
2.21      Based upon recent trends in industrial financing (para. 2.15), on
average about 50% of incremental industrial investment would be financed by
lenders; thus, about US$40.0 million equivalent would be required each year.
The proposed loan of US$30.0 million over the 1982-1984 commitment period
would finance about 25% of the funds required. The remainder of the credit
requirements would be met by short- and medium-term direct foreign loans, by
new and renewal of short- and medium-term loans made by local commercial
banks, and by possible cofinancing resources (para. 3.39).
1/   GDP growth for 1981-85 is projected at about 4-5% annually (July 1981,
Economic Memorandum on Honduras).

III. THE PROPOSED PROJECT
A. Institutional Structure and Project Objectives
Background
3.01      The First Industrial Credit Project (Loan 1659-HO for US$15.0 million,
approved on February 6, 1979), was designed to assist the government in meeting
its objectives for developing the industrial sector, by establishing an effec-
tive system to provide term financing to sound investment projects of small
and medium-sized firms. The loan was made to the Government of Honduras
for onlending through BCH's FONDEI, which operates as a second-tier financial
institution, providing part of the financing for term loans made by the
financial intermediaries (commercial banks and financieras, including CDI
and COHDEFOR) for industrial investment subprojects. The loan originally
had two components: (i) US$6.0 million to be used by COHDEFOR for financing
forestry subprojects; and (ii) US$9.0 million, including US$2.5 million for
SSEs, to be used by other financial intermediaries of FONDEI for industrial
financing. Due to slow utilization of the first component and the strong credit
demand to FONDEI under the second component, COHDEFOR's initial loan allocation
net of the US$0.23 million committed by COHDEFOR, was reallocated to FONDEI
for financing under the second component. Additionally, in 1978, the Bank
approved Loan 1673-HO for US$19.5 million for tourism development in Honduras,
which includes a tourism credit component of US$16.0 million channeled through
FONDEI.
3.02      As of March 31, 1981, FONDEI had committed US$11.2 million out of
the US$14.8 million available under Loan 1659-HO for the financing of indus-
trial subprojects with a total investment cost of US$24.0 million (para. 3.19). 1/
The project's institution building objectives with respect to FONDEI and the
banking system are being achieved (paras. 3.15 to 3.18, 3.27). Overall, this
two-tier credit system through FONDEI has proved itself to be a viable mechanism
in Honduras for financing efficient industrial projects and assisting the
government in reaching its development goals in the industrial sector
(paras 3.19-3.22). These institutional arrangements would be used under the
proposed Second Industrial Credit Project.
Project Objectives
3.03      The proposed project would continue supporting Honduras' indus-
trial strategy outlined in paras. 1.20 and 1.21 and help promoting and
maintaining rapid and efficient growth of industrial output, exports and
employment. The project would assist the government to achieve these objec-
tives by:
1/   Additionally, about US$4.0 million under the tourism credit component
of Loan 1673-HO had been committed.



(i) providing term-lending through FONDEI for financially and
economically sound investment subprojects of small and medium-sized
enterprises;
(ii)  encouraging the building of an effective system within Honduras to
generate sound industrial investment projects;
(iii)  supporting FONDEI's efforts to upgrade the project appraisal and
supervision capabilities of participating intermediaries, and
strengthening FONDEI's operating system; and
(iv)  strengthening technical assistance services to the smaller industrial
enterprises through CDI.
B. Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Industrial (FONDEI)
Establishment, Organization and Management
3.04      Under the First Industrial Credit Project, BCH established FONDEI in
December 1978 as a permanent second-tier institution, with its own staffing,
financial resources and separate accounting. FONDEI is headed by an executive
director who reports to a three-member Executive Committee established by BCH
and which has overall responsibility for establishing FONDEI's policies,
approving FONDEI's loans over US$125,000 equivalent and overseeing its activ-
ities. The resolution creating FONDEI spells out the broad objectives and
scope of FONDEI's activities, specifies its initial resources and the sources
from which it is authorized to secure additional funds in the future, and
defines the composition of the Executive Committee.
3.05      BCH is responsible for appointing FONDEI's director and providing
FONDEI with supporting technical staff and logistics facilities adequate for
carrying out the projects under FONDEI's responsibility. In managing FONDEI's
day-to-day operations, its executive director is supported by two assistants,
one in charge of subproject evaluation and supervision, and the other related
to overall managerial activities and FONDEI's financial planning. A section
in charge of accounting and disbursements, and a regional office in San Pedro
Sula complete the organizational structure (Annex 1). In addition to its
director, FONDEI currently has 12 professional staff members specialized
in finance, economics, engineering and accounting. Overall, FONDEI staff is
dedicated, adequately trained and capable of carrying out its functions. To
cover the planned increase in the volume of operations under the proposed
project, BCH agreed during negotiations to hire at least one additional
experienced subproject analyst for FONDEI's office in San Pedro Sula.
3.06      FONDEI, although legally a part of BCH, maintains separate financial
records on its operations. As under the First Industrial Credit Project,
FONDEI would handle subloan approval and administration, disbursement authori-
zations, accounting and the information system. BCH's Credit Department would



.. 26 -
carry out disbursement and repayment activities. These arrangements have
proved to be adequate under FONDEI"s current operations and are considered
appropriate under the proposed project. However, in order to handle the
increasing subproject approval and supervision workload under the second
project, FONDEI should strengthen its procedures for loan administration and
for its accounting and information systems. During negotiations agreement
was reached on a plan of action for implementing the key improvements required
in the abovementioned procedures and systems. Technical assistance would be
made available under the proposed project for such purposes.
Policies and Regulations
3.07      Statement of Policies and Industrial Regulations.  The policies and
regulations that would govern FONDEITs industrial operations are set forth in
its draft revised Statement of Policies and Industrial Regulations (Annex 2).
It specifies, among other things: (i) FONDEI's objectives in financing
industrial investment subprojects; (ii) the type of subprojects that FONDEI
would finance; (iii) the terms and limtits of financing; (iv) the criteria for
subproject approval; and (v) the responsibility of financial intermediaries
receiving financing from FONDEI. The major revisions included in the draft
concern the terms and limits of financing for any subproject (para. 3.09); the
repayment terms for export oriented subprojects (para. 3.11); and the interest
rate (para. 3.13). The Statement of Policies and Industrial Regulations as
presently drafted would form a satisfactory basis for FONDEI's channelling of
Bank funds for industrial lending under the proposed project. Agreement on
the Statement of Policies and Industrial Regulations was reached during
negotiations, and any subsequent modification would require prior Bank authori-
zation. Approval of the Statement of Policies and Industrial Regulations by
FONDEI-s Executive Committee, would be a condition of loan effectiveness.
3.08      Nature of subprojects to be financed.  As under the first project
FONDEI would focus on financing investment projects of small and medium-sized
firms involved in manufacturing, agroindustry, forestry and wood processing,
fishing and fish products, and related services. Projects eligible for
financing would entail the creation, expansion or modernization of the produc-
tive capacity of the enterprises. In its allocation of scarce resources,
FONDEI would primarily finance projects which increase the utilization of
local natural resources, generate export revenues or efficiently substitute
imports, and create new jobs. FONDEI would finance (i) the purchase of fixed
assets, including machinery, equipment and their installation costs; buildings,
handling and storage facilities, and civil works; (ii) related permanent
working capital needs of subprojects, giving priority to exporters in financing
working capital loans with its own resources; and (iii) technical assistance
needs for project preparation or implemnentation. These aspects are reflected
in FONDEI-s revised Statement of Policies and Industrial Regulations (para.
3.07).
3.09      Terms and limits of financing.  Small enterprises would be defined
as those firms having fixed assets, excluding land and buildings but including
fixed investments to be financed under a proposed subproject, of less than
US$150,000 equivalent, as of the date of the presentation of the proposed



subproject to the financial intermediary. 1/ This definition corresponds
approximately to firms with up to 25 employees, and includes most firms that
in the past have had limited access to credit from tthe banking system. To
avoid concentration of FONDEI financing in a few firms, FONDEI's maximum
financing for any one investment subproject and enterprise would be limited to
US$1.25 million. 2/ This limit would be cumulative taking into account any
other outstanding amounts from previous FONDEI loans. For the same reason,
FONDEI would not approve financi-ng for companies which it judges to have
reasonable access to alternative local or foreign sources of financing on
adequate terms. A minimum subloan of US$5,000 would be established. 3/
3.10      To ensure that a significant part of project resources benefit the
smaller industrial enterprises, FONDEI would: (i) allocate at least US$4.0
million of the proposed loan for SSE lending; (ii) provide a differentiated
spread to the financial intermediaries to cover the higher costs of small-scale
lending (para. 3.14); and (iii) coordinate with CDI to ensure that small-scale
projects are well prepared for submissiorn to the participating financial
intermediaries. Furthermore, BCr' has revised its guarantee mechanism to
encourage lending by the financial intermediaries to SSEs (para. 3.38).
3.11      FONDEI would establish appropriate maturities for each subloan on
the basis of the nature and cash flow projections of the subprojects, with a
limit of 15 years, including up to 3 years of grace. Financial interme-
diaries would be required to lend their own counterpart funds with the same
maturities and with the same grace period as the financing approved by FONDEI.
Normally, FONDEI would not approve subloans to firms able to repay their debt
in less than 3 years, since banks would be expected to finance such subloans
from their ordinary resources. In the case of subprojects oriented to export
outside Central America, FONDEI could extend within the above limits sub-
loan grace period and repayment terms up to 2 additional years, at such
time as the project was completed, upon request from the borrower and based
on the export financing needs and cash flow projections of the subproject.
3.12      FONDEI would participate jointly with the financial intermediary and
the final borrower in financing a specific subproject. FONDEI would finance
up to 65% of the cost of fixed assets and associated permanent working capital
of new industrial subprojects, and up to 80% in the case of subprojects
involving the expansion and modernization of industrial enterprises, provided
that the financial position and prospects of the recipient company would
permit a higher proportion of debt financing. Since about one-half of the
subprojects are likely to be expansions, and most small- and medium-sized
1/   This corresponds in real terns to the definition of SSEs under the First
Project (less than US$100,000 of total assets prior to the FONDEI
financing, in 1978 prices).
2/   This corresponds in real terms to the maximum of US$750,000 in 1978
prices, under the first project.
3/   It is expected that subloans below this limit would be covered by commer-
cial banks (personal loans), and by CDIs artisan program.



- 28 -
firms have rather low D/E ratios because of their limited access to term
credit in the past, FONDEI is likely to be asked to finance on average about
70% of total subproject costs. The financial intermediary would finance at
least 10% of subproject costs and each subborrower the balance.
3.13      Interest rate.  Subloans financed by FONDEI would be denominated in
lempiras. Interest rates charged by financial intermediaries on the portion
of loans with their own resources are subject to the regulations established
by BCH. For subloans financed with FONDEI resources, BCH will require an
interest rate of 17% initially, which is in line with the existing rates for
term lending in Honduras (although in practice term lending to industry is
mainly through FONDEI), and is expected to be positive in real terms. 1/
However, to ensure an appropriate onlending interest rate system for sub-
loans with FONDEI resources under the proposed project, during negotiations
agreement was reached on the initial onlending rate together with a formula
for its periodic review and revision throughout the commitment period of the
proposed loan. Such review and revision would be made every six months, using
a formula based on the inflation rate and market interest rates in Honduras,
and adequate spreads to FONDEI and financial intermediaries (para. 3.14).
3.14      As under the first project, the cost of FONDEI financing and spreads
to the financial intermediaries would vary depending on the asset size of the
borrowing enterprises. Regardless of the final onlending interest rate to the
sub-borrowers, BCH has proposed to maintain the same spreads with FONDEI
resources to the financial intermediaries as under the first project, which
overall have proved to be adequate. FONDEI would allow a spread of 3 percentage
points to the intermediaries on loans to medium-sized enterprises. However,
on loans to small scale enterprises with fixed assets, excluding land and
buildings but including the fixed assets to be financed under a proposed sub-
project, of less than US$50,000 equivalent, or between US$50,000 and US$150,000
equivalent, intermediaries would be allowed higher margins of 5 and 4 percentage
points, respectively. These higher margins are intended to encourage partici-
pating banks to assume the relatively higher costs and risks associated with
lending to SSEs. During negotiations agreement was reached on the abovemen-
tioned financial spreads.
Subproject Appraisal and Supervision
3.15      Under the first project, FONDEI initially had to assume the respon-
sibility, using its own staff, for the full appraisal of virtually all sub-
projects, and financial intermediaries focussed on evaluating the financial
plan and risks of subprojects, and on securing adequate collateral. This
was mainly because few if any Honduran banks had the technical skills or
1/   The interest rate for subloans with FONDEI resources has been increased
from 12% to 16% p.a. under Loan 1659-HO. The inflation rate in Honduras
was about 7.3% average p.a. during 1974-79. It accelerated during
1980 to about 19%, but dropped to an equivalent annual rate of only
about 10% during the first 4 months of 1981, with 13% estimated for
the whole year and 12% for 1982.



- 29 -
staff to carry out detailed project appraisals. However, in the course of
project operation, the intermediaries have developed experience in term
lending, and some banks have started preparing subproject appraisal reports
with gradual improvement in quality. FONDEI has also progressively improved
its appraisal capabilities covering the financ-al, technical and economic
aspects of subprojects, including market analysis and analysis of the enter-
prise and subproject capacity to adequately service their debt. Now, under
the proposed project FONDEI intends to transfer progressively to the interme-
diaries the responsibility for subproject appraisal, providing appropriate
assistance to this end.
3.16      In the future, financial intermediaries would be required to prepare
and submit to FONDEI subproject appraisal reports based on FONDEI guidelines,
with financing requests. FONDEI would review these appraisals, comment on
their adequacy, request additional analysis needed and approve financing for
those subprojects it judges to be technically sound, financially viable and
economically efficient. In line with FONDEI's revised appraisal guidelines, the
depth and sophistication of subproject appraisal and review would be varied to
fit the size and nature of subprojects. Subloans to medium-sized enterprises
would be subject to a detailed review of their technical, financial, market
and economic aspects, including cash flow analysis of the enterprise and of
the subproject. For FONDEI subloans above US$250,000, the economic rate of
return (ERR) would be calculated by FONDEI, using standard Bank guidelines for
DFCs. The review of the ex-ante ERR of some subprojects under the first
project has shown appropriate calculation by FONDEI. Subloans to SSEs would
be subject to simpler and more rapid appraisals, focussing on the market and
technical aspects, repayment capacity and on the financial rate of return
(FRR) which has been used adequately by FONDEI and financial intermediaries
under the first project. All appraisals would include an analysis of certain
key economic variables (e.g., employment, value added, exports) to assist in
project monitoring, and also a discussion of the procurement procedures applied
(para. 4.08).
3.17      In the past, subproject supervision has been focussed on follow-up
by financial intermediaries of loans during the disbursement period to ensure
proper utilization of funds. Lately, FONDEI has conducted its own field visits
to subprojects in operation and has prepared reports of acceptable quality.
However, FONDEI realizes that more extensive operational feedback and informa-
tion on subproject performance will be needed in the future and that given the
expected sharp increase in subprojects, it could visit only a limited number
of enterprises. To strengthen supervision under the proposed project, finan-
cial intermediaries would be expected to assume primary responsibility for
supervision of subprojects and FONDEI's own direct supervision would be
planned to support and complement the efforts by the financial intermediaries.
Additionally, the performance of intermediaries in subproject supervision
would be monitored by FONDEI on the basis of periodic reports which the
intermediaries would be required to submit and through spot visits to final
beneficiaries.
3.18      While the process of delegation of subproject appraisal and super-
vision responsibilities to financial intermediaries would be beneficial, it is
expected to be gradual. This is mainly because of the number of FONDEI's



operations with all intermediaries has not yet grown to the point where even
small permanent units would be fully occupied and because of the time consuming
learning process at the financial intermediary level, which would require close
cooperation and coordination by FONDE:r. About one-third of the subprojects to
be financed under the proposed project are expected to be adequately appraised
by the intermediaries without substantial assistance from FONDEI. Although
financial intermediaries would work more closely with industrialists in the
preparation of appraisals and supervision of subprojects, and would bear the
credit risk, FONDEI would have the ultimate responsibility for the quality of
appraisals and effectiveness of supervision. To support FONDEI's efforts to
delegate gradually these responsibilities and to help ensure appropriate
results, institutional and operationaL technical assistance and training would
be provided to FONDEI, financial intermediaries and their staff under the
proposed project (paras. 4.05 to 4.07). During negotiations, agreement
was reached on the revised guidelines for subproject appraisal and supervision,
(paras 3.15 to 3.17) as well as on the corresponding terms of the draft partici-
pation agreements specifying the intermediaries appraisal and supervision
responsibilities. Approval of the revised guidelines by FONDEI's Executive
Committee would be a condition of loan effectiveness.
Operations
3.19      FONDEI's operations have grown rapidly since its establishment in
December 1978, particularly during 1980 (Annex 4, Table 11). As of March 31,
1981, FONDEI's total approved financing amounted to US$17.8 million of which
77% was under the First Industrial Credit Project (Loan 1659-HO). At that
time, total investment cost of industrial subprojects amounted to US$24.0
million, of which FONDEI had committed US$13.7 million (US$11.2 with Bank loan
resources), the intermediaries US$2.6 million and the beneficiaries the
balance. While disbursements from Loan 1659-HO amounted to US$3.8 million,
FONDEI expects to increase sharply the disbursement level during the rest of
1981. 1/ The majority (17) of banks and financieras operating in Honduras
have participated as financial intermediaries under the First Industrial
Project, with 6 of them (Banco de Occidente, Sogerin, Bancahsa, Atlantida,
Comercio and CDI) channeling about 80% of FONDEI resources and financing 75%
of the subprojects.
3.20      FONDEI's lending is concentrated in relatively small enterprises,
which have on average US$183,000 in fixed assets after the FONDEI financing,
excluding land and buildings, as of March 31, 1981. At that time, FONDEI had
financed a total of 127 industrial subprojects with an average subloan of
US$108,000, of which 46 subprojects are for SSEs 2/ with an average subloan
of US$28,000 (Annex 4, Tables 11, 12)e These SSEs, even after the FONDEI
1/   FONDEI industrial financing comm:itments amounted to US$18.0 million as of
September 30, 1981, of which about US$14.2 million would be required from
Bank loan resources. (Break-down of this information, which was submitted
by FONDEI during negotiations, is available in the Project File.) Dis-
bursement from Loan 1659-HO amounted to US$7.48 million.
2/   This figure is underestimated because FONDEI classifies size of enter-
prises after the FONDEI financing and not prior to the financing, as
established during appraisal.



- 31 -
financing, still have a low debt/equity ratio of about 1:1 which shows the
difficult access to credit of these enterprises in the past (Annex 4, Table 13).
FONDEI, in addition, has supported a large number of new firms which accounted
for about 30% of the enterprises financed and 51% of subloan amount. Overall,
the abovementioned figures show the positive results of FONDEI's policy to
support small and medium-sized enterprises and to widely distribute financial
resources among industrialists.
3.21      Under the first project, as of March 31, 1981, about two-thirds of
subproject investments had been in the food, textiles, construction materials,
chemical and metal-mechanics subsectors (Annex 4, Table 14). The geographical
distribution of industrial investment is in line with estimates during
appraisal. Investment in machinery and equipment represents 57% of total
investment, land and buildings 23%, and working capital 20% (Annex 4, Table
15). Working capital financing, which is mainly for local cost expenditures,
is lower than expected because of the illiquidity of the banking system during
the last 18 months. Foreign costs represent about 69% of total investment
under the first project. Taking into account the current FONDEI subproject
pipeline (Table 3.1), foreign costs are expected to be about 60% of total
subproject investment under the proposed project, as the banking system
improves its liquidity position (para 2.11) and consequently increases
the working capital financing.
3.22      FONDEI's operations under the First Project have made an important
contribution to the Honduran economy. The 127 subprojects financed, according
to data available, would generate about 3,000 new jobs, with an average cost
(total investment) per job of about US$8,000 equivalent, which is in line with
expectations during appraisal. Since the bulk of FONDEI's subprojects also
utilize substantial domestic inputs, they would also be expected to have
a significant indirect employment creation impact, which is not considered in
the abovementioned figures. In addition, the subprojects are expected to
generate, during the first year of operation, about US$24.0 million, US$12.0
million and US$8.5 million of new output value, value added and exports,
respectively. An ex-post analysis of a sample of 44 subprojects in operation
financed by FONDEI shows a favorable performance relative to projections
made at the time of subproject appraisal, mainly regarding export generation
and creation of new jobs (Annex 4, Table 16). The economic rate of return was
estimated for 8 subprojects requiring subloans in excess of US$250,000 each.
The average ERR per subproject is over 35%.
3.23      FONDEI's industrial pipeline for the period June 1981-June 1983
contains about 250 subprojects with total investment cost of about US$60.0
million, with concentration in the food and chemical subsectors (Table 3.1).
These subprojects would require FONDEI financing for about US$40.0 million
(65%-70% of the total cost). The participating financial intermediaries would
provide financing of about US$6.0-7.0 million and final borrowers the balance.
While some of these subprojects are likely to be dropped, the existing project
pipeline could also be expected to be strengthened significantly during the
implementation period of the proposed project. The average subloan size is
expected to be maintained in real terms at about the same level as under the
first project (para 3.20). The number of subprojects is expected to increase
sharply, in view of FONDEI's intention to reach a higher number of SSEs and as
a result of the Guarantee Fund (para. 3.38) and CDI's participation as financial
intermediary from the commencement of the project.

Financial Position
3.24      FONDEI has separate accounting for its industrial project (Loan
1659-HO) and for its tourism project (credit component of Loan 1673-HO).
The consolidated balance sheet (Annex 4, Table 17) shows a rapidly growing loan
portfolio amounting to US$7.5 million, as of December 1980, of which about 96%
corresponds to industrial lending. The portfolio has minimal possibilities of
arrears, since FONDEI requires subloan repayments by financial intermediaries,
regardless of whether payments have been received from the subborrowers, through
the intermediaries' clearing accounts with BCH. 1/ The total debt of FONDEI
amounted to about US$4.7 million as of December 31, 1980. At the time,
FONDEI's paid-in capital of US$6.6 million had been provided by BCH as counter-
part requirements for the two abovementioned loans (US$5.0 million for Loan
1659-HO and US$1.6 million for Loan 1673-HO). While FONDEI incurred losses of
about US$15,000 in 1979, it showed profits of US$233,000 in 1980, mainly as a
result of putting its available cash resources into short term deposits within
the local banking system (Annex 4, Table 18).
1/   FONDEI's 1980 audited financial statements present a provision for losses
of US$11,411 regarding two subloans through Banfinan, a private financiera
that went bankrupt in 1980. Howrever, the subloans were transferred to
other financial intermediaries in early 1981. While there is no detailed
information available at this time, FONDEI has indicated that arrearage at
financial intermediaries appears very low, based on its discussions with
the intermediaries.



- 33 -
3.25      FONDEI has projected a sharp increase in its lending portfolio
from US$7.5 million in 1980 to about US$59.0 million by year-end 1984, 1/ of
which at least 77% would be in the industrial sector. During 1981-1984, the
currently projected main sources of funds would be (i) Bank resources for
about US$12.5 million average p.a., which would represent total foreign
resources; 2/ (ii) FONDEI internal generation (portfolio recovery, interest,
other), amounting to about US$6.0 million equivalent average p.a; and
(iii) BCH capital contribution of US$2.5 million equivalent as counterpart
to the proposed loan (Annex 4, Table 19). Projected outstanding borrowing
from the Bank (US$52.0 million) would represent about 82% of FONDEI's total
assets by year-end 1984, and its capital about 18%. This borrowing situation
would permit FONDEI to diversify its external sources of funds in the future,
as appropriate.
3.26      FONDEI's projected financial results are good for 1981-1984. 3/
Profits would amount to about US$0.5 million average per annum during the
period. Operating income from loan portfolio would cover the financial
expenses as well as administrative costs, which would decrease from 2.1% of
loan portfolio in 1981 to 1.1% by year-end 1984 (equivalent to 2.8% and 1.3%
of FONDEI outstanding debt with the Bank). In this context, FONDEI's current
average spreads of 2.5 and 1.8 percentage points on Bank resources for tourism
and industrial lending, respectively, are adequate, and not including other
revenues, would be enough, starting from 1983, to cover FONDEI's administrative
costs as its portfolio grows. Future surpluses would contribute to maintaining
or increasing FONDEI's capital. Taking into account all the abovementioned
aspects, FONDEI's current and projected financial situation and results appear
satisfactory.
C. Financial Intermediaries
3.27      Out of 17 intermediaries, the most active 7 accounted for 80% of total
loan amount approved and for 75% of the subprojects. This indicates the wide
and well-distributed share of long-term lending among various intermediaries.
To help ensure reaching these objectives under the proposed project, each
intermediary would be limited to US$7.5 million of Bank funds. As under
the first project, although all commercial banks and financieras including CDI
and COHDEFOR would be eligible in principle for FONDEI financing, participation
in the project would be limited to those institutions which could meet the
requirements established in the FONDEI's Statement of Policies and Industrial
1/   Projections made in April 1981.  Currently FONDEI is revising these
projections and believes that growth of the lending portfolio and dis-
bursements from the Bank may be about 7% lower than previously forecast.

Regulations and in the participation agreement. 1/ During negotiations,
agreement was reached on a draft participation agreement. As a condition for
loan effectiveness, the Bank would need to receive satisfactory participation
agreements between CBH and at least three financial intermediaries.
3.28      The participation agreement would provide, among other things, that
the intermediaries would (i) observe all the policies and regulations of
FONDEI; (ii) maintain or contract staff capable of appraising subprojects in
accordance with FONDEI's requirements; (iii) supervise the correct use of
funds by the subborrowers and the general performance of the beneficiary
company, without prejudice to supervision by FONDEI; (iv) ensure that procure-
ment and disbursement provisions are met; (v) maintain proper records of the
subloans financed under the proposed project; (vi) issue periodic reports on
the progress made on the subprojects; (vi) provide all reasonable information
requested by FONDEI and the Bank; (vii) comply with FONDEI's terms of financing
and repayment on each subloan, even if the final borrowers have not met their
financial obligations to the intermediary, when due; (viii) pay FONDEI imme-
diately all advance payments received from subborrowers; and (ix) provide
guidance to industrialists in preparing and monitoring preinvestment studies
needed for subproject preparation.
Commercial Banks
3.29      The commercial banks are expected to be as active as under the first
project, and to account for about 60--65% of subprojects, using about 85-90%
of the loan proceeds. Under the proposed project, commercial banks would be
encouraged to increase significantly their lending to SSEs, as well as to
strengthen their project appraisal and supervision capabilities (paras. 3.15
to 3.18). To this end, technical assistance would be provided to commercial
banks (para. 4.06), which would establish appropriate administrative mechanisms
and train further existing staff or hire new professional staff, as needed.
Commercial bank officers, with the experience under the first project and with
appropriate training, are expected tco carry out satisfactory subproject
appraisal and supervision in accordance with FONDEI's requirements, and also
to provide appropriate guidance to industrialists in the preparation of
investment subprojects.
CDI
3.30      To help ensure that appropriate technical assistance and credit
would be available to the smaller SSEs, CDI, the government's technical
assistance agency initially used mainly for artisan training and handicraft
promotion and sales, has been transformed by law into an autonomous institution.
Under this law, enacted in October 19,78, CDI would furnish a comprehensive
range of extension and promotional services, including technical assistance
for project preparation and implementation as well as financing to SSEs. In
fulfillment of its new and broader mandate, CDI established mechanisms to
1/   COHDEFOR would participate as a normal financial intermediary without
allocation of loan resources i(para. 3.33). For CONADI-s eventual
participation, see para. 3.36.



- 35 -
provide technical assistance to SSEs against a flat fee of not more than 2%
of the subloan requested by the SSE to any financial intermediary, and in 1980
also qualified as a financial intermediary under the First Industrial Credit
Project, after extensive internal reorganization and technical assistance
from UNIDO. CDI has been receiving government financial resources to cover
the major portion of its technical assistance and operating costs and the
counterpart funds required by FONDEI in subproject financing. These arrange-
ments would continue under the proposed project.
3.31      CDI's activities have been concentrated on providing technical
assistance to artisans and lately to SSEs, rather than on lending to those
groups. As of December 31, 1980, CDI's loan portfolio amounted to only
US$0.15 million. Since CDI's lending to SSEs under the first project started
during the second part of 1980, CDI has financed (as of May 15, 1981) only
13 subprojects under the first project, with average loan amount with FONDEI
resources of about US$13,000 and average total subproject investment of about
US$31,000. Currently, CDI has a pipeline of about 42 subprojects, with total
cost of about US$2.0 million. It is anticipated that CDI's lending to the
smaller SSEs would increase substantially under the proposed project (60-80
subprojects, using FONDEI resources for about US$2.0 million), since FONDEI
would be CDI's main source of funds for lending. CDI's experience under the
first project, the expected increasing efficiency of its operations as a result
of the technical assistance to be provided under the project (para. 4.07), and
revision of the guarantee fund by BCH (para. 3.38), would contribute to CDI's
projected lending increase. Furthermore, CDI expects to assist about 150-180
SSEs during the next 3 years in project preparation and follow-up technical
assistance.
3.32      While under the First Industrial Project CDI has provided reasonable
technical assistance to SSE's in preparing investment subprojects, its produc-
tivity as a whole (as measured in terms of number of artisans and SSEs assisted,
number of subproject appraisals/approvals, and man-months required) has been
rather low. Accordingly, an important objective of the proposed project would
be, in addition to helping ensure CDI's sound lending, to increase CDI's
efficiency by upgrading further its institutional capabilities and its staff
through appropriate technical assistance and training (para. 4.07). During
negotiations, agreement was reached on: (i) the government commitment to
provide CDI with adequate financial resources to enable CDI to carry out its
lending operations under the project and its technical assistance responsi-
bilities; and (ii) the timing, financing and nature of technical assistance
to CDI (para. 4.07), subject to final discussions with UNDP.
COHDEFOR
3.33      Although it is not part of the banking system, COHDEFOR has been
authorized to finance forest operations and primary and finished wood products
industries and to provide working capital and term credit to sawmills, recin-
ation plants, and exporters of wood products. Its loans to the sector as of
December 31, 1980 totalled US$7.5 million. COHDEFOR is presently lending
mainly to finance inventories, other short-term needs, and some exports.
Under the first project, CORDEFOR was expected to serve as a financial interme-
diary for a major component of the loan, with an initial allocation of US$6.0
million for forestry subproject financing. This reflected the importance of



- 36 -
the forestry subsector in Honduras and the expected active role of COHDEFOR in
the subsector. However, partly because of difficulties in getting COHDEFOR's
management interested in the project (resulting from management changes), and
failure to develop a capable project unit in COHDEFOR, its commitments under
the first project amounted to only US$0.23 million. 1/ Under the proposed
project it is expected that COHDEFOR would develop some modest term-lending
activities for forestry subprojects, participating as a normal intermediary
without specific loan allocation. As under the first project, COHDEFOR would
finance with loan proceeds only those enterprises in which COHDEFOR's equity
participation would be less than 70%.
CONADI
3.34      In 1974 the government took a significant step forward in providing
long-term resources for industrial investment through the creation of CONADI
to fill a gap in industrial equity and term financing, promote and help
develop a capital market, and facilitate joint ventures between the public
and private sectors in the development of large scale projects. CONADI's
total portfolio has grown rapidly to US$212.0 million as of December 31, 1980,
of which 51%, 28% and 21% are for contingent liabilities (mainly guarantees),
loans and equity investment, respectively (Annex 4, Tables 21 and 23). 2/
Because of lack of cash resources, CONADI's guarantee operations have grown
even more rapidly than its direct lending mainly during the last two years.
CONADI's exposure is concentrated on cement, sugarcane, food processing and
hotel operations (about 69% of its total portfolio). CONADI's debt and
contingent liabilities/equity ratio has grown to a high 16.4:1, and it has
shown modest profits during the last three years (Annex 4, Table 22). However,
these results are overestimated because CONADI does not make portfolio provi-
sions, except for about US$0.5 million reserved in 1979 (see also para. 3.35).
3.35      CONADI's current financial situation is difficult, with a US$11.5
million cash deficit expected during April-December, 1981 3/ (Annex 4,
Table 24). During the same period CONADI's operating income would represent
only about one-fourth of its operating expenses, and CONADI expects to pay
out an additional US$5.0 million in respect of its guarantees. About 13% of
CONADI's lending portfolio is in arrears, affecting about one-third of its
total lending portfolio, figures that are underestimated as CONADI has
frequently restructured loans in arrears (Annex 4, Table 23). The main causes
1/   The Bank reallocated to FONDEI, upon government request, the initial
COHDEFOR allocation net of the US$0.23 million. Commercial banks have
financed, however, about US$1.2 million to forestry firms under the first
project.
2/   While CONADI was included as a normal financial intermediary, it has not
participated actively in the first project (two subprojects, using loan
resources for about US$0.8 million) as of March 31, 1981. CONADI now has
a pipeline of subprojects of about US$26.0 million, of which about
one half could be eligible for financing under the proposed project.
3/   As estimated in April 1981,  More recent estimates indicate a signifi-
cantly higher cash deficit for this period.



of the current financial situation are: (i) CONADI has participated through
long-term loans and investments in several large scale subprojects (36% of its
assets), which may take many years to achieve profitability 1/, using commercial
foreign borrowing with short- and medium-term maturities; (ii) CONADI, using
also commercial foreign resources, has been lerLding medium term to subprojects
requiring longer maturities, and, consequently, many subprojects do not have
repayment capacity; (iii) a high percentage of firms with CONADI guarantee are
not repaying the secured loans, and CONADI has to pay them; and (iv) CONADI's
inadequate collecting system.
3.36      A UNDP-financed, UNIDO-executed study of CONADI's operational and
financial problems, is being carried out during the second half of 1981. 2/
The proposed project would support the government's efforts to re-establish
CONADI as a sound development finance institution. To this end, the project
would include a technical assistance component of US$250,000 with loan
resources, to help finance (along with UNDP money) the implementation of a
plan of action to be prepared taking into account the abovementioned study.
This technical assistance component would be contingent on (i) government/
Bank agreement on the action to be taken based on the first phase study-
recommendations; (ii) satisfactory arrangements being made for the execution
of the second stage; and (iii) CONADI making no new investment, lending or
guarantee operations until a decision is reached and agreed with the Bank on
what to do with the institution. Agreement on these conditions was reached
during negotiations. Furthermore, CONADI's participation as a financial
intermediary under the proposed project would be considered only when and if
its situation does eventually improve to a degree acceptable to the Bank.
D. Guarantee Fund
3.37      The guarantee fund was established by BCH in 1971 to encourage
lending by banks and financieras to SSEs. The fund covered only short-term
loans (one year) with loan amounts of up to US$12,500, and rediscounted
the secured loans. Most of the operations (95% of total guarantees granted)
were through BANAFOM (now BANADESA). The rather small size of such loans, as
well as the poor repayment records of loans guaranteed by the fund (50% of
outstanding loans were in default as of December 31, 1978, mainly because of
poor subproject preparation and lack of supervision and technical assistance),
the high cost of administration associated with small loans, and the one-year
limit of the guarantee discouraged other banks from utilizing the fund. The
fund has now been inactive for about two years. Under the first industrial
credit project, the Bank has encouraged BCH to revise the guarantee fund, and
lately BCH has examined how to fit and coordinate the fund activities
with FONDEI to foster increasing lending by financial intermediaries to SSEs.
1/   At least 10 enterprises in which CONADI has equity participation are
financially bankrupt or had closed operations. Total CONADI exposure
on these enterprises is about US$28.0 million.
2/   The analysis and recommendations focus on:  (i) a review at the enterprise
level of CONADI subprojects to determine how each should be handled, and
(ii) a review of CONADI as a whole to determine whether and how it should
be financially and operationally reorganized, if appropriate, as well as
how its current financial crisis could be resolved.



- '38 -
3.38      According to the revised regulations approved by the Board of
Directors of BCH, which are acceptable to the Bank (Annex 3), the fund would
provide guarantees (75% of the subborrower outstanding debt net of the amount
collected by the bank from the collateral), for a one-time charge to the
entrepreneur of 1.0% of the subloan amount. Eligible enterprises would be
those with fixed assets, excluding land and buildings but including a proposed
subproject, up to US$50,000 when f'inanced with the commercial banks' own
resources, and in accordance with FONIDEI's definition of SSEs (para. 3.09)
when financed through FONDEI. The commercial bank or financiera making the
subloan would initially determine whether a guarantee would be required (in
most cases when the appraised valtue of the collateral offered by the entrepre-
neur falls below about 160% of subloan amount). The proposed scheme would
permit banks to lower their loan coverage based on other guarantees, and open
the bank lending to a wider variety of smaller firms that would not otherwise
have had access to the banking system. In addition, as lack of collateral is
a constrain for lending to SSEs, and the fund would provide guarantees on
medium- and long-term loans granted to such enterprises, it is expected that
the fund would encourage commercial banks to increase lending to SSEs. The
fund, which would operate with a guarantee/own resources ratio of up to 10:1,
has a net capital of about US$0.75 mi'llion as of March 31, 1981. The guarantee
fee to be paid by the entrepreneurs would be part of the fund's own resources.
CBH has created a small unit to manage the fund (within its industrial depart-
ment), which also provides referral technical assistance services.
E. Cofinancing 1/
3.39      In the past, BCH has channeled to industrialists small amounts of
financing from export-credit agreements. BCH is currently trying to negotiate
export credit agreements with several countries. The first such agreement is
being formalized with Argentina, whic:h will provide a line of credit for
US$15.0 million equivalent for multi-sector use. BCH is hopeful that it will
be able to conclude similar agreements with Brazil and Mexico and has initiated
discussions with Japan. BCH expects that about US$5.0 million from these
lines of credit would be used to finance industrial projects. Some additional
cofinancing with foreign resources at: the subproject level is also expected to
be arranged by the participating commercial banks. However, such financing
will probably be for relatively short: maturities and be useful mainly for
financing imported raw materials. During negotiations, agreement was reached
on how the export-credit lines would be used in conjuntion with the proceeds
of the proposed loan to augment the resources available for financing indus-
trial subprojects.  The lines of credit would be administered by the Central
Bank's Credit Department and would be avilable to the Honduran commercial
banks. FONDEI and the Central Bank's Credit Department would advise indus-
trialists of the availabilty of the export credit lines and of their terms

include supplementary financing provided by other external sources to BCH
and/or commercial banks for iLndustrial financing.



- 39 -
and conditions, and would inform them how these resources could be used to
complement FONDEI loans, In these cases, because the credit lines require
tied procurement, FONDEI would ensure that industrialists would only use
these resources if the prices for goods and services procured through them
are competitive. FONDEI would also review the financing plans and sources of
funds for subprojects to ensure that cofinancing resources from the export-
credit lines would only substitute FONDEI's resources and not the amounts to
be provided by the participating intermediary and the investment enterprises
under FONDEI's Statement of Policies and Industrial Regulations.  It was also
agreed that the BCH would give the Bank an opportunity to review and comment
on the detailed operational guidelines to be developed for these cofinancing
arrangements.
IV. THE PROPOSED LOAN
A.  Pro-jet Cost and Financing Plan
4.01      Based on the demand for industrial financing that is expected during
the next 2-3 years (paras. 2.20, 2.21) for new subprojects and expansion of
existing enterprises, on the experience under the first project, and on the
estimate of FONDEI system capacity to channel term resources, the estimated
total cost of the proposed project, including technical assistance, is US$50.2
million equivalent. Overall, FONDEI expects to finance an average of about
70% of the total investment cost of subprojects, including foreign investment
cost estimated on average at about 60% of the total. I/ Since the financial
intermediaries would finance at least 10% of subproject investment costs,
beneficiaries would finance on average about 20% (at least 10% in the case of
expansion or modernization of existing enterprises and at least 25% in
the case of new projects). Table 4.1 below shows the expected total project
cost and financing plan of the proposed project. Additional cofinancing
resources would also be available (para. 3.39).

under the first industrial credit project, and on FONDEI's current
subproject pipeline.

B. Proposed Loan
Amount and Terms
4.02      The proposed Bank loan of US$30.0 million equivalent would provide:
(i) US$28.7 million for lending and (ii) US$1.3 million for financing technical
assistance to the government (as its cost sharing contribution to a UNDP program).
The loan would be made to the Republic of Honduras at the Bank's prevailing
interest rate when the President's Report is circulated to the Executive
Directors and at a standard commitment fee of 3/4 of 1% p.a. The government
would transfer the resources of the lending component to BCH's FONDEI, in the
same terms and conditions as the Bank loan to the government, for onlending
through financial intermediaries that meet FONDEI's conditions of participation
(paras. 3.27 and 3.28). The foreign exchange risk on the proposed loan
component for lending (primarily the cross currency exchange risk, since the
lempira is expected to maintain its parity with the US dollar) would be borne
by BCH. For this FONDEI would transfer to BCH an annual fee of 1.0% on the
balance of outstanding subloans with Bank resources. Out of the loan resources



- 41 -
(i) a minimum of US$4.0 million would be reserved for lending to SSEs; and
(ii) no more than US$7.5 million would be committed by any financial inter-
mediary, not including subloans to SSEs.
4.03      As under the first project, because the expected large number of
subloans would make a composite amortization schedule impractical, the loan
would be repaid in equal installments over a fixed 20-year term, including
5 years of grace. Any surplus of repayments from subloans over repayments due
to the Bank, that would result from the use of a fixed amortization schedule,
would permit FONDEI to build up term resources for lending to small and
medium-sized enterprises, in accordance with its Statement of Policies and
Industrial Regulations. To further capitalize FONDEI, BCH would make available
contributions as needed by FONDEI to support the local currency component of
its operations. A total of at least US$2.5 million equivalent in capital
contributions would be provided by December 31, 1983.
Relending Terms and Conditions
4.04      Subloans under the proposed project would be consistent with FONDEI's
Statement of Policies and Industrial Regulations, including investment items,
interest rate, maturity and subloan limits (paras. 3.08 to 3.14). All sub-
project appraisals submitted by the financial intermediaries would be reviewed
by FONDEI, which would calculate the economic rate of return for all sub-
projects requiring financing of US$250,000 or more. Based on FONDEI's appraisal
performance under the first project, FONDEI's free limit would be raised from
US$250,000 to US$400,000 with loan resources. Prior Bank approval would be
required for all subloans above the free limit. This procedure is expected to
result in a review by the Bank of some 30-35 subprojects covering 40-50% of
the proposed loan amount. In addition, selected subloans below the free limit
would be reviewed on a post-appraisal basis by field supervision missions.
Technical Assistance
4.05      The technical assistance component of the project would be a compre-
hensive program of direct technical assistance and training for FONDEI, commer-
cial banks, CDI and CONADI. The estimated total cost of the technical assis-
tance would be about US$2.8 million of which about US$1.3 million equivalent
is expected to be covered by a UNDP grant financing and the balance by the
government using up to US$1.3 million of loan resources to cover its cost
sharing contribution. It is expected that the technical assistance program
would require about 273 man-months of consultant services, which have an
estimated total cost of about US$1.9 million. The average man-month cost
(based on the individuals' fees, international travel and local allowances)
is expected to be about US$7,000. Additional costs (local office, support
services, local transportation, etc.), which are expected to be about US$0.2
million, would be covered by the government.
4.06      The proposed loan technical assistance component of US$1.3 million
would provide (along with additional UNDP funds) US$0.35 million for FONDEI to
hire experienced consultants to: (i) prepare material for the use of FONDEI,
financial intermediaries and private consultants in subproject preparation,
appraisal, and supervision; (ii) carry out a training program for FONDEI and



- 42 -
financial intermediaries staff, through total immersion seminars (five 7-day
seminars and five 2-day follow-up seminars with about 100-120 total partici-
pants), during 1982-84, and through visits to foreign DFC's, to complement the
activities outlined in (i) above; (iii) upgrade FONDEI's financial planning,
its information/control system, loan administration and operating/disbursement
procedures; (iv) analyze technical aspects and carry out market and subsectoral
studies as background material for su'bproject appraisal; and (v) strengthen.
and broaden the services offered by t'he BCH's industrial department through
its "laboratorio de analisis quimico". I/
4.07      The loan also would provide US$0.7 million for technical assistance
for CDI to cover consultancy costs to (i) upgrade CDI's financial planning,
information system, loan administration and control, and operating procedures;
(ii) design and implement an efficient system to provide technical assistance
to SSEs; (iii) provide administrative, technical or marketing assistance to
predefined subsectors or groups of SSEs and artisans; and (iv) carry out
training for its staff in technological and administrative matters and in
subproject promotion. 2/ UNDP is expected to provide an additional amount of
about US$0.7 million for this technical assistance to CDI, with UNIDO being
the executing agency. The balance of the loan portion for technical assistance,
US$0.25 million, would be made available to assist CONADI to implement a plan
of action that would be agreed with the Bank, based on the recommendations of
the study of its financial situation to be carried out by UNDP-financed
consultants (para. 3.36). During negotiations agreement was reached on:
(a) the scope, timing and components of the technical assistance and training
programs to FONDEI and CDI and their financing; (b) the arrangements for
the execution of the technical assistance portion to FONDEI, and (c) the
conditions for the technical assistance to CONADI (para. 3.36).
Procurement
4.08      The proceeds of the loan would finance the foreign exchange
costs of imported and locally procured equipment, materials, civil works and
services. Consulting services for subprojects or technical assistance services
for the project would be open to international recruitment. Participating
intermediaries would satisfy themselves that procurement items were suitable
for the respective investment projects and reasonably priced, and that the
beneficiaries had canvassed the main sources of supply and were purchasing
from the most advantageous source. Whenever justified, items would be procured
on the basis of at least three different quotations. Since it may be difficult
or relatively costly to obtain quotations from several suppliers in the case
of small orders, the solicitation of three offers would be mandatory for
single items exceeding US$50,000 equivalent. All subproject appraisals would
include a discussion of procurement procedures used, responses received,
prices quoted and criteria for selection of suppliers.

enterprises.
2/   Subproject preparation, appraisal and supervision would be included
in the FONDEI portion (para. 4.06).

Commitment and Disbursement
4.09      The final date for submission of subloan proposals would be December 31,
1984, and the closing date for disbursements June 30, 1986 (Annex 4, Table 25).
For subloans to small industrial enterprises with fixed assets of US$150,000
and under (excluding land and buildings but including the new fixed investments
under a proposed subproject), the Bank would reimburse FONDEI for 75% of
FONDEI's total financing of individual subprojects representing their average
foreign exchange content. Disbursement for small industry subprojects would
be on the basis of a statement of expenditures, supported by a list of subloan
disbursements submitted by FONDEI, who would retain the supporting documentation
in Honduras for inspection during Bank supervision missions. For medium-sized
industry subprojects, full documentation would be required, and the Bank would
disburse for (i) 100% of foreign expenditures for directly imported machinery,
equipment, raw material inventories and services, or 70% of local expenditures
for locally procured imported goods; (ii) 50% of the ex-factory price of
locally manufactured machinery and equipment representing the average foreign
exchange content; and (iii) 35% of investments in industrial buildings and
related civil works representing the average foreign exchange content. For
the technical assistance component of the loan, the Bank would disburse for
100% of foreign expenditures in respect of the costs of consultants and other
services.
4.10      Since the two-tier system involving FONDEI and the financial interme-
diaries (including CDI for SSE lending) requires a longer time for processing
of subprojects than is usual for IDF-type loans, disbursements would be made
for expenditures incurred up to 180 days prior to the receipt by the Bank of
the subloan requests, in lieu of the normal 90 days limit. Retroactive
financing up to US$1.5 million would be permitted for financing expenditures
incurred between September 1, 1981 and the date of signing of the loan agree-
ment. This is to ensure continuity of lending for medium-sized enterprises,
since FONDEI had virtually fully committed its resources under Loan 1659-HO
(Annex 4, Table 20).
Accounting, Auditing and Reports
4.11      FONDEI would continue to maintain separate project accounts as
established for the first project, in accordance with accounting principles
consistently applied and in a form satisfactory to the Bank. Under the first
project, FONDEI's accounts were audited by BCH's Auditoria Externa, and while
the first audit report was poor, the second was improved considerably and was
of acceptable quality. Under the proposed project, FONDEI's accounts would be
audited annually by Superintendencia de Bancos or by independent auditors
acceptable to the Bank. FONDEI's annual financial statements would include a
balance sheet, statement of income and expenses, a statement of sources and
application of funds and the transactions of the project account. Supplemen-
tary data on project objectives, operations, quality of portfolio, and scope
and quality of work carried out by FONDEI and the financial intermediaries
under the project would also be provided. The audit report would express
an opinion as to the reliability of the statements of expenditures to support
claims for disbursements, and specifically whether such claims are supported
by adequate documentation and reflect properly the expenditures eligible for



- 44 -
financing under the loan agreement, and the adequacy of corresponding internal
controls. The audit reports with scope and format satisfactory to the Bank
would be submitted to the Bank not later than four months after the end of
each FONDEI fiscal year. FONDEI would forward to the Bank periodic reports
on its financial situation and operations based on its information system
(para. 3.06).
C. Project Benefits and Risks
4.12      The proposed project would help fill a gap in the financing of
efficient industrial projects in Honduras at a time when the financial system
lacks long-term resources to cover incLustrial investment needs. On the basis
of experience with the first project, the proposed project is expected to
finance some 200-225 investment subprojects involving total investment costs
of about US$47.4 million, focussing onI a wide range of small and medium-sized
enterprises. The ERR of individual subprojects is likely to exceed 25%
based on the experience under the first project. In addition, based also on
the experience under the first project, 1/ the subprojects to be financed are
expected to have a substantial employmient impact, generating a total of about
4,200 new jobs, at an average total investment cost per job of about US$11,300
in 1981 prices. Indirect employment: impact is also expected to be significant,
due to domestic linkages, as the bulk of financing is expected to go to those
subsectors which depend mainly on domestic raw materials.
4.13      In addition to supporting the government's development policies, the
proposed project would strengthen the country's productive capacity and thus
help sustain the financial burden of p)hysical infrastructure and social
development projects in the country. Based on results under the first project,
total output of the subprojects is estimated at about US$44.0 million a
year (an investment annual output value ratio of about 1:1), of which about
US$14.0 million would be for export. The impact of the project would be
geographically dispersed, with agro-industrial subprojects focussed mainly
along the north coast and southwest region of the country and other manufac-
turing subprojects located mainly in the cities of San Pedro Sula and
Tegucigalpa. Based on results of the first project and on FONDEI's subproject
pipeline, the bulk of the financing is expected to go to the food, chemicals,
apparel, metal mechanics, and wood subsectors.
4.14      The project is expected to continue the positive institution develop-
ment impact initiated under the first project. It would focus on the strengthen-
ing of the overall FONDEI system, by widening financial intermediation and
supporting FONDEI's efforts to build-up subproject appraisal and supervision
capabilities of participating intermediaries. The technical assistance
services and lending to SSEs are expected to be strengthened considerably.
In this context, alternatives for investment decisions would be provided to
small industrialists, as the project through CDI would encourage the building
of a subproject generating system within the country.
1/   Ex-post data on 44 subprojectss (Annex 4, Table 16).



- 45 -
4.15      The proposed project, as conceived, does not involve any unusual
risks. However, because uncertainty does exist about the degree to which
financial intermediaries would increase their lending to the smaller firms,
and because some of the institutional arrangements established under the
project would be new, especially the increased responsibilities of interme-
diaries for project appraisal and supervision, some delays in subloan process-
ing may occur. The unsettled political situation in Central America may also
cause some firms to postpone investment decisions. The technical assistance
and training component, BCH's guarantee fund, the emphasis given to
strengthen subproject supervision procedures, and the focus of the project on
small and medium-sized enterprises (that overall are less likely to be suscep-
tible to political events than larger firms in Honduras), would contribute to
reducing project risks, including the risk that external resources would be
substituted for internally generated funds reinvested elsewhere.

Page 2 of 8
(b) to meet payment of all costs and commissions arising out of its
own activities; and
(c) to effect any other financial transactions connected with
its appointed objectives.
4.        FONDEI shall designate a maximum limit on the financing to be
made available for investment projects, a limit which shall be cumulative,
taking account of the size of the debit balance on previous FONDEI loans
made.
5.        All subloans shall be expressed in lempiras.  The Central Bank
of Honduras shall cover the exchange risk associated with FONDEI operations,
prescribing the conditions which are to apply.
6.        Projects for which financing is sought shall be judged on the
following criteria:
- economic and financial rates of return;
- use of labor;
- increase or savings in foreign exchange;
-  likelihood of increasing the percentage of value added;
- use of Honduran raw materials, goods and services;
- other financial and technical factors, depending on the
nature of the particular project; and
- repayment capacity.
7.        FONDEI shall operate for an indefinite period and shall be financed
to carry out the purposes for which it is being set up. It shall employ

in conjunction with financial intermediaries and subborrowers, and to that
end it shall establish the appropriate structure for participation.
11.       The interest rates payable by borrowers and the differentials to
financial intermediary institutions shall be as set by FONDEI and the
Central Bank. Such rates shall cover FONDEI's financing and operating
