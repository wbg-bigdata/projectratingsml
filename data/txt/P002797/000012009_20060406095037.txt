Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited  Proposed 132 kV Transmission Line from Moshi to Arusha
Distribution and Transmission Rehabilitation roject           Resettlement Action Plan

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Backg round
The backbone of the electricity su ply system in the Arusha and Kilimanjaro regions of
northern Tanzania is a 132 kV trans ission line between Kiyungi substation near Moshi and
Njiro substation in Arusha municipal . The system is connected to the national grid at Njiro
substation. The high voltage tran mission line is carried by self-supporting steel lattice
towers and is located in an existin wayleave or right of way (ROW) between Moshi and
Arusha. The existing high voltage t nsmission system between Moshi and Arusha does not
provide for a reliable supply of bul power to Moshi and the Kilimanjaro area. It will be
unable to meet the forecast growt in demand in Arusha and Kilimanjaro regions and
additional high voltage bulk suppl to Moshi as well as rehabilitation of the existing
distribution network is urgently need d.
The Tanzania Electric Supply C mpany Limited (TANESCO) and the International
Development Association  are  c rently  preparing  a project, the  Distribution  and
Transmission Rehabilitation Project Dar as Salaam, Moshi and Arusha (DTRP), to improve
the supply of electricity to consume  in parts of Dar es Salaam and around and between
Moshi and Arusha in northern Tan ania. The project aims to reduce the duration and
frequency of power interruptions, i prove the voltage conditions at consumers' premises
and reduce power system losses.
The project design for the Moshi and Arusha areas includes the construction of an additional
132 kV transmission line between M shi and Arusha, parallel to the existing 132 kV line, the
constnuction of a new 132/33/11 kV  ubstation near Kilimanjaro Intemational Airport (KIA),
30 km west of Moshi, the constructiin of new 33/11 kV substations and the construction or
rehabilitation of medium and low vol ge distribution lines. The proposed transmission line
will pass through parts of Moshi  ural, Hai and Arumeru districts and part of Anusha
municipality. It will mainly pass thr ugh fairly sparsely populated rural areas where crop
farming and livestock rearing are the  ain economic activities. It will pass through a number
of villages and sub-villages.
The proposed second 132 kV trans ission line, which will also be carried by steel lattice
towers for nearly all its length, will  quire an additional ROW. TANESCO will need to
acquire this land and this will displac a number of households that are currently living in or
using land in the ROW within Hai a  Arumeru districts. This will require the provision of
resettlement and/or compensation  easures.  In order to reduce the need for land
acquisition and to reduce displac  ent TANESCO    is proposing to locate the new
transmission line on part of the exi ting ROW, parallel to the existing transmission line.
However, the existing ROW will need to be widened by 10 m (on one side) to accommodate
both lines. Displacement will still o cur. New substations require little land and it is not
expected that their construction will cause much, if any, displacement. TANESCO has
agreed that, after construction, the o iginal users of the acquired land within the new ROW
may continue to use the land for  owing crops and for livestock grazing provided that
certain conditions are adhered to, in uding that tall crops and trees that may interfere with
the transmission line may not be grov .
The final 1,5 km section of the existir ROW into Njiro substation passes through a built-up
urban area with high value properties nd acquisition of even a 10 m strip of land in this area
would cause a significant amount of displacement and disturbance. Therefore, it is being
proposed for this section that the e isting and new transmission lines will be carried, as
double circuits, by a single line of ste lantice towers entirely within the existing ROW.

Tanzania Electric Supply Company Llmited  Proposed 132 k V Transmission Line from Moshi to Arusha
Distribution and Transmission Rehabilitation Project        Resettlement Action Plan
(Dar es Salaam, Moshi and Arusha)                           Revised November 2005
Involuntary resettlement
In Tanzania many projects, including the construction of high voltage transmission lines,
environmental studies have, in terms of the legislation, to be undertaken to deal with the bio-
physical and social environmental impacts of the project. If the studies find that the project
will displace people and property appropriate arrangements have to be included in the
environmental management plan for their compensation and/or resettlement.  The
compensation and resettlement plan may be presented as a separate but complimentary
document to the other environmental studies.
Before the implementation of a project subject to environmental assessment may commence
the developer or proponent is required to be issued with an environmental permit by the
Minister responsible for the environment, on the recommendation of the National
Environment Management Council after its review and approval of the environmental
studies, including the compensation and resettlement component or plan where applicable.
For projects that receive support from the World Bank (WB) group and displace people from
land or productive resources the Bank requires that the projects are subject to the
requirements of its Operational Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (OP 4.12). Displacement
may be physical. economic, social or cultural resulting in relocation or loss of shelter, loss of
assets or access to assets important to production, loss of income sources or means of
livelihood or loss of access to locations that provide higher incomes or lower expenditures to
business people. It is applied even when affected people are not required to physically
relocate from affected land. WB OP 4.12 requires that a resettlement plan (sometimes
referred to as a resettlement action plan) be prepared to meet the requirements of the WB
and Govemment of the United Republic of Tanzania (GOT).
This Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) covers that part of the DTRP that will be implemented
around and between Moshi and Arusha. The RAP is intended to be an agreed commitment
by the parties involved, i.e. TANESCO, the GOT and the affected people, for resolving the
displacement and resettlement and/or compensation issues of the project and for ensuring
that displaced persons (DPs) are left no worse off than they were before commencement of
the project. The RAP:
*     lays down the agreed principles that will apply to the resettlement and/or
compensation exercise:
*     describes the legal and institutional framework for dealing with displacement;
*     identifies. as far as possible, those people currently living within proposed ROWs and
who will suffer losses;
*     provides a general socio-economic profile of the people living in areas where
displacement is likely to occur;
*     estimates the nature and magnitude of displacement;
*     sets out the criteria used to determine eligibility for resettlement, compensation
and/or other assistance and what entitlements are due to different categories of DPs
and for different types of losses;
*     indicates how affected assets of individual DPs are valued;
*     describes how resettlement and/or compensation entitlements will be delivered;
*     describes mechanisms for maximising stakeholder participation and for airing
grievances; and
*     provides an indication of the costs involved.
An independent sociologist was engaged by TANESCO to carry out, separately to the
preparation of the RAP, public consultation meetings with the affected people and other

interested parties and to describe t e socio-economic characteristics of the affected areas'.
The results of the socio-economic tudies were included in a full environmental and social
assessment (ESIA) prepared by TANESCO in April 2005 which has been the principal
source of socio-economic informatio for the RAP.
TANESCO also engaged a register d property valuation team to identify affected properties
and households in the ROW, to in pect affected properties and assets and to determine
compensation payments to the affe ted households.
The overall objective of the resettl Eent and compensation component of the DTRP is to
displace as few people, businesse  and institutions as possible. Where displacement is
unavoidable the objective is to ens re that sufficient investment resources are appropriately
allocated by TANESCO to ensure th it DPs are provided with:
*     adequate and appropriate c rnpensation for assets, including land, lost;
*     compensation for the loss of business profits; and
*     other measures to assist  Ps to restore their livelihoods and regain and ideally
improve their pre-project living standards.
The RAP has identified a number of rinciples which will be followed.
The affected people and expected losses
The field inspection and valuation eercise undertaken by the registered property valuation
company in March and April 200 determined that 516 individual property units will be
affected by the creation of the 10 in extension to the existing ROW. In Hai district 212
properties will be affected while in Arumeru district 304 properties will be affected. Affected
land units comprise 333 crop farm or plots on which standing crops were present at the
time of inspection, 22 pastoral lot , 160 parcels of land on which there were no crops
present (i.e. non-agricultural units) and one institution (i.e. a bible college in Mlangarini
village in Arumeru district). No sig ificant business were identified. Most of the property
owners are local households and th estimated affected population is 2 308 people. Most of
the affected land is held under cust rnary tenure although there are six land units in Arumeru
district that have registered title.

All five hundred and sixteen househ Ids will lose residential and/or productive land, covering
a total area of nearly 67 ha. This r resents a loss of an asset and will require the physical
relocation of some households. H wever, TANESCO will allow limited continued use of
much of the affected land after cons ruction of the new transmission line.
Sixty three households (including th bible college in Mlangarini village) have a total of 124
buildings and structures on their af ected land in the ROW and will have to abandon these
structures when their rights to occ py the affected land are extinguished. Eight of these
buildings belong to the bible colleg . Fifty five of the 63 affected households will lose their
main residential units (i.e. hou es) and so will have to abandon their present

accommodation. Ten affected home owners in Hai district will not have any surplus land
outside of the ROW while most of the remaining residents have spare land adjacent to the
ROW and will probably be able to re-build their houses on such land. Houses are mainly
constructed from mud and wattle with grass thatch roofs while there are also better quality
houses made from bricks and iron sheeting roofing material.
Owners of the 333 farms and plots with standing annual and/or perennial crops on them will
also lose these assets and will, therefore, suffer the loss of their means of livelihood or
sources of income.
A total of 13 graves are within the proposed ROW and will probably need to be exhumed
and re-buried. No affected community or social infrastructure or property was identified
during the inspection exercise.
In summary, 55 households will lose land. their accommodation and other buildings. Seven
households will lose land and buildings but not houses. A total of 453 households will lose
land only, without infrastructure. The bible college will lose land and buildings.

Legal framework
Land issues in mainland Tanzania are mainly governed by the Land Act (No. 4 of 1999), the
Village Land Act (No. 5 of 1999) and the Land Acquisition Act (No. 47 of 1967). All land in
Tanzania is public land and remains vested in the President as trustee for and behalf of the
citizens of Tanzania. Occupation and use of land in Tanzania is legally recognised if a
person or entity has a granted "right of occupancy' (long-term leasehold), if a person in an
urban or peri-urban area has acquired land or has been occupying land as a primary
residence for long periods of time (recognised long-standing occupancy) or, in rural areas, if
a person has been occupying and using land in accordance with customary norms (i.e.
deemed right of occupancy). The latter is the most common form of land occupation in the
project area.
The President may be made to acquire land for any estate or term where such land is
needed for any public purpose. Where a person's right of occupancy, or recognised long-
standing occupation, or customary use of land is revoked or otherwise interfered with to his
or her detriment the Land Act requires that full and fair compensation must be paid for the
value of un-exhausted improvements on the land being occupied and for grazing land and
for any damage to trees, crops and buildings resulting from the creation of, for example, a
ROW. For the DTRP the law requires that responsibility for paying compensation will rest
with TANESCO. Compensation has, normally, to be monetary but may include replacement
of land and buildings, the provision of plants and seedlings and supplies of grain and basic
foodstuffs in certain circumstances. WB OP 4.12 also prefers the provision of replacement
land and housing to DPs rather than the provision of cash compensation.  However,
because of the linear length of the affected area (i.e. the ROW) and the real possibility of
affected people being able to relocate over very short distances, provision of replacement
land is unlikely to be the best alternative for the project. Where monetary compensation is
provided in terms of Tanzanian law it should include:

Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited  Proposed 132 k V Transmission Line from Moshi to Arusha
Distribution and Transmission Rehabilitation roject          Resettlement Action Plan
(Dares Salaam, Moshi and Arusha)                              Revised November 2005
*     the market value of real prop rty;
*     a disturbance allowance;
*     transport allowance;
*     loss of profits or accommoda on;
*     the cost of acquiring or gettin the subject land; and
*     any other cost loss or capital xpenditure incurred to the development of the subject
land.
The methods for calculating the com ensation payable for each of these are explained in the
Land Regulations of 2000. WB OP .12 generally requires that compensation be based on
replacement cost rather than on t e open market values as required in the Tanzania
legislation. In the area affected b the proposed transmission line there is a weak but
growing land market but the replac ment cost method has been used as a surrogate for
market value. The law also require that compensation be paid to DPs within six months
after the affected properties have b  n valued and if the payment is delayed for any time
after this period interest has to be pa .
The Ministry of Lands and Human Settlement Development (MLHSD) is responsible for
policy, regulation and co-ordination  atters pertaining to land in Tanzania. It administers the
Land Acquisition Land Acts and  dministers most land issues to do with allocation,
acquisition, registration, compensati  and management in general.
Resettlement and compensation e titlements
All owners of the 516 properties loc ed within the proposed 10 m extension to the existing
ROW are eligible for resettlement an compensation measures. Only one principal category
of eligible people has been identifie i.e. property owners. No "squatters" or" encroachers'
on the 10 m extension to the ROW have been identified. Four sub-categories of eligible
households or entities have been ide tified. These include:
*     55 owners of farms or plots w h houses and other buildings in the ROW;
*     7 owners of farms or plots wit non-residential buildings in the ROW;
*     453 owners of farms or plots ithout buildings in the ROW; and
*     1 institution with buildings in t e ROW
In accordance with Tanzanian law  onetary compensation will be provided to eligible DPs.
Compensation will apply to all DPs r gardless of whether or not there is need for the DPs to
relocate to another area or to re- rrange on the remaining part of their affected land.
Compensation and resettlement en tlements will be granted as shown in the entitlement
matrix (overleaf).  Between Mar   and June 2005 affected households completed
compensation claim submission for s. These were checked by independent valuers and
compensation rates and awards det mined and agreed to. Individual entitlement packages
have been determined on a case-b case basis as part of the valuation exercise and have
been described in individual compen ation schedules.
For losses of residential and product e land affected households will be paid compensation
to enable them to acquire replacem t land. It is expected that relocation will be within the
local vicinity as much as possible. The need for affected households to be given
replacement land (and houses) in Ii u of cash compensation is not anticipated. However,
assistance will be given to househo s who request help in finding alternative land and in
negotiating purchase prices. A distu ance allowance will be paid to DPs to alleviate social
problems and physical hardship. Th  is calculated by multiplying the assessed value of the
affected land (not assets) by the  erage percentage of interest offered by commercial
banks on twelve month fixed deposit  This is currently 4%.

Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited  Proposed 132 kV Transmission Line from Moshi to Arusha
Distribution and Transmission Rehabiltation Project          Resettlement Action Plan
(Dar es Salaam. Moshi and Arusha)                            Revised November 2005
Land compensation values have been determined on the basis of the earning potential of
the farm unit, primarily crop and livestock production for different climatic areas and soil
types. The cost of preparation of new land is implicit in the valuation rates adopted.
Compensation will also be given for the loss of houses and other infrastructure to enable
displaced households to either purchase replacement structures or construct these
themselves on the residual part of their plots not affected by the ROW or on new plots
acquired elsewhere. Affected households will be able to salvage building material from their
old houses and buildings. Valuation of houses and buildings has been based on the
replacement cost method, making allowances for condition and depreciation.
In addition to cash compensation for houses, the 55 households who will lose their main
residential buildings will also receive an accommodation allowance to allow them to rent
other accommodation while they are either waiting to purchase a new property or while they
are constructing a replacement house. The accommodation allowance is based on the
assessed market rent for the abandoned property over a period of 36 months. In addition,
these households will also be entitled to a transport allowance to enable them to move their
furniture and other goods. The transport allowance is calculated as the cost of moving 12 t
of goods over a distance of 20 km.
Compensation will also be paid to affected households that lose standing crops.  In
assessing the value of compensation, the eamings approach has been used. A list of rates
was determined and approved by the relevant district valuers. The production capacity of an
average tended crop that is normally found in the area was estimated in order to determine
the annual value of the crop. This was then capitalised at an average bank rate.
Interest on compensation payments made more than six months after acquisition of the
property will be calculated as the average percentage rate of interest offered by commercial
banks on fixed deposits until the compensation is paid.
With respect to graves, the project will cover the costs of performing the necessary
ceremonies and rituals.
It is possible that some persons or entities may suffer unforeseen or unplanned damage to
their property by construction teams. In most cases these will be temporary losses.
Affected parties will be able to claim compensation from the responsible contractor.
Particularly vulnerable people will be given special assistance, in cash and kind, on a case-
by-case basis.
The DPs are part of the individual local communities in which they currently live or operate.
As it is not expected that DPs will be moving very far they will continue to remain within their
respective communities and there are unlikely to be any significant social impacts associated
with the compensation and relocation exercise. It is not foreseen that there will be any major
issues related to integration into host populations.
Implementation of the resettlement action plan
TANESCO is responsible for implementing the RAP and delivering entitlements to DPs. The
Project Co-ordinator of the DTRP in the Projects Directorate of TANESCO has overall
responsibility for implementation of the RAP but staff from the Corporate Planning and
Research Directorate are also involved. TANESCO has employed the services of external
specialists to prepare many elements of the resettlement and compensation component of
the DTRP already. These have included the registered property valuation company which
has identified affected households and properties, served notices on DPs, compiled

compensation schedules for each  P and determined the amount of compensation to be
paid. It is expected that, where n essary, such an arrangement will continue. For the
implementation of activities that st I have to be undertaken it is believed that there is
sufficient and adequate capacity wit n TANESCO to undertake these activities.
A Compensation Committee should be formed within TANESCO to include staff from the
Directorate of Projects, the Directora e of Corporate Planning and Research, The Directorate
of Finance, the Directorate of Syst m Control and Transmission, the Company Secretary
and representatives from the resp ctive regional offices. This committee will guide the
DTRP Project Co-ordinator who w I link also with a Compensation Steering Committee
(CSC).which should be established to co-ordinate the implementation of the RAP and to
review progress. The CSC shoul comprise representatives from: TANESCO; Hai and
Arumeru district administrations (e. district executive directors); the Ministry of Energy and
Minerals; and MLHSD.
Many activities have already been u dertaken. These include:
*     the inspection of affected  roperties and households by the registered property
valuation company in March and April 2005, with a reference number assigned to
each DP:
*     serving notice on DPs (on th prescribed Land Form No. 14) and on other interested
parties;
*     the submission by DPs of cc pleted compensation claims (on the prescribed Land
Form Nos. 15 and 16);
*     the determination of compen ation rates for specific items (including land, buildings
and crops) for different area and submission of these to the relevant district valuers
for approval;
*     the  determination  of in idual compensation  entitlements  and  values  of
compensation by the register d property valuation company;
*     the production of a valuatio report, submitted to the Chief Government Valuer in
MLHSD for approval;
*    . the compilation of individual ompensation schedules, indicating the breakdown and
total amount of compensatio to be paid to each claimant, forwarded to TANESCO
and to the respective district land officers (the compensation schedules have to be
countersigned by the releva t village leader, ward executive officer, district lands
officer, district commissioner nd regional commissioner).
A number of additional activities will eed to be implemented. These include:
*     a socio-economic survey b  undertaken of the affected households in order to
provide a baseline for futu monitoring and evaluation of the resettlement and
compensation component of e project. It is important that this be carried out before
any compensation and/or p ysical relocation is implemented. Particular attention
should be paid to vulnerab e households (e.g. households headed by children,
widows, the elderly, the ill an the handicapped);
*     payment, after approval    the compensation   schedules, by TANESCO    of
compensation amounts to t e Lands Officers at district level who will then pay
compensation cheques to th eligible beneficiaries. Legally, payment must be made
within six months of serving n tices on DPs otherwise interest has to be paid;
*     signing for receipt of the entitl ments on the compensation schedules;
*     relocation of affected househ Ids and removal of salvage material from the ROW;
*     issuing of permits to house  Ids allowed to continue to use the ROW for certain
purposes, such as crop prod tion; and

*      instituting a progress monitoring system.
The main outstanding activities include the payment of compensation and the relocation of
affected people, which is expected to take place over a six month period. No construction
should commence until compensation has been completed and DPs afforded the opportunity
to find alternative land and accommodation, as applicable, and to salvage materials from
abandoned property.
An indicative time schedule for activities still to be undertaken is shown below. It is assumed
that the delivery of entitlements (e.g. entitlements) to DPs will commence before March or
April 2006, i.e. within twelve months of the valuation of properties which took place in March
and April 2005.    It is expected that implementation of activities which still need to be
undertaken (including the self-relocation of DPs to new sites) will not exceed ten months
from the time that the payment of compensation begins.

A number of public communication meetings have been held with people living in affected
areas along the proposed ROW and it is recommended that existing communication
mechanisms, through the relevant district, ward and village officials and leaders, should be
maintained to ensure that DPs are fully involved in RAP implementation.
The Land Act provides for grievances related to land acquisition and compensation issues in
respect of the creation of a ROW to be brought to the High Court of Tanzania. However, this
is difficult, expensive and impractical for most of the residents within the project area. It is
suggested that any such issues be brought to the attention of the village leadership which
will forward unresolved issues to the ward executive officer and then the district executive
director. They, in addressing any grievances, should consult with TANESCO, the Ministry of
Energy and Minerals, the valuation teams, councillors and ward and village officers and
leaders. If a dispute cannot be resolved it can be brought before the local courts and if the
local courts cannot solve the matter application can be made to the High Court of Tanzania
for resolution, this decision being final.
The need for monitoring and evaluation implementation and the impacts of the resettlement
and compensation component of the DTRP is discussed in the RAP. It should be part of the
monitoring and evaluation process designed for the overall project as laid out by the ESIA
report prepared by TANESCO for the DTRP. It includes impacts, mitigation measures,
indicators, means of verification and responsibilities for monitoring. External monitoring and
evaluation should be conducted through WB missions deployed to monitor and evaluate the
overall DTRP.

Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited  Proposed 132 kV Transmission Line from Moshi to Arusha
Distribution and Transmission Rehabilitation roject            Resettlement Action Plan
(Dar es Salaam, Moshi and Arusha)                              Revised November 2005
1     INTRODUCTION
1.1   BACKGROUND
Nearly all the generation, transmiss n and distribution of electricity in mainland Tanzania is
undertaken by the Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited (TANESCO). TANESCO is a
public company that is wholly owne by the Government of the United Republic of Tanzania
(GOT). TANESCO is responsible fol about 98% of the country's electricity supply.
The demand for electrical power in anzania has been increasing rapidly due to the growing
economic and social situation in the country. The average growth of the customer base
since 2000 is between 6% and 9%   However, power outages and deterioration of power
quality (i.e. under voltage), and tec -nical and non-technical losses have also increased in
spite of recent efforts taken so fa by the TANESCO management. This is due to the
overload experienced in some sub ations and ageing distribution networks. This situation
calls for urgent major maintenan e and upgrading of the existing transmission and
distribution systems and developme t of new sources of electricity.
In 2002 TANESCO, in collaboratio with the Japanese International Co-operation Agency,
prepared a master plan to improve t e power situation in Dar es Salaam and the main towns
of Kilimanjaro and Arusha regions in the north of the country. The master plan outlined
areas of priority and investments n eded to solve the frequent power outages experienced.
Further, TANESCO undertook sev ral studies, including the Relief Project II, prepared by
NETGroup Solutions (Pty) Ltd of S uth Africa in 2004, as well as a feasibility study for the
Reinforcement and Upgrade of the Dar es Salaam, Kilimanjaro and Arusha Transmission
and Distribution Systems, prepare  by Lahmeyer Intemational of Germany in December
2004.  These studies identified piority areas and the type of investment needed by
TANESCO to optimally utilise the av ailable resources to achieve desired objectives.
Based on the above studies TANEk 0 has consulted various financiers to seek assistance
in implementing different compone s of the master plan. The World Bank (WB) is one of
the financing institutions that is int rested in supporting TANESCO. TANESCO and the
International Development Associa ion (IDA) are currently preparing the Distribution and
Transmission Rehabilitation Project Dar es Salaam, Moshi and Arusha (DTRP) as a follow-
on component of the Songo Songo as Development and Power Generation Project (credit
3569-TA)2. The DTRP aims to impr ve the reliability and the quality of electric power supply
to consumers in Dar es Salaam an in and around Arusha and Moshi in northem Tanzania.
The project is intended to achieve th following objectives:
*     reduction of the duration and frequency of power interruptions;
*     improvement of voltage con tions at consumers' premises; and
*     reduction of power system lo ses.
In northem Tanzania the DTRP    11 be implemented in Kilimanjaro and Arusha regions
(Figure 1). Kilimanjaro region lies long the north-eastem border between Tanzania and
Kenya and has a population of nea y 1.4 million people (2002 census). The town of Moshi,
with a population of around 144 00 people, is the regional capital and is the centre of both
an important agricultural region and he Kilimanjaro tourist area.
2The Songo Songo Project was implemen ed during the late 1990s to improve the availability of electricity in
Tanzania, and in Dar es Salaam in particul r It involved the development of the Songo Songo natural gas field
in Kilwa district, southern Tanzania. the c struction of gas processing facilities on Songo Songo island, the
construction of a 300 mm pipeline to transp  the gas to Ubungo in Dar es Salaam and the construction of a gas
turbine power station at Ubungo The Song Songo Project was implemented by Songas, a company specifically
established for this purpose. TANESCO is e of the partners in Songas.

Arusha region, to the west of Kilimanjaro region, has a population of nearly 1,3 million
people (2002 census). The town of Arusha, with a population of nearly 283 000 people, is
the administrative centre of Arusha region and is an important industrial and agricultural
commodity processing centre. It is also a fast growing tourist gateway for the Olduvai gorge
and the world famous national parks of northern Tanzania. Kilimanjaro international airport
(KIA) is located between Arusha and Moshi, some 30 km west of Moshi. It is a busy airport
serving both urban centres and the tourism industry in northern Tanzania.
The backbone of the electricity supply system in the Kilimanjaro and Arusha areas is an
existing 132 kV link between the Kiyungi substation, some 8 km south of Moshi town in

Moshi Rural district, and the Njiro ;ubstation in the Arusha municipal area (Figure 2). It is
connected to the 220 kV national grid at Njiro. There is also a 66 kV transmission line
between Arusha and Moshi but it s in poor condition, resulting in many power outages3.
The high voltage conductors (i.e. c bles) of the existing 132 kV transmission line are carried
by 208 self-supporting steel lattice  wers which pass through an existing way leave or right
of way (ROW) between the two cen es.
Soon after leaving Kiyungi substat n the transmission line enters Hai district (Kilimanjaro
region) and then, about 3 km nort of KIA, Arumeru district (Arusha region) before passing
into Arusha municipality to reach  *iro substation. The area between Moshi and Arusha is
fairly sparsely populated, is predo inantly used for agriculture (mainly crop production and
livestock grazing) and the line p sses through or close to a number of villages and
settlements. Most of these are r al although a number are increasingly taking on more
urban characteristics. For the fin I 1,5 km approach to Njiro substation through Arusha
municipality the transmission line p sses through a built-up, fairly high value residential area.
The route characteristics of the exi ing transmission line are listed in Table 1.
The existing high voltage transmis on system between Arusha and Moshi does not provide
for a reliable supply of bulk power t the Kilimanjaro area and any loss of the existing 132 kV
link leads to power outages in the rea. The medium voltage distribution network in Arusha
region extends for about 366 km  ile that in Kilimanjaro region is about 1 040 km in total
length. Distribution substations ar scattered over a wide area and some distribution line
feeders extend as far as 120 km so that the end receiving voltage is subject to wide
fluctuations.
It is evident that the existing transm ssion and distribution system will not be able to meet the
forecast growth in demand in the A usha and Kilimanjaro area in the near future. Additional
high voltage bulk supply to Moshi as well as rehabilitation and expansion of the existing
distribution systems are urgently ne ded.
1.2   THE PROJECT
In northern Tanzania the DTRP will support the construction of a second 68 km single circuit
132 kV transmission line between  oshi (Kiyungi substation) and Arusha (Njiro substation)
to meet the expected fast growi g demand in the area, especially in Moshi and the
Kilimanjaro region. The existing Ki ungi and Njiro substations will be upgraded with new line
bays and transformers to cater or the new transmission line.  A new  132/33/11 kV
substation will also be constructe  about 3 km north of the KIA, close to the boundary
between Hai and Arumeru districts, to serve as the main feeder for the KIA and surrounding
areas.
From Kiyungi substation to the pror osed new KIA substation the additional transmission line
will run parallel to the existing 132 V line, on its northern side. From the KIA substation the
new line will also follow the existing ine to Njiro substation, but on its southem side.
3 The Feasibility Study Report produced b Messrs Lahmeyer International in December 2004 recommends that
this line should be abolished.

The conductors of the proposed 13    kV transmission line will be carried, for the most part,
by self-supporting steel lattice tower . In Tanzania, for operational and safety reasons, such
a transmission line normally require  a ROW   of 40 m in which people are not supposed to
live and in which the activities that  ay be carried out are restricted. The design of the new
transmission line was originally bas d on the need for a new 40 m ROW in addition to the
existing ROW used for the existing transmission line. However, it has now been decided
that the new transmission line will hare part of the ROW   of the existing transmission line
and that the existing ROW will need o be widened by only 10 m.
As with the    existing  transmissio   line, the  second  132 kV   line will pass through
predominantly agricultural land and a number of villages and smaller settlements. Part of
the transmission line will pass thro gh the recently declared urban area of Bomang'ombe
township in Hai district, which includ s Kilimambogo, Lerai and Mlima Shabaha settlements.
These areas are increasingly taking on urban characteristics. In Arumeru district two of the
affected villages, i.e. Kiseriani an  Olkarieni, are fast urbanising   in response to the
expansion of Arusha municipality.   he villages of Sanya Stesheni and Malula are within an
area acquired by the Tanzania Air orts Authority (TAA) for the KIA although the affected
people are yet to be paid compensa on.

Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited  Proposed 132 kV Transmission Line from Moshi to Arusha
Distribution and Transmission Rehabilitation Project         Resettlement Action Plan
(Dar es Salaam, Moshi and Arusha)                            Revised November 2005
To increase the size and reach of the 33 kV and 11 kV sub-transmission and distribution
systems in the Moshi and Arusha areas the DTRP will also support the construction or
rehabilitation of 33 kV and 11 kV sub-transmission and distribution lines to feed load centres
from various substations. In most cases the lines will be single circuit lines mounted on
wooden or reinforced concrete poles. The project will also support the rehabilitation or
construction of 33/11 kV substations.
The feasibility study prepared by Lahmeyer International in December 2004 briefly examined
the environmental issues likely to arise from the implementation and operation of the DTRP,
including that part of the project to be implemented in and around Moshi and Arusha. While
the feasibility study found that there would be few adverse biophysical impacts associated
with the project it found that some adverse social impacts would arise. These included
impacts on people living, using land or owning buildings and other assets within the original
40 m ROW that would need to be acquired by TANESCO.
In April 2005 an Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) for the DTRP,
including the Moshi and Arusha component, was prepared by TANESCO and submitted to
the National Environment Management Council (NEMC) in accordance with national legal
requirements. The ESIA confirmed that the ROW for the new transmission line will pass
through a number of properties which are being occupied or used by people for residential,
agricultural (i.e. crop production and livestock grazing) and other purposes. Acquisition of
the ROW by TANESCO will, therefore, cause the affected people to lose land, houses, other
stnuctures and standing crops, or access to these resources or assets, and will thus cause
physical and economic displacement.
1.3   ADDRESSING AND MITIGATING DISPLACEMENT
1.3.1 Requirements in Tanzania
For many projects, including the construction of high voltage transmission lines, an
environmental permit has to be issued by the Minister responsible for the environment
before implementation of the project may commence. The permit is issued by the Minister
on the recommendation of the National Environment Management Council (NEMC) after
review and approval of the environmental studies4 required to be undertaken in terms of the
legislation.
In cases where a project causes the displacement of people and property the NEMC must
be satisfied that appropriate arrangements have been planned to adequately and
appropriately compensate the affected people for their losses including, where necessary,
arrangements for resettlement and or relocation. The basic premise is that the affected
people should not be left in a worse position than they were before project implementation.
For projects involving the displacement of people and property the arrangements for
compensating and resettling displaced people must be included in the environmental
management plan and may be presented as a separate compensation and resettlement
plan.
1.3.2 World Bank requirements
For projects that receive support from the WB group the Bank requires that any such project
that displaces people from land or productive resources, and which results in relocation or
loss of shelter, the loss of assets or of access to assets important to production, the loss of
4These include, for example, environmental impact assessments and management plans.

income sources or means of livelih d or the loss of access to locations that provide higher
incomes or lower expenditures       businesses or persons must be subject to the
requirements  of its  Operationa   Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  (OP 4.12)5.
Displacement may be physical, eco mic, social or cultural.
WB OP 4.12 is applied whether or ot the affected persons must move to another location.
The WB describes these processe and outcomes as "involuntary resettlement", or simply
resettlement", even when people re not required to physically move to another location.
Resettlement is involuntary if proj t affected persons (PAPs) do not have the option to
retain the status quo that they ha  before the project begins. For the purposes of WB
OP 4.12 "involuntary" is taken to  ean actions that may be taken without the informed
consent or power of choice of the di laced persons (DPs).
Involuntary resettlement may ca   e severe long-term  hardship, impoverishment and
environmental damage unless appr priate measures are carefully planned and carried out.
For these reasons, the overall objec ves of the Bank's policy on involuntary resettlement are
the following:
*      involuntary resettlement sh  Id be avoided where feasible, or minimised, exploring
all viable alternative project  signs;
*      where it is not feasible to avoid resettlement, resettlement activities should be
conceived  and executed    s sustainable development programmes, providing
sufficient investment resour s to enable the DPs to share in project benefits. DPs
should be meaningfully co  ulted and should have opportunities to participate in
planning and implementing r ettlement programmes; and
*      DPs should be assisted in t ir efforts to improve their livelihoods and standards of
living or at least to restore th m, in real terms, to pre-displacement levels or to levels
prevailing prior to the beginn g of project implementation, whichever is higher.
WB OP 4.12 provides policy guid nce and procedures for adequately resettling and
compensating PAPs. To address t economic and social impacts associated with potential
losses suffered by DPs, WB OP 4.1 requires that a resettlement plan (sometimes referred
to as a resentlement action plan) be repared to meet the requirements of the WB and GOT.
The resettlement plan includes mea ures to ensure that DPs are:
*      informed about their options nd rights pertaining to resettlement;
*      consulted on, offered choice among, and provided with technically and economically
feasible resettlement alterna yes; and
*      provided prompt and effectie compensation at full replacement cost for losses of
assets attributable directly to he project.
If the impacts include physical reloc ion the resettlement plan includes measures to ensure
that the DPs are provided with:
*      assistance (such as moving Ilowances) during relocation; and
OP 4.12 was published in December 2001 nd was revised in April 2004. The revision applies to projects that
are governed by WB Operational Policy 6.0 and Bank Policy 6.00. i.e. those in countries with approved country
financing parameters The revision omits P ragraph 34 in the December 2001 publication, i.e. 'The Bank does
not disburse against cash compensation an other resettlement assistance paid in cash, or against the cost of
land (including compensation for land acq sition). However, it may finance the cost of land improvement
associated with resettlement activities'

*     residential housing, or housing sites, or, as required, agricultural sites for which a
combination of productive potential, locational advantages, and other factors is at
least equivalent to the advantages of the old site.
Where necessary to achieve the objectives of the policy, the resettlement plan also includes
measures to ensure that DPs are:
*     offered support after displacement, for a transition period, based on a reasonable
estimate of the time likely to be needed to restore their livelihoods and standards of
living; and
*     provided with development assistance in addition to compensation measures, such
as land preparation, credit facilities, training or job opportunities.
1.4   THE RESETTLEMENT ACTION PLAN
1.4.1  Objectives and scope of the resettlement action plan
The objective of the resettlement action plan (RAP) is to provide a plan for resolving the
displacement, resettlement and/or compensation issues of the project and for ensuring that
DPs are left no worse off than they were before commencement of the project. The RAP is
intended to be an agreed commitment by the parties involved (e.g. TANESCO, the GOT and
the DPs) for guiding the implementation of resettlement and/or compensation actions for
persons affected by the enforcement of the ROW for the project. It:
*     lays down the agreed   principles that will apply to the resettlement and/or
compensation exercise;
*     describes the legal and institutional framework for dealing with displacement;
*     identifies, as far as possible, those people currently living within the proposed ROW
and who will suffer losses;
*     provides a general socio-economic profile of the people living in areas where
displacement is likely to occur;
*     estimates the nature and magnitude of displacement;
*     sets out the criteria used to determine eligibility for resettlement, compensation
and/or other assistance and what entitlements are due to different categories of DPs
and for different types of losses;
*     indicates how affected assets of individual DPs are valued;
*     describes how resettlement and/or compensation entitlements will be delivered,
including the procedures, responsibilities and timing;
*     describes mechanisms for maximising stakeholder participation and for airing
grievances; and
*     provides an indication of the costs involved.
The RAP has been prepared in accordance with the standards and procedures of the GOT
policy and legislation relevant to involuntary resettlement and to compensation as well as in
accordance with the policies and guidelines of the WB, i.e. OP 4.12. This RAP, although it is
presented as a separate document, should be considered as an integral component of the
ESIA and environmental management plan prepared by TANESCO.
1.4.2 Disclosure of the resettlement action plan
Consistent with the WB's Disclosure Policy, the RAP will have to be disclosed prior to
appraisal. Disclosure will take place in Tanzania as well as in the WB Infoshop. Thus,

TANESCO will disclose the docu nt in-country while forwarding a letter to the Bank,
authorising the latter to disclose the  cument in the WB Infoshop.
In Tanzania the RAP will be made a ailable to the public for a period of six weeks in English
and Kiswahili in the relevant district nd ward council offices. This fact will be advertised in
newspapers and on radio stations c  monly accessed by the local population. During this
period members of the public will be given the opportunity to respond to the RAP, in writing
or verbally, to the relevant district e cutive director or ward executive officer who will then
pass on the responses to TANESCO
1.4.3  Methodology for preparatio of the resettlement action plan
Preparation of the RAP commenced in mid-January 2005 and continued until August. The
methodology applied included:
*     review of relevant backgroun reports and documentation;
*     review and use of informatio contained in assessment and survey reports prepared
by third party consultants;
*     meetings with key personnel nd organisations; and
*     compilation and analysis of d ta and elaboration of the RAP document.
Much of the information included  the RAP is presented according to the two main
administrative districts through whih the ROW will pass, i.e. Hai district and Arumeru
districts. For each district smaller u its of administration have also been used. These are
wards, villages and sub-villages. Vill ges and sub-villages primarily revolve around the local
leadership and gene rally have neithe defined geographical boundaries nor areas.
1.4.4 Information sources
A number of background document on the project were obtained and reviewed, the most
important of which was the Lahm  er International feasibility study of December 2004.
Relevant Tanzanian policies, legalis tion and guidelines were reviewed to understand and
record their implications for dealing  ith DPs that will be displaced, in one form or another,
from areas within the proposed RO  . These included: the Land Act (No. 4 of 1999); the
Land Acquisition Act (No.47 of 196 ; the Village Land Act (No. 5 of 1999); the Electricity
Ordinance (Cap. 131 of 1931); the Land Regulations (2001); and the Tanzania
Environmental Impact Assessment  idelines (2002), published by the NEMC.
WB OP 4.12 was also reviewed and he preparation of the RAP was also guided by several
examples of RAPs prepared recen y for WB supported projects in Tanzania and other
countries in the region.
In January and February 2005 a nu ber of public consultation meetings were held in some
of the affected villages and sub-villa es along the route of the proposed new transmission
line and with other interested parties The public consultation process was undertaken by an
independent sociologist engaged by ANESCO with the objective of introducing the project,
explaining the need for land acquis ion, explaining the resettlement and/or compensation
principles to be applied as well as  soliciting feedback. The results of the process were
presented in a Draft Final Social Im ct Assessment (SIA) report submitted to TANESCO in
April 2005. The Draft Final SIA is pr ented as Annex 1 to the RAP in Volume 2.
A generalised description of the soc  economic and cultural conditions in the villages visited
during the public consultation proces was also included in the Draft Final SIA. However, no
detailed socio-economic survey of otentially affected households was undertaken nor

household profiles produced. This was because, at the time, discussions were still taking
place within TANESCO concerning the width of the ROW for the new transmission line6 and
it was, therefore, not possible to accurately identify the affected properties and households7.
The Draft Final SIA was subsequently incorporated into the full ESIA prepared by TANESCO
in April 2005 and approved by the WB review teams. The ESIA was, therefore, used as the
primary source of socio-economic information for the preparation of the RAP. Additional
population and demographic information was obtained from summaries of the results of the
2002 population and household census, available on the GOT website8.
In March and April 2005, after the width and location of the ROW for the proposed
transmission line had been confirmed, all affected properties and households within the
ROW were identified in the field by a Tanzanian commercial property valuation company9
engaged by TANESCO. The survey team consisted of six valuers, three land surveyors and
six field auxiliaries. The survey team also compiled a detailed inventory of the types, sizes
and conditions of the land and assets of each affected household, business or entity and
determined the value of compensation to be paid to each household for affected land, assets
and loss of income sources.   The results of the survey and valuation exercise were
presented to TANESCO in a valuation report' in July 2005. For the preparation of the RAP,
the valuation report, therefore. provided the principal source of information on the number
and location of affected properties, the number and categories of affected households, the
nature and magnitude of losses and displacement, the methods used for valuing land,
assets and loss of income and assessing compensation, and the amount of compensation to
be paid.
Meetings were held with officials from TANESCO in January and May 2005, particularly with
personnel in the Corporate Planning and Research Directorate which is responsible for
environmental issues, with surveyors and with transmission and distribution engineers.
Meetings were also held with personnel from TAA and the Tanzania National Roads Agency.
Discussion and communication with the sociologist and with personnel from the property
valuation company engaged by TANESCO were maintained throughout the period of
preparation of the RAP.

2     PROJECT COMPONENTS LEADING TO DISPLACEMENT
2.1   RIGHT OF WAY FOR THE rRANSMISSION LINE
The main component of the project hat will lead to displacement of people and the need for
resettlement and/or compensation vill be the creation of a ROW for the proposed second
132 kV transmission line from Kiyu gi substation, near Moshi, to Njiro substation, in Arusha
municipality. Land, which people a D currently occupying and using, will need to be acquired
by TANESCO for the ROW and th s will cause the physical and economic displacement of
affected people. DPs will lose t eir legal rights to occupy and use the affected land.
According to Tanzanian law they wi I have to abandon houses and other structures within the
ROW   and will, therefore, lose s elter and/or premises used for business or income
generation purposes. They will I se assets (e.g. crops and fruit trees) and, therefore,
sources of food or income. The will lose resources (e.g. land) or access to resources
important for food production or inc me generation.
2.1.1 Project design alternative and potential displacement
According to the Lahmeyer Intern tional feasibility study of December 2004 the proposed
second 132 kV transmission line w s to use conventional self-supporting steel lattice towers.
This would necessitate the acquisit n of land for a 40 m wide ROW. Apart from the adverse
social impacts of displacement a considerable amount of compensation would have to be
paid. Alternative transmission lin designs are available which require a narrower ROW,
reduce the amount of displacement and, thus resettlement and compensation costs.
Durng January and February 2 05 TANESCO undertook an optimisation exercise to
compare the advantages and d sadvantages of various design technologies for the
transmission line in terms of const uction costs, displacement caused and resettlement and
compensation costs. The alternati es considered were: self-supporting steel lattice towers,
requiring a ROW of 40 m; tubula steel poles with a more compact arrangement of the
conductors (i.e. cables), requiring a ROW of 15 m; and underground cables, requiring a
ROW of 5 m. A rapid reconnais ance survey of properties in the possible ROWs was
undertaken. Construction costs wf re found to be highest for underground cables and lowest
for tubular steel poles. It was esti nated that a 40 m ROW would affect 240 properties and
displace around 1 440 people. Boh a 15 m and 5 m ROW would affect 218 properties and
displace around 1 300 people.  he reason why there is little difference between the
altematives is that even a narrow ROW would, in many cases, require the acquisition of all
of an affected property and not onl the directly affected portion as the residual portion would
no longer be viable on its own.
A further altemative considered b TANESCO was to allow people to continue to live and
use land within the ROW. Allowi g people to live and work within the ROW, provided a
minimum  clearance under the  onductors of 8 m was maintained, would not only
accommodate the wishes of D s who generally are reluctant to move, but would
considerably reduce the amount of displacement and the cost of resettlement and/or
compensation. However, it is the o inion of TANESCO that, for safety and security reasons,
it is not advisable to allow people t live in a ROW used for high tension transmission lines.
The Electricity Ordinance (Cap. 31 of 1931, Supplementary 57) also legally prevents
people living in such a ROW. How ver, TANESCO has usually allowed other activities, such
as growing short and temporaf crops and livestock grazing, within high tension
transmission line ROWs.

(Dar es Salaam. Moshi and Arusha)                            Revised November 2005
2.1.2 Adopted project design and right of way
A further alternative considered, and subsequently adopted, is to use part of the ROW of the
existing transmission line for the second proposed transmission line. For most of its length
the transmission line will be carried by self-supporting steel lattice towers.  This will
necessitate the widening of the existing ROW by only 10 m and will thus require the
acquisition of considerably less land than would be the case with other altematives
considered.
However, the final 1.5 km approach of the new transmission line into Njiro substation in
Arusha municipality passes through a densely built-up urban area which has high value
properties.  The existing ROW  in this section (Njiro hill) is 60 m wide but cannot
accommodate another 132 kV line using conventional steel lattice towers. It would thus be
necessary to widen the existing ROW further but this would require a considerable amount
of land acquisition in this built up area.  Using this option would have adverse socio-
economic effects and cost a considerable amount of money for compensation. In the light of
this TANESCO has subsequently decided to employ alternative technologies for this section,
such as adding an additional circuit to the towers used for the existing 132 kV line.
Therefore, no additional ROW is required for this section.
The creation of the ROW for the proposed second 132 kV transmission line from Moshi to
Arusha will affect a total of 516 properties or households and displace, in one form or
another, an estimated 2 308 people. Most of the affected properties are small agricultural
(i.e. crop or livestock) plots, many with residential structures on them.  No social or
community infrastructure is expected to be displaced. In Arumeru district 304 properties will
be affected. The greatest impact tends to be in those areas which are increasingly taking on
urban characteristics, i.e. Hai Mjini, Masama Rundugai and King'ori wards. The magnitude
and zone of impact id discussed in more detail in following sections of the RAP.
2.1.3 Use of the right of way after construction of the transmission line
The creation of the additional 10 m ROW will cause DPs to lose official ownership or
occupancy of their land within the ROW and they will be compensated in full for this loss.
Although some standing crops will be destroyed or damaged during construction TANESCO
will allow DPs and affected communities to continue to use the ROW for crop production and
livestock grazing after construction of the new transmission line. Restrictions will however
apply to the type of crops which can be grown as tall tree crops cannot be grown under the
transmission line. Most crops, including coffee, will not be affected. Restrictions will also be
placed on the use of access and maintenance roads associated with the transmission line.
However, TANESCO will not be liable for any damage to crops caused during operational
and maintenance work after construction.  To avoid future misunderstandings it is
recommended that TANESCO introduces some type of permit system for people given
authority to use the ROW for cropping and livestock grazing purposes.
2.2   OTHER PROJECT INFRASTRUCTURE
The project will also establish a new 132/33/11 kV substation near KIA which will require the
acquisition of a small area of land as the substation will be mostly located within the
expanded ROW. A number of new 33/11 kV substations will also be constructed by the
project. In all cases existing TANESCO land or vacant land will be used and no
displacement is expecte'! In keeping with existing practice most new and rehabilitated
overhead 33 kV and 11 kV distribution lines will be aligned along the sides of roads within
existing road reserves. Except for a possible few cases it will not be necessary to acquire
additional land and no signi ficant permanent displacement is expected.

2.3    INADVERTENT CONSTR           TION DAMAGE
Some negative impacts, such as amage to property, may be caused during construction,
operational and maintenance, both within and without the proposed extension to the existing
ROW but these are expected to b minor and temporary and will be dealt with on a case by
case basis.
2.4     SUMMARY OF POSSIBLE DISPLACEMENT CAUSED BY PROJECT
COMPONENTS
The establishment of project infra tructure will require acquisition of land, the removal of
some houses and      other structu  s and will affect land use, livelihoods and     income
generating  opportunities in som    areas.   There will be need for resettlement and/or
compensation.    The 33 kV, 11 k    and low voltage distribution lines and substations are
considered to have low displace     nt significance due to the relatively small sizes of the
structures, the limited space requi ment and the narrow width of the ROWs for the lines.
Table 2 summarises the main proj    t components that are expected to cause displacement
in Hai and Arumeru districts. No isplacement is expected to occur in Moshi Rural distrct
and Arusha municipality. Displace   ent is likely to be very localised and in most cases DPs
will be able to rebuilo houses an   other infrastructure on the remaining part of their land
holding. For others who lose most f their land holdings it is envisaged that they will be able
to acquire replacement land in the  icinity so that they will not have to relocate very far from
their original land holdings.

Distribution and Transmission Rehabilitation Project          Resettlement Action Plan
(Dar es Salaam, Moshi and Arusha)                             Revised November 2005
3     OBJECTIVES OF THE RESETTLEMENT COMPONENT
The overall objective of the resettlement and compensation (simply called 'resettlement")
component of the DTRP is to displace (i.e. move or deprive from resources or access to
resources or deprive from income earning capacity or opportunities) as few people,
businesses and institutions as possible. Where displacement is unavoidable the objective is
to ensure that sufficient investment resources are appropriately allocated by TANESCO to
ensure that DPs are provided with:
*     adequate and appropriate compensation for assets, including land, lost;
*     compensation for the loss of business profits;
*     assistance, where required, to relocate to other areas and re-establish houses and
other infrastructure; and
*     other measures to assist DPs to restore their livelihoods and regain and ideally
improve their pre-project living standards.
The following is a list of basic principles which will govem the preparation and
implementation of the resettlement and/or compensation exercise:
*     displacement of people, property and livelihoods will be minimised as much as
possible by employing technologies and locating project infrastructure in such a
manner so as to minimise the need to acquire land and property and to cause as little
disturbance and disruption as possible;
*     all possible means will be used to ensure that no people are harmed in any way by
construction activities and project outcomes;
*     resettlement and compensation planning and implementation activities will be
undertaken with the participation of DPs and other relevant PAPs who will be
continuously consulted throughout the process;
*     DPs will be informed about their options and rights pertaining to displacement,
compensation and resettlement and about grievance mechanisms available to them;
*     only DPs who meet agreed eligibility criteria will be entitled to compensation and
relocation measures;
*     lack of legal rights to land and assets occupied or used will not preclude a DP from
entitlement to resettlement and compensation measures;
*     compensation, resettlement and rehabilitation measures will be as fair as possible to
all parties concerned and should minimise the long-term liability of TANESCO;
*     compensation. resettlement and rehabilitation entitlements will be provided in
accordance with Tanzanian law and procedures as a minimum but will include
additional measures to meet World Bank requirements, where appropriate;
*     where compensation, in cash or kind, is provided for loss of assets (including housing
and other structures), for loss of access to assets or for damage caused to assets it
will be provided on the basis of market value or replacement cost (whichever is the
highest) and will include necessary additional costs incurred to achieve full
restoration:
*     if replacement land is to be provided it will have a combination of productive
potential, location advantages, accessibility, availability of services and other factors
at least equivalent to the advantages of the original site and will be as near as
possible to the original site;
*     specific and additional assistance will be provided for particularly vulnerable people,
i.e. widows, orphans, HIV/AIDS victims, elderly people and handicapped people; and
*     pre-construction and actual construction work on each particular affected site will not
commence until DPs have been satisfactorily compensated and/or relocated.

4     SOCIO-ECONOMIC ASP CTS
4.1   FIELD VALUATION EXERCI E
The new transmission line will be ro ed through mostly fairly sparsely populated rural areas
in Hai district (Kilimanjaro region) an Arumeru district (Arusha region) and the extension of
the existing ROW by 10 m will only d ectly affected properties and people in these districts.
During March and April 2005 a te m of six valuers, three land surveyors and six field
auxiliaries from a registered Tanzani n property valuation company visited and inspected all
the properties within the proposed 1 m extension to the existing ROW. In carrying out field
surveys the valuation team was, at 1i times, accompanied by a local leader who identified
the landowners, confirmed the boun aries shown to the team by the property owners and
certified, on the field sheets, the co t of crops and fruit trees. In brief the team undertook
the following
*     identification of assets affec d by the proposed additional 10 m ROW and their
respective owners;
*     assigninc of a reference num er to each of the identified cases;
*     taking of notes of the identi ed properties (buildings) and other assets as well as
crops on a pre-prepared insp ction sheet;
*     taking of measurements of t e affected land and buildings with the help of the land
surveying team;
*     taking of photographs of  Ffected properties together with the owners, where
possible: and
*     ensuring that all entries on t e inspection sheets were counter-checked and signed
by the local leadership and th property owners in the respective location.
Affected lhouseholds were served  otices requiring them to claim compensation for the
affected properties. This was done i accordance with the provisions of Regulation 3 of the
Land (Assessment of the Value of L  d for Compensation) Regulations, 2001, and Part Ill of
the Village Land Regulations, 2002. The identified property owners completed Land Forms
No. 14 and No. 15.  Land Form   o. 16 was returned to the local village leaders who
subsequently passed them over to te property valuers during June 2005. This allowed the
affected property owners the statuto  period of 60 days to file their claims for compensation.
Care was taken to explain the proce ures to DPs in a manner comprehensible to everyone
being affected.  DPs were inform d that if they did not agree with the valuation for
compensation they could apply to he district land valuer to examine the case. If no
satisfactcry agreement was reache at this level the aggrieved claimant could refer the
matter to tthe courts of law.
The follo.. ing documents are availab  separately to the RAP document:
*     Voluation data sheets:  Th  e are field sheets that the valuers used to record
inturmation about each of th identified properties, counterchecked by the property
owvner and the local leader;
*     A :Judication plans: These a  maps presenting spatial data within and adjacent to
tlt proposed ROW. They s ow the layout of the affected land, infrastructure and
assets: and
*     Cumpensation schedules: T ese provide details of each pf the identified properties
for compensation purposes  nd are signed by the respective district lands officer,
di-jrict commissioner, region commissioner and TANESCO.

4.2    CURRENT OCCUPANTS OF THE AFFECTED AREA
4.2.1 Affected properties and households
Table 3 shows the number of affected properties or household units inspected in each of the
villages or sub-villages along the proposed 10 m extension to the existing ROW. A total of
516 households or entities" will be directly affected by the acquisition of land by TANESCO
for the ROW extension. In Hai district 212 households (41% of the total for the ROW) will be
affected wijiie in Arumeru 304 households (59%) will be affected. For most of the affected
properties only a small portion of the whole farm or plot is within the ROW. Where most of
the area o' a plot is affected to the extent that the remaining portion will be too small or non-
viable the plot is treated as if the whole area will be affected.
There is essentially one type of affected property. It includes those properties that are
outside ilie existing ROW but within the proposed 10 m extension to the existing ROW.
These wi:; be, therefore. directly affected by the construction of the proposed new
transmissiL., line. Four sub-types of affected properties have been identified. These are:
Crop farin. ind plots: These are properties which are used mainly for crop farming and had
annual and,or perennial crops on them within the proposed 10 m ROW at the time of
inspection Some of these properties also have houses and structures on them within the
part affecttLu L, the ROW. A total of 333 crop farms and plots (65% of all affected land
units) wLr. identified. Of these, 66 are in Hai district and the remaining 267 (80%) are in
Arumeru   strict.
Grazing or pastoral lots: These are used mainly for grazing livestock on and none has
infrastrucuure within the part affected by the new ROW. A total of 22 pastoral lots (4% of all
affected land units) were identified. Of these, 18 are in Sanya Stesheni village in Hai district
and the ruiliaining four are in Arumeru district.
Mainly n.: -agr'cultural plots: These are land units on which no crops were found within the
proposec    ni ROW   at the time of inspection. Most of them are used for residential
purposes uut some of the affected parts of these land units did not have buildings on them.
Six of these plots are also used for extracting ("quarrying") building sand. A total of 160 non-
agricultu;a. ,jlots (31 % of all affected land units) were identified. Of these, 128 (80%) are in
Hai district .nd the remaining 32 are in Arumeru district.
lnstitutio?xu land: A bible college in Mlangarini has land and buildings within the proposed
ROW.
Most of tie affected land is being used or occupied in terms of customary rights of
occupati.. ..lhich are recognised in Tanzanian law. In Hai district none of the affected
propert,>.: -is registered land titles while six of the affected properties in Arumeru district
have rei; >:,:ed titles. These are mostly large-scale commercial farming enterprises, mostly
engaged ::c offee and flower production. At Kwa Ugoro village, two of the affected farms
were abe :;tcied sisal farms that were recently acquired by two entrepreneurs who are keen
to develc: :u em into coffee farms.
For the   se of tne RAP all these are referred to as households.

Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited  Proposed 132 kV Transmission Line from Moshi to Arusha
Distribution and Transmission Rehabilitation Project         Resettlement Action Plan
(Dar es Salaam, Moshi and Arusha)                            Revised November 2005
4.2.2 Estimated number of affected people
A census of the number of people in each of the affected households was not carried out
during the valuation exercise. However, the number of affected people has been estimated
using average household size figures obtained from the 2002 national population and
housing census. The average number of persons per household is, by ward:
Hai district:
Machame Kusini     4,4
Masama Kusini      4,5
Hai Mjini          4,0
Masama Rundugai    4,6
Arumeru district:
King'ori           4,9
Maroroni           4,7
Kikwe              4,5
Mlangarini         4,6
Moshono            4,9
The estimated affected population for each of the affected villages or sub-villages is included
in Table 3. It is estimated that a total of 2 308 people will be affected with 881 (38%) in Hai
district and the remaining 1 427 (62%) in Arumeru district.
4.3   TYPE AND MAGNITUDE OF EXPECTED LOSSES
4.3.1 Loss of residential and productive land and resources
According to the field inspection and valuation exercise carried out 516 households will lose
their rights to use and occupy all or part of the land on which they are living (i.e. residential
land) or which the are using for various productive purposes (productive land) in the
proposed ROW. Of these, 212 are in Hai district and the remaining 304 are in Arumenu
district. Table 4 shows the area of affected land in each village or sub-village.
The total area of land that will need to be acquired for the extension to the existing ROW is
66,586 ha, with 28,346 ha (43%) of this being located in Hai district and 38,240 ha (57%)
being found in Arumeru district. The greatest amount of affected land is found in Chekimaji,
Lerai, Masama Shabaha, Malula, Samaria, Maroroni and Kikwe villages and sub-villages.
In all cases the loss of land represents the loss of an asset. For people living in houses on
affected land in the ROW this will mean the loss of space for living and will cause physical
displacement from the land. For crop farmers and pastoralists this will also represent the
loss of land and resources used for providing food or generating income.
4.3.2 Loss of structures and shelter
Sixty three households have buildings and structures on their affected land within the
proposed 10 m extension to the existing ROW (Table 5). Of these, 10 are in Hai district and
the remaining 53 are in Arumeru district, including the bible college in Miangarini village. On
the 63 affected properties a total of 124 buildings are affected (24 in Hai district and 100 in
Arumeru district). The affected families will have to abandon these when their rights to use
and occupy the affected land are extinguished. The total floor area of the affected structures
is 3 226,42 m2

(Dar es Salaam, Moshi and Arusha)                             Revised November 2005
The loss of their main resident I units by 55 families will represent the loss of
accommodation or shelter in additi to the loss of other infrastructure. In the cases of the
ten households in Hai district who will have to abandon their houses, they do not have
surplus land which is not subject t acquisition and will have to physically relocate to new
sites. In Arumeru district most of th 44 households that will have to abandon their homes in
the ROW do have residual land ad cent to the ROW and most of them will be able to re-
build their houses on this residual Ia d.
A total of 13 graves are located wit  the proposed extension to the ROW and will probably
have to be removed. In Mijongwen village in Hai district one family had 4 graves which will

(including fruit trees), such as such s pineapples, maize, potatoes, cassava, yams, mango,
citrus (e.g. orange and lemon) and j ckfruit. The loss of these crops will represent economic
displacement. There are no other ignificant business activities that will be affected by the
acquisition of the land for the propo  d ROW.
4.3.4 Loss of access to commu ty and public structures
No community or public structures  II be affected.

Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited  Proposed 132 kV Transmission Line from Moshi to Arusha
Distribution and Transmission Rehabilitation Iroject          Resettlement Action Plan
(Dar es Salaam. Moshi and Arusha)                             Revised November 2005
However, no detailed socio-econo nic survey of potentially affected households was
undertaken nor household profiles roduced. This was because, at the time, discussions
were still taking place within TANE SCO conceming the width of the ROW for the new
transmission line and it was, there 'ore, not possible to accurately identify the affected
properties and households. A hous hold survey will, thus, need to be undertaken before
implementation of the project begins in order to provide a baseline for future monitoring and
evaluation activities.
Land use along the length of the pr posed 10 m extension to the existing ROW is mainly
devoted to residential purposes, cro farming and livestock grazing. The populations (2002)
of the affected wards are presented in Table 1. Population data at village and sub-village
level is generally not available and o ly a few village leaders have made an effort to collect
village level population data. Data fr m the 2002 national population and household census
was published at the ward and highe levels only.
Population density in Kilimanjaro regi n was 104 persons per square kilometre in 2002 while
in Arusha region it was much lower a 35 persons per square kilometre15.
4.4.1 Hai district
Part of the transmission line will pass through the recently declared urban area of
Bomang'ombe township which inclu es Kilimambogo, Lerai and Mlima Shabaha. These
areas are increasingly taking on urba characteristics and the affected people in these areas
are from multiple ethnical origins.
Further westwards the villages of Sa ya Stesheni and Malula are within an area acquired by
TAA for KIA. Valuation of affected p operties in these villages has already been undertaken
by TAA but compensation has yet to e paid. As a consequence landowners affected by the
10 m extension to the existing ROW in Sanya Stesheni and part of Malula villages will need
to be compensated by the transmissi n line project to allow for the smooth implementation of
the project16
Sanya Stesheni village (Masama R ndugai ward)17
Population: The 2002 population of Aasama Rundugai ward was estimated to be 17 176 of
which 51,4% were males and 48,60/ females. There was a total of 3 759 households with
an average household size of 4,6 pe sons. The population of the village is not known.

neighbouring village located at a dist nce of 3 km.
15 Certain data, such as population density, is only published at the regional level on the GOT website.
16 TAA is aware of the recent valuation exerc se and TANESCO will need to avail TAA of the list of compensated
people within the affected areas so that TAA oes not compensate the affected people a second time.
17 The socio-economic information presente in this Section for each ward or village has been sourced directly
from the Draft Final SIA (see Annex 1 in Volu e 2).

Health: Water supply is not a major problem in one part of the village as the water pipe line
passes the village. Personal cleanness behaviours may be contributing to the poor health of
families, especially with respect to skin diseases caused by the lack of bath facilities and
personal hygiene. The nearest dispensary is available in the neighbouring village.
Land use patterns: One part of the land is used for crop farming while another is used for
grazing livestock, including cows, goats, sheep and donkeys. The remaining area is used for
buildings. The area is generally dry and most of the area is suitable for livestock grazing.
The residents of this area normally farm maize, beans and sunflower seeds. They have only
one farming season which starts in March and ends in August when it is harvesting period.

many of their residents undertake i igation to help improve food supplies during poor rainfall
years. This is based on furrow irri ation systems, mainly using water from the Kikafu river.
The villages include Kikafu Chini, ijongweni, Chekimaji and Rundugai. The main economic
activities include crop farming and rading in agro-based products
4.4.2 Arumeru district

5     LEGAL AND INSTITUTIO       AL FRAMEWORK
5.1   LEGAL FRAMEWORK
5.1.1 Introduction
Land issues in mainland Tanzania a e mainly governed by the Land Act (No. 4 of 1999), the
Village Land Act (No. 5 of 1999) an the Land Acquisition Act (No. 47 of 1967). All land in
Tanzania is public land and remain vested in the President as trustee for and behalf of the
citizens of Tanzania. Land in Tanza ia is classified into three categories, i.e.: General Land;
Village Land; and Reserved Land. Socio-economic activities are permitted in General or
Village Land but not in Reserved La d which is allocated to national parks, wildlife reserves,
forest reserves and other protected reas.
5.1.2  Rights to use and benefit fm land
Tanzania has a dual system of I nd tenure that recognises both statutory rights and
customary rights. Firstly, land may be granted by leasehold as a "right of occupancy" for
varying periods for up to 99 years (enewable) by the Lands Commissioner. In urban and
peri-urban areas people who have  quired land or have been occupying land as a primary
residence for long periods of tim  without having obtained a right of occupancy are
considered to be legal occupant  (i.e. recognised long-standing occupancy).  Local
authorities may also issue "residentiI licences" to long-standing residents.
Secondly, in rural areas people a  communities using and occupying land in terms of
customary norms are considered to ave customary rights of occupancy or 'deemed" right of
occupancy. Most of the people i Tanzania obtain land freely within village land from
inheritance, allocation by village co  cils or by clearing land. This is the situation in nearly
all of the areas affected by the pro osed transmission line from Moshi to Arusha. Village
land may be occupied by individu s and families or may be used communally, e.g. for
livestock grazing.
Tenure rights may be held by ind iduals, associations of two or more people and by
communities.
5.1.3 Transfer of land and impro ements
The Land Act recognises that an int rest in or right over land has value and that such value
is taken into consideration in any t nsaction affecting the interest. Granted and deemed
(e.g. customary) rights of occupany may be transferred between parties and an active
market for land is growing, particula y in the urban areas of the country, with market prices
reflecting the value of the land and i provements. The land market is much weaker in nural
areas, Land without un-exhausted mprovements, in general, is deemed to have no value
and may not be sold.
5.1.4  Acquisition of land for pub c purposes
Land acquisition in Tanzania is gov rned by the Land Acquisition Act which is the 'mother
act' when it comes to land acquisitio  Provisions related to land acquisition in the Town and
Country Planning Ordinance (Cap 378) are subservient to the provision in the Land
Acquisition Act and the more recent Land Act has not amended any of the land acquisition
provisions in the Land Acquisition Ac

(Dar es Salaam. Moshi and Arusha)                           Revised November 2005
The Land Acquisition Act bestows powers on the President to acquire land for any estate or
term where such land is needed for any public purpose. It defines the circumstances in
which public interest could be invoked, such as, among others, for exclusive State use or for
public use. The Land Act (Section 151) also empowers the Minister of Lands and Human
Settlement Development to create way leaves or ROWs for the benefit of the Govemment, a
local authority, a public authority (such as TANESCO) or any corporate body. In terms of
Section 45 the President may revoke a right of occupancy if, in his opinion, it is in the public
interest to do so.
5.1.5 Requirement to pay compensation
The Land Act (Section 3) requires the State:
'To pay full, fair prompt compensation to any person whose right of occupancy or
recognized long standing occupation or customary use of land is revoked or otherwise
interfered with to their detriment by the State under this Act or is acquired under the Land
Acquisition Act."
5.1.6 Eligibility for compensation
According to the laws relating to land administration in Tanzania entitlement for payment of
compensation is essentially based on the right of ownership. WB OP 4.12 differs from this
and states that affected people, including people who have no recognisable legal right or
claim to the land that they are occupying, are entitled to some form of assistance, whether or
not they have legal title, if they have occupied the land before a specified cut-off date. Such
people would include "encroachers" and 'squatters". WB OP 4.12 does not require that they
be paid compensation for the land they lose but that they be provided resettlement
assistance which may consist of replacement land, other assets, cash compensation for
infrastructure and assets lost, employment and others, as appropriate. In the case of the
proposed 10 m extension to the existing ROW no squatters or encroachers were identified at
the time of the field inspection and valuation exercise.
5.1.7 Form of compensation
In terms of the 2001 Land (Compensation Claims) Regulations compensation has, normally,
to take the form of monetary compensation but may, at the option of the Govemment, take
the form of all or a combination of any of the following:
*     a plot of land of comparable quality, extent and productive potential to the land lost;
*     a building or buildings of comparable quality, extent and use comparable to the
building or buildings lost;
*     plants and seedlings; and
*     regular supplies of grain and other basic foodstuffs for a specified time.
For situations involving physical relocation, particularly in rural areas, WB OP 4.12 prefers
that, wherever possible, DPs be provided with replacement land, replacement houses or
housing sites and replacement agricultural sites, as applicable.
In Tanzania it is common practice to provide monetary compensation rather than
replacement land and housing. The monetary compensation is designed to allow the DPs to
obtain similar replacement land and either buy or construct similar housing close to the area
of displacement, based on the equivalent market value of the property foregone. The
establishment of dedicated resettlement areas is also problematic with linear type project
areas, such as ROWs, as numerous small resettlement areas would have to be established

along the route if resettled DPs we e to maintain their cultural and social ties with their own
communities. However, in a numb r of recent situations DPs have requested and received
assistance from project proponents and local govemment authorities to source replacement
land and to negotiate purchase p ces. This will also apply for the DTRP in Moshi and
Arusha. However, all DPs have a eady submitted the required compensation claim forms
and none has so far requested repl cement land and housing in lieu of cash compensation.
5.1.8 Compensation payable
For land acquired in terms of Se tion 3 of the Land Act (e.g. ROWs) the compensation
payable, as elaborated on in Secti n 179, the Land (Assessment of the Value of Land for
Compensation) Regulations, 2001, ncludes:
*      the market value of the real roperty;
*      a disturbance allowance;
*     transport allowance;
*      loss of profits or accommod tion;
*     the cost of acquiring or getti g the subject land; and
*      any other cost loss or capit I expenditure incurred to the development of the subject
land.
Land, structures and assets
In general, compensation may    e claimed for the value of land and un-exhausted
improvements on the land bein    occupied.  The Land Act specifically requires that
compensation be paid to any per on for the. use of land, which the person is legally or
actually occupying (including reco nised long-standing occupation without official title), for
the purposes of a ROW (Section 1 6). In addition, compensation must also be awarded for
any damage to trees, crops and buildings resulting from the creation of such a ROW.
Compensation is to be assessed a the market value'8 of real property
WB OP 4.12 requires that comper iation for losses of assets be based on full replacement
cost rather than on the open mark t values as required in the Tanzania legislation. Market
value may be defined as the hig est price in terms of money that a property would be
expected to bring in a competitive nd open market under conditions requisite for a fair sale.
Replacement cost is the cost of pu ing up an equivalent structure to the existing structure at
the time of valuation and makir g allowances for age, state of repair and economic
obsolescence.
In an active property market s tuation market value would tend to be higher than
replacement cost. In the project a ea, however, there is a very weak property market. The
altemative is to use the replacer| nt cost method to determine surrogate market values.
Depreciation, as dictated by comm n practice, will be allowed although separate land values
and a compensatory disturbance a lowance will be added"9. This is crucial as the valuation
must meet the Ministry of La ds and Human Settlement Development (MLHSD)
requirements if the valuation is to e approved and not constrain the implementation of the
project.
a            18 The Land Acquisition Act also provides hat compensation shall be assessed on the market value basis. This
concept is, however, contradicted in the nethod of assessment as provided by the Act. The 1999 Land Act
apparently redresses the situation.
_   This is the conclusion of the independe t property valuation team that carried out the affected land and asset
inventory and valuation along the propose ROW from March to April, 2005.

Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited  Proposed 132 kV Transmission Line from Moshi to Arusha
Distribution and Transmission Rehabilitation Project        Resettlement Action Plan
(Par es Salaam, Moshi and Arusha)                           Revised November 2005
No compensation is to be awarded for any land that is vacant ground or is to be limited to
the value of un-exhausted improvement of the land in cases where the development of the
land is deemed inadequate. However, in a number of precedents compensation has, in fact
been awarded for vacant land that has been acquired in the public interest. Premises that
have remained unoccupied or semi-finished are considered to be vacant and may not be
considered for the transport allowance, accommodation allowance or profit allowance.
Compensation has to be paid promptly, within six months of the valuation of the property,
and if the payment of compensation is delayed for any time after this period interest has to
be paid on the amount of compensation assessed until the date when the compensation is
paid.
Disturbance
In Tanzanian law a disturbance allowance is paid in addition to compensation paid for land
and is calculated as a percentage (currently 4%) of the market value of the acquired land
over 12 months.
Transport of goods
A transport allowance is also paid to assist people to move their fumiture and goods. It is
calculated as the cost of 12 tonnes hauled over a distance not exceeding 20 km. It is only
paid to people required to vacate residential premises.
Loss of profit or accommodation
For businesses a loss of profit or accommodation allowance is meant to compensate for lost
profit or business opportunity while the affected person is re-establishing the business
elsewhere. For loss of residential accommodation the allowance is meant to cover the cost
of renting a similar property to that foregone while the affected person is either acquiring a
replacement residence or is building a new house.
Loss of profit is supposed to be based on business audited accounts. The accommodation
allowance should be equivalent to the rent of the acquired property per month over a 36
months period. Accommodation allowances and loss of profit compensation should not be
paid concurrently in respect of the same property. The law is not clear as to whether or not
the accommodation allowance is to be paid when only part of a DP's structures are acquired
and the owner or occupier continues to-live on the remaining part of the property. In practice
in such cases no accommodation allowance is paid.
Graves
The Land Acquisition Act specifically refers to certain compensation requirements for land
that was, prior to its acquisition, used as a cemetery or crematorium. The Graves Removal
Act (1968) also stipulates that compensation should be paid to the relatives of the deceased
to meet the costs of exhumation, burial elsewhere and ritual expenses.
5.1.9 Responsibility for paying compensation
According to the Land Act (Section 156) the duty to pay compensation when ROWs are
created lies with the Government department, local or public authority or corporate body that
applies for their creation. In this case this refers to TANESCO. Affected land and property
owners are free to hire a valuer, at their own cost, to provide advice and to assist in
determining compensation to be claimed on the prescribed forms.

(Dar es Salaam, Moshi and Arusha)                           Revised November 2005
In addition the affected people's in olvement is strongly emphasised. In this respect the
project proponent (i.e. TANESCO) i obliged to involve the affected people in every aspect
of acquiring their land and ensure t at it pays fair and prompt compensation and at market
value prices.
5.1.10 Dispute settlements
The Land Acquisition Act define| procedures for dispute settlement with respect to
compensation. Where disputes a d disagreements cannot be resolved by the parties
concemed the parties may take the atter to a court of law in terms of provisions of the Act.
The Act states, among others, that i such disputes and disagreements are not settled by the
parties involved within six weeks a er the date of publication of the notice of intention to
acquire the land for a public purpo e, the Minister or any person holding or claiming any
interest in the land may institute a s it in a court of law for the determination of the dispute.
More specifically with respect to the creation of ROWs, in terms of the Land Act
(Section 156), when any person or ntity entitled to claim compensation and the body with a
duty to pay the compensation cann t agree on the amount or method of payment or where
there is dissatisfaction over the ti e taken to make, negotiate or process an offer of
compensation the aggrieved party  ay refer the matter to the High Court.
5.2   INSTITUTIONAL AND ADM INSTRATIVE FRAMEWORK
There is no single agency in Ta zania that is responsible for planning and providing
resettlement and compensation i cases where people are involuntarily displaced by
development projects. However, it s accepted practice that the developer (i.e. in this case
TANESCO) assumes full responsibi ty for the delivery of entitlements even though a number
of other actors may be involved.
5.2.1 The Tanzania Electric Sup Iy Company Limited
TANESCO a public company that w s established in 1964 and is wholly owned by the GOT.
The Ministry of Energy and Mineral regulates the operations of TANESCO. The company's
core business is generation, transm ssion, distribution and sale of electricity to the Tanzania
mainland and bulk power supply to the island of Zanzibar. The current Board of Directors
comprises of nine members from t e Government, public and private sectors. Apart from
the Chairman, all members of th  Board of Directors are appointed by the Minister for
Energy and Minerals. The Chairma is appointed by the President of the United Republic of
Tanzania.
TANESCO is currently managed   y a Managing Director and General Managers (for
Transmission, Generation, Distrib tion and Supporting Services).  The company is
organised into a number of dire torates covering: Operations; Finance; Privatisation;
Systems Control and Transmission Corporate Planning and Research; Human Resources;
Security; Information System; Interr I Audit; Projects; Generation and Public Relations. The
Directors of Corporate Planning an Research and of Projects are the most actively involved
in the planning of projects and in ealing with environmental and social issues. They will
play a significant role in implementa ion of the RAP.
There are a total of 23 regional offi es. Most of the activities at the regional offices are co-
ordinated by the Directorate of 0 erations. The main duties carried out in the regions
include billing and revenue collect n, construction and maintenance of distribution lines,
installation of new service lines and ttending to emergency cases from customers.

5.2.2 Local government
Tanzania is divided into 26 regions and each region is divided into a number of districts,
although in many urban areas, including Arusha, these districts are constituted as
municipalities. There are 130 districts. Part of the project will be implemented in Anusha
municipality and Arumeru, Hai and Moshi Rural districts.
The districts and municipalities are govemed by district or municipal councils and are
administered by district executive directors or municipal directors who co-ordinate
administrative and technical service personnel at the district or municipal level. Permission
to undertake any activity in a district or municipality has to be granted by the relevant
director. There is also a district commissioner in each of the districts who is responsible for
co-ordinating and managing central govemment affairs20.
Each district/municipality is divided into a number of wards govemed by ward councils. For
administrative purposes the ward is headed by a ward executive officer. The responsibility
for implementing and overseeing development activities rests with the ward level. Ward
authorities have authority and responsibility for implementing, overseeing and monitoring
development activities and for granting permission to undertake development activities in a
ward.
In nural areas wards are further divided into villages which are govemed by village councils.
Villages may be further subdivided into sub-villages or hamlets. In urban areas such as
Arusha and some other areas along the proposed transmission line the wards are
subdivided into a number of sub-wards or "streets" known as mtaa.
The institutional framework is intended to facilitate effective planning and implementation of
various activities on the ground by ensuring that there are both top-down and bottom-up
communication channels during planning and implementation of development programmes,
such as the DTRP.    In cases of conflicting interests between stakeholders the district
executive director's office, or municipal director's office often plays the role of arbitrator
before the matter is taken to the appropnate courts of law.
5.2.3 Ministry of Lands and Human Settlement Development
The Ministry of Lands and Human Settlement Development (MLHSD) is responsible for
policy, regulation and co-ordination matters pertaining to land in Tanzania. The ministry
administers the Land Acquisition Act, the Land Act and the Village Land Act and the
Commissioner of Lands administers most issues to do with land allocation, acquisition,
registration and land management in general. All instances of acquisition of land for public
purposes and the need for resettlement and/or compensation have to be referred to the
Commissioner.
Lands offices have been established at the district and municipal levels. Personnel relevant
to land affairs, resettlement and compensation include land officers, land surveyors, valuers
and town planners. Their day-to-day work is co-ordinated at the district level by the district
planner. They are supported by similar technical staff at the headquarters of the MLHSD.
District or municipal valuers are required to prepare and approve compensation rates for
crops for their respective districts or municipalities.  However, most districts and
municipalities have not yet done this.
20 There are also officers of regional commissioners with a small number of technical staff. However, most staff
who, until recently, used to be based at the regional level have been transferred to the districts.

5.2.4 National Environment Man gement Council
The Environmental Management Ac (No. 20 of 2004) provides for the legal and institutional
framework for the sustainable mana ement of the environment. Among others, it:
*     outlines principles for man gement, impact and risk assessment, prevention and
control of pollution, waste  anagement, environmental quality standards, public
participation and enforcemet;
*     provides the legal basis fo implementation of economic and financial incentives
designed to influence behav our to ensure sustainable use of natural resources and

*     repeals the National Environ ental Management Act (1983); and
*     provides for the continued existence of the National Environment Management
Council (NE MC).
The NEMC is responsible for advis g the govemment on issues of environment, including
social issues. In terms of its ma date the NEMC will review both the ESIA and RAP
documents and, if acceptable to the NEMC, recommend the Minister responsible for
environment to issue an environme tal permit to TANESCO. The environmental permit is
required before the project can be i plemented.

6     RESETTLEMENT, COMPENSATION AND RESTORATION MEASURES
6.1   ELIGIBILITY
According to the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act and the Land Act all properties
located within the proposed 10 m extension to the existing ROW at the time of inspection
and valuation are eligible for compensation.  Identification and inspection of affected
properties took place during March and April 2005 by a registered property valuation
company engaged by TANESCO and notices to claim compensation, on the prescribed
Land Form No. 14, were served on the affected property owners.
The cut-off date for eligibility for compensation and resettlement measures is deemed to be
the date on which the notices were served.
6.2   CATEGORIES OF DISPLACED PEOPLE
Only one principal category of people is recognised in Tanzanian land legislation and
regulations as being eligible for resettlement and/or compensation  measures.  It
compromises property owners, i.e. people with granted rights of occupancy, customary
rights and long-standing rights of occupancy. No specific business enterprises that are
distinctly different to common agricultural undertakings have been identified. A number of
sub-categories of DPs have been identified. These are:
*     owners of farms or plots with houses and other buildings in the ROW;
*     owners of farms or plots with non-residential buildings in the ROW;
*     owners of farms or plots without buildings in the ROW; and
*     institutions with buildings in the ROW
6.2.1  Owners of farms or plots with houses and other buildings in the ROW
Fifty five households have land within the proposed 10 m extension to the ROW on which
they also have residences (i.e. houses) and other buildings. These DPs will thus:
*     lose land on which they are living;
*     loses the houses in which they are living (and thus be physically displaced and be
required to relocate elsewhere);
*     lose (in many cases) other buildings and structures;
*     lose (in many cases) productive crop land (and thus suffer losses of means of food
supply and/or income generation); and
*     lose (in some cases) standing crops (and thus suffer losses of income sources or
means of livelihood).
6.2.2  Owners of farms or plots with non-residential buildings in the ROW
Seven households have land in the ROW on which they have non-residential buildings. In
most cases their houses are on parts of their land holdings outside of the proposed ROW.
These DPs will thus:
*     lose non-residential buildings and structures;
*     lose (in many cases) productive crop land (and thus suffer losses of means of food
supply and/or income generation); and
*     lose (in some cases) standing crops (and thus suffer losses of income sources or
means of livelihood).

6.2.3 Owners of farms or plots wi thout buildings in the ROW
Four hundred and fifty three DPs h ve land in the proposed ROW on which there are no
buildings or structures. These DPs v ill thus:
*     lose (in many cases) product ve crop land (and thus suffer losses of means of food
supply and/or income general on); and
*     lose (in some cases) standi g crops (and thus suffer losses of income sources or
means of livelihood).
6.2.4 Institutions with buildings i i the ROW
The bible college in Mlangarini villag will lose land on which it has a number of institutional
buildings. These include the pastor s house, the college principal's house, a dining hall, a
kitchen block, an ablution block, a tore shed, a cattle shed and a shed housing a grain
grinding mill. The bible college will tt us:
*     lose land on which it is situatf d;
*     loses the college buildings ( ausing physical displacement and the need to relocate
elsewhere);
*     lose productive crop land (a d thus suffer losses of means of food supply and/or
income generation); and
*     lose standing crops (and  hus suffer losses of income sources or means of
livelihood).
6.2.5  Other categories of displac d people
A number of other categories of di placed people have been identified. These may also
belong to one of the four main sub-c tegories described above, as applicable. These are:
*     people who may suffer inadv rtent and temporary damage to their land and property
caused by construction tearr . This could include, for instance, damage to nearby
crops, fruit trees and, possit y, infrastructure such as fences. For this category of
people the same compensati n principles outlined in this RAP will apply;
*     relatives with an interest in raves adversely affected by the project. Graves may
need to be exhumed and r urial undertaken at another location. In many cases
rituals and ceremonies will nf d to be performed; and
*     vulnerable people. In terms of WB OP 4.12 requirements an additional category of
DPs has been identified. So e DPs, such as widows, single mothers, child-headed
households, handicapped pe pie, HIV/AIDS victims and the elderly, are particularly
vulnerable when displaced  r affected by some development projects and often
require special assistance. I line with the principles of the RAP that no DP suffers
undue hardship, it is propo ed that supplementary measures be provided to this
category of DPs

Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited  Proposed 132 kV Transmission Line from Moshi to Arusha
Distribution and Transmission Rehabilitatio Project          Resettlement Action Plan
(Dar es Salaam, Moshi and Arusha)                             Revised November 2005
6.3   RESETTLEMENT AND CO       PENSATION ENTITLEMENTS
6.3.1 Determination of entitleme ts and amount of compensation
During March and April 2005 eac DP was served with a notice on the prescribed form
(Land Form No. 14), requiring the o ner/occupier to complete and submit Land Form No. 15
and to agree upon a date for offici 3 valuation. This was done by the registered property
valuation teams appointed by TAN SCO, together with local leaders and the relevant ward
executive officer. The owners/occu iers were informed about their rights and the grievance
procedures to be followed in the case of any complaints or disagreements about the
compensation process and valuati ns21. They were informed that they have the right to
employ, at their own expense, their wn independent valuers.
After receipt of the notifications the DPs completed Land Form No 15 to apply for
compensation and submitted these o the valuation team. The completed forms for a ward
were submitted within 60 days to th valuation team.
The registered valuation team also arried out its own inspection of the affected properties to
check the claims submitted by D s and to undertake its own valuation. Compensation
details for each identified property re provided in individual compensation schedules which
have been signed by the respect e district lands officer, the district commissioner, the
regional commissioner and TANES O.
The compensation packages differ or each DP, depending on the nature and magnitude of
displacement. The compensation pplies to all DPs regardless of whether or not there is
need for the DPs to relocate to an her area or to re-arrange on the remaining part of their
affected land.  Table 7 is an en lement matrix for the four categories of DPs. It is
considered that these adequately meet the requirements of WB OP 4.12 and that no
additional measures are conside d to be necessary.  In the following sections an
explanation of the entitlements for arious losses is provided and the methods used to value
the losses explained. The decision n what valuation method was to be adopted was guided
by the provisions of the Land Act (N D. 4 of 1999) which provides that the basis of valuation is
market value, although this has h d to be adapted to cater for the circumstances of the
project area.
The basic principle goveming com ensation is that none of the affected people should be
made worse off. The element of compulsory acquisition of land is well treated in most
legislation worldwide, including Tan ania, emphasising the right to receive fair compensation
by those who occupy land that is su ject to acquisition by the State for declared objectives.
6.3.2 Compensation for the los of residential and productive land
All 516 DPs within the propose   10 m extension to the existing ROW  will receive
compensation for the loss of land.  he compensation awarded will enable DPs, if they wish,
to purchase, or obtain from village ouncils, replacement land. For the 55 families who will
lose residential land within the RO  this will be localised, self-relocation. Enquiries made
during the inspection and valuation exercise undertaken in March and April, 2005, revealed
that land is generally readily ava able in close proximity to the proposed ROW. Ten
households in Hai district will los all of their land and will, therefore, suffer full physical
displacement.
21 Complaints and claims are to be forwar ed to the district executive director who is obliged to investigate the
case. All claims need to be resolved befor compensation payments are effected. Any complaints lodged after a
specific date will not be considered.

Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited  Proposed 132 kV Transmission Line from Moshi to Arusha
Distribution and Transmission Rehabilitation Project        Resettlement Action Plan
(Dar es Salaam, Moshi and Arusha)                           Revised November 2005
Tanzanian legislation requires that DPs be paid a disturbances allowance to alleviate social
problems or physical hardship experienced by DPs, regardless of whether or not they have
to relocate to a new area or whether they remain on the unaffected potion of their land. In
accordance with the applicable regulations, the disturbance allowance has been calculated
by multiplying the assessed value of the affected land (not assets) by the average
percentage of interest offered by commercial banks on twelve month fixed deposits. This is
currently 4%.
Despite the fact that land will have been acquired for the ROW, TANESCO will allow DPs to
continue to grow crops on the ROW where the new overhead transmission line has been
erected. However, this will be allowed on the understanding that no tall crops or trees will be
planted which could interfere in the operation of the transmission line. It will also be allowed
on the understanding that TANESCO will not be liable for any subsequent damage caused
to crops and property by transmission line operation and maintenance teams within the
ROW. It is recommended that TANESCO issue permits to DPs allowed to continue to grow
crops and use grazing land within the ROW as a measure of control.
Valuation of productive farmland has been based on the eaming potential of the farm unit,
primarily based on crop production or livestock grazing. This was to comply with regulations
made under Section 179 of the Land Act. In establishing valuation rates for land in the two
districts, the registered property valuation company made local enquiries and, with help of
the two district valuers, obtained a list of recent sales transactions in the areas. These were
used to compute values for land in different locations of the project area. These rates are
listed in Appendix 1. The cost of land preparation at the new site is implicit in the
compensation rates adopted so no extra allowance is provided for this. Table 8 lists the
compensation for land for each village or sub-village in the project area.
The total value of compensation for land to be paid to the 516 affected households is
TSh 108 797 000 and the value of the disturbance allowance to be paid to these DPs is
TSh 4 351 884.
6.3.3 Provision of replacement land instead of compensation
A possible altemative to the payment of compensation for the loss of residential and
productive land would be the provision by the project of replacement land, together with land
preparation and other assistance. However, this altemative is not favoured mainly because
of the linear nature of displacement along the ROW. Establishment of one or more
resettlement areas would remove DPs from their home areas and impact on social and
cultural linkages and networks. It would also require the provision of additional social
infrastructure and services which will not be needed if DPs relocate locally.
No DPs have so far indicated that they wish to be provided with replacement land and
housing in lieu of cash compensation. However, should this arise DPs who qualify for
physical relocation will be asked to identify replacement plots for themselves that the project
will assist them to purchase. In a similar exercise (i.e. The Songo Songo Project - Rural
Areas) DPs were asked to identify plots for themselves and this was readily done and the
purchase prices of these plots were negotiated with the land owners in the selected areas.

6.3.4  Compensation for the loss f houses and other structures
Sixty three affected households will e compensated in cash fro the loss of buildings that are
currently located on their land within he proposed 10 m extension to the existing ROW. Fifty
five of these households are reside  on the affected land. The compensation awarded will
enable DPs to construct similar hou  s and stnuctures on the unaffected part of their plots or
to constnuct new houses and buildi gs or purchase these on replacement plots that they
may purchase or obtain elsewhere. t is expected that many DPs will construct replacement
houses and other buildings the    elves and will use material salvaged from   those
abandoned in the ROW. Other DP will employ local builders to construct the houses and
buildings on their behalf. For DPs reuiring special assistance the project will provide help in
organising and supervising the cons  ction of replacement houses and buildings.
For valuing houses and other buildi gs for compensation the registered property valuation
company should have applied the  r ect comparison method" to arrive at the market values
of the different structures. However this was not possible due to lack of comparable recent
sales data. The subject area is ve  inactive in real property market business. International
Valuation Standards (IVS: 2005) as  ell as local practice in Tanzania permits the estimate of
surrogate market values through  ;ost methods". The "replacement cost method" was
therefore adopted to estimate the ost of erecting a similar unit at current prices. The
observed condition of the housing  nits being valued was then used as a basis to allow
depreciation sums from the replace ent cost figure to obtain what would be the likely price a
person may be prepared to pay fo the subject property if given opportunity to buy. The
obtained depreciated replacement ost adopted is considered to be equal to the market
value which may be defined as:

'...the highest price in terms of money which property under appraisal would be expected to
bring in a competitive and open market under conditions requisite for a fair sale..."
Implicit in this definition is the consummation of a sale at a specified date and the passing of
ownership from seller to buyer under conditions whereby:
*     both the buyer and seller are economically motivated and are both acting prudently;
*     the sale price is not affected by any undue influence;
*     both parties are well informed and well advised and are acting in what they consider
to be their own best interest; and
*     a reasonable time is allowed for exposure in the open market..
Tanzanian law provides for an allowance which compensates DPs who lose a residential
premises to cover costs of renting another premises for 36 months while they are purchasing
or building a replacement house. The accommodation allowance has been determined by
multiplying the assessed monthly market rent for the affected house by 36 months. The
monthly market rent for the building is based on standard market rentals for the affected
building in the area in which it is located.
A standard transport allowance is paid in addition to the accommodation allowance to DPs to
meet costs incurred in moving assets from the affected property to a new location. It covers
the haulage of 12 t of goods for a distance of 20 km. The allowance is paid to property
owners who have to physically relocate from their existing residence.
Table 9 lists the total value of compensation for houses and buildings in each village or sub-
village to be paid to 63 affected households. The total value of compensation for affected
structures is TSh 194 068 488. The total value of accommodation allowances to be awarded
to 55 of these households which will abandon houses within the ROW is TSh 21 852 000.
The total value of the transport allowances to be paid to the 55 households is
TSh 4 435 200.
6.3.5 Compensation for the loss of standing crops
A total of 333 affected households have standing crops on their farms and plots within the
proposed ROW. These include annual crops and perennial crops, including fruit trees. The
affected families will be compensated in full for these.
In assessing the market value of standing crops for compensation purposes the registered
property valuation company adopted the "eamings approach". This is in compliance with the
regulations made under Section 179 of the Land (Assessment of the Value of Land for
Compensation) Regulations, 2001.
A list of rates was prepared and presented to the district valuers of Hai and Arumeru districts
and Arusha Municipality to seek their opinion. In tum, the two district valuers (Hai and
Arumeru) commented on the proposed rates and provided a schedule of rates in use by their
offices. The rates for Hai district were found to be higher than those for Arumeru district as
Hai district is more drought prone and the cost of rearing a crop tends to be high as does the
price per unit of produce.

In applying the eamings approach, t e production capacity of an average tended crop that is
normally found in the area was esti ated. Adopted valuation rates for crops are presented in
Appendix 2. The net annual value c ' the crop was then determined and capitalised at a rate
which was averaged from the sev ral bank lending rates currently in force in Tanzania.
Adjustments were accordingly ma e to arrive at values that were considered to be fair
market value.
The approximate compensation co t, per village, for affected standing crops is shown in
Table 10. The estimated total cost f r standing crops is TSh 37 571 700.
6.3.6  Interest on overdue payme t
Interest on compensation payments made more than six months after valuation of the
property will be calculated as the av rage percentage rate of interest offered by commercial
banks on fixed deposits until the co pensation is paid.
6.3.7 Removal of graves
A total of 13 graves will need to Ie removed. The cost of removing a grave invariably
involves traditional rituals which  sually include the cost of local brews, the cost of
purchasing and slaughtering an ani al and the payment of fees to those who perform the
rituals. In line with current Lands Dffice experience the cost of grave removal has been
estimated at TSh 150 000   per g ave so that the total cost for grave removal is
TSh 1 950 000 (Table 9). The villa e councils are responsible for allocating replacement
burial plots.

6.3.8 Compensation for the loss of community and social infrastructure
The inspection and valuation exercise carried out in March and April 2005 did not identify
any community and social infrastructure or resources that will be affected by the creation of
the 10 m extension to the existing ROW. Since it is expected that most DPs will continue to
live on the residual part of the plots outside the ROW or will relocate themselves to other
plots in the local vicinity they will continue to use existing community and social infrastructure
and services.
6.3.9 People affected by unplanned construction damages and losses
It is possible that some persons or entities may suffer damage to their property by
constnuction teams during the implementation of the project which may lead to small
amounts of additional displacement not foreseen during the preparation of the RAP. This
could include, for instance, damage to buildings, walls, fences, hedges, gardens, trees and
crops. In many cases these will be temporary losses. Affected parties will be able to claim
compensation from   the responsible contractor.  The transmission line construction
contractors will be responsible for paying compensation for any damage at prevailing market
rates in accordance with the other compensation principles outlined in the RAP.
6.3.10 Vulnerable people
The inspection and valuation exercise carried out in March and April 2005 did not specifically
identify any vulnerable people who require additional assistance. However, should the need
arise the project will provide the necessary assistance, in cash or kind, to be determined on
a case-by-case basis.

6.4    SOCIAL IMPACTS OF RESI TTLEMENT
The DPs are part of the individual I al communities in which they currently live or operate.
As it is not expected that DPs will b  moving very far they will continue to remain within their
respective communities and there al unlikely to be any significant social impacts associated
with the compensation and relocatio exercise. It is not foreseen that there will be any major
issues related to integration into hos populations.

(Dar es Salaam, Moshi and Arusha)                          Revised November 2005
7     IMPLEMENTATION AND DELIVERY OF ENTITLEMENTS
7.1   ORGANISATIONAL ARRANGEMENTS
TANESCO is responsible for implementing the RAP and delivering entitlements to DPs. The
Project Co-ordinator of the DTRP in the Projects Directorate of TANESCO has overall
responsibility for implementation of the RAP but staff from the Corporate Planning and
Research Directorate are also involved. TANESCO has employed the services of external
specialists to prepare many elements of the resettlement and compensation component of
the DTRP already. These have included the registered property valuation company which
has identified affected households and properties, served notices on DPs, compiled
compensation schedules for each DP and determined the amount of compensation to be
paid. It is expected that, where necessary, such an arrangement will continue. For the
remaining activities to be undertaken it is believed that there is sufficient and adequate
capacity within TANESCO to undertake these activities.
TANESCO will also need to work closely with a number of institutions, many of which have
legal obligations to carry out functions related to resettlement and/or compensation. These
include MLHSD and the relevant local authorities such as the Hai and Arumeru district
councils and administrations as well as the relevant ward executive officers.
A Compensation Committee should be formed within TANESCO to include staff from the
Directorate of Projects, the Directorate of Corporate Planning and Research, The Directorate
of Finance, the Directorate of System Control and Transmission, the Company Secretary
and representatives from the respective regional offices.
This committee will guide the DTRP Project Co-ordinator who will link also with a
Compensation Steering Committee (CSC).which should be established to co-ordinate the
implementation of the RAP and to review progress. . The CSC should comprise
representatives from:
*     TANESCO;
*     Hai and Arumeru district administrations (e.g. district executive directors)
*     The Ministry of Energy and Minerals;
*     The Ministry of Lands and Human Settlement Development (MLHSD);
*     The socio-economic consultant appointed by TANESCO; and
*     The commercial property valuation company appointed by TANESCO.
7.2   ACTIVITIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
7.2.1  Activities already completed
The Land Regulations (2001) clearly state the procedures to be followed by TANESCO and
other bodies with respect to the creation of ROWs and the payment of compensation to
displaced persons. Many of these activities have already been undertaken. These included:
*     the inspection of affected properties and households by the registered property
valuation company in March and April 2005, with a reference number assigned to
each DP;
*     serving notice on DPs on the prescribed Land Form No. 14 and on other interested
parties;
*     the submission by DPs of completed compensation claims on the prescribed Land
Form Nos. 15 and 16;

(Dar es Salaam, Moshi and Arusha)                           Revised November 2005
*     the determination of compen ation rates for specific items (including land, buildings
and crops) for different areas and submission of these to the relevant district valuers
for approval;
*     the  determination  of indi idual compensation  entitlements and  values of
compensation by the registere  property valuation company;
*     the production of a valuation report, submitted to the Chief Govemment Valuer in
MLHSD for approval;
*     the compilation of individual compensation schedules, indicating the breakdown and
total amount of compensatio to be paid to each claimant, forwarded to TANESCO
and to the respective district land officers (the compensation schedules have to be
countersigned by the releva t village leader, ward executive officer, district lands
officer, district commissioner, nd regional commissioner).
Implementation of a number of activit es has still to be undertaken.
7.2.2 Household survey
It is recommended that a socio-econ zmic survey be undertaken of the affected households
in order to provide a baseline for fu ure monitoring and evaluation of the resettlement and
compensation component of the projo tct.
7.2.3 Delivery of entitlements
After approval of the valuation rep rt and compensation schedule the Commissioner of
Lands will instruct TANESCO to corr mence the payment of compensation. Payment will be
made by TANESCO to the Lands Officers at district level. District officials will then pay
compensation cheques to DPs in a cordance with the compensation schedules. Legally,
payment must be made within six months of serving notices on DPs otherwise interest has
to be paid.
7.2.4 Confirmation of receipt of ertitlements
On receipt of the compensation che ues the DPs will sign for receipt of the entitlements on
the compensation schedule.
Owners will have the right to remove all affected structures and assets. If this is not done by
a fixed date (advised at the time f compensation payment) TANESCO will provide, in
writing, the contractor with permiss n to remove all affected structures when needed for
clearing the ROW and constructing t e transmission line.
7.2.5 Permits to utilise the right cf way
TANESCO will allow DPs to contin e to use the ROW for certain activities, such as the
production of short and temporar i crops and for livestock grazing.  However, it is
recommended for control purposes, that the affected DP are issued with permits. These
could include the conditions of us  of the ROW  and could, for example, be renewed
annually.
7.2.6 Other activities
Not less than ninety days after the serving of notices the Minister for Lands and Human
Settlement Development may, b sed on the information provided to him by the
Commissioner of Lands concemin the compensation exercise, publish an order in the
Gazette creating the ROW. The ROW is deemed to be officially created 30 days after

publication in the Gazette. (i.e. 120 days after the notices have been served on the affected
parties).
For registered properties the Registrar of Lands will amend certificates of occupancy or other
title documents held in any office of the land registry as well as the copies of certificates of
occupancy kept by the holders to reflect the boundaries of the.new ROW and the changed
boundaries of properties. Where the whole of a land holding is acquired for the ROW the
certificate of occupancy has to be cancelled. Fees associated with the re-registering and re-
surveying process will be met by the project.
7.3     PROGRESS MONITORING AND REPORTING
Throughout the implementation process TANESCO will keep records of all progress and
submit regular reports to the CSC. The CSC will verify that the progress report is a tnre
record. The interval of progress report submission will need to be determined but should
probably be monthly.
7.4    INDICATIVE TIME SCHEDULE
As many of the RAP activities have been completed the outstanding activities centre around
the payment of compensation and the relocation of DPs to adjacent parts of their current
land holdings or to new areas. A period of six months should be given to DPs to relocate
after they have been provided with compensation. While it is recognised that DPs living
within the ROW may not be immediately able to obtain replacement residential land or
accommodation, the payment of the accommodation allowance will enable them to rent
altemative accommodation in the meantime.
No construction should commence until compensation has been completed and DPs
afforded the opportunity to find alternative land and accommodation, as applicable, and to
salvage materials from abandoned property.
An indicative time schedule for the implementation of activities that still need to be
undertaken is shown in Figure 3. It is assumed that the delivery of entitlements to DPs will
commence before March or April 2006, i.e. within twelve months of the valuation of
properties which took place in March and April 2005. It is expected that implementation of
activities which still need to be undertaken (including the self-relocation of DPs to new sites)
will not exceed ten months from the time that the payment of compensation begins.

8     COMMUNITY PARTICIPA       ION AND GRIEVANCE PROCEDURES
8.1   COMMUNITY PARTICIPATIC N
Since the beginning of 2005, a num er of public communication meetings have been held
with people living in affected areas al ng the proposed ROW to explain the project, the need
for land acquisition and to obtai  feedback.  These meetings were conducted by
independent public consultation con ultants engaged by TANESCO. The results of these
meetings are recorded in the Draf Final SIA (Annex 1 in Volume 2) and subsequently
incorporated into the ESIA produced y TANESCO in April 2005.
Because the affected people are spr ad along the length of the proposed transmission lines
it is difficult to deal with a sin le community or community representative body.
Nevertheless, it is proposed that the resent mechanism for communicating with the affected
parties should be continued, i.e. TA ESCO and the district and ward officers will interact
with the affected persons through th already well-established channels that are operating in
the wards.
8.2   GRIEVANCE MECHANISMS AND PROCEDURES
Grievances and disputes related to the resettlement and/or compensation exercise may
arise from a number of different issu s. These include:
*     mistakes related to the identif cation of affected property and people within the ROW;
*     disagreements related to the wnership of property (including inheritance and divorce
related disputes);
*     disagreements on land and a set valuation;
*     disagreements on other com ensation allowances; and
*     problems related to the time nd manner of payment of compensation;
Disputes related to land ownership will need to be brought before the appropriate level of
land courts as established by law, in luding those established at the village level.
The Land Act (Section 156) only p ovides for grievances reiated to land acquisition and
compensation issues related to the reation of a ROW to be brought to the High Court of
Tanzania. However, this is difficult, xpensive and impractical for most of the residents and
businesses within the project area.
Therefore, for compensation issues claims and complaints it is suggested that they be
brought to the attention of the villac leadership which will forward grievances conceming
the non-fulfilment of entitlement co tracts, levels of compensation or seizure of land and
assets without compensation to the ward executive officer and then the district executive
director.
It is important that grievances be re Ived at the local level as far as possible and care will
need to be taken to respect the fact that many of the claimants are poor and illiterate. It is
proposed that the district executive irectors, in addressing any grievances, should consult
with TANESCO, the Ministry of Ene gy and Minerals, the valuation teams, councillors and
ward and village officers and leade . If a dispute cannot be resolved it can be brought
before the local courts and if the I al courts cannot solve the matter application can be
made to the High Court of Tanzania or final resolution.

9     MONITORING AND EVALUATION
In temms of the requirements of the WB, during compensation and resettlement
implementation, and possibly for some time afterwards, both internal and extemal monitoring
and evaluation exercises should be carried out in order to monitor progress and ensure that
DPs are adequately catered for and are left in a position no worse off than they were prior to
project commencement.
However, because DPs are widely dispersed along the proposed transmission line
monitoring and evaluation would need to be undertaken for nearly every individual DP in
order to be able to draw accurate conclusions. Such an exercise would present practical
and logistical difficulties. However, monitoring and evaluation should be part of, or be
closely aligned to, the monitoring and evaluation process agreed to for monitoring of other
environmental impacts in terms of the ESIA prepared for the DTRP. The ESIA presents a
monitoring and evaluation plan which includes the resettlement and/or compensation
aspects of the project. The monitoring and evaluation plan presented in the ESIA lists the
impacts, mitigation measures, indicators, means of verification and responsibilities for
monitoring. The aspects of this monitoring and evaluation plan that are relevant to the
resettlement and compensation component of the DTRP are listed in Table 11.
Extemal monitoring and evaluation should be conducted through WB missions deployed to
monitor and evaluate the overall DTRP. The main objective will be to determine whether the
objectives of the resettlement/compensation component of the project have been achieved
and to assess, to the extent possible, implementation of compensation and the restoration of
the livelihoods of DPs. The external monitoring and evaluation exercise should include, but
not be limited to, evaluation of:
-     implementation progress;
-     compensation and resettlement policies;
-     delivery of entitlements;
-     changes in livelihoods and incomes among DPs; and
-     consultation with and participation of DPs and other stakeholders.

(Dar es Salaam, Moshi and Arusha)                             Revised November 2005
10    INDICATIVE IMPLEMENTATION COSTS
The breakdown of estimated compensation costs, provided through the inspection and
valuation exercise undertaken from March to June 2005, is shown in Table 12. The total
compensation cost is estimated at TSh 371 076 272 (USD 371 016).   The cost per
household is thus TSh 719 140 (USD 719) (516 households)
In addition, grave removal is estimated to cost TSh 1 950 000. An amount of TSh 5 000 000
has been allocated for undertaking a 20% sample socio-economic survey of the DPs in order
to provide baseline data for future monitoring and evaluation purposes.  Global field
implementation costs are estimated at TSh 50 000 per household to give a total global field
implementation cost of TSh 25 800 000 (USD 25 800).   A contingency of 15%   of
compensation costs, grave removal costs and global field implementation costs has been
assumed. The breakdown of the indicative implementation costs for the RAP is shown in
Table 13.
The total indicative implementation cost for the RAP, including the 15% contingency, is
therefore TSh 464 400 213 (USD 464 401) or TSh 900 000 (USD 900) per household (516
households or entities).

Reinforcement and Upgrade of Dar es Salaam, Cilimanjaro and Arusha Transmission and Dismbution System Project
EXECUTIVE SUM !IARY
The report presents the results of th Social Impact Assessment study undertaken in three
regions of Dar-es-Salaam, Kilimanj ro and Arusha. In total, about 30 Wards, Hamlet and
.        Villages were involved in the st y conducted by a private (sociologist) consultant
Nyinisaeli Palangyo.
.        The wards/villages studied were 11 that will be affected by the upgrading of the
electricity transmission lines and re  bilitation of substations.
The study is part of TANESCO's fforts in the improvement of supply of energy. The
specific objectives of the project ar herefore:
*  Reducing the duration and  quency of power interruptions
*  Improving voltage condition at consumers premises
*  Reducing power system los s
Basically the study's key objective  as to assess the impact of the project to the people
who will have to be resettled so as tgive way for the transmission lines and construction
of sub-stations. According to the  and Act No 4 of 1999 those to be relocated are
supposed to be compensated of the properties (houses, crops, land, trees, etc.), moving
allowance up to 20km and disturb nce allowances. Also according to the World Bank
Operational Policies on Involuntay Resettlement (revised April 2004), involuntary
resettlement should be avoided or  inimised where feasible after exploring all possible
altematives. But where not feasibl resettlement should be conceived and executed as
sustainable development programs.
The consultant was therefore assignrd to
1. Review of relevant xisting and pending environmental legislation, land
acquisition legislatio and any other relevant legislation pertaining to this
project
2. Review the relevan  World Bank policies (OP4.01 & OP4.12) and
guidelines including he pollution Prevention and Abatement hand book
(Electric Power Tran mission and Distribution)
3. Meetings and consul tions with the TANESCO facility management and
relevant staff in res ctive regions, relevant govemment and municipal/
town authorities, env ronmental experts, projects affected people and other
bodies deemed nece ary
4. Establish an appro  ate baseline for environmental, socio-economic,
health and safety iss s
5. Identify potential im acts of the project on aspects of (social, biological,
physical health and s fety)
6. Prepare an analysis f altematives e.g. various routes/considered for the
new transmission lin , different design e.g. underground cable, compact
design. These shoul put to consideration economic technical social and
environmental param ters.

Reinforcement and Upgrade of Dar es Salaam, Kilimanjaro and Arusha 1Transmission and Distrbution System Project
The study was carried out in the period from 5/1-21/2/05. It involved data collection,
semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions and public participatory meetings,
review of literature, transect walks and observations. The results of these methods have
been complementary.
General Observation
1. All communities to be affected received the information with mixed feelings.
Most of the community members showed complete anger and annoyance. They
would not understand why the Government did not plan the Right of Way before
2. Other members took the information casually requesting for compensation of
property and a plot to build on
3. The areas owned by the rich majority were the most difficult to reach agreement
and despite the reduction of area to be used for distribution they found it difficult
to let go any piece of land
4. In the rural areas Kilimanjaro and Arusha regions, some people will be without
land to support the family if the acquired land will not be allowed for use to grow
short crops such as beans and maize
5. Most people now are more aware of their rights of their property than was the
case in the past
6. People have fear over the past experience when people were resettled and not
properly compensated. This situation should be avoided/controlled as much as
possible during project implementation
Key findings
- Majority of those to be affected by the project will have to let go either their
houses and business or their houses and land or only land
' Majority the people to be affected are annoyed and angry over the whole idea of
being dislocated
, All people to be affected are concerned about their fate after relocation
particularly on the availability of the social services in the new places they will be
relocated
- All people are worried of loosing their properties. They are worried that the whole
exercise will reduce them to total poverty especially when the compensation will
not be fair
- All people are worried over the loss of their businesses and other income
generating activities
I People are more concerned over their psychological and sociological losses that
cannot be compensated by any amount of money
' They believe that loss of neighbourhood, friends and loss of a place one has
grown or used to and have become part of that area and community can not be
replaced by anything
- People especially businessmen and women are worried of loosing markets
. People with mud/wood grass thatch, old poor quality houses, are worried that they
will lead to them being discriminated and become poorer than they already are

live by ethnicity but they liv mixed. It is only possible to identify ethnic groups
in the rural areas
i There was a diverse opinio regarding houses and plots compensation. Some
wanted to be compensated M ith money, others wanted to be given another plots
while some wanted to be give n a house to house
' The Ubungo -Mikocheni rou e had majority of people who were very resistive to
the relocation and insisted or project to use the road reserve and the underground
cable
" Majority of people in Moshi- krusha route requested TANESCO to continue using
the acquired land to grow short and seasonal crops such as beans, maize,
sunflower, paddy, etc.
' People want transparent val ation process, fair and prompt compensation. They
do not like compensation d lays as happened to Airport expansion Project at
Kipawa and Kiwalani area
l  It is the wish of majority t at project should relocate as minimum people as
possible either using present technologies such as underground cable in spite of
the construction costs or rerc ting the transmission line since the social impact is
so huge to them even if they re compensated
Key Recommendations
From stakeholders
I. Compensation should be do e as soon as valuation of property is done so as to
keep up with shilling devalua ion
2. Compensation should be don to the affected persons and not to relatives
3. Compensation should be ma e by TANESCO and not by the govemment
4. After the valuation the affec ed people should be informed of the value of their
properties (in a meeting the anount of each one has to be paid as compensation)
before payment is processe so as to eliminate /reduce the possibility of being
paid less than what each ou  t to be paid
5. Where there is a possibility f diverting the transmission line it is better to divert
it and use open spaces so as t avoid disturbing and dispersing families
6. If possible use underground cable so as to shift as few people as possible or no
shifting at all
7. The project should try as mu h as possible to avoid the relocation of the people by
working hard to use open sp es whenever and wherever possible
8. Generally speaking the relo ation leads to lots of disruptions in someone's life
and any resistance instituted y those affected is very natural and understood
9. Affected people should be in olved in every stage of the project
10. Tanesco should consider usi g the road reserve instead of causing much pain to
people and incur huge comp  sation
11. Tanesco should consider a temative technologies other than lattice structure
towers that need 40m ROW. The space is too much in built areas. Try to use the
technology that will affect as less people as possible
12. People should be assured of the project implementation rather than imposing the
psychological effect while th project is not going to take place

13. Tanesco and the contractor should provide casual jobs to the children of affected
people labour during construction
14. Tanesco should establish a mechanism to deal with affected people complaints
and to conduct information dissemination
15. Tanesco should deal with people who are still living under the transmission line
or within the right of way of the existing transmission line for the safety of the
people and the operation of the line
16. Tanesco should consider supplying electricity to the affected village such as
Samaria so that they see the value of development in terms of electricity supply
17. The project should consider improving road infrastructure in the villages that will
be affected by the project as project contribution to village development
18. The project should provide some social services such as clean safe water or health
facilities in the villages where the transmission line passes and there are no such
facilities
Further to the recommendations from the stakeholders, it is recommended that the
implementation of Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP) and monitoring
is vital to the sustainability of the project. Both parties, project proponent (TANESCO)
and Contractor should ensure that they fulfil their responsibilities.

Reinforcement and Upgrade of Dar es Salaa n, Kilimanjaro and Arusha Transmission and Distribution System Project
Chapter 1
1.0   Background
TANESCO and the International  evelopment Bank Association (IDA) are preparing a
distribution rehabilitation project c mponent as part of the Songo Songo Gas Development
and power generation Project (C  dit 3569-TA). This component aims to improve the
reliability and the quality of pow  supply to the consumer. The project will achieve the
following objectives:
- Reducing the duration al d frequency of power interruptions
- Improving voltage condi ions at the consumers' premises
- Reducing power system osses
1.1.  Overall Objective
The overall objective is to assist I e project to carry out a comprehensive Social Impact
Assessment and prepare Resettlem nt Action Plan as per country laws and the World Bank
requirement as well as bringing mo  project benefits to the society.
1.2.  Objectives of the study
The objectives of the assessments M re;
o To find out the communities main concerns
o  Find out if they know/feel t at they will be affected and the extent of effects to their
lives
o  Find out main impacts to th community
o  To get suggestions from the ommunities to be affected as to what they would like to
be done to them or what the don't like from the project
o  The extent of the commu ities to be affected psychologically, financially and
sociologically
o  To find out what the affecte people wish to be done to them to replace the loss they
will undergo due to shifting
1.2.1. Methodology
A number of methodologies were a lied to conduct the study. The methodologies included:
1. Public meetings with comn unities along the identified ROW for the transmission
lines
2. Observation
3. Discussions with differen  heads in different offices at district, institutions
departments, ward and villas offices
4. Review of available docume ts

Reinforcement and Upgrade of Dar es Salaam, Kilimanjaro and Arusha Transmission and Distribution System Project
1.3   Scope of Work
The Social Economic Impact Assessment will focus on new facilities to be financed under
the project. The tasks include the following:
1. Review of relevant existing and pending environmental legislation, land
acquisition legislation and any other relevant legislation pertaining to this
project
2. Review the relevant World Bank Policies (OP 4.01&0P4.12) and guidelines
including the Pollution Prevention and Abatement Hand Book (Electric Power
Transmission and Distribution)
3. Meetings and consultations with the TANESCO facility management and
relevant staff in respective regions, relevant government and municipal/town
authorities, environment experts, projects affected people and other bodies
deemed necessary
4. Establish an appropriate baseline for environmental, socio-economic, health
and safety issues
5. Identify potential impacts of the project on aspects of (social, biological,
physical health and safety)
6. Prepare an analysis of altematives e.g. various routes/considered for the new
transmission line, different design e.g. underground cable, compact design.
These should put to consideration economic, technical, social and
environmental parameters
1.4   Limitations/bottlenecks
Time planned for workl in Dar-es-Salaam region was disrupted and extended by the timing
and availability of the Dar-es-Salaam residents. It was difficult to arrange meetings in the
working days in most of Dar-es-Salaan Wards.
Most meetings were conducted on weekends because those were the only days people could
attend meetings. This led to extended time than expected at the beginning of the work. In
some places like Msasani it was difficult to get hold of the owners of houses and instead their
housekeepers or children represented them. It was therefore difficult to get the real wishes of
house owners. This led to arrangement of another stakeholders meeting. Even then in the
second meeting only a few tumed up but the rest were still represented by their
children/house keepers.
The work was conducted during the period when there was reshuffles for the Ward Executive
Officers thus it was difficult for Mbagala Charambe Ward to arrange a meeting with the
community to be affected until a new Ward Officer was in office thus pushing the
accomplishment of work to one more week.

with useful suggestions and ideas fi'm the people that will be affected. All people though
reluctant to accept the idea of shi ing understands that the developments activities have
positive as well as negative impacts on the communities such as this one which will lead to
resettlement of people from their pla es of residence to another place.
With the support of District and Wa rd authorities, it was possible to conduct meetings in all
areas that will be affected by the p ject. This has helped to ensure that no place was left
unaddressed and this will help to mi imise unnecessary future conflicts.
The work was a success in all the t ree regions and no place was left un-addressed and thus
leading to the output of this report.

Reinforcement and Upgrade of Dar es Sal m, Kilirnanjaro and Arusha Transmission and Distnbution System Project
The Land Act, 1999
The Act stipulates procedures of a quiring land from the rightful owners and what should be
compensated. In the Act, it is fundamental principle to pay full, fair and prompt
compensation to any person w ose right of occupancy or recognized long-standing
occupation or customary use of lan I is revoked or otherwise interfered with to their detriment
by State under the Act or is ac uired under the Land Acquisition Act; the concept of
opportunity shall be based on the f llowing:
*  Market value of the real pr perty;
*  Transport allowance;
*  Loss of profits or accommo ation;
*  Cost of acquiring or getting the subject land;
*  Any other cost loss or capi I expenditure incurred to the development of the subject
land; and
*  Interest at market rate shou d be charged
Also people's (the affected) invo ement has strongly emphasized. In that matter project
proponent (TANESCO) is obliged o involve the affected people in every aspect of acquiring
their land and ensure that it pays fa r, prompt and at market value prices compensation.
National Environmental Manage ent Council Act (1983)
The Act established the National E vironment Management Council (NEMC). Which means
NEMC is a legal body with a r sponsibility of advising the government on the issues
environment which include social issues. As this project is going to relocate people to a
certain extent, it will be the intere t of NEMC to see that procedures are followed and that
people's participation in knowing heir fate is given a priority to reduce social impacts that
may be caused by the project.
World Bank OP4.12: Involuntar Resettlement (Revised in April 2004)
The World Bank recognizes tha involuntary resettlement may cause severe long-term
economic, social and environrme tal damage unless appropriate measures are carefully
planned and carried out. The m in objective of the OP4.12 is therefore to minimize
involuntary resettlement as far as pi ssible by exploring all viable options and designs before
any action is taken to resettle peopl . However, if all options have been explored and find out
that resettlement is still necessary, hen it should be done in sustainable manner by providing
sufficient investment resource to nable the persons displaced by the project to share in
project benefits. In addition, displa ed persons should be meaningfully consulted and should
have opportunities to participate in planning and implementing resettlement programs.
Further, the displaced people shou d be assisted in their efforts to improve their livelihoods
and standards of living or at lea t to restore them to pre-displaced levels or to levels
prevailing prior to the beginning o project implementation, whichever is higher.
Therefore, the policy requires the f llowing to be done though the list is not exhaustive:
o  Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) should be prepared
o Prompt and effecti e compensation at full replacement cost for losses of
assets attributable di ectly to the project should be provided
5
Social impaci Assessment Dr-ft Final Reporn



Reinforcement and Upgrade of Dar es Salaam, Kilimanjaro and Arusha Transmission and Dismbution System Project
o Consultations with affected people and information of the rights of the
displaced persons should be made
o Displaced people should be provided with assistance such as moving
allowance
o Displaced people should be provided with residential housing, housing and or
agricultural plots according to the wishes of affected people
o  Displaced people are offered support after relocation to ensure that their
livelihood is restored
o Displaced people are provided with development assistance in addition to
compensation measures such as credit facilities, training and job opportunities
o Vulnerable groups such as the elderly, women, widows, children, etc., are
given special considerations
o  Ensuring that displacement does not occur unless all necessary measures for
resettlement are in place.
World Bank OPN 11.03: Management of Cultural Property
The United Nations term "cultural property" includes sites having archaeological
prehistoric, religious, and unique natural values. Cultural property therefore,
encompasses both remains left by previous human inhabitants.
The objective of this policy is to ensure that cultural properties are protected and conserved.
Policy guidance
The general policy regarding cultural properties is to assist in their preservations and to seek
to avoid their elimination: Specifically:
A) The Bank normally declines financing projects that will significantly damage non-
replicable cultural property and will assist only those projects that are sited or
designed so as to prevent such damage
B) The Bank will assist in the protection of cultural properties encountered in Bank
financed projects rather than leaving the protection to chance. In other cases, the
project is relocated in order that the sites and structures can be preserved, studied
and restored intact in situ. In other cases structures can be relocated in order that
sites and preserved, can be studied and restored on alternate sites.
Based on this policy therefore, it is of utmost importance that the project makes sure that the
graveyards that will be affected by the project, just as was appointed out by the communities
to be affected during the consultative meetings, should be preserved or where need arise they
should be relocated to another area that will be convenient to the affected community.
However, the new site to relocate the graveyards must be agreed upon or selected by the
affected communities including religious leaders.

Chapter 3
3.0   PUBLIC CONSULTATIO i MEETINGS
Public meetings were used to ident ^y the people's concems and impacts of the project. The
people's requirement and recomm ndations that were identified by people themselves are
regarded as mitigation measures of ie peoples concerns and impacts caused by the project.
3.1   Sinza Ward: Sinza C
The first public meeting was held i Sinza C for the affected community members of Sinza
C. The number of attendants was  . 4 of them were the Mtaa leaders and not residents in
the affected area.
As a start the community members  ere shown a map showing the way leave for the project
so as to be clear whether they all re ide within the area to be affected. After the exercise the
number of the attendants was re( ced from  15 to 11 out of which 4 were the local
government leaders while only 7 w e members of the area to be affected by the project.
After clearing the confusion the mi ting was opened by the Mtaa chairman by welcoming
the consultants to the meeting and r questing them to present the agenda of the meeting. The
consultant informed the members 1at the intention or the purpose of the meeting was to
inform them the expected TANESC D project which would be implement along their area in
future, and that those who will fall vithin the identified area will be affected in a number of
ways but mainly might be require to move out of their area of occupancy and shift to
another area that will be allocated by the project. The consultant therefore requested the
members to point out their concern and opinions and what they would like the project do so
as not to be very affected by the pro -ct.
3.1.1 Stakeholders concerns
The implementation of this project ill involve loss of residences, neighbourhood built over
along period of time, closeness to ocial services like schools, main roads, shops, health
facilities, closer to town. However iven the fact that the project is for development and is
inevitable, we request the following
  Before we are move out of our premises we should be given sufficient time
to prepare ourselves to move out- ample time to built new houses before
demolishing our hou s.
* The project should mike sure that they have provided all social amenities like
school, road, transp rt services, health facilities, power/electricity water
supply, shops, etc.
*  Before people are sh ed to the new area they would like very much to have
same neighbourhood :s they are living now.
*  They pointed out if ey are shifted they would prefer to be allocated in the
same district and not therwise.
24
Social Impact Assessment Draft Final Report



Reinforcement and Upgrade of Dar es Salaam, Kilimanjaro and Arusha Transmission and Distribution System Project
*  We would prefer to be given a chance to select a place to move to on our own
rather than being allocated a place with no preference.
*  We request the project to compensate other properties other than house and
plot like petty businesses i.e. shops, hair salons, milk cows etc.
*  Shifting involves a lot of losses physical, financial, social and psychological.
All these cannot be compensated by money but we would appreciate to be
paid disturbance allowance.
After the meeting the participants requested to be shown the route, which the project will
pass. After which it was found out that there might be no one to be affected other than the
compound wall.
3.2   Sinza Ward: Sinza A - Communitv Members
The meeting was opened at 5.35 pm then TANESCO engineer introduced the project to the
community members. After the introduction of the project, the community members were
invited to point out their concems, worries and expectations.
The first reaction was anger by the information and the first reaction was to refuse the idea to
be moved out of their area. First speaker pointed out that instead of moving out the
population in that area they should find ways of reaching an agreement with the University of
Dar es Salaam so as to avoid extra costs and to avoid disturbing people who have been
settled for a very long time in that area. Because the university area is still open, the idea to
hold talk with them to get an area for the project is quite ideal.
Another speaker pointed out that she is neither interested nor intends to move out of that
place. Why not use improved technology such as underground cable so as to reduce
disturbances, reduce possible health hazards, and help future plans?
3.2.1  Stakeholders concerns
I. Physical loss- People are concemed over the loss of their residential houses
2. Loss of business houses and income.
3. Sociological loss - after staying for a very long time in this place we have developed
friends, relations and attachments with neighbours- if we move out of this place it
means we will loose all these long established relationships.
4. There is so much attachment to the place we have lived in for over twenty years
period such that it has so much psvchological attachment that cannot be replaced by
any amount of money paid.
5. We are closer to town; we have all infrastructural structures that are not available in
the new place where we will be moved. How can you assure us the availability of
such services?
6. The area we live in already have and are close to all social services like schools, from
primary to secondary, colleges, good roads, reliable transport, health facilities and
many other services that are not available in the new place we will be moved to.

7. Moving some of us out of s place would mean pushing us to quick death. Most of
us living in this area are reti d people; we are so much used to the place therefore not
interested to move in whate r amount of money you are going to compensate us.
8. We started living here wh  it was bushy and we were young and energetic now
when we are settled, retired  d powerless you come to move us to a new place. Can't
you see that I can no longe olerate the hassles of construction and moving to a new
place? In fact if I am forced  t, I will commit suicide. It is better I die than facing the
idea of moving out.
9. Why didn't the government iled to project the population growth and provide space
needed for future growth? Therefore, the governments carelessness should not
become the people's nuisan
3.2.2  Stakeholders recommenda ons
*  In case a person looses a reside  e and or business house, he/she should be compensated
a substantial amount of mon  enough to enable the construction of a new house
equivalent or better than the one o be demolished.
*  The people to be moved must e allocated another plot to help reduce disturbance of
search for a plot and be moved  m the place of domicile to the new place.
*  We should be given a grace peri to enable us to construct a house before the demolition
of where we are now living.
*  If we move from our place odomicile we would prefer to live with the kind of
neighbours that we have where  are now living
*  We as community are recipient  f government decisions so we only request to be given
optional place for next domicil We should be given a chance to select a place of our
own preference rather than be llocated a place we won't be comfortable with. Any
allocation of new place should b within Kinondoni Municipality.
*  Wherever we are moved to we hould be assured of availability of public transport for
easing our movement.
*  For those who will be affected  e have small businesses like keeping milk cows, hair
salons, chicken keeping, and sh  s we should be compensated for the lost income and
lost opportunity.
*  The value of our houses and p ts will be hot cake because of the investment on the
University side. The project sho d take that into consideration.
3.2.3 Issues that needed further  nsiderations
After introducing the project and ex laining to the people what we wanted from them, they
argued with the following comments
o  Main argument was that thei area is planned and in the city plans there should have
provided space for future exp sion of the public services.
o  They also pointed out that  ere was an open space close by on the side of the
University of Dar-es- Sal  why not utilise that area instead of incurring so much
expenses of compensating  pie settled in this area.
26

Reinforcement and Upgrade of Dar es Salaam, Kilimanjaro and Arusha Fransmission and Dismnbution System Project
o  Why not use the underground cable option to avoid moving people out and
demolition of their houses.
o  The high voltage electricity has health hazards. Have TANESCO people assessed the
impact of having a high voltage line passing close to people's residences?
o  If there are other area that can be an altemative to our area let the govemment opt to
that.
o  This is shocking and too quick information that I can't digest the message within this
so short time to give genuine response in so short time. So give us time to digest then
we will respond back to TANESCO in writing.
o  Shifting of people will involve not only physical and financial costs but social and
psychological losses- neighbourhood, relations, safety that cannot be compensated by
any amount of money.
o  Some of us are old and retired have grand children who are used to this area and
environment moving out of this place would mean life will be disrupted completely
and will affect the children psychologically.
o  The prices of the place are going up every day due to its positioning and now you
want to move us out of here.
3.3   Yombo Vituka Area
After introducing the project to Yombo Vituka residents and requested for their feelings and
expectations from project, the community members general response was that: since this was
the government's decision and it is for development purposes they can't stop it. However
they requested the following:
3.3.1 Stakeholders concerns
*  Before we are moved out of our place of residence there should be proper preparations by
TANESCO.
*  Make sure there is a place prepared where people will be moved to.
*  Prepare and make available plots for those who will be affected, sufficient compensation
that will enable them construct a house of the same standard like the one we live in.
*  Make sure that the small businesses like kiosks are also compensated since it is an
income eaming activity.
*  Make sure that the social amenities- schools, health facilities, roads, water supply, public
transport, market and power are available to where will be moved to.
*  There should be a provision of choices for the place to be moved to- individuals have
their own preferences and they should be allowed to pick on their own a place they would
like to move to.
*  One wanted to know if his/her property is half way affected, will she/he be compensated
only the affected area or the whole area? - I would like to be compensated the whole area.
*  How is the assurance that those who are close by the ROW won't be affected by the ultra
radiations from the transmission line?
*  How will be the evaluation of an empty plot going to be? what will be the compensation?

3.4.1 Stakeholders concerns
*  One of the members wanted tc know if the meeting was to request them or to inform
them of the action to take plac  The answer was that it was a request and informnation
about the project.
*  Majority of those that will be a ected are old retired widows and widowers who cannot
withstand the hassles of new co tructions and shifting. Some of us have lived here since
1968.
*  The day you transfer me from  re that day will be the announcement of my death. From
here at my age where do I go to I'm waiting for the day of my death here.
*  We want a copy of the project  oposal to see the suggested alternatives in writing so as
to file it for our references.
*  In case it is necessary to mov  us out it is important to know that the compensation
should include not only physic  and financial but also psychological, sociological and
social amenities which are not e; ily found in new places.
*  We would like to be involved in very stage of the project.
*  We will present our wishes in w ting after receiving a copy of the project proposal.
*  Don't you have alternative tec  logy other than lattice structure towers that needs 40m
RoW? The space is too much. T  to use the technology that will affect as less people as
possible.
*  Use the straight line along S  Nujoma road or look for another altemative route to
avoid disturbing many people.
*  TANESCO should look not int physical and financial costs alone but look into social
and psychological costs as well
*  Even the needed space of five  etres for underground cable will disturb a number of
people. Why not use the road res re.
3.4.2  Stakeholders recommenda   ns
*  Affected people should be invol d in every stage of the project.
*  TANESCO should consider us g the road reserve instead of causing much pain to
people and incur huge compens on
*  TANESCO should consider alt native technologies other than lattice structure towers
that need 40m ROW. The space  too much in built areas. Try to use the technology that
will affect as less people as possi le.

3.5   Ubungo Ward
The area to be affected in Ubungo ward is the area in Abiani Hamlet located at the corner
where Morogoro road joins Sam Nujoma road at the Ubungo traffic lights. In the public
meeting held, all people in the area attended even those not affected by the project. The Ward
Officer did not attend the meeting and a place to sit was a problem
3.5.1 Stakeholders concerns
After introducing the project to the residents, the residents had the following view and
questions or doubts:
* Why not use the underground cable to reduce social impact and reduce the compensation
costs? If not possible then the issue of compensation should be done properly and directly
to the affected person and not through the government.
* Our main concern is that when one gives land the owners end up desperate because the
compensation is not enough. What we want is a proper compensation.
*  We would like to be educated on our rights so that we can have proper control over our
own property.
*  We want the area covering the 40 metres to be clearly identified to know the exact people
to be affected.
* We have our loved relatives' graves; we request the area to be respected in case the area
falls within the area needed for the project.
*  Before we are shifted we should be provided with plots to be sure where we will move to
*  I want no plot but money because I am tired of this shifting. I want to go back home
because it seems now what remains is shifting from one place to another and I'm too old
and only waiting to die.
*  I'm a tenant and landlords will be compensated. Therefore it will be very difficult for
tenants to get a house to rent for a short time of a month or two; therefore tenants should
be considered too because they will also be affected by the project.
* Compensation should be done in foreign currency since the government is paid in foreign
currency by the donor.
*  For those living close to the transmission lines, how are we assured of our safety from the
electricity emissions if any?
*  We would like TANESCO to use private valuers and make sure there is no valuation
done by estimation outside site, but should be done through visiting individual properties.
*  We request that for every step of the project we should be informed and involved as it
started.
*  Each house should be evaluated according to the ongoing prices of to date.
*  We request that the compensation to be done in a meeting like this and not in government
office.
The Hamlet Chairman thanked the resident members and the TANESCO delegation for the
smooth running of the meeting and wanted cooperation in every step during the
implementation of the project

3.6   Mlalakuwa area at Mikoch ni
Only three people will be affected d the propose line. One has a small house and the other
two own two big buildings. The hi: use owners were not available during the time of this
study.
3.7   Msasani ward: Bonde la TYl unga Area
This area is recommended for an underground cable. The study team had to hold two
meetings on different dates in an ef Irt to get hold of real owners of the houses in the area.
Most of the house owners were not I resent they were represented by either house caretakers
or children. After the introduction of the project to the community members the speaker
invited the members to give their ide as, concerns, worries suggestions and wishes.
3.7.1  Stakeholders concerns
*  One respondent requested to ha e a look at the map so as to be precise over the area
being discussed
*  Why not use the road reserve a eas and leave us alone or we give 2.5 metres and road
reserve give 2.5.metres. Otherwi e I am not willing to move out.
*  Road reserve measurements are  varied in the area why?
*  The issue of unreliable power is yery crucial I agree that we give out space for passage of
electricity cable.
*  One wanted to know if it is pos! ible to use the land with underground cable for parking
after cables have been placed.

Reinforcement and Upgrade of Dar es Salaam, Kilimanjaro and Arusha Transmission and Distribution System Project
* We would like to know what will be the health effects of the underground cable if there
are any.
*  We suggest that during valuation of property together with TANESCO's appointed
valuers should be accompanied by independent valuer selcted by the affected person.
*  Since majority of the residents claim that the road reserve is varied it is important for
TANESCO to liase with the Municipal council to clear the doubts.
*  In case of compensation we want updated valuation.
3.7.2 Stakeholders recommendations
*  Consider using the road reserve area altematively they may consider giving 2.5m and and
road reserve should give 2.5 metres.
*  Provide more information and assurance of health effects of the underground cable if
there are any and whether other uses such as parking cars can go on after the cable has
been laid down
*  During the valuation of properties it is suggest that TANESCO's appointed valuers
should be accompanied by an independent valuer selected by the affected person to
protect the right of the affected person
*  Compensation should follow the updated valuation costs
*  Since road reserve width varies it is important for TANESCO to liaise with the
Kinondoni Municipal Council to clear the doubts
The second meeting was kind of chaotic- people were angry and not ready to listen to any
negotiation at the beginning and even some threatened to go to court in cases their property is
touched.
3.8   Kiwalani Ward
A short introduction about the project was given to the community members who attended
the meeting. Then resident members were told that the aim of the meeting was to make the
project known to them and as well as to hear their concems suggestions and wishes. Then the
residents had the following views and doubts:
3.8.1 Stakeholders concerns
*  Look into the prices of plots, construction costs, and the compensation has to enable us
build a house and not a hut.
*  It is not fair shifting from one place to another. The experience I have with TANESCO is
that they pay well but the payment for compensation is delayed, thus we want payments
to be done once (no instalment payments) with promptness. Once the evaluation has been
done payments should not be delayed.
*  When TANESCO is certain about the shifting dates we should be given sufficient time to
prepare ourselves to move out so as to avoid family disappointments.
*  We would prefer to direct communication between TANESCO and us and not with the
govemment.
31

Reinforcement and Upgrade of Dar es Salaal ., Kilimanjaro and Arusha Transmission and Distibution System Project
* Compensation payments and rel cation plots should be given soonest after evaluation so
as to start preparation for shiftinI2i
*  We were stopped to do any dev lopment projects on our plots and we are very tired over
such situation, so we want to be ertain if we will be shifted.
* TANESCO will have to give L 3 alternative plots for constructing a house, money for
building, and then give us time for construction and preparation to shift. There should
also be payment of disturbance i llowance.
* We also request to be informed )f all stages of the project and progress. We request that
everything that touches our lives we should be informed.
*  People want to know if they coI ld proceed with their planned development activities on
their plots. The answer was yes because the visit of the consultants was to introduce the
project and collect people's ide; s, concerns and suggestions and not to stop any activity
on the expected area.
* TANESCO should connect our I ouses in the new areas with electricity because where we
live now we have electricity.
3.8.2  Stakeholders recommenda ons
*  Compensation payment should e done without any delayed and not in instalment once
the evaluation has been done.
*  The affected people should be nformed of shifting dates and given sufficient time to
prepare themselves to move out 0o as to avoid family disappointments
* There should be direct comm iication between TANESCO and the affected and not
through the government.
* People should be assured of the project implementation rather than imposing the
psychological effect while the pi i ject is not going to take place
*  TANESCO should connect elec icity immediately to new houses of the relocated people
*  TANESCO should inform the af .ected people of every stage of the project and progress.

pipeline.
*  I'm too old now if I get transferr d where will I go to at this age?
*  Since the project will touch peoi e's lives, we suggest that proper evaluation of houses be
done and we also need a one yea period of preparation.
*  The government should provide ompensation of plots
*  I would like to be allocated a plo right here in this very neighbourhood.

*  We would like to be involved in every process of the project.
*  We want all that which will be affected by the project to have representation in the
project committee.
*  Far from effect of loosing residences our children will be affected, we request that our
youths be involved by providing them with casual labour during construction.
*  We've lived here for over 15 years. We have neighbours and schools so we would not
like to move far away from here. So we request that we be allocated plots within this
ward -An area called Mgeni Nani has enough land where TANESCO can get us plots.
* People with houses made of mud and wood and grass thatch should be compensated well
so as to improve their lives.
3.9.2 Stakeholders Recommendations
From the stakeholders meeting the following recommendations were suggested:
*  Proper evaluations of houses need to be done and one year period should be given for
people to prepare their new homes after compensation.
*  TANESCO Should find new plots at Mgeni Nani area to relocate Mbagala Kuu
affected people
*  Affected people participation in every process of the project is highly insisted. Or at
least involve their representative in the project committee
*  TANESCO and the contractor should provide casual jobs to the children of affected
people labour during construction
* The project should consider uplifting the values mud houses to help the poor improve
their lives.
3.10 Mchikichini ward
A short introduction about the project was given to the community members who attended
the meeting. Then members were told that the aim of the meeting was to make the project
known to them and as well as to hear their concems suggestions and wishes. Then the
residents had the following views and doubts:
3.10.1 Stakeholders concerns
During the meeting the affected people raised the following concems:
*  We want to be compensated for our properties
*  Allocate us a place to move and construct new houses
*  We would like to be compensated with already constructed houses to avoid the pain
of constructing again. Given the fact that the majority here are poor if given money
might end up misusing money and family gets disrupted so it is better if we are given
ready house than hard cash for house construction.
*  1 would like to be given a plot at Mbweni in Kinondoni district.
*  We are used to living close to all social services i.e. we don't need transport to got to
reach Kariakoo market, big shops, Muhimbili Hospital, Fish market/ferry or schools
for our children they just walk. That means moving us out of here will mean a
33

Reinforcement and Upgrade of Dar es Salaa Kilimanjaro and Arusha Transmission and Distribution System Project
complete loss of our life st le. Hence the compensation should consider all such
things and the disturbances tl at will be involved.
* Compensation of the house ! hould not consider the type of house rather the person
should be compensated eno. gh to enabled the construction of a comfortable home
and also consider costs invol ed in constructing a house of the same size today
*  Should we stop rehabilitating our houses if one is planning to do so? The answer was:
No one has been stopped to do her his development activities in his premises stop
order will come later after va ers have assessed everybody's property.
3.10.2 Stakeholders recommendat ions
Generally the stakeholders had s imilar recommendation as their counterpart meeting.
However the following recommenda ions need to be highlighted and insisted:
* TANESCO should consider compensation of house to house compensation for some
people in Mchikichini area as most people agreed on the idea of house to house
compensation. This is becaus e majority are poor and if given cash money they might
end up misusing their money hus disrupting their families.
* When allocating new plots for the affected people, Mbweni area in Kinondoni
District, should be considere( for the affected people of Mchikichini area
* Mchikichini area people ;hould be given special consideration during the
compensation as they are g iing to miss so many social services and environment
which are now available in their area such as walking distance to reach Kariakoo
market, big shops, Muhiml ili Hospital, Fish market/ferry and schools for their
children
*  Compensation of the house hould not consider the type of house rather the person
should be compensated enoLlh money to enabled the construction of a comfortable
home

*  If my piece of land is affected is t possible to be refunded crops and be given a plot?
*  Will we be compensated a plot al id all the crops?

informed of amount to be paid b fore payment so that we won't be paid less of what we
should be paid.
*  We request that all agreements regarding properties and property payments should be
done in writing

* We are living in a place where we have all the social services like water supply, schools,
health facilities and transport services. So wherever we will be moved to, TANESCO
should make sure the social amenities are available.
* Is one allowed to buy his /her own plot instead of being allocated by TANESCO?
3.11.2 Stakeholders Recommendations
Generally the stakeholders had similar recommendation as their counterpart meetings.
However the following recommendations need to be highlighted and insisted:
*  Qualified valuers should be contracted to do proper valuation of their properties and
people should be informed of amount to be paid before payment is processed so that
they won't be paid less of what they should be paid
*  All agreements regarding properties and property payments should be done in writing
to ensure nothing is twisted from the original agreement
*  There should be a provision to allowed people to buy their own plot instead of being

known to them and as well as to hear their concerns suggestions and wishes. Then the
residents had the following views, concerns and doubts:
3.12.1 Stakeholders concerns
The stakeholder meeting identified the following issues and concerns:
* If you consider compact and underground cable technologies as expensive have you
considered the cost of compensating people if you shift them?
*  We want compensation for our houses, be given plots, and be paid disturbance
allowances.
*  Some of us don't want to be shifted if there is an option it should be adapted. The issue of
psychological and social defects is not compensable.
*  I suggest the compensation of houses should be divided into two categories- the ordinary
-50 million and the best 100 million including other properties.
*  Have you prepared a place to shift us to?
*  The area to be allocated for those to be shifted should be properly demarcated so as to
avoid unnecessary land disputes.
*  In case of complaints who should we get in contact with?
*  What will happen if I don't want to shift?
*  We would like to know the decision on the three options of technologies you have on the
table.
* We request the project to use underground cable so as to shift as few as possible.

*  I'm worried about the valuers t at they could be unqualified and end up undervaluing our
properties.
* Are independent valuers allowe so as to compare the values?
* Try to look for a place to divert he line where people to be affected will be fewer.
3.12.2. Stakeholders Recommend tions
Generally the stakeholders had s1milar recommendation as their counterpart meetings.
However the following recommend tions need to be highlighted and insisted:
* TANESCO should explore the cost of all technologies and compare the cost of
shifting people and the soc I pain individual is going to be impacted. The issue of
psychological and social def cts is not compensable.
*  Compensation of houses s ould be divided into two categories- the ordinary -50
million and the best 100 mi ion including other properties
*  TANESCO should prepare a place to shift people under the Resettlement Action
Plan (RAP)
* TANESCO should establish a mechanism to deal with affected people complaints and
to conduct information diss mination
* TANESCO should make a ecision immediately on the right technology option of
every location to reduce an ety and psychological impact of the people in the project
route.
*  Mivinjeni residents request ANESCO to consider the use underground cable so as to
shift as few people as possi e
*  Independent valuers shoul  be allowed so as to compare the property values
recommended by TANESC    consultants

3.13.1 Stakeholders Concerns
The stakeholders meeting identifie the following impacts and concems that will result from
implementing this project:
* The first speak-er started by hanking the TANESCO for involving the affected from
the very beginning of the p ject. What TANESCO need to know is that we will be
very much affected by the roject because we have tuned ourselves to live here our
life time. We have school c ldren here and we have our businesses here. This project
will cause us great harm ps hologically and particularly our children.
*  We would like TANESCO    compensate us satisfactorily to the point that we will be
able to live comfortably as e are living here.
*  The compensation should   enough to enable some one construct a good quality
house as the one living in.
Social Impact Asscssment Dratt Final Report



Reinforcement and Upgrade of Dar es Salaam, Kilimanjaro and Arusha Transmission and Dismbution System Project
* The compensation should be paid straight to the affected person and not through the
government so as to avoid embarrassment and deduction of our money
* I have lived here too long and I am too old for shifting. If comes the worst and I have
to shift, make sure the compensation covers all the disturbances including
psychological defects. But I am worried that this shifting will kill me.
* I'm very much disturbed by this information, and have been unable to sleep. If there
is anyway to avoid shifting us please try the alternative way.
* If the project knows widows and widowers they will think otherwise. I suggest they
use the open space between the Military area and the Mwalimu Nyerere SABASABA
exhibition grounds. It will reduce costs for TANESCO as well as reduce people's
disturbances and womres.
3.13.2 Stakeholders Recommendations
Generally the stakeholders had similar recommendation as their counterpart meetings.
However the following recommendations need to be highlighted and insisted:
* TANESCO should compensate people satisfactorily to the point that they will be able
to live comfortably as they are living now
* Special consideration should be given venerable group such as the widows and
widowers during the implementation of this project.
* TANESCO should explore every alternative possible including relocating the route
via Military area and the Mwalimu Nyerere SABASABA exhibition grounds so as to
reduce costs for TANESCO as well as reduce people's impacts.
3.14  Yombo Ward: Yombo Buza
The meeting was conducted on 22nd January 2005 starting from  1.45 pm. After the
introduction of the project and aim of holding the meeting the community members were
invited to discuss their concems, worries, suggestions and ideas.
3.14.1 Stakeholders Concerns
The stakeholders meeting identified the following impacts and concerns:
*  The first speaker suggested the use of underground cable to reduce disturbance of
people.
* The second speaker suggested the use of the open space of the TPDF and the
TAZAMA pipeline ROW to reduce the number of people to be shifted as well as
costs involved in shifting people.
* The issue of compensation is not only payments but involve lot more that cannot be
compensated. There has been too much of this shifting practice. TANESCO should
use the technology that needs less land.
* From today when will we be moved out? - The answer was that until the valuers have
done their job and the work is accepted by TANESCO and the donor, after payment
of compensation has been done and time to prepare the new homes has been expired.
* We want to be provided with plots and compensation of property.
* Buildings and undeveloped plots will be affected. Will the undeveloped plots be
compensated as well?
* 1 hope no one is going to take away my land without compensation.

*  We want to know clearly th actual area where the proposed transmission line passes
to be sure of people who wi be affected by the project.
*  I want to be paid for my pl and compensation of my house and I will decide where I
want to shift to.
* Who will pay the compens tion- the government or TANESCO? The answer was:
The government will be inv Ived to make sure rights are being done to everyone.
*  How if the graves are af cted will they be removed or what is the fate of the
graveyards?
*  Our experience shows that ompensation is not done on time. We therefore request
that as soon as the valuati  is done payments of compensation should be done on
time.
*  When valuation is ready pe ple should be informed on their amount they will be paid
so that it is not easy for tho  handling the payments to cheat on people.
3.14.2 Stakeholders Recommen itions
Generally the stakeholders had  imilar recommendation as their counterpart meetings.
However the following recommen  tions need to be highlighted and insisted:
*  It is the wish of majority o Yombo Buza residents that underground cable should be
used to reduce disturbance f people.
*  TANESCO should consid r re-routing the transmission line to the open space
belonging to TPDF and th TAZAMA pipeline ROW so as to reduce the number of
people to be shifted as well s costs involved in shifting people
*  Beside compensation Yomr D Buza residents should be provided with plots
*  TANESCO should clearly emarcate the actual routing so that people to be affected
by the proposed line are cle ly identified.
*  When the valuation is alre y done people should be informed on their amount they
will be paid so that it is not asy for those handling the payments to cheat on people

3.16.1 Stakeholders concerns
The stake holder meeting identified the following concerns about the project:
* There are still some people living within the right of way (reserve) area of the
existing transmission line is it safe for such people?
* 1 have a house and trees in my area that will be affected will I be compensated my
house, trees and land?
* If someone is planning to start building on his /her land is it allowed to proceed with
our plans or we stop our plans? The answer was that: Proceed with your plans as we
are not here to stop any development activity. Stop order will come after the valuers
have valued your properties.
* Is it necessary to pass on that very place? Can't you divert the line?
* On what basis are the compensations done? The answer was: on the basis of the Land
Act of 1999 which states clearly what/how should be compensation procedure be if
someone is to be shifted from his/her place of residence.
* 1 want compensation to my trees, crops, house and land
* If I have ploughed my land but have not planted crops will I be paid the costs of
ploughing my land together with land?
3.16.2 Stakeholders Recommendations
Generally the stakeholders had similar recommendation as their counterpart meetings.
However the following recommendation needs to be highlighted and insisted:
* TANESCO should deal with people who are still living under the transmission line or
within the right of way of the existing transmission line for the safety of the people
and the operation of the line.
3.17 Maroroni Ward
The villages to be affected by the project in Maroroni Ward include Maroroni and Samaria
Villages. The meetings ware held on the 3rd February 2005. After a short introduction about
the project was given to the community members who attended the meeting, then members
were told that the aim of the meeting was to make the project known to them and as well as
to hear their concerns suggestions and wishes. Unfortunately only those having houses along
the area to be affected were invited. Those with land were not invited. The consultant
requested the village leaders and the community members that attended the meeting to be
ambassadors and deliver the right message to those not invited but were supposed to be there.
The residents had the following views and doubts:
3.17.1 Stakeholders Concerns
The stake holder meeting identified the following concerns about the project:
Maroroni Village
* I am one of those who will be severely affected by the project. Yesterday I didn't
sleep after getting the informnation about the project because I have just finished
investing so much on my land; recently I finished my house and have just moved in. I
have trees that through painful efforts have grown very nice. I have also an animal
bans. This means starting afresh again and much more efforts are needed. I am really
bitter about this infornation.

*  How if the house is partly i side the area in question, what will happen to my house?
Will I be compensated my I ouse or part of it? And if part of it how do you expect me
to survive?
* In case of compensation w, would like to be paid money for all our property and we
will decide on our own whe e to go to buy land and settle.
*  We women and children wi II be the most affected in this process, If TANESCO pays
money to men it is very Iil cly for men to disappear with the money and the family
will be left without a place to go to. We therefore request TANESCO if possible to
provide us with land /plot  we look for land and TANESCO pays for the land and
hand over the paid land to is rather than give hard cash which will end up misused
and the family becomes des erate and miserable.
Samaria Village
* I have a house trees I want ( ompensation for my house trees and farm.
*  I have a house, trees and vater well. Will I be compensated all of my mentioned
properties?
*  I have a house, trees and sis I plants will I be compensated?
*  How if unknowingly I bc ught land that is in the reserve area for the existing
transmission line will I be c mpensated?
*  Since our village has never enefited from the electricity despite letting our land for
transmission lines, how can illagers benefit from this project? Can't the project help
our village get power? We ) ant to feel the benefits of having the transmission lines
pass through our village.
3.17.2 Stakeholders Recommend tions
Generally the stakeholders had ! milar recommendation as their counterpart meetings.
However the following recommend ations need to be highlighted and insisted:
*  TANESCO should be consi erate when compensating the properties especially if part
of the house (like toilet) w} ch is important for that house is taken away and there is
no another space to shift then the whole house should be compensated
*  TANESCO in collaboratiol with local leaders should work together to ensure that
compensation benefits the whole family rather than men who may run away with cash
leaving their family to suffi r. Such compensation should be plot to plot and house to
house.
* TANESCO should considt r supplying electricity to the affected village such as
Samaria so that they see the value of development in terms of electricity supply
3.18  Mlangarini and Moshono Vards (Rural)
The meetings in these two wards -ook place on 4th February 2005. The concerned village
include Olkereyani Village in M : shono Ward with total population of 2,800 with 650
households according to 2004 vill; ge census and Mlangarini Village in Mlangarini Ward.
These villages have similar charac ristics. After a short introduction about the project was
given to the community members v, ho attended the meeting, then members were told that the
aim of the meeting was to make he project known to them and as well as to hear their
concerns suggestions and wishes. T ien the residents had the following views and doubts:

Reinforcement and Upgrade of Dar es Salaam, Kilimanjaro and Arusha Transmission and Distrbution System Project
3.18.1 Stakeholders Concerns
The stake holder meeting identified the following concerns about the project:
Olkereyani Village
* First speaker requested to know the procedure for compensation.
* Why can't you look for an alternative technology that will need less land rather than
stick to outdated technology which uses 40m thus affecting people enormously.
* For how long will TANESCO keep on shifting people and disrupting people's lives/
don't you think} it is high time to change the way of your practice and services?
* We would like to know if there is any health effects from the transmission lines rays
emissions to the people living close to the lines. Please let us know so that we take
necessary precautions to avoid the effects.
* We request that the project should consider giving our youth casual labour
(employment) as one of the benefits of having the transmission line pass by our
village.
* For compensation rather than being given plots, we would prefer to be given cash so
that we purchase places of our own preferences.
* Some of us think it is not appropriate to give people hard cash because experience
shows that when people are given cash they end up misusing money and leaving the
family suffering; in this respect we think it is better to compensate people by giving
them a plot and money for construction of a house and if possible close supervision
by government leaders to make sure the money is not divert to other purposes.
Mlangarini Village (rural)
The meeting was attended by the affected villagers and three representatives from a mission
centre and two estates in the affected area. The following were the concerns:
* For the existing transmission line, the affected people were not compensated. Will
they be compensated now? The answer was: We ere only concerned about the new
proposed transmission line to be constructed. The past project of the existing line is
over and the land was acquired in different Land Act and Policies back in 1983.
* All my land is gone into TANESCO transmission lines what is the aftermath of me
and my family?
* Given life today it is very easy to misuse money if given cash, so we ask TANESCO
to purchase for us a new land to transfer us to rather than give us money for land so
that when we are given house compensation it becomes easy to construct new houses.
* I was in the existing transmission line but was not compensated and could not move
out. I am still living there and cannot move out because the family is very poor and
my father is old and seriously sick in bed. This family needs assistance to be able to
move out of this dangerous area.
3.18.2 Stakeholders Recommendations
Generally the stakeholders had similar recommendation as their counterpart meetings.
However the following recommendation needs to be highlighted and insisted:
* TANESCO should do sensitization seminars about dangers of staying under the high
tension transmission lines.

cash money and there those wishing to be compensated with house to house.
3.19 Kikwe Ward (rural)
The meeting was held on the 4th F bruary 2005. After a short introduction about the project
was given to the community mer bers who attended the meeting, then members were told
that the aim of the meeting was to make the project known to them and as well as to hear
their concems suggestions and wishes. Then the residents had the following views and
doubts:
3.19.1 Stakeholders Concerns
The stake holder meeting identifiec the following concems about the project:
*  How if my house is 5 metr s after the reserve area will I be affected by the project?
The answer was: No.
*  I think it is better if TANE CO takes all my piece of land and buy me another land
far way from the transmissi n line because it seems that this transmission and shifting
are on going processes as k g as the demand of power grows.
* The transmission lines are liassing through our village and so far there have been no
benefits of the transmissio l line passing through our village. What will the project
help so us to feel the benefi s of the transmission lines passing through our village?
*  I am building a house and h  reached the level of linter should I stop the construction
or what should I do while u aiting for the shifting? The answer was: Proceed with any
of your development activil ies in your premises because we did not come to stop any
activity to those who will bc affected by the project.
*  I have a house, chicken b, , cows ban and a toilet will I be compensated and be
helped to shift to another p lace? The answer was: Yes according to the Land Act of
1999.
*  I have open lain land will be compensated? The answer was: Yes.
* We also ask the project to y ve us casual employment during construction.
3.19.2 Stakeholders Recommend tions
Generally the stakeholders had .imilar recommendation as their counterpart meetings.
However the following recommenc tion needs to be highlighted and insisted:
*  TANESCO should consid r supplying electricity to the affected village such as
Kikwe Village which has aout three sources where Kikwe could be connected with
less than 4km of 33kV lin: so that they see the value of development in terms of
electricity supply
*  The project contractor shou J consider giving local youth casual labour (employment)
as one of the benefits of hav ng the transmission line pass in their areas
3.20  Hai District
The meetings were held between tl 2nd February 2005 and 3rd February 2005. As usual after
a short introduction about the proje t was given to the community members who attended the

meeting, then members were told that the aim of the meeting was to make the project known
to them and as well as to hear their concerns suggestions and wishes. Then the residents had
views and doubts raised.
3.20.1 Stakeholders Concerns
The stakeholder meetings identified the following concerns about the project:
Hai Mjini Ward: Mlima Shabaha Hamlet (Rural)
This hamlet was part of Masama Rundugai Ward, but since 2000 it became a hamlet in Hai
Mjini Ward. Very few people will be affected in terms of shifting and even compensation of
land. The team conducted a dialogue with individuals by visiting him or her at their
homesteads. The raised issues include:
*  I want to get support from the project to enable me and my family survive, as is the
case before the project.
*  I should be compensated my two houses a plot for construction, a place/plot where I
can shift my graveyard.
*  I need compensation for my houses and money to purchase another land/plot for
building a house.
Longoi Village (Machame Kusini Ward)
This is the village with 5 sub-villages having a population of about 1670 people, out of which
780 are males and 890 are females and has 345 households. In this village only two people
will be affected whose houses will be affected. The rest will be affected on their land that is
open field without permanent crops. The land is used for different crops production including
paddy and vegetable irrigation.
Ngosero Village (Machame Kusini Ward)
In Ngosero Village around 16 people will be affected and only two out them will have their
houses affected, the rest will be land. Issues raised by the community members were as
follows:
* How if my whole land is affected by the project where will I go to do my agriculture?
The answer was: You will be compensated of all your land but agriculture of short-
term crops is not forbidden on the transmission lines reserve area.
*  How if I have permanent crops like banana trees, trees for timber, shade and fruits on
my land will I be compensated?
*  We request to be given casual employment during the transmission line
implementation when it reaches our village.
*  We suggest that instead of paying us hard cash TANESCO build us houses for those
whose houses will be demolished and hand us ready houses to save us from the
construction troubles and possibility of misusing money.
*  Compensate me a house, a plot and my trees.
*  Our Village have very poor roads; can't the project help us improve our roads as a
contribution to our village development?
*  Will areas under village government that will be affected be compensated? If yes
what will be the modalities of compensating?

Masama- Rundugai Ward: Cheki naji and Rundugai villages
The community member had the fol owing concerns and views about the project:
*  People are bitter over past e) periences where after valuation of property it took so
many years before payment f compensation was done
*  Are we going to be compens ated our properties and are we going to be allowed to do
farming on the reserve are of the transmission lines? The answer was: Yes but
TANESCO reserves all righ  of using that land without notice.
*  Does valuation of land and roperty follow actual values or estimated depending on
one place to another?
*  What is the value of one baar a tree? The answer was: the prices can be found in the
department of agnrculture
*  We request to be paid imme iately after valuation has been done to avoid devaluation
of shilling.
* W e need electricity the proj ct should help us get electricity.
*  1 am located about 20m fror the reserve area; I would like to know the defects I get
being close to the transmissi n line.
Kawava Village
In Kawaya Village only two people vill be affected. The two owns open land no house will
be affected.
Kikafu Chini and Mijongweni Vil ages (Machame Kusini Ward)
These villages are located close to k yungi substation. The affected people had the following
comments and concerns about the p ject:
*  The new transmission line M 11 affect trees, bananas, houses and land. Are they going
to be compensated? The ans er was yes.
*  1 will be affected in terms of house, my crops, permanent plants and livestock keeping
I want to be compensated. I  a widow and I have children. I own a farm, a house
and permanent plants. What will be my family destiny? The answer was: You will be
compensated.
*  Can the project help womer to reduce poverty by providing them with loans to help
them develop small income a  ing projects?
*  Will I be given another plot fter compensating my land and plants? The answer was:
No; the compensation is to e able you purchase another piece of land.
* Can the project help the vill ges where the transmission is passing by providing them
with clean safe water and he Ith facilities where they are not available?
3.20.2 Stakeholders Recommend, ions
Generally the stakeholders had s milar recommendation as their counterpart meetings.
However the following recommend. ions need to be highlighted and insisted:
*  TANESCO should categori e people who want cash money and those wishing to
have new houses built for th m so as to avoid future complain.
*  The project should consider mproving road infrastructure in the villages that will be
affected by-the project as prc ject contribution to village development.

Reinforcement and Upgrade of Dar es Salaam, Kilimanjaro and Arusha Transmission and Dismbution System Project
*   A study should be conducted to find if there are any health effects to people living
close to the transmission line.
* The project should institute small income earning projects and providing soft loans to
the young and women to help them to reduce poverty.
*   The project should provide some social services such as clean safe water or health
facilities in the villages where the transmission line passes and there are no such
facilities.
3.21    Arusha Municipal
Njiro Ward
Njiro ward is located in Arusha Municipal Council. The area of concern about this project is
about 1.5km stretch long as you are entering the Njiro substation (see the attached Map).
During the consultative meeting regarding to the new proposed 132kV transmission line, the
following concerns were raised:
3.21.1 Stakeholders Concerns
w   Why don't consider utilizing the 30m-way leave already in your possession?
- Consider constructing a new substation away from urban centres like N'jiro and bring to the town only
33kV feeders which take small corridor way leave
Wanted to know what TANESCO does to control the noise caused by the corona effect in 220 and 132kV
lines
Wanted to know if the construction of new transmission line in their area will not affect them health wise
due to electromagnetic effects
P Wanted to know compensation modality and how is going to be implemented. Also wanted to know what is
going to be compensated
' Some wanted to be given other plots on top of the compensation of their lost land and houses
Wanted to know the project time frame to prepare themselves
Wanted to be assured that electromagnetic fields do not affect people living close to the 220/132/33kV
Njiro substation and the 132kV transmission line
P   Wanted to know why TAN ESCO does not compensate people (customers) when their properties get
damaged as a result of over voltage or over current
o Project should provide knowledge to the local youngsters and provide temporary and permanent
employment to them
.' Project should consider using local materials whenever possible
' Whenever possible TANESCO should use the underground cable at Njiro (and other urban areas) to reduce
the social impacts that will result if conventional overhead lattice steel towers are used
3.21.2 Stakeholders Recommendations
.- Involve the public in every step of the project
M More sensitization about the project is needed
ensure open valuation process and fair and prompt compensation
x Involve the local leaders in the process of acquiring the ROW
.' TANESCO should allow limited agricultural activities of perennial crops such as beans, maize etc. under
the lines
.-  Request the contractor to employ the locals for semi skilled and unskilled jobs
;w Exhaust all possible alternatives such underground cable, Compact design, double circuit, possibility of
shifting the existing line to utilize the 60m corridor for both lines

4.0   POTENTIAL IMPACTS         ND RESPECTIVE MITIGATION MEASURES
4.1   Analvsis of the social - ec  omic Impacts
The impact analysis is based on the ollowing criteria:
w Likelihood - terms to be used incl e unlikely, likely or certain which will refer to the level
of possibility that the impact will o ur. Unlikely will mean that the possibility of occurrence
is limited or none because of the i  rent nature of the project and design to be used; likely -
will refer to the possibility that th impact may occur and certain will mean that the impact
will surely occur irrespective of the reventive measures adopted.
Duration - this will refer to the li of the impact. The terms to be used include short-term
(0-5 years), medium- term (5-10 y  s), long term more than 10 years and permanent which
will refer to the impacts that wil  ontinue life long even if the mitigation measures are
implemented.
Intensity - this parameter assess he magnitude of the impact or violation of a certain
standard. Degree of significance  this will incorporate the above mentioned parameters
(likelihood, duration and intensit) to determine how severe the impact will be. The
categories of these parameters will e low, medium or high.
4.2   Social Impacts associated  ith the 132kV power line construction
All the villages and hamlets whe the proposed transmission lines pass will be directly
affected by the project either positi ly or negatively. There will be positive impacts in terms
of temporary employment opport ities and petty businesses along the power line routes.
However, most of the expected im  cts are of negative nature which will require mitigation
measures to be put in place to cou er react the impacts on local communities in the project
area.
The more profound impacts will be n resettlement areas of Dar es Salaam where by if design
and technology to be used will e 40m corridor, many houses, businesses, shops and
workshops located along the propo d route are going to be affected. For Arusha and Moshi
line the only major impacts will be n agricultural land if there will be a restriction on land
use in the right of way.
The identified impacts will occur uring the construction and operation and maintenance
phases. For each identified signific t impact mitigation measures have been provided. The
impacts are grouped in four catego s:
Impacts on the population
- Relocation of people and th r properties
,  Physical presence of immi  t workers
- Psychological effects and fa e expectations of jobs, access to electricity, etc.

Reinforcement and Upgrade of Dar es Salaam, Kilimanjaro and Arusha Transmission and Disrnbunon System Project
Impacts on the subsistence systems
- Loss of agricultural land
x Loss of crops and harvests
' Loss of business opportunities and customers
JVI Loss of income
Impacts on the cultural and historical system
. Interference with historical places and cemeteries
Other impacts
Production of dust and noise
Interference with land concessions and ownership
4.2.1 Impacts on the population
4.2.1.1 Relocation of people and their properties
The proposed routes will traverse population settlement areas in some places. For the safety
reasons a 40m wide right of way will be required in all cases if the steel lattice structure
towers are going to be used, 15m wide corridor if compact design tubular towers are used or
about 5m corridor way leave if underground cable is used. In the right of way no residences
or any type of construction is allowed. In settlement areas getting such corridors without
relocating people is difficult, thus it will necessitate relocating a number of people to pave
the way for the construction of the transmission line.
The use of 40m right of way will relocate more people which means huge impact to the
population along the proposed line route. The use of 15m corridor will significantly reduce
the number of people to be relocated compared with a 40m way leave corridor. The use of
5m corridor will further reduce the number of people to be relocated. The relocation of
people causes many side effects even if someone is compensated.
Mitigation measures
- The project proponent should do a thorough survey to determine alternative routes that
will minimize the number of people to be relocated. As public consultation meetings
indicated, in spite of the cost of underground cable, TANESCO should think us using this
technology that will reduce the corridor to only 5m which can be laid in road reserve thus
preventing a mass relocation.
- The project proponent should open the dialogue with affected families to prepare and
implement the resettlement action plan that will involve the following:
o  Financial compensation for the loss of housing, land, crops, fruit and exotic
trees
o  Availing all social services needed to the new settlement area (hospital,
schools, water, electricity, transport, roads, etc.)
o  Ensuring that compensation is paid promptly and time to construct new
housing is provided before the demolition of houses is effected
47
Social Impact Assessment Draft Final Repon



Reinforcement and Upgrade of Dar es Salaam Kilimanjaro and Arusha Transmission and Distnbution System Project
o Continuous communi ation between the people to be relocated and the project
proponent should be maintained in corroboration with local authorities to
ensure that all affecte people have appropriately compensated and resettled
4.2.1.2 Physical presen ce of immig  nt workers
The spread of information about th implementation of the project will create employment
expectations in other villages in  e regions outside the affected communities. These
expectations may lead to an influx  f strange people to the local communities searching for
employment. This will increase the I elihood of conflicts and spread of diseases.
During the construction phase cam s will be installed along the selected transmission line
route especially the long route of A  sha - Moshi T/L to house the workers involved in the
project. These workers will of cour  interact with local population and conflicts of a socio-
cultural nature and the transmission f diseases may occur.
This impact is likely to occur though it will be short-term only during the construction works.
The impact is of high significance i here will be no mitigation measures in place.
Mitigation Measures
" Both workers and the local    ommunities should be subject to awareness raising
campaigns, so as to promote go  relations and avoiding the unnecessary conflicts.
,  Workers and the affected comm  nities should receive special health care and health care
education particularly the sprea of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and HIV AIDS.
If possible condoms should be a  ilable and provided to workers.
;w If the contractor does not forese hiring a large scale local work force, he should take the
necessary measures to spread tl information so as to discourage the influx of strange
people to the local communities However, communities directly affected by the project
should be given the priority.
. The contractor and the project proponent in close cooperation with local leaders and
government authorities should h ve the monitoring system to observe the influx of people
in the project zone and procedu s to be followed in cases of the emergence of informal
population in project sites
4.2.1.3 Expectations ofjobs and ac, ess to electricity
During the consultative meetings, he majority of local communities especially in rural
setting accepted the project in expe ation that there will be huge compensation, project will
create jobs opportunities and they w I get access to electricity.
This impact is very likely to occu It is expected to be short to medium term impact. If
mitigation measures are not put in place there will be significant complains and
dissatisfaction with the project.
Mitigation measures
48
Social Impact Assessment Draft Final Repon



Reinforcement and Upgrade of Dar es Salaam. Kilimanjaro and Arusha Transmission and Dismnbution System Project
- As far as possible the compensation exercise should be transparent and the affected
people should be involved from the beginning to the end. Also the project should
incorporate the local work force as far as the job vacancies allow.
P- In the contractor's contract, work places of the local community should be stipulated and
the recruitment and work conditions of the local work force should be carefully
monitored.
- If the hiring of local personnel is not foreseen the proponent (TANESCO), in
coordination with the local authorities, should hold meetings with the communities to
inform them about this fact and explain the reasons.
As far as possible TANESCO should take initiative to provide electricity to the villages
along the Arusha - Moshi route as some of the villages like Kikwe, Kikafu chini,
Kawaya, Orkereyani and Ngosero have for some time now applied for electricity
connections. This measure will improve the project acceptance to the locals and in some
way improve the lives of the local population
4.2.1.4 Sociological loss
After staying for a very long time in their place they have developed friends, relations and
attachments with neighbours- if they move out of the place it means they will loose all these
long established relationships. Basically this psychological attachment cannot be replaced by
any amount of money paid. Currently some of the residents are closer to town, schools,
colleges, good roads, reliable transport, health facilities and many other services that are not
available in the new place they will be moved. The impact is likely to be permanent in some
aspects but may be reduced if mitigation measures will be put into place.
Mitigation measures
- The project should make sure that they provide all social amenities like school, road,
transport services, health facilities, power/electricity water supply, shops, etc. to the new
location where people will be resettled.
, If possible people should be resettled in the same district
- People should be given a chance to select a place to move to on their own rather than
being allocated a place with no preference.
, The affected people should be paid a disturbance allowance though it does not cover at
all their socio loss and psychological effects but people would appreciate.
- In the resettlement area the underground cable should be considered so as to move as few
people as possible.

4.2.2 Impacts on the subsistence systems
4.2.2.1 Loss of agricultural land
During construction phase, particul irly on the sites where the pylons will be erected, there
will be permanent loss of agricultur LI land due to the space occupied by the pylon and if any
the opening up of the access r ad to support construction logistics and subsequent
maintenance. This loss will creat. serious constraints for the local communities whose
subsistence is entirely dependent on agriculture.
The impact is likely to occur and il will be permanent for pylons sittings and for the access
roads. The level of significance is n edium but can be lowered through the implementation of
mitigation measures.
Mitigation measures:
' Financial compensation should I le paid to allow the affected to purchase another piece of
land somewhere.
- Use the existing access roads v, henever possible. Access roads should be allowed only
when it is necessary to do so.
' In case new plots will be pro , ided by the project proponent (TANESCO), the plots
should be located near the affec ed person residence
v There should be no restriction on using the right of way to grow short crops such as
beans, maize, paddy, etc. thoug  farmers should be made to understand that the land in
the right of way is no longer the rs
4.2.2.2 Loss of crops and harvests
During the construction phase it Will be necessary to clear the access roads that traverse
agricultural fields. If this will hapf en before the harvest is done, crops and fruit trees still
unharvested will be lost causing c nstraining effect on subsistence and programmed family
income.
However, the impact will be only if it is done while the crops are still in the fields. In
addition for Arusha - Moshi T/L e) isting access roads will be used while for Dar es Salaam
the biggest part is built up area rath -r than agricultural fields. Hence no significant impact is
expected if mitigation measures wil be implemented.
Mitigation Measures
' Fair financial compensation for the crops should be paid the crops in the proposed right
of way. In addition local comrT unities should be informed when the project is going to
start so that they are not caught a naware thus they decide themselves to plant crops or not
4.2.2.3 Loss of business opportunit ics, income and customers
The demolition of houses and reloc ation of people during the construction phase will make
businesses located in the proposed I ransmission line corridor to be destroyed or to disappear.
This demolition will mak}e busines owners to loose opportunity of making their business
prosper; business owners will loose some potential customers, and will be denied opportunity
to continue eaming some income fr m their businesses. The new location does not guarantee
him/her of customers and business 6pportunity. The relocation may cause long term loss of
income.

The impact of loss of income to some people may be permanent and significantly huge.
Mitigation measures will help to reduce the significance of the project but may not eliminate
the impact altogether.
Mitigation Measures
PI The project proponent should provide fair financial compensation to businesses and
economic activities located in the proposed right of way as required by the World Bank
policy and the Land Act no 4 of 1999.
- If possible in collaboration with local govemment authorities the project proponent
should help to find new business locations for the displaced people similar or close to the
original location
4.2.3 Impacts on the cultural and historical svstem
Interference with cultural places and cemeteries
In the study area, family and communal cemeteries (burial sites) and place of worships were
observed. In addition, although no places of archaeological importance have been identified
in the project area, it is possible that during excavations, old objects of archaeological values
may be discovered. These places may be affected by the project if measures and locations for
pylons are not careful selected, thus causing conflict with the local communities.
The impact on these places may occur (likely) if care is not taken by involving the local
community and local leaders to identify all areas of concems. The destruction may be
permanent. However, the impact is mitigated.
Mitigation Measures
:v All burial sites, family or communal cemetery, should be identified in collaboration with
local, religious and traditional leaders and marked to ensure that they are avoided as
much as possible. In case it is found that the T/L will interfere with these places measures
should be taken to alter the direction of the route or change the seating of the pylon.
- In case a discovery of archaeological site is found during the excavation, measures should
be taken to notify the competent authorities that will provide further guidance.
- In case is not possible to avoid cemeteries and graves, excavation should be done after all
parties have reached the consensus in terms of reburial costs and other requirements have
been fulfilled and permission has been granted by concemed relatives, religious leaders
or community
4.2.4 Other impacts

community surrounding the project s es. In spite that the impact will surely occur, the impact
will be short term and of low signifi ,nce if mitigation measures will be in place.
Mitigation Measure
The contractor should take measure to inform the communities about the start of the work
and the time limit for the night time pnclusion. Water Lorries should also be used to moisten
the works site in areas near pop ation settlements and the working hours should be
according to the law. Whenever po sible, working at night, weekends and public holidays
closer to the settlements should be a  ided.
4.3   Social-economic Impacts d  ing Operation and Maintenance Phase
The socio-economic impacts during  e operation and maintenance phase include:
w Possibility of accidents with  cal population
- Electromagnetic waves on h nan health
, Visual impacts
4.3.1  Possibilitv of accidents wit the local population
The transmission lines may pose gr at danger to the surrounding population if they are not
informed about the potential dang rs and precautionary measures are not in place. The
impact will likely affect all surroun ng settlement and communities around the project area.
The impact is potentially long term  d if there will be no mitigation measures the impact has
medium significance.
Mitigation Measures
, Awareness raising actions shoul be carried out, in coordination with the local authorities
and local leaders, to inform the ffected and surrounding communities about the dangers
that a high voltage transmission line may pose. These awareness raising actions should
include security precautions to b adopted by the local communities as follows:
, To avoid children climbing the p(ions
,P- To avoid children playing with k es and catapults near the line
- To avoid people seeking shelt  next to the pylons, particularly during the rain and
thunderstorms
- To avoid pruning of tall trees ne  the power line cables
- To avoid the handling of cables  at has broken
- To avoid rebuilding or building  w structures in the right of way
4.3.2 Impacts of electromagnetic waves on human health
Even though there are no concrete cientific proofs, it is thought that the electromagnetic
waves generated along the transmi ion line may cause health problems to the people who
are directly exposed to them for  long period of time. The exposure limits stipulated
internationally define 5kV/m as t  maximum allowed limit for human exposure. Thus
precautionary attitude should be  aintained and measures taken that may avoid the
occurrence of possible effects of tho e waves to human health.

SOCIO-ECONOMIC MANAGEM NT AND MONITORING PLAN
Socio-economic management plan (SMP) contains instructions that allow the project
proponent to integrate the socio issu  that emerge from the socio-economic assessment into
the project implementation process. ANESCO as the project owner is basically responsible
for the fulfilment of these instructi S himself or through the consultants and contractors.
This SMP contains general and spec ic recommendations that collectively constitute a basis
for management of impact during th construction and operation phases of the project.
Role and responsibilities
The SMP serves to identify the  inciples, responsibilities, activities and things to be
monitored for an effective managem nt of the socio-economic impacts during the project's
construction and operation phases.
TANESCO is committed to ensur that construction of the power lines is undertaken
according to the recommendations o this report. TANESCO is also committed to undertake
their work in such a way that is resp tful to the local communities and to the law of the land
in the sense that health and safety of people, their livelihood and customer services are
protected and maintained. In that r ard it is a responsibility of TANESCO or through his
consultants to:
, Advice employees and contracto  of safety, health and environmental requirements, and
hold them accountable for poor  rformance
Manage activities to minimize e ironmental and human health impacts
' Monitor, evaluate and report per rmance in safety, health and environmental protection
. Provide training when needed   protect human, environment, cultural and physical
resources
The responsibilities of the contracto among other things will include:
t Comply with the requirement   the SMP as a minimum standard to minimize socio-
economic impacts on affected co munities
. Prepare and submit plans on ho  he/she is going to comply with socio and environmental
requirements during the implem  tation of the project.
" Be open to periodic complianc audits and provide the necessary information for such
purposes
Monitoring
The contractor and TANESCO sho d draw up appropriate protocols for site inspection and
perform regular audits that will llow the monitoring of adherence to environmental
requirement and good practice. TA  ESCO staff should always participate in this process in
the context of institutional capacity  ilding for environmental management.
Workers' and local communities' ealth and safety management
As malaria and HIV AIDS are am g the deadliest diseases in the project area, contractor
should prepare and implement a p gramme to minimize the incidences of these diseases

among the workers and the local communities in the project area. The issues to be covered by
the programme should include:
- Measures to avoid the proliferation of mosquitoes in the construction areas
'  Measures to avoid workers from contracting the disease, including awareness-raising
regarding its prevention and taking protection measures in the housing and eating areas
'i Measures to detect and effectively treat malaria immediately after detection
t- A continuous HIV AIDS training course for workers' information about ways of HIV
AIDS and STDs transmission through workshops, posters and informal information
sessions
- Inciting workers to submit themselves to HIV tests
: Inciting workers to submit themselves to STDs treatment in their initial phases to
minimize the HIV infection risks
Supply of condoms to the project areas
Drawing up of a detailed construction camp management plan, including among others
prohibitions, onsite behaviour rules
Environmental and monitoring training needs
Environmental management and monitoring require a knowledgeable staff in the fields of
environment and social issues so that they accomplish their monitoring roles. The training
may be needed in the areas of health, safety and environment to enable them in the first place
do awareness raising in project areas. Further, specialized training in social and
environmental management such as environmental and social audits should be provided.

Reinforcement and Upgrade of Dar es Salaa Kilimnnjaro and Arusha Transmission and Distribution System Project
Chapter 6
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOM          ENDATIONS
From the public consultations held n 30 wards and villages,, the general conclusion of how
people received the project informat on is as follows:
;w All communities to be affected X .ceived the information with mixed feelings. Most of the
community members showed cc plete anger and annoyance. They would not understand
why the Government did not pla i the Right of Way before
' Other members took the infom ation casually requesting for compensation of property
and a plot to build on
, The areas owned by the rich n ajority were the most difficult to reach agreement and
despite the reduction of area to I used for distribution they found it difficult to let go any
piece of land
t In the rural areas Kilimanjaro a id Arusha regions, some people will be without land to
support the family if the acquir d land will not be allowed for use to grow short crops
such as beans and maize
t Most people now are more aware of their rights of their property than was the case in the
past
F People have fear over the past experience when people were resettled and not properly
compensated. This situation sh uld be avoided/controlled as much as possible during
project implementation
6.1   Ken findings
'- Majority of those to be affe : ted by the project will have to let go either their houses
and business or their houses md land or only land
- Majority the people to be iffected are annoyed and angry over the whole idea of
being dislocated
, Majority of people to be  fected are concerned about their fate after relocation
particularly on the availabil ty of the social services in the new places they will be
relocated
,w All people are worried of 14: osing their properties. They are worried that the whole
exercise will reduce them to total poverty especially when the compensation will not
be fair
All people are worried over the loss of their businesses and other income generating
activities
- People are more concernec over their psychological and sociological losses that
cannot be compensated by a] iy amount of money
P- They believe that loss of nei ! hbourhood, friends and loss of a place one has grown or
used to and have become p    of that area and community can not be replaced by
anything
, People especially businessm n and women are worried of loosing markets
a People with mud/wood gras thatch, old poor quality houses, are worried that they
will lead to them being discr minated and become poorer than they already are

o It is not possible to identify specific ethnic groups in town because people don't live
by ethnicity but they live mixed. It is only possible to identify ethnic groups in the
rural areas
x There was a diverse opinion regarding houses and plots compensation. Some wanted
to be compensated with money, others wanted to be given another plots while some
wanted to be given a house to house
' The Ubungo -Mikocheni route had majority of people who were very resistive to the
relocation and insisted on project to use the road reserve and the underground cable
' Majority of people in Moshi-Arusha route requested TANESCO to continue using the
acquired land to grow short and seasonal crops such as beans, maize, sunflower,
paddy, etc.
t People want transparent valuation process, fair and prompt compensation. They do
not like compensation delays as happened to Airport expansion Project at Kipawa
and Kiwalani area
I lt is the wish of majority that project should relocate as minimum people as possible
either using present technologies such as underground cable in spite of the
construction costs or rerouting the transmission line since the social impact is so huge
to them even if they are compensated
6.2   Kev Recommendations
The component of the reinforcement and Upgrade of Dar es Salaam, Kilimanjaro and Arusha
Transmission and Distribution System Project, which entails the construction of 132kV
transmission line, will have social impacts particularly in built areas. According to the
stakeholders meetings people and properties will be severely impacted. Generally, majority
are reluctant to be relocated though they will be ready to move if fair compensation is paid
and after being convinced that there are no alternative available to implement the project.
This is in line with everybody's recognition and acceptance that development for our country
is necessary for our current and future generations; however the development should be
sustainable by reducing social and environmental impact as much as is possible. In
understanding that fact the following recommendations have been made by the stakeholders:
19. Compensation should be done as soon as valuation of property is done so as to keep
up with shilling devaluation
20. Compensation should be done to the affected persons and not to relatives
21. Compensation should be made by TANESCO and not by the government
22. After the valuation the affected people should be informed of the value of their
properties (in a meeting the amount of each one has to be paid as compensation)
before payment is processed so as to eliminate /reduce the possibility of being paid
less than what each ought to be paid
23. Where there is a possibility of diverting the transmission line it is better to divert it
and use open spaces so as to avoid disturbing and dispersing families

Reinforcement and Upgrade of Dar es Salaant Kilimanjaro and Arusha Transmission and Distribution System Project
24. If possible use underground cable so as to shift as few people as possible or no
shifting at all
25. The project should try as m ch as possible to avoid the relocation of the people by
working hard to use open sp es whenever and wherever possible
26. Generally speaking the relo tion leads to lots of disruptions in someone's life and
any resistance instituted by t ose affected is very natural and understood
27. Affected people should be in olved in every stage of the project
28. TANESCO should consider sing the road reserve instead of causing much pain to
people and incur huge comp  sation
29. TANESCO should consider Iternative technologies other than lattice structure
towers that need 40m ROW. he space is too much in built areas. Try to use the
technology that will affect a less people as possible
30. People should be assured of e project implementation rather than imposing the
psychological effect while t  project is not going to take place
31. TANESCO and the contract should provide casual jobs to the children of affected
people labour during const  tion
32. TANESCO should establish  mechanism to deal with affected people complaints and
to conduct information diss  ination
33. TANESCO should deal wit people who are still living under the transmission line or
within the right of way of th existing transmission line for the safety of the people
and the operation of the line
34. TANESCO should consider upplying electricity to the affected village such as
Samaria so that they see the ialue of development in terms of electricity supply
35. The project should consider mproving road infrastructure in the villages that will be
affected by the project as pr ect contribution to village development
36. The project should provide  me social services such as clean safe water or health
facilities in the villages whe the transmission line passes and there are no such
facilities
Further to the recommendations from  the stakeholders, it is recommended that the
implementation of Environmental  d Social Management Plan (ESMP) and monitoring is
vital to the sustainability of the p ject. Both parties, project proponent (TANESCO) and
Contractor should ensure that they  Ifil their responsibilities.
