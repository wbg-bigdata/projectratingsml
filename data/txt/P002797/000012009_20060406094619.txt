Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited  Proposed 132 kV Transmission Lines in Dar es Salaam
Distribution and Transmission Rehabilitation Project    Resettlement Policy Framework
(Dar es Salaam, Moshi and Arusha)                             Revised January 2006
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This purpose of this document is to present a resettlement policy framework (RPF) for that
part of the Distribution and Transmission Rehabilitation Project - Dar es Salaam, Moshi and
Arusha (DTRP) to be implemented in the three municipal areas of the city of Dar es Salaam
by the Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited (TANESCO). The DTRP in Dar es
Salaam will primarily involve the construction of new 132 KV transmission line in parts of the
city and TANESCO, through the Government of the United Republic of Tanzania (GOT), is
seeking financial support from the Intemational Development Association to implement the
project.
Despite the considerable economic and social benefits that the project is expected to deliver,
the project will initially adversely affect a number of people (currently estimated at nearly
9 000 people or around 1 800 households) who will suffer possible physical, economic and
social losses and negative impacts, in one form or another, due to the need for TANESCO to
acquire land for project infrastructure. The RPF is needed to meet the requirements of
Tanzanian environmental policies and legislation relating to such land acquisition and those
of the World Bank Operational Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (i.e. WB OP 4.12) in order
to address the needs of affected and displaced people. In temms of WB OP 4.12 the WB
requires that a RPF or a more detailed resettlement action plan (RAP) be prepared,
disclosed in Tanzania (in English and Kiswahili) and in the WB Infoshop, and approved prior
to appraisal of the project as a whole.
The RPF has been prepared because the exact location (i.e. routings and alignments) of the
proposed transmission lines have not been finalised, the exact location and full extent of
land acquisition is not known, the number and type of affected properties has not been
accurately determined, the number and characteristics of affected or displaced people is not
known with certainty and required mitigation measures to compensate and/or relocate
displaced persons (DPs) have yet to be more precisely determined, so that a full RAP
cannot be prepared until after project appraisal. The RPF is a statement of the policy,
principles, institutional arrangements and procedures that TANESCO will follow for preparing
a full RAP and for implementing compensation, relocation and other resettlement measures.
For the purposes of the RPF it is anticipated that only one detailed RAP will be prepared.
However, if the detailed design and subsequent construction of various sections of the new
transmission lines are to be undertaken in stages it may prove more suitable to compile a
number of separate, but similar, RAPs.
TANESCO will be responsible for elaborating the RAP. It is proposed that overall oversight
and co-ordination of the resettlement planning and implementation process be undertaken
by a Compensation Steering Committee (CSC), consisting of the DTRP Project Co-ordinator
and senior representatives of other relevant ministries and the three municipalities. Internal
management of the resettlement programme should be handled by senior TANESCO
management staff in a Project Compensation Committee (PCC) while day-to-day
management and field co-ordination should be the responsibility of a Project Resettlement
Unit (PRU) consisting of TANESCO technical staff, the project design engineers and
specialist consultants. The PRU will manage and co-ordinate specialist field teams, such as
a Social Issues Team (SIT), a Land Acquisition and Valuation Team (LAVT) and a Dispute
Resolution Team (DRT). The PRU will be responsible for elaborating the detailed RAP
document. The principal activities to be undertaken during the preparation of the RAP
include:
0     preparatory activities after finalising the routes of transmission lines;

.     holding public consultation l eetings with DPs and local communities to provide
information on the project, form community representative committees and solicit
feedback;
.     physical surveying of wayl aves or right of ways for project infrastructure and
marking affected properties a id structures;
.     carrying out a field census to identify DPs, identify, quantify and value physical losses
and other economic and soc Il impacts on DPs and to assist DPs in the process of
applying for compensation;
.     carrying out a socio-econoi .lic household and community survey to serve as a
baseline for planning and futt re monitoring and evaluation;
.     elaborating and agreeing ent Ilement packages for individual DPs;
.     locating and planning possi le resettlement sites for DPs who have to completely
abandon their landholdings;
.     making arrangements for c mpensating people in potential resettlement areas for
any losses that they may incU r;
I     determining the feasibility of . ny other income or livelihood restoration measures;
I     and compiling the draft and fi al RAP documents.
It is anticipated that the preparation of the detailed RAP will take approximately six months.
The RAP will need to be disclose: to the DPs and public in Tanzania (in English and
Kiswahili) and in the WB Infoshop before being approved by the GOT, particularly the
National Environment Management Council, and the WB.
The backbone of the electricity sups: ly system in Dar es Salaam is an existing 132 kV high
tension (i.e. high voltage) transmiss Dn network, utilising self-supporting steel lattice towers
in corridors of varying widths, linkinl the main Ubungo substation to 132/33 kV substations
at Tegeta, llala and Factory Zone l.l The existing transmission system does not provide for
a reliable supply of bulk power to most areas in Dar es Salaam and, together with the
present distribution system, is unabl to meet current and forecast demand in many parts of
the city, particularly the north-east rn and southern areas. Additional high voltage bulk
supply as well as rehabilitation of tt existing distribution network is urgently needed. The
DTRP is aimed at improving the e isting transmission and distribution systems in Dar es
Salaam, as well as in areas in and a lund Arusha and Moshi in northem Tanzania.
In Dar es Salaam the project will in olve the construction of additional 132 kV transmission
lines, the constnuction of new 13; 33 kV substations, the expansion and upgrading of
existing 33/33 kV substations to 13 :/33 kV substations, the rehabilitation of new 33/11 kV
substations and the construction oi rehabilitation of medium and low voltage distribution
lines. The project design, including the type of transmission line infrastructure (e.g. towers,
poles or buried cables) and the ro tes and alignments of the transmission lines, has not
been finalised. This will be done  uring the detailed design phase of the project. The
transmission lines will mainly pas: through a number of wards of Temeke, lala and
Kinondoni municipalities which are medium to densely populated urban residential and
commercial areas and less densely populated semi-rural or peri-urban areas, characterised
by small farming plots.
The transmission lines and other pn iject infrastructure will require the creation of wayleaves
or right of ways (ROWs) and neces. tate the permanent acquisition of land for these ROWs.
TANESCO will acquire this land ii terms of the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act
(No. 47 of 1967). For safety and s :cuty reasons, no or limited other forms of use of the
ROWs will, in most cases, be possi le. In general, no buildings, structures or tall trees will
be permitted in the ROWs, althougl the use of ROWs for growing short stature crops and
undertaking certain activities, such a l informal vending and marketing, may be allowed. The
acquisition of land for ROWs will me an that people and entities who currently own or occupy

Distribution and Transmission Rehabilitation Project     Resettlement Policy Framework
(Dar es Salaam, Moshi and Arusha)                              Revised January 2006
the affected land will lose either their exiting rights over the land if they have such rights or,
in some cases, the ability to access or use the land where they do not have such rights.
DPs losing land or access to land may also lose buildings, structures, crops, trees and other
fixed assets that will need to be demolished or destroyed when the land is acquired. In tum,
DPs may, in some cases, have to physically relocate themselves (i.e. their place of
residence), affected business and income earning operations and/or farming activities. The
need to relocate may then result in losses of accommodation, income from business and/or
income or food sources from farming, although these losses may only be temporary DPs
may also incur other expenses associated with relocation or restoring their income
generating activities or livelihoods.
WB OP 4.12 applies to any project, supported by the WB, that involves land acquisition and
that displaces people from land or productive resources and which results in relocation, the
loss of shelter, the loss of assets or of access to assets important to production, the loss of
income sources or means of livelihood or the loss of access to locations that provide higher
incomes or lower expenditures to businesses or persons. These processes and outcomes
are termed "involuntary resettlement", or simply "resettlement", even when people are not
forced to move. The objectives of the WB policy are that:
*     involuntary resettlement should be avoided where feasible, or minimised, exploring
all viable altemative project designs;
•     where it is not feasible to avoid resettlement, resettlement activities should be
conceived and executed as sustainable development programmes, providing
sufficient investment resources to enable the DPs to share in project benefits. DPs
should be meaningfully consulted and should have opportunities to participate in
planning and implementing resettlement programmes; and
*     DPs should be assisted in their efforts to improve their livelihoods and standards of
living or at least to restore them, in real terms, to pre-displacement levels or to levels
prevailing prior to the beginning of project implementation, whichever is higher.
The RPF, therefore, lists a number of principles which will be adhered to in the design of the
project and the preparation and implementation of the RAP. Displacement of people,
property and livelihoods will be minimised as much as possible by employing appropriate
technologies and locating project infrastructure in such a manner so as to minimise the need
to acquire land and property and to cause as little disturbance and disruption as possible.
Where resettlement is unavoidable TANESCO will ensure that sufficient investment
resources are appropriately allocated to ensure that DPs are provided with:
*     adequate and appropriate compensation for assets, including land, lost;
*     compensation for the loss of business profits or opportunity; and
*     other measures to assist DPs to restore their livelihoods and regain and ideally
improve their pre-project living standards.
All possible means will be used to ensure that no people are harmed in any way. DPs will
be informed about their options and rights. DPs and other stakeholders will participate in the
planning of resettlement measures and consulted as much as possible. Eligible DPs will be
offered choices among technically and economically feasible resettlement altematives.
Resettlement will be provided in accordance with Tanzanian law but will, where appropriate,
include additional measures to meet WB requirements. For example the lack of legal rights
to land occupied or used will not preclude a DP from entitlement to resettlement measures
Resettlement measures will be provided promptly. Cash will be the preferred form of
compensation for the loss of land, assets, incomes and for other assistance provided but,
where necessary, DPs will be offered replacement land which they may acquire with the
proceeds of the compensation received. Such replacement sites will have a combination of

productive potential, location advan ages, accessibility, availability of services and other
factors at least equivalent to the adv intages of the old site. Where necessary, specific and
additional assistance will be provides to particularly vulnerable people. Construction work at
a particular site will not commence ul til DPs have been satisfactorily compensated.
In line with the objective to avoi( involuntary resettlement TANESCO carried out an
*          optimisation exercise during 2005 and considered a number of different project design
possibilities, involving various optic, is for transmission line structures, transmission line
routes, widths of ROWs and the use of unoccupied land, waste areas and existing road, rail,
pipeline and electricity distributiol reserves, corridors and ROWs.  An additional
consideration was to allow people o continue to live within and use land in the ROWs.
However, due to health, safety and $ecurity concerns of TANESCO and restrictions on the
use of high tension transmission line ROWs imposed by the Electricity Ordinance (Cap. 131
of 1931, Supplementary 57), this will not be possible, although certain activities, as
mentioned previously, may be allowd d. Although not final, a design proposal put forward by
TANESCO in August 2005 envisage! the construction of:
.     a new 132 kV transmission I ne from Ubungo substation to llala substation, via the
existing 33/11 kV Oysterbay ;ubstation (to be expanded on the existing TANESCO
plot and upgraded to 132/33 1 V);
*     a new 132 kV transmission line from Ubungo to the existing 132/33 kV Factory
Zone IlIl substation, via the e isting 33/11 kV Kurasini, Mbagala and Factory Zone II
substations (to be expanded .nd upgraded to 132/33 kV); and
*     a new 132 kV transmission lir e from the existing 11 33/11 kV Factory Zone substation
(to be expanded and upgradf d to 132/33 kV) to a new 132/33 kV substation, north of
Factory Zone II, on an existin TANESCO plot at Kinyerezi.
A combination of standard self-su :porting steel lattice towers and tubular steel poles,
enabling a more compact arrangeme i t of the cables and the ability to support more than one
circuit (i.e. multi-circuit line) will be sed. While a 40 m wide ROW is usually required for
transmission lines using steel lattict towers and a 15 m wide ROW for transmission lines
using tubular steel poles, the width c the ROWs will be reduced by using the outer edges of
existing road and rail reserves, pipe ne corridors and ROWs for electricity distribution lines,
thus decreasing the amount of privat and other land that will need to be acquired.
Since the beginning of the prepar tion of the RPF a number of public communication
meetings were undertaken by an independent sociologist engaged by TANESCO to
introduce the project to people livini in many of the areas likely to affected, to explain the
need for land acquisition, to explain the resettlement principles to be applied and to solicit
feedback. The results of the exercise are recorded separately in the Final SIA report which
is also presented as Annex 1 (separE Ie volume) to this RPF.
The project will affect a number of in lividuals, households, groups, companies or institutions
who are living (i.e. resident), carryin out business or income generation activities, farming
(mainly cultivation of crops and trees on small farm plots) or using land for a combination of
these purposes on plots or other la id that will be acquired in whole in part. DPs will be
affected in different ways.
Some of the DPs are recognised ir Tanzanian Law (i.e. The Land Act No. 4 of 1999) as
being legal property owners" or occ ipants of land, either through having a granted right of
occupancy (i.e. a long-term lease fr m the Sate, with title documents) or a deemed right of
occupancy (e.g. based on customarf lend tenure or proven long-standing occupancy of land,
usually without supporting docume ts).  DPs in this category will lose their land and,
possibly, buildings, other fixed asse  (e.g. boundary walls and wells) and crops and trees

Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited  Proposed 132 kV Transmission Lines in Dar es Salaam
Distribution and Transmission Rehabilitation Project   Resettlement Policy Framework
(Dar es Salaam, Moshi and Arusha)                             Revised January 2006
but in many cases the losses will be small, requiring no physical relocation of the household,
the business or the farming operations or only requiring relocation to the residual (non-
acquired) portion of the affected plot. Where losses are greater (e.g. total loss of land, loss
of 50% or more of land or where the residual in no longer viable for continued use) complete
abandonment of the property and relocation of the household, business or farming
operations to a new site will be necessitated.
In accordance with Section 3 of the Land Act eligible property owners will be compensated in
cash for their losses of land and un-exhausted improvements (including crops and trees) at
the market rate of the property. For land and improvements this will be determined using the
direct comparison method, evidenced by actual recent sales of similar properties, or using
the replacement cost if this is more appropriate or higher than the comparison method. The
value of crops and trees will be determined using the incomes approach, based on
estimating the productive capacity of an average tended crop and then capitalising the net
annual value of crop production at the average bank lending rate. To cater for possible
hardship, disturbance and inconvenience a disturbance allowance, determined as a
percentage (e.g. 5%) of the compensation paid for the land acquired, will be awarded.
DPs in this category who have to relocate, even over very short distances, may suffer the
loss of accommodation while they are looking for altemative accommodation or are building
new houses.   In conformity with the legislation they will be paid an accommodation
allowance calculated as the cost of renting altemative premises for 36 months. Other DPs
may, likewise, suffer losses of income or profit while re-establishing their business elsewhere
and will be paid a loss of profit allowance equivalent to their net monthly profit, as evidenced
by audited accounts or municipal trade lists where accounts are not available, over a 36
month period.
Where DPs in this category are required to relocate they will generally incur expenses for
moving fumiture, equipment or business inventory to new premises The Land Regulations
require that they be paid a transport allowance which will be the local cost of transporting
12 t of goods for 20 km by road.
DPs will generally only be paid for the portion of their land and fixed assets actually taken.
However, in situations where the greater part of the property is acquired (i.e. more than 50%
of the land and fixed assets are taken) or the residual is no longer viable for continued use
the DP will have the option to require the project to acquire the residual and for
compensation to be paid for the total holding.
Compensation will be paid in cash which will allow the DP to purchase replacement land
and/or assets, purchase or construct replacement buildings and/or re-establish business or
farming operations according to his or her own wishes. Where a DP has to abandon his or
her property completely and relocate away from the site the DP will be paid the appropriate
compensation but will be given a purchase option on a replacement plot offered by the
project, in conjunction with the relevant municipality, in another area (e.g. a resettlement
area).
Tenants, with formal lease contracts or only informal lease agreements, will also be
displaced by the acquisition of land and will be required to vacate all or part of the rented
property, In many cases there is more than one tenant living on rented property, e.g. a
number of tenants renting rooms on a property. Tanzanian law relating to land acquisition
and compensation does not recognise tenants as being property owners or eligible for
compensation. However, WB OP 4.12 recognises them as being eligible to receive some
resettlement entitlements, such as relocation assistance. As tenants will suffer no economic
loss of land and structures they will not be compensated for such losses, except in cases

where a tenant has made un-exhaus d improvements with the agreement of the landlord.
The project will, however, pay affe ed tenants a standard disruption allowance of, for
example, TSh 100 000 in lieu of the di;turbance allowance.
As is common practice, landlords will e required to give tenants three months' notice which
should enable them to find alternativ accommodation or premises before they are required
to leave and, therefore, enable th  to resume their residential, business or farming
activities elsewhere, with minimal di  ption and loss of accommodation or income. They
will, therefore, not be eligible for ac  mmodation or loss of profit allowances. The project
will, however, provide tenants assi ance to help them  locate alternative housing and
premises and reclaim advance rent  payments from landlords where there are problems.
Where necessary, the project will p vide free transport to enable tenants to move their
belongings to alternative locations.
It is expected that some DPs will be ccupying or using public land and land within public
safety zones (e.g. pavements, road  rges, land along streams and existing utility ROWs)
for a number of purposes. Legally,  ey have no recognised property rights over the land.
Informal occupiers include informal ettlers (squatters), informal businesses and people
cultivating vacant land (encroachers) Some informal business are operated from fixed sites
and use small fixed or not easily mov d structures (e.g. kiosks) or operate from fixed sites in
the open without fixed assets but  ere the goods are removed on a daily basis (e.g.
roadside plant nurseries and door fra e manufactures and sellers). Others are semi-mobile
street vendors, with no fixed assets, perating from a fixed site and removing their wares
daily (e.g. pavement vendors using ables). Highly mobile itinerant street vendors and
hawkers also operate from time to tim in areas to be acquired by the project.
As for tenants, the legislation does no consider such "illegal" or informal occupiers of land to
be eligible for compensation, even th  gh some of them may lose access to land, lose fixed
assets that belong to them and/or su  r other adverse impacts due to the taking of the land.
WB OP 4.12 recognises that so      informal occupiers, without officially recognised
occupancy rights, may be eligible fo some form of resettlement entitlement in respect of
their losses. Informal occupiers who re permifted to continue their activities within ROWs
either during or after construction as  ell as itinerant hawkers will suffer no or very minimal
losses and will not be eligible for com  nsation in terms of the RPF.
Eligible informal occupiers who per  nently lose access to the public land that they are
using will be offered altemative sites  vending spots nearby by the project in collaboration
with the relevant municipalities. The will also be provided with a fixed disruption allowance
of, for example TSh 100 000. Info  I occupiers who have installed fixed structures and
assets will, as for property owners, b  ompensated in cash for these.
In order that informal settlers (squaKte  ) do not lose shelter after they abandon their present
residential sites they will be requi d to construct, using the compensation received,
replacement shelter at the altemativ  ite provided by the project before they abandon the
present site. The project will pay  uch informal seKtlers a loss of eamings allowance
(equivalent to the minimum wage fo one month) to compensate for the possible loss of
wages or income while they are re- ilding. They will be provided with free transport to
relocate their personal belongings.  erever possible, in the interests of poverty alleviation
and improving the standards of living f DPs, eligible informal seKtlers will be included in on-
going municipal housing programm  , through which they may be allocated a plot and
house for free or with an assistance p ckage.
Where necessary, eligible informal b  iness operators will also be given a loss of eamings
allowance (equivalent to the minimu  wage for one month) to compensate them for loss of

income while re-establishing their business operations at a new site. Free transport for their
movable assets and wares will also be provided.
DPs in all categories will have the right to salvage material from affected structures and
assets. They will also be encouraged to harvest any standing crops prior to acquisition to
minimise possible losses of income and/or food sources.
Affected permanent employees will be provided with a loss of earnings allowance, to be
determined on a case by case basis, for loss of income incurred as a result of temporary or
longer-term loss of employment. The needs of specially vulnerable people will be assessed
on a case by case basis and additional assistance provided if required. It is proposed that
such DPs be also provided with a vulnerability allowance of, for example, 5% of the normal
compensation to be paid to them. In accordance with the Graves Removal Act (1968) the
relatives of people buried in graves that have to be relocated will be provided with a free
altemative burial site by the respective municipalities and be paid cash compensation at
rates set by the municipalities.
A proposed entitlement matrix is presented in the table below. Entitlements in italics indicate
measures in addition to those prescribed in Tanzanian legislation to meet requirements of
WB OP 4.12).
The number of DPs in each category will be determined during the preparation of the RAP.
However, estimates derived from the spot enumeration and valuation exercise carried out
during 2005 indicate that 1 788 properties or units will be affected. Taking each of these to
roughly represent on household, with an average of five persons per household, 8 940
people will be affected. These figures are likely to be an underestimation since the
preliminary enumeration exercises did not consider tenants and informal occupiers of land
with very small land areas and structures.
The RPF outlines the procedure to be followed during RAP preparation and responsibilities
for identifying eligible DPs and for determining individual entitlement packages. In summary
this is:
*     surveying and marking of ROW  limits and property and infrastructure within the
ROWs;
*     holding of public consultation meetings and creation of DP representative
committees;
*     identification of DPs, confirmation of tenure status, tenancy and employment;
*     conducting a baseline socio-economic survey of affected people and communities;
*     serving notice on DPs to apply for compensation and providing a letter explaining the
project, cut-off dates, general eligibility, general compensation rates and values,
rights and grievance mechanisms;
*     carrying out a census of DPs and compiling an inventory of losses;
*     completing valuation data sheets and adjudication plans, to be counter-checked and
signed by the DP and local leaders;
*     assisting DPs to complete an application for compensation by land occupier form;
discussing and agreeing on compensation and any relocation entitlements;
*     agreeing valuation specifications;
*     submitting a valuation report to the Chief Govemment Valuer;
*     working out individual entitlement packages; and
*     completing compensation schedules (to be countersigned by the relevant Sub-ward
Chairman, Ward Executive Officer, Municipal Lands Officer, District Commissioner

Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited  Proposed 132 kV Transmission Lines in Dar es Salaam
Distribution and Transmission Rehabilitation F oject    Resettlement Policy Framework
(Dar es Salaam, Moshi and Arusha)                             Revised January 2006
It is recommended that TANESC maintains similar structures established for the
preparation of the detailed RAP to s pervise, manage and carry out the implementation of
the RAP, for which it will be responsi e. These include the CSC, the PCC, the PRU and the
DRT. The project will also appoint a  gal consultant to deal with problems that tenants may
have with landlords, such as the refu  of advance rental payments. The RPF lists activities
to be undertaken during the impleme ation of the RAP. In summary, these include:
.     preparatory activities;
.     planning and preparation of r ettlement areas and sites;
.     delivery of entitlements to Ds (inclining affected "hosts" in resettlement areas).
Actual payment of compensa on and delivery of other entitlements will primarily be
undertaken by staff from the r evant municipalities with support from the PRU;
.     allocation of replacement land nd sites, where applicable
*     activities necessary prior to  Ps abandoning acquired land and, where applicable,
relocating to residua I parts of ffected land or to new locations;
.     demolition of structures in t e ROWs and commencement of transmission line
construction activities;
.     re-establishment of residenc: s, businesses and farming activities by DPs in
accordance with their own wis es, plans and schedules; and
.     monitoring and evaluation of n ettlement implementation and impacts.
Grievances and disputes related to r ettlement in general, and compensation in particular,
will be handled by the DRT which wil as far as possible, attend to disputes on the ground.
Where disputes cannot be resolved b the DRT they will be referred to the CSC and then to
the relevant Municipal Director who  1I consult with all interested parties. Unresolved land
disputes may be referred to the ap ropriate level of land courts. If disputes cannot be
resolved by Municipal Directors or th local courts application can then be made to the High
Court of Tanzania for resolution, who  decision will be final.
It is proposed that community repres  tative committees be established in various areas to
provide a platform for co-operation b  een the planning teams and the DPs and to ensure
the full participation of the DPs and o er stakeholders in the planning process.
Throughout the resettlement implem ntation process the PRU will maintain records of all
progress and submit regular reports  the CSC, via the PCC. Both intemal and extemal
monitoring and evaluation (M&E) wil e undertaken during implementation, and for some
time afterwards, in order to monitor  d evaluate, among others, implementation progress,
compensation and resettlement po ies, delivery of entitlements satisfaction with the
resettlement process, impacts on live oods and incomes among DPs, and consultation with
and participation of DPs and other takeholders. Appropriate indicators and means of
verification will be developed during t  preparation of the detailed RAP. It is proposed that
intemal participatory M&E be und  aken by an independent sociologist engaged by
TANESCO. Extemal M&E should b conducted through WB missions deployed to monitor
and evaluate the overall DTRP.
A budget for the implementation   compensation, relocation and other resettlement
measures will be developed during t  preparation of the detailed RAP, once the full extent
of land acquisition and resettlement  easures is known. From the preliminary valuation
exercises, based on the TANESCO  gust 2005 project design proposals, it was estimated
that cash compensation would amou  to USD 16 078 270 or USD 8 992 per property unit or
USD 1 799 per person. This estim  does not include possible compensation costs for
tenants and informal occupants, the c sts associated with possible compensation for people
living in potential resettlement areas ( . host populations), possible costs for grave removal
nor the costs associated with planning nd developing such areas.

Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited  Proposed 132 kV Transmission Lines in Dar es Salaam
Distribution and Transmission Rehabilitation  oject      Resettlement Policy Framework
(Dar es Salaam, Moshi and Arusha)                               Revised January 2006
1     THE PROJECT, LAND AC        UISITION AND RESETTLEMENT
1.1   PURPOSE
The purpose of this document is to resent a resettlement policy framework for that part of
the Distribution and Transmission Re abilitation Project (Dar es Salaam, Moshi and Arusha)
that the Tanzania Electric Supply C  npany Limited (TANESCO) is proposing to implement
in Dar es Salaam. Its approval and isclosure are required prior to appraisal of the overall
project by the World Bank which hs been requested to provide financial support for the
project.
This document focuses on that parti of the project to be implemented in Dar es Salaam.
Although the policy framework is p sented as a separate, stand-alone document to the
project environmental and social im  ct assessment (ESIA) report prepared in April 2005, it
is an integral component of that re ort, particularly its environmental management plan
recommendations.
1.2   BACKGROUND TO THE PR        ECT
Nearly all the generation, transmissi  and distribution of electricity in mainland Tanzania is
undertaken by TANESCO which i a public company that is wholly owned by the
Govemment of the United Republic  Tanzania (GOT). TANESCO is responsible for about
98% of the country's electricity suppl
The demand for electricity in Tanz  ia has been increasing rapidly due to the growing
economic and social situation in th  country. The average growth of the customer base
since 2000 is between 6% and 9%.  owever, power outages, deterioration of power quality
(i.e. under voltage) and technical an non-technical losses have also increased, mainly due
to the overload experienced in s me substations and the ageing transmission and
distribution networks.
Dar es Salaam is situated on the eas 3m coast of Tanzania (Figure 1). With a population of
nearly 2,5 million people' (2002 cens s), it is the largest city in Tanzania and is the country's
largest sea port and principal com  ercial, industrial and educational centre. Although
Dodoma is the capital of Tanzania m t govemment ministries and administrative institutions
are still located in Dar es Salaam.  early 60% of households in the city have access to
electricity.
The backbone of the electricity suppl system in Dar es Salaam is an existing 132 kV high
tension (i.e. high voltage) transmissin network which is connected to the 220 kV national
grid at Ubungo substation (i.e. a 22 132/33/11 kV substation), some 12 km north-west of
the city centre. From Ubungo 132 k transmission lines supply power to three other bulk
distribution/load centres (i.e. 132/33/ 1 kV substations) at Tegeta to the north of Ubungo,
llala to the south east and Factory  ne IlIl to the south (see Figure 2). The high voltage
conductors (i.e. cables) are carried y self-supporting steel lattice towers that have been
constructed within corridors of varyin widths.
' This is the population of Dar es Salaam r on which comprises three municipalities (i.e. Temeke, Kinondoni
and llala) and essentially covers the area kno  as the city of Dar es Salaam.

From the four main substations 33 kV (i.e. medium voltage) distribution lines supply
industrial areas and other single large consumers while 33 kV sub-transmission lines feed
around twenty primary (i.e. 33/11 kV) substations. The 33 kV conductors are usually carried
by treated wooden poles with horizontal cross arms and post type insulators.. The lines are
usually located alongside roads and both single and double circuit lines exist. Radial
networks of medium voltage (i.e. 1 1 kV) and low voltage (i.e. 0,4 kV or 0,23 kV) distribution
lines serve as the main distribution system supplying consumers from the four main (i.e.
132/33/1 1 kV) and other primary (i.e. 33/1 1 kV) substations.

Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited   Proposed 132 kV Transmission Lines in Dar es Salaam
Distribution and Transmission Rehabilitation f oject         Resettlement Policy Framework
(Dar es Salaam, Moshi and Arusha)                                   Revised January 2006
The existing electricity supply syste  in Dar es Salaam  is unable to meet the growing
demand for electricity by existing and potential consumers.    The high voltage bulk
transmission system does not extend to many parts of the city, particularly in the north-east
and south, and most of the equip ent in the main 132/33/11 kV substations is old and
overloaded. At the same time the exi ting distribution system (i.e. 33 kV and 11 kV lines and
33/11 kV substations) is inadequate nd overloaded. Line tripping occurs frequently and
many of the lines are extremely Ion  which contributes to distribution losses and the low
voltages experienced by consumers   In order to cover the full power demand in Dar es
Salaam, reduce losses, decrease vc tage drops and increase the reliability of the system
additional high voltage (e.g. 132 kV) Iulk supply and the rehabilitation and expansion of the
existing distribution system are urgen y needed.
In 2002 TANESCO, in collaboration With the Japanese International Co-operation Agency,
prepared a master plan to improve th: power situation in Dar es Salaam and the main towns
of Kilimanjaro and Arusha regions it the north of the country. Subsequently, TANESCO
commissioned several studies2 whic Iidentified priority areas and the type of investment
needed by TANESCO to optimally utilise the available resources to achieve desired
objectives.
Based on the studies, TANESCO hs approached various financing institutions, including
the World Bank (WB), to assist in ir plementing different components of the master plan.
TANESCO and the International Dev lopment Association (IDA) are currently preparing the
Distribution and Transmission Reha ilitation Project - Dar es Salaam, Moshi and Arusha
(DTRP) as a follow-on component of the Songo Songo Gas Development and Power
Generation Project (credit 3569-TA);  The DTRP aims to improve the reliability and the
quality of electric power supply to cc sumers in Dar es Salaam and in and around Arusha
and Moshi in northem Tanzania. The project is intended to achieve the following objectives:
.      reduction of the duration and f equency of power interruptions;
.      improvement of voltage condil ons at consumers' premises; and
.      reduction of power system los es.
1.3    SUMMARY DESCRIPTION O I MAIN PROJECT COMPONENTS
A detailed description of the project a id its components is presented in the Project Appraisal
Document and the Project Impleme itation Plan. In Dar es Salaam the DTRP has two
principal infrastructure-related compo l ents.
1.3.1 Component 1 - Transmissic n system
Component 1 will support the install tion of new transmission infrastructure to principally
supply bulk power to areas with high oad densities and to new supply areas, particularly in
the north-eastern and southern parts f the city. Component 1 will involve the:
2 E.g. the Relief Project II, prepared by NETi roup Solutions (Pty) Ltd of South Africa in 2004, and a feasibility
study for the Reinforcement and Upgrade  the Dar es Salaam, Kilimanjaro and Arusha Transmission and
Distribution Systems, prepared by Lahmeyer Itemational of Germany in December 2004.
3The Songo Songo Project was implementc during the late 1990s to improve the availability of electricity in
Tanzania, and in Dar es Salaam in particular It involved the development of the Songo Songo natural gas field
in Kilwa district, southem Tanzania, the cor truction of gas processing facilities on Songo Songo island, the
construction of a 300 mm pipeline to transpor the gas to Ubungo in Dar es Salaam and the construction of a gas
turbine power station at Ubungo. The Songo !ongo Project was implemented by Songas, a company specifically
established for this purpose. TANESCO is on I of the partners in Songas.

(Dares Salaam, Moshi and Arusha)                                Revised January 2006
construction of new 132 kV transmission lines: Different types (i.e. designs) may be
used for all or specific sections of the proposed 132 kV transmission lines. These
include:
*     fairly widely spaced overhead conductors (i.e. cables) carried by self-
supportinQ, steel lattice towers: This is the standard design commonly used
for high tension transmission lines in Tanzania and elsewhere. The towers
can be designed to carry more than one circuit. This option is often the
cheapest, in terms of construction and subsequent maintenance costs;
*     more compactly spaced overhead conductors carried by tubular steel poles:
This type of transmission line often accommodates one or more circuits (e.g.
a 132 kV line and a 33 kV line) as a multi-circuit line. Construction costs are
similar to those for steel lattice towers; and
*     buried cables: This is the most expensive option in terms of construction and
subsequent maintenance costs;
construction of new 132/33/11 kV substations: New 132/33/11 kV substations will be
modular. The 132/33 kV part will be of the open air type with, usually, two line bays
and two transformer bays. The 33/11 kV part will be housed in a metal-clad,
prefabricated indoor type unit;
installation of additional 132/33 kV components to existing 132/33/11 kV substations:
Additional 132/33 kV transformers and line bays will be installed in some of the
existing 132/33/11 kV substations to serve the proposed new 132 kV transmission
lines; and
extension and upgrading of existing 33/11 kV substations to full 132/33/11 kV
substations: Some existing 33/11 kV substations will be expanded and upgraded to
132/33/11 kV substations with the addition of new 132/33 kV transformers and line
bays (usually two of each) to serve the proposed new 132 kV transmission lines.
Component 1 will be implemented in a number of wards in Temeke, Kinondoni and llala
municipalities in Dar es Salaam. The location (i.e. routing) of new transmission lines and
other project infrastructure is still being planned and has not been finalised. As part of its
efforts to meet overall project objectives, satisfy engineering and safety requirements,
reduce the negative impacts of the project on people and their property and reduce project
costs, TANESCO has been considering a number of transmission line routing and
infrastructure location altematives. Although not final, a proposal put forward by TANESCO
in August 2005 for Component 1 (see Figure 2) will involve the:
*     construction  of a  new  132 kV  transmission  line from  Ubungo  substation
(220/132/33/11 kV) to llala substation (132/33/11 kV), via the existing Oysterbay
primary substation (33/11 kV) which is to be expanded on the existing TANESCO
plot and upgraded to a 132/33/11 kV substation. This line will be used to close a
132 kV circular link in the north-east of the city from Ubungo to Oysterbay to llala and
back to Ubungo;
*     construction of a new 132 kV transmission line from Ubungo to the existing Factory
Zone IlIl substation (132/33/11 kV), via the existing Kurasini, Mbagala and Factory
Zone II primary substations (33/11 kV) which are to be expanded and upgraded to
132/33/11 kV substations. This line will be used to close a 132 kV circular link in the
southern part of the city from Ubungo to Kurasini to Mbagala to Factory Zone II to
Factory Zone IlIl and back to Ubungo; and

specific sections, the exact alignment of transmission line sections and the final location of
all substations and other infrastructure have not been finally determined.
1.3.2 Component 2 - Distribution system
Component 2 will support the extension, upgrading and rehabilitation of existing distribution
infrastructure in various parts of Dar es Salaam. It will involve the:
•      construction, repair and upgrade of 33 kV and 11 kV distribution lines: New 33 kV
and 11 kV distribution lines will be constructed and some existing lines repaired and
upgraded to feed load centres from various substations. For these medium voltage
distribution lines single or double circuit lines, carried by wooden or reinforced
concrete poles; or buried cables will be used; and
*      rehabilitation of existing 33/11 kV primary substations: Around 18 existing 33/11 kV
primary substations will be rehabilitated to metal-clad, prefabricated indoor type,
composed of individual cubicles.
1.4    LAND ACQUISITION AND DISPLACEMENT
1.4.1  Standard land requirements for project infrastructure
New transmission lines, new substations and extensions to existing substations to be
established under Component 1 of the project will occupy land permanently. For high
tension overhead transmission lines self-supporting steel lattice towers and tubular steel
poles individually occupy relatively small areas of land. However, for health, safety, security
and maintenance purposes a cleared strip of land is required undemeath the conductors and
between the towers or poles. Such transmission lines, therefore, require a wayleave or right
of way (ROW), the standard width of the ROW varying according to the type of transmission
line stnucture used. Although installed underground, high tension buried cables require a
surface ROW. The total amount of land required for ROWs for the proposed 132 kV
transmission lines will depend on the type of structure to be used for a particular
transmission line or for individual sections of a transmission line.  Standard land
requirements for project infrastructure are listed in Table 1.
Under Component 2 of the project new medium voltage distribution lines will require narrow
land corridors. No new 33/11 kV substations are envisaged and medium voltage to low
voltage transformers will usually be pole-mounted.

1.4.2 Land availability and the need to acquire additional land
For the installation of new project infrastructure TANESCO will, where possible, utilise land
over which it already has the right of occupation or use. This includes existing transmission
line and distribution line corridors and substations (although these may need to be

expanded) and vacant plots of land wned by TANESCO. However, the amount of such
land in the project area is very lirri ted and the utility will need to permanently acquire
additional land for project infrastruct re from other sources. Additional land will need to be
acquired primarily for new or expa ded ROWs and substations to be established under
Component 1 of the project. It is nc I expected that the implementation of Component 2 of
the project will require significant amc nts of additional land.
Where possible, public and land us d for public safety zones, such as unallocated and
unoccupied Sate land, "waste" land E ong water courses, road and railway line reserves and
existing water, natural gas and pet lleum  pipeline corridors and ROWs, will be utilised.
However, it will not be possible to loc te all project infrastructure within such land.
Therefore, TANESCO will need to pe imanently acquire a significant, but as yet unconfirmed,
amount of land in Dar es Salaam 0,hich is currently owned, occupied or being used by
people and institutions for residentia commercial, industrial, agricultural (e.g. crop farming)
and other purposes.    TANESCO     ill acquire the land by application of the relevant
provisions of the Land Acquisition Ac (No. 47 of 1967) and the Land Act (No. 4 of 1999).
1.4.3 Impact of land acquisition o n affected people
Although the exact alignment of t ansmission lines and the location of other project
infrastructure have not been finalis d and approved, preparatory studies for the DTRP4
indicate that the land to be acquired f i ir ROWs is mainly located in:
.      medium   to high population density built-up urban residential, commercial and
industrial areas:  These r nge from    well-established, relatively well serviced
suburban areas with medium to high value properties, owned mainly by people with
legally recognised occupanc! rights5, to unplanned settlements, with smaller plots
and lower value properties   occupied by people with and without recognised
occupancy rights; and
.      low to medium   population d nsity semi-nural or peri-urban mixed residential and
agricultural areas (e.g., consi $ting of small farm plots): Residential structures are
often included on the sma     plots.  Most occupants have legally recognised
occupancy rights.
Acquisition of the land needed for RC  s and other infrastructure will cause affected people,
organisations and entities with legal  recognised occupancy rights to lose those rights in
respect of the acquired portion of Ind. Affected people without recognised occupancy
rights6 will also have to abandon thl land that they are occupying or using. For people
whose land is acquired by the project this will result in one or more of the following:
.      physical displacement: It is e pected that some affected people will have to abandon
houses or shelter on the aci uired land and have to relocate to the non-acquired

portion of an affected plot (i.e. over short distances) or to a completely new location
(i.e. over longer distances). Some business may also be physically displaced;
*     economic displacement: Affected people may suffer the loss of the value of affected
land and fixed assets (e.g. structures, boundary walls, crops and trees), the physical
loss of assets or resources important for production (e.g. farm land and land used for
outdoor business activities), the loss of access to these assets or resources or the
loss of income sources or means of livelihood; and
*     social displacement: In some cases affected people may be adversely affected by
the loss or breakdown of social, cultural and spiritual networks and stnuctures,
particularly if they have to relocate away from the affected area.
Displacement will, generally, be permanent. However, TANESCO has indicated that it will
permit affected people to use parts of the ROWs after construction of the transmission lines
for certain purposes, such as crop farming and vending, provided that these do not present a
safety hazard to people and do not interfere with the operation and maintenance of the
transmission lines. Restrictions will be applied, e.g. on the type of crops which can be grown
as tall trees and crops cannot be grown under the transmission lines. To control the use of
the ROW and avoid future misunderstandings it is recommended that TANESCO introduces
a permit or tenancy system for the use of land within the ROWs.
Although not directly related to the acquisition of land for project purposes it is possible that
construction teams may adversely impact on (e.g. damage) land or property located outside
the ROWs. The affected people will, therefore, suffer losses which may be temporary or
permanent and such displacement will need to be dealt with accordingly.
1.5   POLICIES APPLICABLE TO INVOLUNTARY RESETTLEMENT PLANNING
1.5.1 Planning requirements for involuntary resefflement in Tanzania
The GOT recognises that projects which displace people involuntarily can potentially give
rise to economic and social hardships and be detrimental to the environment. It further
recognises that people to be displaced by a project, such as the DTRP, should receive
benefits from it and that the quality of life of those affected by the project is restored and
even improved. Accordingly, the GOT has set out three overriding objectives to guide
resettlement planning and implementation, i.e.: avoidance, compensation and replacement.
The basic premise is that the affected people should not be left in a worse position than they
were before project implementation.
Although there is no specific policy or procedural guideline on involuntary resettlement
planning in Tanzania, the environmental regulations and guidelines require that for projects
involving the displacement of people and property the arrangements for compensating and
resettling displaced people must be included in the environmental studies which are required
in terms of the legislation7. Resettlement planning is required to follow the policies and
procedures outlined in the Land Acquisition Act (No. 47 of 1967), the Land Act (No. 4 of
1999), the Village Land Act (No. 5 of 1999) and their associated Regulations.  The
resettlement arrangements may be presented as a separate compensation and resettlement
plan.
The environmental studies have to be reviewed and approved by the National Environment
Management Council (NEMC) which has to be satisfied that appropriate arrangements have
been planned to adequately and appropriately compensate the affected people for their
losses including, where necessary, arrangements for relocation.  On the basis of the
7These include, for example, environmental impact assessments and management plans.

recommendation of the NEMC, the     Minister responsible for the environment may issue an
environmental permit to the project ieveloper or proponent. Such a permit is required for
many projects, including the con. truction of high voltage transmission     lines, before
implementation of the project may c nmence.
1.5.2 World Bank operational pol cy on involuntary resettlement
Because that part of the DTRP to b  implemented in Dar es Salaam is expected to receive
financial support from the WB groL i and will involve land acquisition and the involuntary
displacement of people, the Bar I's Operational Policy on      Involuntary Resettlement
(OP 4.12) must be applied to the p ject8.  This safeguard policy is applied to any project
that displaces people from land or p oductive resources and which results in relocation, the
loss of shelter, the loss of assets or of access to assets important to production, the loss of
income sources or means of liveliho id or the loss of access to locations that provide higher
incomes or lower expenditures to businesses or persons.       The WB describes these
processes and outcomes as 'involul ary resettlement", or simply 'resettlement", even when
people are not forced to move. Res ttlement is involuntary if displaced people (DPs) do not
have the option to retain the status q o that they have before the project begins.
WB OP 4.12 provides policy guida ce and procedures for adequately resettling9 project
affected persons. In the case of thal part of the DTRP to be implemented in Dar es Salaam
the general zone of impact of the prc ect is known but the precise alignments of transmission
lines and locations of other projecl infrastructure, and thus the nature and magnitude of
displacement, will not be known L itil after project appraisal. In such a case OP 4.12
requires TANESCO to prepare a r settlement policy framework (RPF), as a stand-alone
document, to address the econom      and social impacts associated with potential losses
suffered by DPs. The RPF has tc be reviewed, approved and publicly disclosed as a
condition of appraisal of the overall F loject.
Subsequent to appraisal and apprd al of the DTRP and during the detailed engineering
design of the project, the design ar J location of project infrastructure will be finalised and
approved. At this stage OP 4.12 requires TANESCO to prepare a more detailed and
accurate resettlement action plan ( AP), consistent with the RPF, for the project. The RAP
will be reviewed, approved and discl sed prior to project implementation'°.
1.5.3  Objectives and scope of th iresettlement policy framework
The objective of this RPF is to set c t the policies, principles, organisational arrangements,
design criteria and indicative budge, to be applied to avoid or resolve displacement impacts
on people and property caused b # the acquisition of land for the project. As a policy
framework the RPF is an agreed c : mmitment by the parties involved (e.g. TANESCO, the
GOT, local authorities and the DPs for resolving the displacement and resettlement issues
of the project as a whole and for e suring that DPs are left no worse off than they were
a OP 4.12 was published in December 2001 and was revised in April 2004. The revision applies to projects that
are governed by WB Operational Policy 6.0/: and Bank Policy 6.00, i.e. those in countries with approved country
financing parameters. The revision omits Paragraph 34 in the December 2001 publication, i.e. 'The Bank does
not disburse against cash compensation ar:l other resettlement assistance paid in cash, or against the cost of
land (including compensation for land acq lisition). However, it may finance the cost of land improvement
associated with resettlement activites".
9 'Resettlement" includes all aspects of c rr+pensation, physical relocation and support for the restoration of
livelihoods.
'° The same requirement applies to each  ub-project where a project involves multiple sub-projects and the
planning details of each sub-project are not Mown prior to appraisal of the overall project. Each sub-project RAP
must be reviewed and approved before it is xcepted for inclusion in the overall project or programme.

Distribution and Transmission Rehabilitation Project   Resettlement Policy Framework
(Dar es Salaam, Moshi and Arusha)                             Revised January 2006
before commencement of the project. The RPF will guide and govern the project as the
details of the project become available. By setting out the agreed policies, principles and
procedures it allows further detailed resettlement planning, such as the elaboration of a
RAP, to be undertaken without having to further discuss these and it allows implementation
to proceed without having to re-negotiate fundamental agreements. The RPF:
•     lays down the agreed principles that will apply to resettlement and compensation
preparation and implementation;
*     describes the procedures to be used for preparing and approving a more detailed
RAP;
*     identifies and describes, as far as possible, those people currently living within the
proposed ROWs and who will suffer losses;
*     describes the legal framework for dealing with involuntary resettlement in Tanzania
and measures to bridge any gaps between this and WB policy requirements;
*     defines eligibility criteria for defining various categories of DPs;
*     indicates how affected assets of individual DPs will be valued;
*     describes how resettlement and other entitlements will be delivered, including the
procedures, responsibilities and timing;
•     describes mechanisms for maximising stakeholder participation and for resolving
disputes and grievances; and
*     provides an indication of the costs involved.
Although it is assumed that a single RAP will be prepared for that part of the DTRP to be
implemented in Dar es Salaam it may be agreed to prepare two or more RAPs covering
specific transmission lines or transmission line sections. This may be because detailed
planning and design, and subsequently implementation, may be undertaken in stages for
individual transmission lines or sections of transmission lines and the detailed planning
information for the whole project may not be available at a single point in time.
1.5.4 Disclosure of the reseftlement policy framework
Consistent with the WB's Disclosure Policy, the RPF will have to be disclosed prior to
appraisal. Disclosure will take place in Tanzania as well as in the WB Infoshop. Thus,
TANESCO will disclose the document in-country while forwarding a letter to the Bank,
authonsing the latter to disclose the document in the WB Infoshop.
In Tanzania the RPF will be made available in English and Kiswahili to the public for a period
of six weeks in the relevant municipal and ward council offices. This fact will be advertised
in newspapers and on radio stations commonly accessed by the local population. During
this period members of the public will be given the opportunity to respond to the RPF, in
writing or verbally, to the relevant municipal director or ward executive officer who will then
pass on the responses to TANESCO.
1.6   METHODOLOGY AND INFORMATION SOURCES USED
This RPF is presented as a stand-alone document. However, it should be considered as an
integral component of the ESIA for the DTRP, particularly the constituent environmental
management plan, prepared by TANESCO in April 2005.     Preparation of the RPF
commenced. in mid-January 2005 and continued until December. The methodology applied
is described in Appendix 2 to this report.

1.7   DESIGN ALTERNATIVES To MINIMISE LAND ACQUISITION AND
DISPLACEMENT
In January 2005 TANESCO comme iced a project design and cost optimisation exercise
based on the original 132 kV trans ission line routing plan suggested in earlier studies".
The exercise compared the construcl n costs, compensation costs (based on the estimated
number of affected properties) and total project costs for transmission lines using self-
supporting steel lattice towers (RC l  = 40 m wide), tubular steel poles with compact
arrangement (ROW = 15 m wide) lrnd buried cables (ROW = 5 m wide). The results
indicated that a 5 m wide ROW woul affect an estimated 637 properties and 3 205 people
and that a 40 m wide ROW would a fect an estimated 1 977 properties and 9 975 people.
More importantly, the exercise revea id that a considerable amount of physical relocation in
addition to financial compensation wc Ild be needed as many houses and business premises
would be affected.
In an effort to reduce the amount of additional land that needs to be acquired compulsorily
for project infrastructure, and so mir imise displacement, compensation costs and physical
relocation TANESCO has subseque intly been considering a number of transmission line
design, transmission line routing a fd other infrastnucture location alternatives.  These
include, wherever feasible and appro riate:
.     using types of transmission lil e (i.e. structures) which require a narrower ROW, thus
reducing the amount of land to be acquired. Tubular steel poles with a compact
conductor arrangement and buried cables require narrower ROWs than do self-
supporting steel lattice towers Buried cables are, however, a very expensive option;
*     using types of transmission Ii le which are more flexible in their routing possibilities,
thus avoiding  privately o0 ned, occupied  or used  land  and  infrastructure.
Transmission lines using sel -supporting steel lattice towers generally need to be
aligned in a straight line a' much as possible so that routing possibilities are
somewhat inflexible and it is lifficult to avoid properties and infrastructure along the
route. Transmission lines u ing a compact conductor arrangement supported by
steel tubular poles allow for r ore flexible routing possibilities. The lines, which may
be used as multi-circuit lines are more easily aligned along the sides of roads or in
other corridors in built-up al as, thus avoiding properties and infrastructure to a
greater extent. Buried cables have the most flexible routing options as the cables
can be buried in road reserve and other corridors;
.     using public land and public safety zones, such as unallocated land, unoccupied
land, undeveloped land, wE ste land, road reserves, other ROWs and existing
distribution line corridors, thu reducing the amount of privately owned or occupied
land that needs to be acquired;
i     utilising TANESCO property ( .g. for substations); and
i  .  routing transmission lines t ough private property, where unavoidable, so as to
avoid major infrastructure (e g. houses) as much as possible, thus reducing the
amount of physical displacem nt caused.
Following consideration of the alte, .atives, a number of options have been included in
revised transmission line design anc routing proposal put forward by TANESCO in August
2005 which will reduce the amount )f additional land that needs to be acquired12. These
include the use of transmission lines carried by:
A summary of the original transmission lin, design and routing plan is presented in Appendix 1 to this RPF.

*      self-supporting steel lattice towers in a ROW that utilises the outer edges of existing
pipeline and other ROWs. The additional strip of land required for the transmission
line ROW will be less than the normal 40 m wide;
*     tubular steel poles (compact design) erected along the sides of roads, requiring a
total ROW of between 5m and 7m wide of which 1,5 m to 3 m is the outer edge of
existing road reserves'3. If the poles are erected within the centre of the full 5 m to
7 m wide ROW the additional strip of land to be acquired outside the road reserve is
between 2 m and 3,5 m wide (assuming the full ROW is 5 m wide);
*     tubular steel poles (compact design) erected along the sides of roads, requiring a
total ROW of between 5m and 7m wide of which 1,5 m to 3 m is the outer edge of
existing road reserves (same as above). However, if the poles are erected along the
inner boundary of the 1,5 m to 3 m wide corridor made available to TANESCO within
the road reserve, with one of the cross-arms over the actual road, no or very little
land will need to be acquired14;
*     tubular steel poles (compact design) erected within existing railway reserves where
no additional land will need to be acquired15; and
*     tubular steel poles (multi-circuit, compact design) transmission lines within existing
33 kV or 11 kV corridors, which can carry a new 132 kV line and the existing 33 kV or
11 kV line. In some cases the existing ROW may need to be widened by, for
example, 5 m.
Table 2 summarises the various options that are currently being considered to reduce the
amount of new or additional land required for the ROWs and to minimise displacement and
compensation and resettlement costs. Application of these options to various sections of the
proposed 132 kV transmission lines will be confirmed during detailed design.
An additional alternative considered by TANESCO was to allow people to continue to live
within and use land in the ROWs, as much as possible, after construction of the transmission
lines, taking into account that a strip of land immediately under the conductors would need to
be kept permanently cleared. Allowing people to live and work within the ROWs, provided a
minimum clearance under the conductors (e.g. 8 m) was maintained, would not only
accommodate the wishes of affected people who generally are reluctant to move, but would
considerably reduce the amount of displacement and the cost of relocation and/or
compensation. However, it is the opinion of TANESCO that, for health, safety and security
reasons, it is not advisable to allow people to live in a ROW used for high tension
transmission lines. The Electricity Ordinance (Cap. 131 of 1931, Supplementary 57) also
legally prevents people living in such a ROW. However, TANESCO has usually allowed
other activities, such as the growing of short and temporary crops, within such ROWs.
13 The Tanzania National Roads Agency (TANROADS) has offered TANESCO and other utilities corridors of
varying widths (e.g. 1,5 m and 3 m) within some of its road reserves.
14 Discussions with TANROADS have been initiated. In principle, TANROADS has no objection but existing
regulabons preventing activities being undertaken under transmission lines will need to be amended and safety
measures strengthened.
15 TANESCO is consulting with the Tanzania Railways Corporation (TRC) on the possibility of utilising one such
railway reserve.

displace, in one form or another, a   stimated 8 940 people. While the revised number of
estimated affected property units a   people may not be much less than that estimated for
the original transmission line design  nd routing plan, fewer houses and other buildings will
need to be demolished within thes     roperties. Resettlement costs will be lower and the
amount of physical relocation needed ill be less.

Distribution and Transmission Rehabilitation Project    Resettlement Policy Framework
(Dar es Salaam, Moshi and Arusha)                             Revised January 2006
2     PRINCIPLES AND OBJECTIVES COVERING RESETTLEMENT
PREPARATION AND IMPLEMENTATION
Implementation of that part of the DTRP to be implemented in Dar es Salaam will be
consistent with the overall objectives of the WB policy on involuntary resettlement which are
that:
*     involuntary resettlement should be avoided where feasible, or minimised, exploring
all viable alternative project designs;
*     where it is not feasible to avoid resettlement, resettlement activities should be
conceived and executed as sustainable development programmes, providing
sufficient investment resources to enable the DPs to share in project benefits. DPs
should be meaningfully consulted and should have opportunities to participate in
planning and implementing resettlement programmes; and
*     DPs should be assisted in their efforts to improve their livelihoods and standards of
living or at least to restore them, in real terms, to pre-displacement levels or to levels
prevailing prior to the beginning of project implementation, whichever is higher.
Because the project infrastructure is to be installed in populated urban areas it will not be
possible to avoid the acquisition of land and displacement of people. However a number of
measures, as described previously, are being taken by the TANESCO management to
displace (i.e. move or deprive from land or resources or access to resources, or deprive from
income earning capacity or opportunities) as few people, businesses and institutions as
possible and this will remain the overall objective of the "resettlement" component of the
DTRP. Displacement of people, property and livelihoods will be minimised as much as
possible by employing appropriate engineering and design technologies and locating project
infrastructure in such a manner so as to minimise the need to acquire land and property and
to cause as little disturbance and disruption as possible. Where resettlement is unavoidable
TANESCO will ensure that sufficient investment resources are appropriately allocated to
ensure that DPs are provided with:
*     adequate and appropriate compensation for assets, including land, lost;
*     compensation for the loss of business profits or opportunity; and
*     other measures to assist DPs to restore their livelihoods and regain and ideally
improve their pre-project living standards.
The following are basic principles that will govem the preparation and implementation of the
resettlement exercise:
*     all possible means will be used to ensure that no people are harmed in any way by
construction activities and project outcomes;
*     DPs will be informed about their options and rights pertaining to displacement and
resettlement (i.e. compensation and/or relocation) and about dispute resolution and
grievance mechanisms available to them;
*     resettlement planning and implementation activities will be undertaken with the
participation of DPs and other relevant stakeholders who will be continuously
consulted throughout the process. DPs will be offered choices among technically
and economically feasible resettlement altematives which they will be provided
information on;
*     resettlement entitlements will be provided in accordance with Tanzanian law and
procedures as a minimum but will include additional measures to meet WB
requirements, where appropriate. Resettlement measures will be as fair as possible
to all parties concemed and should minimise the long-term liability of TANESCO;

preference will be to provid. DPs with compensation in cash for loss of assets
(including land, housing an other structures), for loss of access to assets, for
damage caused to assets    nd for loss of business profits or income eaming
opportunities.  However, D0 s, particularly those who will lose their entire land
holdings, will be offered alt rnative land which they will be able to acquire and
develop with the cash compe sation received. These.replacement sites will have a
combination of productive po ential, location advantages, accessibility, availability of
services and other factors at least equivalent to the advantages of the old site and
will be as near as possible to he original site. Where compensation is in the form of
cash it will be provided on the basis of market value or replacement cost (whichever
is the highest) and will inclu e necessary additional costs incurred to achieve full
restoration;
where physical relocation is nvolved, eligible DPs will be provided with assistance,
such as moving allowances;
transitional support, such E  a disturbance allowance and an accommodation
allowance, will be provided I DPs to enable them to restore their livelihoods and
standards of living;
only DPs who meet agreed eligibility criteria will be entitled to compensation and
relocation measures. The Ick of legal rights to land occupied or used will not
preclude a DP from entitleme t to resettlement measures;
*     specific and additional assis ance, as necessary, will be provided for particularly
vulnerable people, i.e. widd ws, orphans, HIV/AIDS victims, elderly people and
handicapped people; and
*     resettlement measures (i.e  compensation and/or relocation) will be provided
promptly and pre-constructi n and actual construction work on each particular
affected site will not commen e until DPs have been satisfactorily resettled.

3     PREPARATION, REVIEW AND APPROVAL OF THE DETAILED
RESETTLEMENT ACTION PLAN
3.1   NUMBER OF RESETTLEMENT ACTION PLANS
For that part of the DTRP to be implemented in Dar es Salaam it is assumed that a single
detailed RAP will be prepared once more detailed planning information, including the exact
alignment and widths of ROWs, is available. However, it may be decided to undertake the
detailed design and/or construction of each of the proposed transmission lines, or sections of
each transmission line, separately or in phases as "sub-projects". If this is the case it may
prove more suitable to prepare individual RAPs for each transmission line or transmission
line section "sub-project" as detailed planning information becomes available.
The RAP (or RAPs) will be prepared, in the first instance, as a draft which will be reviewed
by the NEMC and the WB. Modifications and changes will be included in the final version of
the RAP.
3.2   ORGANISATIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES FOR RESETTLEMENT PLANNING
TANESCO will be responsible for preparing the detailed RAP and it is recommended that
TANESCO establishes a number of committees, units and groups to supervise, manage and
undertake the planning needed as part of the preparation of the RAP.  Suggested
committees, units and teams, together with their responsibilities and constituent
membership, are listed in Table 3. Figure 3 shows a possible structure and linkages for
resettlement planning.
The DTRP Co-ordinator in TANESCO will be the principal link between a Compensation
Steering Committee (CSC), TANESCO management (i.e. a Project Compensation
Committee (PCC)) and a Project Resettlement Unit (PRU). The PRU and the field teams will
work closely with DPs and other stakeholders, such as the local authorities (at municipal and
ward levels), local leaders, staff from the Ministry of Lands and Human Settlement
Development (MLHSD), the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) and other utilities, such as road,
railway and pipeline authorities. Staff from these agencies will be included in the field teams,
as necessary. It is probable that a particular person may be a member of more than one
committee, unit or team.
3.3   RESETTLEMENT PLANNING ACTIVITIES
A summary of activities required for the preparation of the RAP, together with the
responsible agencies, are listed in Table 4. Field work and the determination of entitlement
packages will mainly be undertaken by a Land Acquisition and Valuation Team (LAVT) with
support from a Social Issues Team (SIT) and a Dispute Resolution Team (DRT) who will
work together with the relevant Municipal Lands Officers and Valuers, Ward Executive
Officers and Sub-ward Chairmen.
A household survey and general socio-econom ic survey of the affected areas will be
necessary in order to provide inputs for resettlement planning and a baseline for future
monitoring and evaluation exercises.

The PRU will be responsible for preparing the RAP document following the 'suggested
structure of a detailed resettlement action plan" presented in Appendix 3 to this RPF. The
RAP will be an agreed draft action plan and commitment of all stakeholders for resolving the
displacement and resettlement (i.e. compensation and relocation) issues of the project. It
will thus form the basis for delivering entitlements due to individual DPs during
implementation, and serve as a guideline for resettlement implementation.
Among others, the RAP will describe:
*     the location of project infrastructure;
*     the land-take required;
*     the number and categories of affected properties and people;
*     information on the socio-economic circumstances of the affected people and
communities;
*     specific land, asset and other resettlement measure valuation standards to be
applied;

The PRU will submit the a draft of the RAP to the PCC in TANESCO which will review it
before submitting it to the CSC and the WB. Members of the CSC (including the NEMC) will
further review the RAP and provide the PCC and PRU with comments. A final RAP will then
be submitted to the CSC and WB for approval.
Consistent with the WB's Disclosure Policy, TANESCO will forward a letter to the WB,
authorsing the latter to disclose the document in the WB Infoshop. In Tanzania the RAP will
be made available in English and Kiswahili to the public for a period of six weeks in the
relevant municipal and ward council offices. This fact will be advertised in newspapers and
on radio stations commonly accessed by the local population. During this period members
of the public will be given the opportunity to respond to the RAP, in writing or verbally, to the
relevant municipal director or ward executive officer who will then pass on the responses to
TANESCO.
3.5    INDICATIVE SCHEDULE FOR PREPARATION OF THE RESETTLEMENT
ACTION PLAN
An indicative schedule for the preparation of the detailed RAP is provided in Figure 4. It is
estimated that preparation of the detailed RAP will be completed within a period of
approximately six months.

4     ESTIMATED POPULATION DISPLACEMENT AND LIKELY CATEGORIES
OF AFFECTED PEOPLE
4.1   LIKELY CATEGORIES OF AFFECTED PEOPLE
Nearly all the displacement in the project will be caused by the permanent acquisition of land
needed for ROWs for 132 kV transmission lines and other project infrastructure in Dar es
Salaam. As far as possible, existing public land and safety zones, such as road, railway and
other utility reserves, corridors and ROWs, will be used to decrease the amount of privately
owned or occupied land that will be needed and to minimise the resultant physical and
economic displacement of people. Nevertheless, some privately owned or occupied land will
need to be acquired. In addition, people currently using public land and safety zones may
be permanently or temporarily adversely affected by the use of such land for project
infrastructure.
Different categories of affected people will be more clearly defined during the preparation of
the detailed RAP. Possible categories of DPs are listed in Table 5. Most of those displaced
are expected to be people residing, carrying out business or income generating activities, in
one form or another, farming (e.g. cultivating) or undertaking a combination of these
activities on affected plots and other land. DPs may include individuals, families (i.e.
households), groups, companies, institutions or other organisational entities. It is expected
that residential properties and businesses will mainly be affected in the north-eastem and
central parts of the project areas which are mainly medium and high density built-up urban
areas of Dar es Salaam. Small crop and tree farming plots and mixed residential/farming
plots are more likely to be affected in the southern part of the project area which has a more
semi-rural or peri-urban character with lower population densities.
DPs may also be categorised according to the ownership, occupation or use rights that a DP
has over the land to be acquired. Property "owners" are considered to be those DPs that
have an occupancy right which is legally recognised in Tanzanian Law (i.e. the Land Act,
No. 4 of 1999). They include DPs with a granted right of occupancy, which is a long-term
lease from the Sate with title documents, or a deemed right of occupancy, which recognises
occupancy based on customary land allocations and norms (more common in nural areas)
and proven long-standing occupation of land (common in urban areas). People with a
deemed right of occupancy usually have no official supporting documentation.
Tenants are people renting land, houses or business premises from landlords. A tenant may
have a formal, registered lease contract with the landlord (more common in low and medium
density suburbs) or only an informal agreement with the landlord (more prevalent in high
density urban areas). Tenants sometimes, with the agreement of landlords, install fixed
assets which, essentially, belong to the tenant. On rented farmland standing crops and trees
usually belong to the tenant.
Many of the DPs are expected to be people occupying or using open access land, such as
public land or safety zones (e.g. road reserves, ROWs and land along streams and rivers),
for residential, business, farming (e.g. cultivation) and other purposes, without any officially
recognised ownership rights over the land that they are occupying or using. Their activities
are usually considered to be "illegal", even if officially tolerated, but may sometimes be
registered or licensed.. They may or may not have invested in permanent structures or
assets that are not easily movable (e.g. disused shipping containers) or in crops, trees and
other assets. DPs in this category may include, for example, informal settlers or "squatters'
living in shelters on affected land, people operating businesses at fixed locations on a
permanent on daily basis, itinerant street vendors and hawkers who travel from one area to
another and cultivators growing crops on affected public land

(Dar es Salaam, Moshi and Arusha)                               Revised January 2006
A further category of DP includes  ployees who lose their jobs as a result of families
having to move, businesses having to close or relocate or farming operations having to
cease or move elsewhere as a re ult of land acquisition for the project. The loss of
employment may be temporary wher the DP is likely to be re-employed once the affected
enterprise is re-established or wher the DP is able to find alternative employment fairly
easily. Employment loss may be m  e permanent in cases where it is unlikely that the DP
will be able to find alternative employ lent again or only after a long period.
People with relatives buried in graves located in ROWs may also be considered to be DPs if
the bodies have to be exhumed and the graves moved. However, it may not always be
necessary to move graves located ii the ROWs. People outside the proposed ROW may
also suffer inadvertent damage to Ian l and property during construction. Such losses will be
fully covered as for expected losses. It is expected that most of DPs will be:
.     residential property owners, vith recognised ownership rights but not necessarily
registered title, who will lose part of their plots and portions of houses and other
buildings;
.     mixed residential and busine s property owners, with recognised ownership rights
but not necessarily registered title, who will lose part of their plots and portions of
houses, business premises ar J other buildings;
.     residential and business ten; nts (mainly informal) living or operating on partially
affected land who will lose the ir accommodation and business premises;
.     vendors (e.g. kiosks), servicl providers, artisans and cultivators encroaching on
public land (e.g. road reserve. ), with or without fixed structures; and
.     itinerant (e.g. daily) traders, Eservice providers and artisans operating on public land
with no or easily movable ass ts (e.g. tables).
4.2   POSSIBLE LOSSES AND IM PACTS
The nature of losses and impacts anc the extent to which a DP is adversely affected will vary
from one DP to another. Physical los es include the loss of land or access to land, the loss
of infrastructure and, where applicabl , title or the right of occupancy. Possible impacts on a
DP include the need to relocate the  P, business or farming operation, the loss of the value
of land (for property owners), the oss of the value of buildings and fixed assets, the
temporary loss of accommodation while residents rebuild houses or find altemative
accommodation, the temporary loss f income or profit while businesses re-establish their
business operations, the temporary loss of food sources and income while farmers re-
establish farming operations, the co ts incurred for moving fumiture, equipment, business
inventory and other assets to tei .porary or new  accommodation and, for affected
employees, the temporary or permal ent loss of income. Table 6 lists possible impacts on
the various categories of DPs consid ed in the RPF.
Minor impacts will occur when, for e ample, only a small part of a plot or occupied land is
acquired (i.e. partial loss), without the need to demolish major structures or abandon land
under productive use (either for agricu Iture or for outdoor business activities) and the DP can
continue to live or operate on the res ual or non-acquired part of the property without much
disturbance. Since it is expected thal new transmission lines will be routed alongside roads
as much as possible and that only r arrow roadside portions of properties will need to be
acquired, this situation is expected to revail.

Distribution and Transmission Rehabilitation Pr ect     Resettlement Policy Framework
(Dar es Salaam, Moshi and Arusha)                             Revised January 2006
Moderate impacts will occur when a  P loses a part of his or her productive land and
structures (i.e. partial loss) but can Wrntinue to occupy the remaining part of the same
structures or use the remaining part of he productive land. During the spot valuation survey
undertaken in August 2005 it was obse ved that, in most cases, the affected portion of a plot
contained a boundary wall or extens ons erected for business purposes (e.g. a kiosk).
These extensions often abut the mai house or building, boundary wall or are outright,
stand-alone, containerised shelters. Tl erefore, in most cases, the main house or building on
a plot will be unaffected and there will be no need for physical relocation of people. Where
there is, it is expected that most DPs Xlill opt to rearrange or reconstruct houses and rooms
within the boundaries of the unaffectec portion of the plot. The same will also probably hold
true for businesses, such as those ver ing their goods within the road reserve from a kiosk
attached to a boundary wall or the roac $ide edge of a house.
More severe impacts will occur where ; 3 part of the land is acquired (i.e. partial loss) but the
main residence, structures or busines: or farming operation is on the acquired part of the
property. As long as the residual remel ns large enough and viable for continued use the DP
may be able to rebuild or re-establish $tructures and operations on the residual. In such a
situation the DP must physically reloc te to the residual part of the property and may incur
temporary losses of accommodation income or food sources and may incur moving
expenses, even if only to cover a short Jistance.
Very severe impacts will occur when tt l whole landholding has to be acquired or, when only
a portion of the landholding has to be acquired, the residual part is rendered non-viable for
continued use in its present form. The DP will have to physically relocate to a completely
new location and may possibly incur more severe temporary losses of accommodation,
income and/or food sources and will in ur greater relocation costs. The DP will also lose the
use and value of the non-viable resi ual portion of the land and/or structures so that, in
terms of the RPF, the entire plot wi be considered to be affected (i.e. total loss) and
acquired. Resettlement measures will, therefore apply to the entire plot and assets.
Some tenants may be offered immes ate alternative accommodation or facilities by their
landlords on the residual or non-ac iuired part of an affected property. However, it is
expected that most will have to locate replacement accommodation or facilities elsewhere.
Affected tenants may incur moving e penses and business tenants may temporarily lose
income or profit while re-establishin  elsewhere if measures to prevent this are not
implemented.
Informal occupants of public land an : safety zones, without recognised land rights, may
suffer similar impacts to those incurrer by property owners, depending on the nature and
size of the affected operation and los es. It is, however, expected that many DPs in this
category will suffer only very minor di splacement, if at all, or only temporary displacement
since it is expected that many will be able to continue their activities within the ROWs after
constnuction of the transmission lines a id even during the construction of the lines.
4.3   ESTIMATED NUMBER OF AF ECTED PROPERTIES
The exact number of properties to be affected by the acquisition of land for ROWs for the
proposed 132 kV transmission lines wi be determined during the preparation of the detailed
RAP once the exact alignment and  , idths of the respective ROWs have been confirmed.
The most recent estimate of the numt er of potentially affected properties has been derived
from the spot enumeration and valuati n exercise carried out for TANESCO in August 2005
(see Appendix 1 of the RPF). Table 7 shows that an estimated 1 788 properties will be
affected by the acquisition of land for tl e project.

not accurately known, an estimate of the number of DP has been included in Table 7 which
shows that around 8 940 people may be displaced in one form or another.. This estimate
was provided by the property valuation consulting firms and is based on applying an average
'household" size of five persons to each affected property. The rough estimate dose not
include tenants and informal land occupiers and users who do not work from fixed
structures.

5      LEGAL AND INSTITUTION       L FRAMEWORK FOR RESETTLEMENT
5.1    LEGAL FRAMEWORK
5.1.1  Land ownership, transfer ar I acquisition for public purposes
Land issues in mainland Tanzania ar mainly governed by the Land Act (No. 4 of 1999), the
Village Land Act (No. 5 of 1999) and the Land Acquisition Act (No. 47 of 1967). All land in
Tanzania is public land and remains iested in the President as trustee for and behalf of the
citizens of Tanzania. Land in Tanzar ia is classified into three categories, i.e.: General Land;
Village Land; and Reserved Land.   ocio-economic activities are permitted in General or
Village Land but not in Reserved Lan which is allocated to national parks, wildlife reserves,
forest reserves and other protected areas. Land to be acquired by the DTRP in Dar es
Salaam is predominantly urban Gene al Land.
Tanzania has a dual system of la d tenure that recognises both statutory rights and
customary rights.  Firstly, land m y be granted by leasehold as a "granted right of
occupancy" for varying periods for ul. to 99 years (renewable) by the Lands Commissioner.
In urban and peri-urban areas peopld who have acquired land or have been occupying land
as a primary residence for long perio s of time without having obtained a right of occupancy
are considered to be legal occupant (i.e. recognised long-standing occupancy)16. This is
the situation in many areas affected by the proposed transmission lines in Dar es Salaam.
Secondly, in rural and peri-urban ares people and communities using and occupying land in
terms of customary norms are co sidered to have customary rights of occupancy or
'deemed" right of occupancy. This situation may exist in parts of Dar es Salaam to be
affected by the project. Officially  cognised tenure rights may be held by individuals,
associations of two or more people a, d by communities.
The Land Act recognises that an inte est in or right over land has value and that such value
is taken into consideration in any tr nsaction affecting the interest. Granted and deemed
(e.g. customary) rights of occupanc  may be transferred between parties and an active
market for land is growing, particular y in the urban areas of the country, with market prices
reflecting the value of the land and ir lprovements. The land market is much weaker in rural
areas. Land without un-exhausted i nprovements, in general, is deemed to have no value
and may not be sold.
Land acquisition in Tanzania is govI rned by the Land Acquisition Act which is the 'mother
act' when it comes to land acquisi on"7. The Act bestows powers on the President to
acquire land for any estate or term vhere such land is needed for any public purpose. It
defines the circumstances in which F ,blic interest could be invoked, such as, among others,
for exclusive State use or for public use. The Land Act (Section 151) also empowers the
Minister of Lands and Human Settler lent Development to create wayleaves or ROWs for the
benefit of the Govemment, a local a ithority, a public authority (such as TANESCO) or any
corporate body. In terms of Section 45 the President may revoke a right of occupancy if, in
his opinion, it is in the public interest o do so. Section 3 of the Land Act requires the State:
'To pay full, fair and prompt compr nsation to any person whose right of occupancy or
recognized long standing occupatic n or customary use of land is revoked or otherwise
16 Local authorities may also issue 'residenti licences" to long-standing residents.
" Provisions related to land acquisition in thE Town and Country Planning Ordinance (Cap 378) are subservient
to the provision in the Land Acquisition Ac and the more recent Land Act has not amended any of the land
acquisition provisions in the Land Acquisition ct.

interfered with to their detriment by the State under this Act or is acquired under the Land
Acquisition Act."
5.1.2 Resettlement entitlements for displaced persons considered to be eligible in
terms of national legislation
According to the laws relating to land administration in Tanzania entitlement for payment of
compensation is essentially based on the right of ownership. The legislation only makes
provision for payment of compensation to property "owners" holding a granted right of
occupancy or a deemed right of occupancy based on customary tenure or proven long-
standing occupation of land.  For land acquired in terms of Section 3 of the Land Act
compensation is to be paid to such eligible DPs according to individual circumstances and,
as elaborated on in the Land (Assessment of the Value of Land for Compensation)
Regulations, 2001, includes:
*     the market value of real property: Compensation may be claimed for the value of
land and un-exhausted improvements (e.g. acquired or damaged buildings, crops,
trees and other fixed assets) on the land being "legally" occupied, No compensation
is to be awarded for any land that is vacant ground or is to be limited to the value of
un-exhausted improvement of the land in cases where the development of the land is
deemed inadequate. However, in a number of precedents compensation has, in fact,
been awarded for vacant land that has been acquired in the public interest. Cash
compensation is intended to provide DPs with sufficient resources to acquire
replacement land or property and, where necessary, construct replacement houses
and other infrastructure;
*     a disturbance allowance: All eligible DPs compensated for the loss of land are to
receive an additional allowance18 to assist alleviate any suffering, hardship and other
impacts experienced during the process of acquisition, demolition and, where
applicable, relocation that are not specifically covered by other forms of
compensation.;
*     a transport allowance: An allowance'9 may be paid to assist eligible DPs to move
their fumiture and goods from the acquired property to an altemative or replacement
property. The intent is that it should only be paid to DPs required to vacate houses
or business premises and physically move property and the regulations are not clear
whether it has to be paid when only structures, such as boundary walls, are affected.
In some past cases in Tanzania it has been paid to all affected property owners,
irrespective of whether they have to relocate or not. The allowance is not paid for
unoccupied land;
*     loss of accommodation or profits: DPs may also be paid an allowance20 to cover the
cost of renting a similar house (or part of house) to that foregone while the affected
person is either acquiring a replacement residence or is building a new house. The
law is unclear as to whether a DP may be paid the allowance when only some or
parts of all structures are affected and the DP can remain on the residual part of the
property. For the RPF it is assumed that it will be paid in respect of affected parts of
housing units regardless of whether the DP must relocate to a new location or not.
18 The disturbance allowance is calculated by multiplying the actual value of the land by the average percentage
rate of interest (currently 5%) offered by commercial banks on fixed deposits for 12 months..
19 The transport allowance is to be calculated as the cost of hauling 12 tonnes over a distance not exceeding 20
km by road or rail.
20 The accommodation allowance is equivalent to the monthly rent of the acquired property over a 36 months
period.

(Dar es Salaam, Moshi and Arusha)                               Revised January 2006
For businesses that have to b vacated or abandoned an allowance2' may be paid to
DPs to compensate them for any loss of profit that may occur during the period that
the DP is rebuilding premises and re-establishing the affected business. In theory
lost business income could 4 Iso include lost rental income and lost income from
farming operations. Accomn odation allowances and loss of profit compensation
should not be paid concurrent in respect of the same property and may not be paid
in respect of unoccupied land;
.     the cost of acquiring or getting the subject land; and
.     any other cost loss or capital xpenditure incurred to the development of the subject
land.
Compensation has to be paid promp ily, within six months of the valuation of the property,
and if the payment of compensation i delayed for any time after this period interest has to
be paid on the amount of compensat on assessed until the date when the compensation is
paid.
These entitlements for DPs consi, ered eligible under Tanzanian law are largely in
conformity with the requirements of NB OP 4.12 which states that DPs with formal legal
rights to land (including customary E id traditional rights recognised under the laws of the
country) and those DPs who do no have formal legal rights to the land at the time the
census begins but have a claim to such land or assets (provided that such claims are
recognised under the law of the cour try or become recognised through a process identified
in the resettlement plan) are to be prc tided with:
* compensation for the land they ic ;e and other assistance in accordance with the Policy;
such as moving allowances, re acement land, where appropriate, and assistance to
help them to restore their livelihoc s over a transitional period; and
. compensation for the loss of asse s other than land.
In terms of the 2001 Land (Compens ition Claims) Regulations compensation has, normally,
to take the form of monetary comper ation but may, at the option of the Govemment, take
the form of all or a combination of an! of the following:
.     a plot of land of comparable q iality, extent and productive potential to the land lost;
.     a building or buildings of co parable quality, extent and use comparable to the
building or buildings lost;
•     plants and seedlings; and
.     regular supplies of grain and other basic foodstuffs for a specified time.
It is preferred practice in Tanzania, p rticularly in urban areas, to provide DPs with monetary
compensation to allow them to buy imilar replacement land and either buy or construct
replacement houses and structures. "his conforms with WB OP 4.12 which, whiie preferring
that DPs be provided with replacen ient land, houses, housing sites and productive land
when physical relocation is necessa , particularly in rural areas or where land markets are
weak, recognises that cash compe isation may be appropriate in certain circumstances.
These include situations where: live hoods are land-based but the land taken is a small
fraction of the total landholding of l DP and the residual is economically viable; active
markets for land, housing and labour txist; or livelihoods are not land-based.
However, the RPF makes provision f : r DPs, particularly those losing all or most of their land
and assets, to be able to purchase, ith the compensation received, replacement plots in
21 The loss of profits allowance is supposed 1 be assessed by establishing net monthly profit, as evidenced by
audited accounts, and paid to cover a period f 36 months.

resettlement areas made available and prepared by the project, through the respective
municipal authorities. Therefore, to ensure that all DPs eligible in terms of the law are
treated equally, all eligible DPs will receive compensation and allowance packages as fixed
in standard procedures during the valuation process and remain completely independent in
their choice of further residence.
5.1.3 Resettlement entitlements for displaced persons not considered to be eligible
in terms of national legislation
Tanzanian law does not specifically recognise tenants, informal occupiers and users of
public land and safety zones (e.g. squatters, informal businesses and encroachers) and
employees (i.e. DPs without recognised rights of occupancy) as being eligible for
compensation22. However, such DPs may lose access to land and buildings and may lose
fixed assets that belong to them. They may have to physically relocate, lose shelter while
resettling elsewhere, lose business opportunity and profits while re-establishing elsewhere
and incur possible relocation and other expenses. While WB OP 4.12 recognises that
people who have no recognisable legal right or claim to the land that they are occupying may
not be eligible for compensation for the land taken, they are entitled to some form of
assistance, as appropriate, including:
* resettlement assistance in lieu of the land that they occupy, such as replacement land,
other assets, cash, employment, and others assistance, as necessary, to achieve the
objectives of the Policy; and
* compensation for the loss of assets other than land.
In order to meet the requirements of WB OP 4.12 the RPF follows the principle that all DPs
will be treated fairly and equally, regardless of whether or not they have recognised
occupancy rights to the land taken, provided that they occupy the affected land prior to a cut-
off date to be established during the preparation of the detailed RAP. Thus DPs without
recognised occupancy rights may be entitled to receive similar resettlement packages to
DPs with occupancy rights recognised under Tanzanian law, depending on the nature and
extent of losses and impacts suffered.
DPs without recognised land rights will generally be eligible for cash compensation for fixed
assets and improvements belonging to them and for transitional support, relocation
assistance and other measures as necessary and appropriate.    Informal or 'illegal"
occupants of public land and safety zones will not be entitled to cash compensation for the
land that they permanently lose but may be entitled to an offer of nearby replacement land or
sites by the project, through the respective municipal authorities. To ensure that such DPs
do not become homeless or remain without alternative vending sites altemative sites will be
made well in advance of their eviction from affected land. This will be to ensure that they
have time to build replacement houses and structures, if necessary, on the replacement
sites.
Informal occupants who can be permitted to continue to use affected land and sites during
construction, or quickly return to such sites after construction, as well as itinerant street
traders and vendors, will not be entitled to an offer of replacement land or sites at a new
location.
22 The case for not compensating tenants is based on the fact that a landlord may, at any time and for good
reason, give a tenant three month's notice to vacate a rented property, as required by Tanzanian law, and not be
iiable to pay compensation to the tenant. Acquisition of rented property for public purposes is, therefore.
considered to be a valid reason to terminate a lease agreement.

Employees, losing employment tern orarily may be entitled to transitional support while
those losing jobs permanently or for   very long period may be entitled to transitional support
plus other restoration support.
Landlords may be entitled to relocat n assistance (e.g. transport allowances) in respect of
affected property. They would nor ally be expected to pass this onto their tenants.          In
practice this is be difficult to enforce and would be inadequate in situations where there is
more than one tenant on an affec       d property.   The RPF makes provision for affected
tenants to be treated as individual c ses for relocation assistance, transitional support and
other resettlement measures.       To ensure that tenants have time to locate altemative
accommodation or premises, landl rds will be required to give tenants three months'
advance notice to vacate the rented; ccommodation or premises23.
5.1.4 Valuation of acquired land, tructures and assets
The 2001 Land (Assessment of the I alue of Land for Compensation) Regulations state that
the basis for assessment of the value of land and un-exhausted improvements for
compensation purposes shall be the market value of the land. The market value24 is to be
arrived at by the use of:
*      the comparative method, evid nced by actual recent sales of similar properties;
*      the income approach; or
*      the replacement cost25 appri ach where the property is of special nature and not
saleable.
Market prices will be used as the aluation must meet the MLHSD requirements if the
valuation is to be approved and n t constrain the implementation of the project. This
approach is generally consistent wi     that recommended by WB OP 4.12 for determining
compensation for urban land26 and fe houses and other structures27.
5.1.5 Relocation of graves
The Land Acquisition Act specificall refers to certain compensation requirements for land
that was, prior to its acquisition, use  as a cemetery or crematorium. The Graves Removal
Act (1968) also stipulates that comp nsation should be paid to the relatives of the deceased
23 Most tenancies in the unplanned settlemer s are informal (i.e. they carry no documentation). Tenants pay their
rents monthly or for longer periods (up to 12 months) and can move out any time they want. In those instances
where the tenant has paid rent in advance ( .g. for the coming year) the landlord will be required to refund the
amount of the unused advance payment.
24 Market value may be defined as the highe  price in terms of money that a property would be expected to bring
in a competitive and open market under cor ions requisite for a fair sale.
25 Replacement cost is the cost of putting  p an structure equivalent to the existing structure at the time of
valuation and making allowances for age. st e of repair and economic obsolescence.
26 For urban land, compensation may be det mined on the basis of the pre-displacement market value of land of
equal size and area, with similar or improved ublic infrastructure facilities and services and located in the vicinity
of the affected land, plus the cost of any regi ration and transfer taxes.
27 For houses and other structures, WB OP d 12 defines compensation as being the market cost of the materials
to build a replacement structure with an are, and quality similar to or better than those of the affected structure.
or to repair a partially affected structure, pi  the cost of transporting building materials to the construction site,
plus the use of any labour and contractor's fe s, plus the cost of any registration and transfer taxes. Depreciaton
of the asset and the value of salvage materiz are not taken into account.

to meet the costs of exhumation, burial elsewhere and ritual expenses when graves have to
be relocated28.
5.1.6 Responsibility for paying compensation
According to the Land Act (Section 156) the duty to pay compensation when ROWs are
created lies with the Government department, local or public authority or corporate body that
applies for their creation. In this case this refers to TANESCO. In addition the affected
people's involvement is strongly emphasised. In this respect the project proponent (i.e.
TANESCO) is obliged to involve the affected people in every aspect of acquiring their land
and ensure that it pays fair and prompt compensation and at market value prices.
5.2   INSTITUTIONAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE FRAMEWORK
There is no single agency in Tanzania that is responsible for planning and providing
resettlement and compensation in cases where people are involuntarily displaced by
development projects. However, it is accepted practice that the developer (i.e. in this case
TANESCO) assumes full responsibility for the delivery of entitlements even though a number
of other actors may be involved.
5.2.1 The Tanzania Electricity Supply Company Limited
TANESCO is a public company that was established in 1964 and is wholly owned by the
GOT. The Ministry of Energy and Minerals regulates the operations of TANESCO. The
company's core business is generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity to
the Tanzania mainland and bulk power supply to the island of Zanzibar. The current Board
of Directors comprises of nine members from the Govemment, public and private sectors.
Apart from the Chairman, all members of the Board of Directors are appointed by the
Minister for Energy and Minerals. The Chairman is appointed by the President of the United
Republic of Tanzania.
TANESCO is currently managed by a Managing Director and General Managers (for
Transmission, Generation, Distribution and Supporting Services).  The company is
organised into a number of directorates covering: Operations; Finance; Privatisation;
Systems Control and Transmission; Corporate Planning and Research; Human Resources;
Security; Information Systems; Internal Audit; Projects; Generation and Public Relations.
The Directors of Corporate Planning and Research and of Projects are the most actively
involved in the planning of projects and in dealing with environmental and social issues.
They will play a significant role in the preparation and implementation of the RAP.
There are a total of 23 regional offices. Most of the activities at the regional offices are co-
ordinated by the Directorate of Operations. The main duties carried out in the regions
include billing and revenue collection, construction and maintenance of distribution lines,
installation of new service lines and attending to emergency cases from customers.
5.2.2 Local government
Tanzania is divided into 26 regions and each region is divided into a number of districts,
although in many urban areas, such as Dar es Salaam, these districts are constituted as
municipalities. Part of the project will be implemented in the three districts/municipalities of
Dar es Salaam region, i.e. Kinondoni, llala and Temeke. The municipalities are govemed by
28 Standard compensation rates are determined by the relevant municipalities which also provide altemative
burial sites.

municipal councils and  are admi istered  by Municipal Directors who co-ordinate
administrative and technical service  ersonnel at the municipal level. There is a District
Commissioner in each of the three n lnicipalities who is responsible for co-ordinating and
managing central government affairs 9. In Dar es Salaam a city council has also been
established which deals with issues cc lmon to the three municipalities in the city.
Each municipality is divided into a - umber of wards governed by ward councils.  For
administrative purposes the ward is h aded by a Ward Executive Officer. Ward authorities
have authority and responsibility for i iplementing, overseeing and monitoring development
activities. In urban areas such as Di l es Salaam the wards are further subdivided into a
number of sub-wards or "streets" knov n as mtaa.
The institutional framework is intende to facilitate effective planning and implementation of
various activities on the ground by  suring that there are both top-down and bottom-up
communication channels during plan ng and implementation of development programmes,
such as the DTRP. In cases of co  icting interests between stakeholders the Municipal
Director's office often plays the role ol arbitrator before the matter is taken to the appropriate
courts of law.
5.2.3 Ministry of Lands and Huma Settlement Development
The Ministry of Lands and Human iettlement Development (MLHSD) is responsible for
policy, regulation and co-ordination natters pertaining to land in Tanzania. The ministry
administers the Land Acquisition Ac , the Land Act and the Village Land Act and the
Commissioner of Lands administers most issues to do with land allocation, acquisition,
registration and land management in 3eneral. All instances of acquisition of land for public
purposes and the need for resettlen ent and/or compensation have to be referred to the
Commissioner.
Lands offices have been establishec at the municipal levels. Personnel relevant to land
affairs, resettlement and compensati i include Land Officers, Land Surveyors, Valuers and
Town Planners.  Their day-to-day York is co-ordinated at the municipal level by the
municipal planner. They are support d by similar technical staff at the headquarters of the
MLHSD. MLHSD has developed an approved list of crop compensation rates for the three
Dar es Salaam municipalities.
5.2.4  National Environment Mana ement Council
The Environmental Management Act No. 20 of 2004) provides for the legal and institutional
framework for the sustainable manag ment of the environment. Among others, it:
.     outlines principles for mana  ment, impact and risk assessment, prevention and
control of pollution, waste  nagement, environmental quality standards, public
participation and enforcement
•     provides the legal basis for  plementation of economic and financial incentives
designed to influence behavi r to ensure sustainable use of natural resources and
protection of the environment;
.     provides for the implementatio of the National Environmental Policy;
.     repeals the National Environm pntal Management Act (1983); and
.     provides for the continued  xistence of the National Environment Management
Council (NEMC).
29 There are also officers of regional commis oners with a small number of technical staff. However, most staff
who, until recently, used to be based at the re ional level have been transferred to the districts.

The NEMC is responsible for advising the government on issues of environment, including
social issues. In terms of its mandate the NEMC will review the ESIA, RPF and RAP
documents and, if acceptable to the NEMC, recommend the Minister responsible for
environment to issue an environmental permit to TANESCO. The environmental permit is
required before the project can be implemented.

6     ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FR RESETTLEMENT MEASURES
6.1   CUT-OFF DATES FOR ELIGlI31LITY FOR BENEFITS
All DPs who suffer losses and incu negative impacts due to the acquisition of land for
ROWs for project infrastructure will  considered to be eligible for benefits, the nature and
extent of which will depend on the ty e and extent of losses suffered and negative impacts
incurred. Such DPs will be conside id to be eligible regardless of their tenure status with
respect to the land that they own, oc upy or use, provided that they own, occupy or use the
affected land prior to a cut-off date  The establishment of a cut-off date is required to
prevent opportunistic invasions onto the affected land, thereby posing a major risk to the
project.
The cut-off date for eligibility to entitl ment to benefits will be when official notices (i.e. Land
Form No. 69) are served on DPs du ing the preparation of the detailed RAP, by the LAVT
working together with the respectiv  Municipal Lands Officers and Ward and Sub-ward
leaders, and when a census of DPs nd affected land and assets commences. However,
people who consider themselves to  eligible but who are not identified as being eligible at
the time of the census will have the ri ht to appeal to the Municipal Director.
6.2   POSSIBLE CATEGORIES 0      DISPLACED PERSONS ELIGIBLE FOR
COMPENSATION
Table 8 lists the broad categories of DPs who will be eligible to receive compensation and
other resettlement measures for th ! loss of land and fixed assets or improvements to
property. Where land and building are occupied by more than one household or tenant
each household or tenant will be teated individually and compensated as such. DPs
suffering temporary losses may a so be eligible for benefits, depending on particular
circumstances and the nature and s e of losses and impacts. In addition to DPs identified
during the census, people who suff r inadvertent losses or damage, outside the acquired
land, caused by construction teams vill be entitled to claim compensation from contractors in
accordance with the resettlement me sures provided for in this RPF and the detailed RAP to
be prepared subsequently.
6.3   ELIGIBILITY FOR DIFFERE T TYPES OF RESETTLEMENT MEASURES
6.3.1 Compensation for land and ixed assets
Recognised property owners, inclu ing those with customary or proven long-standing
occupancy rights, will be provided wh cash compensation, at appropriate market rates, for
that part of their land or those struct res acquired by the project. Compensation may cover
total or partial losses.
Tenants and informal settlers, busin sses and cultivators on public land are not eligible for
compensation for land. They will, h ever be paid cash compensation for any fixed assets
that they have installed and belong t them.
Itinerant street vendors and hawkers without any fixed assets will, in general, not be eligible
for compensation measures since t ey are constantly mobile and will be bale to continue
business in the immediate vicinity of he ROWs.

6.3.2  Option for certain DPs to rec ive or acquire replacement land provided by the
project
It is expected that many displaced re ognised property owners will lose only small strips of
land and that most of their property v ill be unaffected. In other cases DPs will be able and
willing to re-arrange the residual (n n-acquired) parts of their plots and relocate to the
residual where they will reconstruct at ected houses and buildings.
However, property owners who lose all their landholding, most of their landholding (e.g.
generally greater than 50%30) or lose only a part of their landholding but the residual part is
no longer viable for continued use w I be offered replacement land by the project at a new
site. The DP will be able to acquire he land using the cash compensation received for the
acquired land. A DP will not be comr elled to accept replacement land and may opt to retain
and use the cash compensation as I e or she pleases, such as for purchasing altemative
land at a location of his or her choice.
Resettlement sites will be, planned, d veloped and allocated by the respective municipalities
with financial assistance from the pro ict. The replacement sites will be equivalent or better
in terms of size, nature, service pro\ sion and productive capacity to the land taken. Any
host communities owning, occupying lr using land and infrastructure in areas to be acquired
for resettlement purposes will be co pensated for any losses and adverse impacts in the
same manner as DPs relocated form ROWs acquired for the project.
In a few cases some informal occul iers and users of public land and safety zones who
generally live, carry out income generating activities or cultivate encroached land
permanently or more or less permane tly at a fixed spot may permanently lose access to the
land that they occupy. Such DPs I, il be offered replacement residential land or vending
sites, preferably close by, in areas p vided by the relevant municipalities. DPs will not be
obliged to accept the replacement sit! s and may move elsewhere if they chose.
Encroachers who own or occupy o er viable landholdings which are considered to be
sufficient to meet livelihood needs w , as a rule, not be offered replacement sites but may
still be eligible for compensation for i estments in structures or crops on the acquired land.
6.3.3 Option for certain DPs to rei eive compensation for residual land and
structures
Cash compensation for land and infrc structure belonging to recognised property owners will
normally only cover those parts of th: land (e.g. plot) and infrastructure actually affected by
the creation of the ROWs. Howevet such DPs who lose most of their land and/or other
property (e.g. more than 50%) or wh re the residual part of the plot or building is no longer
30 The percentage used to determine whett pr most of a landholding is acquired will vary from one case to
another, depending on the size, use and exist og development of the holding.

viable for continued use will have an option to require the project to acquire the residual. In
effect, this will be equivalent to total acquisition of the affected land and/or buildings.
6.3.4 Transitional allowances
A disturbance allowance will be paid to recognised property owners as transitional
assistance. Tenants and other opportunistic occupiers of public land will be paid a small
disruption allowance in lieu of a disturbance allowance.
Recognised property owners will be provided with allowances to enable them to cover the
costs of renting temporary residential accommodation and to compensate for temporary
losses of business income while they are re-establishing their place of residence or business
operations. Potential losses of farm income and food sources will be covered by cash
compensation for crops and trees, determined at market values using the earnings
approach. Wherever possible DPs will be encouraged to harvest crops before acquisition or
construction commences. Informal settlers (squatters), if any, and businesses on public land
and safety zones may need to build new residential or business structures or shelters at a
new location provided by the project. They will be provided with a loss of eamings
allowance, to compensate for lost wages or income while building the replacement
structures.
6.3.5 Avoiding temporary accommodation and income losses
Landlords will be required to give three months' notice to tenants to provide them with
sufficient time to find and relocate to alternative accommodation, business premises or
rented farmland. It is therefore unlikely that tenants will suffer much, if any, temporary loss
of shelter, business income or farm income and/or food sources since they will have time to
re-establish themselves before land acquisition and demolition of affected property is
affected. They will, however, be provided with free project assistance to locate altemative
accommodation or premises and obtain refunds of any advance payments from landlords.
Informal settlers and business enterprises will be required to construct and occupy
replacement houses, shelters and vending structures (if any) on replacement sites before
construction commences. This will largely offset potential temporary losses of shelter and
business income. However, they will be provided with a loss of eamings allowance while
constructing the replacement shelters and business structures.
6.3.6 Relocation allowances
Property owners who are required to relocate their activities and move furniture, equipment,
business inventory and other movable assets to a new location, even if only over a very
short distance, will be entitled to a transport allowance. Tenants and informal settlers,
businesses and cultivators will be provided with free transport by the project to move their
goods where this is deemed to be necessary.
6.3.7 Permanent employees
Depending on individual circumstances permanent employees who lose their jobs, either on
a temporary or permanent basis, due to the acquisition of land and infrastructure for the
project, may be eligible for a loss of eamings allowance.

6.3.8 Specially vulnerable people
Both the GOT and WB OP 4.12 recc gnise that some DPs may be specially vulnerable and
require special assistance. They irn lude the poor, widows, single mothers, child-headed
households, handicapped people, F VAIDS victims and the elderly. It is proposed that
vulnerable DPs identified during t e census be provided with a special vulnerability
allowance (e.g. 5% of compensation ayable) and other assistance as determined on a case
by case basis to help them restore ar d improve their livelihoods.
Informal settlers (squatters) may als be considered to be vulnerable. Relocating them to
altemative sites and providing only c  pensation for their existing shelters to enable them to
reconstruct similar shelters will on  maintain their vulnerable status.  It is, therefore,
proposed that they be included ir on-going municipal housing programmes aimed at
alleviating suffering and poverty amo g the poor, through which they may be allocated a free
plot and house or at least provided w h assistance to improve their habitation.
6.3.9 Use of right of ways during nd after construction
TANESCO will, at its discretion, allo certain activities to continue to be undertaken within
ROWs during and after construction of transmission lines and other project infrastructure.
These may include, for example, C towing low crops (but not tall crops and trees) and
informal vending from no or very sn al structures. This will minimise the displacement of
many potential DPs, particularly str et and pavement vendors. It is recommended that
TANESCO introduces some form of ermit or tenancy system to people using the ROWs as
a measure of control.

(Dar es Salaam, Moshi and Arusha)                             Revised January 2006
7     METHODS OF VALUING AFFECTED ASSETS
7.1   VALUE OF COMPENSATION AND OTHER RESETTLEMENT ENTITLEMENTS
The value of land and assets to be compensated and the amounts to be paid for other
resettlement measures will be based on the prevailing Tanzanian legislation for land
acquisition and compensation, i.e. the 1999 Land Act and 2001 Land Regulations. Values
for resettlement measures included to meet the requirements of WB OP 4.12 will be
determined separately.
For acquired land compensation will be based on rates for the market value of the land,
determined using the direct comparison method, as evidenced by actual recent offerings and
sales of similar properties in the area, in terms of condition, quality, age, location, timing,
financing terms and the motivation of sellers and buyers. In practice, the market value of
land in urban areas generally includes the value of un-exhausted improvements on the land,
including buildings, structures, other fixed assets (e.g. boundary walls and garden
vegetation), land clearing and land preparation or development. Average values per square
metre for land and structures or for specific items will be determined for specific areas and
agreed with the respective Municipal Valuer. These will be applied to each affected property
and adjusted for discemable differences.
For fixed assets not directly associated with land ownership, such as those belonging to
tenants and informal occupiers of public land, the market value or replacement cost will be
used, whichever is the higher.
Compensation for crops and trees will be based on the market value, determined using the
income approach. This is based on estimating the production capacity of an average tended
crop that is normally found in the area. The net annual value of crop production is then
determined and capitalised at the average bank lending rate of banks in the country. Crop
compensation rates for a variety of crops, trees and other plants are determined by the
MLHSD. Adjustments may have to be made for local and crop specific differences.
According to the Land (Assessment of the Value of Land for Compensation) Regulations,
2001, the disturbance allowance for registered property owners is calculated by multiplying
the assessed value of the affected land (not assets) by the average percentage rate of
interest offered by commercial banks on twelve month fixed deposits (currently 5%). As the
disruption allowance for tenants and occupiers of public land cannot be calculated as a
percentage of the value of land compensated for (since such DPs are not eligible for
compensation for land loss) a flat rate cash payment of TSh 100 000 is proposed in the RPF
but may be adjusted during the preparation of the RAP. Individual variations may be
appropriate.
The accommodation allowance to be paid to residential property owners, where eligible, will
be calculated by multiplying the assessed monthly market rent for the affected house or part
of house by 36 months. The monthly market rent for the building is based on standard
market rentals for the affected building in the area in which it is located.
The loss of profit allowance to be paid to property owners running business on acquired land
is calculated as the net monthly profit of the business carried out on the affected property, as
evidenced by audited accounts, where available, multiplied by 36 months. Loss of income or
food sources in respect of small plot farmers will be covered by cash compensation paid for
standing crops and trees.

Distribution and Transmission Rehabilitation P oject    Resettlement Policy Framework
(Dar es Salaam, Moshi and Arusha)                             Revised January 2006
Many small businesses do not have proper records and municipal trade records may be
used to estimate net monthly profit On some occasions it may be easier and more
appropriate to substitute the loss of rofits allowance with an accommodation allowance in
respect of the affected business buil ings and structures (i.e. by multiplying the assessed
monthly market rent for the affected  Jilding by 36 months).
For the loss of earnings allowance to e paid to informal settlers (squatters) and businesses
required to re-establish their resid nce or businesses on replacement sites the RPF
proposes a cash payment equivalent o the minimum monthly wage for one month.
In terms of the Land Regulations, 001, the transport allowance for displaced property
owners who are required to move  eir goods, business inventory, equipment and other
movable assets is calculated as the prevailing cost of road haulage of 12 t of goods for a
distance of 20 km. Standard rates a determined by each of the respective municipalities.
Where graves have to be moved, the affected individuals, families or religious groups will be
paid cash compensation, at standard municipal rates and provided with an altemative burial
site by the municipalities.
7.2   IDENTIFICATION OF DISPL CED PERSONS AND INVENTORYING ASSETS
Once the application for the ROWs  approved the respective Municipal Lands Officer will
authorise TANESCO to serve notice n:
.     all persons occupying land u der a right of occupancy within the proposed ROWs,
including persons occupying I nd in accordance with customary rights or with proven
long-standing occupancy righ ;
.     all local government authoriti in whose area of jurisdiction the proposed ROWs are
situated;
*     all persons in an urban and eri-urban area in actual occupation of land within the
proposed ROWs; and
.     any other interested person.
TANESCO transmission line survey eams will identify and survey the routes and locations
of the proposed transmission lines  d other project infrastructure. The boundaries of the
additional land needed for ROWs wi be marked on the ground using stakes. Infrastructure
and other assets within the proposed ROWs will be marked with paint.
Where this has not already been d  e, the Social Issues Team (SIT) will hold a series of
public consultation meetings in affec d areas to explain the project, resettlement principles,
grievance mechanisms and solicit pedback from the public. Community representative
committees will be established to fac itate liaison between the project planners, DPs and the
affected communities.
The transmission line survey tea will be accompanied by the Land Acquisition and
Valuation Team (LAVT) which, to ther with Dispute Resolution Team (DRT) and the
respective Municipal Lands Office  and Ward or Sub-ward leaders, will identify affected
properties and DPs and assign a r erence number to each individual unit. The LAVT will
need to confirm the land ownership r occupation status of each DP by reference to official
records, local authonties or commu  y leaders. The legitimacy of claims of DPs claiming to
be tenants, informal occupiers of p  lic land or employees will be ascertained. Particularly
vulnerable DPs will be identified wit the assistance of local community leaders. A baseline
socio-economic survey of affected p ople and communities should be carried out by the SIT
at the same time that census and as et inventory is undertaken.

(Dar es Salaam, Moshi and Arusha)                                Revised January 2006
The LAVT will hand each DP Land Form No. 69 (Notice to land occupier to apply for
compensation) and a letter explaining the project, cut-off dates, general eligibility, general
compensation rates and values31, rights and grievance mechanisms and will carry out a
census and inventory of DPs and affected land, structures, crops, other assets and
businesses. Data for each DP, including descriptions and measurements, will be recorded
on valuation data sheets which will be counter-checked and signed by the DP and local
leaders. Adjudication plans, showing the spatial location of affected land, assets and
associated adjacent areas, will be drawn up. Photographs will be taken of the DPs and
affected land and assets.
The LAVT will assist DPs to complete Land Form No. 70 (Application for compensation by
land occupier) which is to be submitted by the DP to the LAVT within 60 days, via Ward or
Sub-ward leaders. The DP and LAVT will discuss and agree the compensation and any
relocation entitlements32. The LAVT will maintain a database to store information obtained
during the census.
A similar process will be undertaken in any host areas identified for resettlement in which
people will be displaced or adversely affected.
7.3   ASSIGNMENT OF VALUES TO ASSETS AND LOSSES
After completing the valuation exercise the LAVT, working with Municipal Valuers, will
confirm the legal obligations for compensation and resettlement and the eligibility of
individual cases. The valuation specification for land, assets and other entitlements will be
confirmed and approved by the Municipal Valuers. A valuation report will be compiled and
submitted to the Chief Government Valuer in MLHSD for approval.
The LAVT will then develop resettlement entitlements (e.g. compensation and relocation
measures) for each DP and produce compensation schedules, indicating the breakdown and
total amount of compensation to be paid to each claimant, which will be forwarded to
TANESCO and to the respective Municipal Lands Officer. The compensation schedules
have to be countersigned by the relevant village leader, Ward Executive Officer, Municipal
Lands Officer, District Commissioner and Regional Commissioner.
7.4   INDICATIVE FORMS AND AMOUNTS OF RESETTLEMENT MEASURES FOR
ELIGIBLE DISPLACED PERSONS
Table 9 lists, in the form of an entitlement matrix, the possible categories of DPs and the
resettlement (i.e. compensation) measures that they will receive for each type of expected
loss.  Benefits in addition to those legislated for in Tanzania, in order to meet the
requirements of WB OP 4.12 are shown in italics.
31 Compensation rates for specific areas will be approved by the Municipal Valuer before the LAVT undertakes
the census and valuation.
32 Affected land and property owners will be free to hire a valuer, at their own cost, to provide advice and to assist
in determining compensation to be claimed on the prescribed forms.

Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited  Proposed 132 kV Transmission Lines in Dares Salaam
Distribution and Transmission Rehabilitation f roject   Resettlement Policy Framework
(Dar es Salaam, Moshi and Arusha)                             Revised January 2006
8     ORGANISATIONAL ELEM        NTS AND PROCEDURES FOR DELIVERY OF
ENTITLEMENTS
8.1   ORGANISATIONAL ARRANI -EMENTS FOR IMPLEMENTATION
Once the detailed RAP has been p !pared, disclosed both locally and in the WB Infoshop,
and approved, implementation of the RAP and delivery of entitlements can commence.
Responsibility for implementing th  resettlement measures of the RAP and delivering
entitlements to DPs will be with TAN .SCO, particularly the DTRP Project Co-ordinator in the
Projects Directorate of TANESCO  nd staff from the Corporate Planning and Research
Directorate. TANESCO will also w rk closely with other institutions, many of which have
legal obligations to carry out functio s related to resettlement and/or compensation. These
include MLHSD and the relevant mu icipal and ward authorities.
It is recommended that TANESCD maintains similar committees, units and groups
established for the preparation of th detailed RAP to supervise, manage and carry out the
implementation of resettlement m asures.  Suggested committees, units and teams,
together with their responsibilities a d constituent membership, are listed in Table 10. It is
believed that there is sufficient a  adequate capacity within TANESCO to fulfil these
functions. The PRU and the field te ims will work closely with DPs and other stakeholders,
such as the local authorities (at mun ipal and ward levels), local leaders, staff from MLHSD,
MOA and other utilities, such as r d, railway and pipeline authorities. Staff from these
agencies will be included in the fiel teams, as necessary. It is probable that a particular
person may be a member of more t n one committee, unit or team.
The project will also appoint a leg  consultant to deal with problems that residential and
business tenants have with landlor . Such problems could include failure by landlords to
refund deposits and advance ren I payments, even when landlords are in receipt of
accommodation allowances or loss  profit compensation.
8.2   RESETTLEMENT IMPLEM       TATION ACTIVITIES
A summary of activities required  r the implementation of resettlement measures and
delivery of entitlements to DPs,  gether with the suggested responsible agencies, is
presented in Table 11.
Actual payment of compensation, a cation of replacement land and sites, where applicable,
and delivery of other entitlements ill primarily be undertaken by staff from the relevant
municipalities with support from th PRU. Ward and municipal authorities have attained
considerable experience in deali g with similar compensation and relocation issues
associated with recent projects..  egally, payment must be made within six months of
serving notices on DPs. The DR  will handle disputes and grievances in the field before
referring any unresolved issues to t  CSC and municipal authorities.
Owners will have the right to remo  all affected structures and assets. If this is not done by
a fixed date (advised at the time f compensation payment) TANESCO will provide, in
writing, the contractor with permiss n to remove all affected structures in order to clear the
ROW and construct the transmiss n lines. DPs will also be encouraged to harvest any

income and/or food sources to be p tentially incurred by DPs.

boundaries of properties. Where the whole of a land holding is acquired for a ROW the
certificate of occupancy has to be cancelled. Fees associated with the re-registering and re-
surveying process will be met by the project.
8.4    IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE FOR RESETTLEMENT
A schedule for the implementation of the detailed RAP and for delivery of entitlements will be

9     GRIEVANCE REDRESS Ml CHANISMS
Grievances and disputes related to r settlement in general, and compensation in particular,
may arise from a number of different i sues. These include:
.     mistakes related to the iden ification of affected property and people within the
ROWs;
*     disagreements related to the wnership of property (including inheritance and divorce
related disputes);
*     disagreements on land and a  et valuation;
*     disagreements on other com  nsation and relocation entitlements; and
*     problems related to the time  d manner of payment of compensation.
The Land Acquisition Act prescrib  procedures for dispute resolution with respect to
compensation. If disputes and disag  ements are not resolved by the parties involved within
six weeks after the date of publicat n of the notice of intention to acquire the land for a
public purpose, the Minister, or any  rson holding or claiming any interest in the land, may
institute a suit in a court of law fo the determination of the dispute. More specifically,
Section 156 of the Land Act makes rovision for an aggrieved party to refer disagreements
among any person or entity entitled  claim compensation and the body with a duty to pay
the compensation on the amount or ethod of payment or the time taken to make, negotiate
or process an offer of compensati , to refer the matter to the High Court of Tanzania.
However, in practice this is usually d icult and costly for most DPs so that specific grievance
redress mechanism for the DTRP wi be established by TANESCO.
In the first instance TANESCO will e ablish a Dispute Resolution Team (DRT) which will, as
far as possible, attend to disputes o the ground. Where disputes cannot be resolved by the
DRT they will be referred to the C  and then to the relevant Municipal Director who will
consult with the interested parties, in luding TAN ESCO, the Ministry of Energy and Minerals,
the LAVT, Councillors, Ward Execut e Officers, Sub-ward Chairmen and local leaders. It is
important that grievances be resolv  at the local level as far as possible and care will need
to be taken to respect the fact that m ny of the claimants are poor and illiterate.
Further to this, unresolved disputes rnay be referred to the appropriate level of land courts
established by law, particularly for  atters involving land ownership. If disputes cannot be
resolved by Municipal Directors or t  local courts application can then be made to the High
Court of Tanzania for resolution, wh  e decision will be final.

10    METHODS FOR CONSULTATION WITH AND PARTICIPATION OF
AFFECTED PEOPLE
10.1  CONSULTATION AND PARTICIPATION DURING THE PREPARATION OF THE
RESETTLEMENT POLICY FRAMEWORK
Since the beginning of the preparation of the RPF a number of public communication
meetings were held with people living in most of those areas of Dar-es Salaam likely to
affected by the project. These meetings were undertaken by an independent sociologist
engaged by TANESCO who worked closely with municipal, ward, sub-ward and local
representatives. The main purpose of these meetings was to:
* introduce the project;
* explain the need for land acquisition;
* explain the resettlement principles to be applied; and
* solicit feedback
The results of the public consultation exercise are recorded separately in the Final SIA report
which is also presented as Annex 1 (separate volume) to this RPF.
10.2 CONSULTATION AND PARTICIPATION DURING THE PREPARATION OF THE
DETAILED RESETTLEMENT ACTION PLAN
Because the affected people are spread along the length of the proposed transmission lines
it is difficult to deal with a single community or community representative body.
Nevertheless, it is proposed that community representative committees be established in
vanous areas to provide a platform for co-operation between the planning teams and the
DPs and to ensure the full participation of the DPs and other stakeholders in the planning
process. Liaison between the representative committees may be effected directly with the
resettlement planning teams, such as the SIT, LAVT and DRT, or through the well-
established local government channels, involving local leaders, Sub-ward Chairmen and
Ward Executive Officers.

11    MONITORING ARRANG         MENTS
Throughout the resettlement imple entation process the PRU will maintain records of all
progress and submit regular report' (i.e. probably weekly and monthly) to the CSC, via the
PCC. The CSC will verify that the p ogress reports are true records.
In accordance with the requireme s of WB OP 4.12 both internal and external monitoring
and evaluation (M&E) will be unde taken throughout the implementation process, and for
some time afterwards, in order to m nitor and evaluate, among others:
.     implementation progress;
.     compensation and resettlem  nt policies;
.     delivery of entitlements;
.     satisfaction with the resettle ent process;
.     impacts (i.e. changes) on liv lihoods and incomes among DPs; and
.     consultation with and partici ation of DPs and other stakeholders.
This M&E will be part of, or be cI sely aligned to, the M&E process to be undertaken for
overall monitoring of environme tal impacts in accordance with the environmental
management plan of the project ESIA report. An M&E plan will be developed during the
preparation of the detailed RAP. he M&E plan presented in the ESIA lists the impacts,
mitigation measures, indicators, rr ans of verification and responsibilities for monitoring.
Aspects of this M&E plan that are r levant to the resettlement and compensation component
of the DTRP are listed in Table 12.
It is proposed that intemal M&E b undertaken by an independent sociologist engaged by
TANESCO and be carried out with he full participation of the beneficiaries. It is recognised
that M&E will be difficult as the D s will be widely dispersed along the length of the new
transmission lines and some will  ve moved to new areas altogether. This may make it
difficult to obtain representative dat and draw accurate and meaningful conclusions.
Extemal M&E should be conducte through WB missions deployed to monitor and evaluate
the overall DTRP. The objectives of extemal M&E will largely be the same as those for
intemal M&E.

12    INDICATIVE IMPLEMENT      TION COSTS
A budget for the implementation of compensation, relocation and other resettlement
measures for that part of the DTRP': be implemented in Oar es Salaam by TAN ESCO will
be developed during the preparatior of the detailed RAP. This will only be possible once
more accurate details of the locatior of project infrastructure, the type and number of DPs,
the nature and extent of losses, th level of cash compensation and other resettlement
entitlements and the amount of physi al relocation to resettlement areas is known.
During the preliminary identification and valuation exercise undertaken during 2005 the
property valuation consulting firms i ngaged by TANESCO estimated the amount of cash
compensation and allowances to be )aid to DPs for transmission line routings based on the
August 2005 TANESCO proposal. I .ese are summarised in Table 13. The total estimated
cost from the spot valuation exercise $ was determined to be USD 16 078 270 or USD 8 992
per property unit or USD 1 799 per p rson.
It should be noted that the estim itions provided in Table 13 do not include possible
compensation costs for tenants an( DPs, such as fairly permanent street vendors (with
structures) as these could not be ea ily identified during the preliminary valuation exercises.
The estimates also do not include c sts associated with possible compensation for people
living in potential resettlement area (i.e. host populations) nor the costs associated with
planning and developing such areaE The estimates also do not include possible costs of
grave removal nor global implement; tion and management costs. These will be determined
during preparation of the detailed RA .
Total estimated compensation ant relocation costs for the Community Infrastructure
Upgrading Programme, as indicate I in the RAP prepared in 2004, were USD 2 209 per
affected property or unit. For the S :ngo Songo Gas to Electricity Project which was partly
implemented in Dar es Salaam tota compensation, relocation and monitoring costs were,
according to the Resettlement Plan of 1997 and an Addendum of 2002, estimated to be
around USD 9 million or around US  3 000 per household.

APPENDIX 1
SUMMARY DESCRIPTION OF          OSSIBLE PROJECT DESIGN AND POTENTIAL
)ISPLACEMENT
1     INTRODUCTION
One part of the Distribution and Trar mission Rehabilitation Project - Dar es Salaam, Moshi
and Arusha) (DTRP) will be impleme nted by the Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited
(TANESCO) in Dar es Salaam.      ere, the project will support the installation of new
infrastructure and the extension, up ading and rehabilitation of existing infrastructure. New
infrastructure will be installed to p incipally supply bulk power to areas with high load
densities and to new supply areas. -'he project has two main components.
Component 1 of the DTRP will suppc rt the:
.     construction of new 132 kV tr nsmission lines;
•     construction of new 132/33/1  kV substations;
.     installation of additional 132/:3 kV components to existing 132/33/11 kV substations;
and
.     expansion  and  upgrading of existing 33/11 kV  substations to  132/33/11 kV
substations.
Component 2 of the DTRP will suppc I the:
.     construction, repair and upg ade of 33 kV and 11 kV distribution lines to feed load
centres from various substati ns; and
.     rehabilitation of existing 33/1 kV primary substations (around 18).
Component 1 will be implemented n a number of wards in Temeke, Kinondoni and llala
municipalities in Dar es Salaam, pa icularly in the north-eastem and southem parts of the
city. The new 132 kV transmission lines will pass through mainly medium to high density
urban residential, commercial and i dustrial areas as well as through lower density semi-
nural or pen-urban agricultural areas e.g. small farming plots), mainly in the south of the city.
Component 2 will be implemented in various parts of Dar es Salaam.
The detailed design of the part of th DTRP to be implemented in Dar es Salaam has yet to
be completed and approved an various options are being discussed with other
stakeholders'.  This means that, t the time of preparation of this resettlement policy
framework (RPF) it was not possibIE for each section of the proposed 132 kV transmission
lines, to know with any certainty the transmission line design, width of right of way (ROW)
required, routing of the line, locatioi of other project infrastructure and, therefore, location
and amount of additional land to be cquired. Nevertheless, since January 2005 TANESCO
has been considering a number of d sign and routing options.
2     INITIAL PROJECT DESIGN     ROPOSALS
According to the Lahmeyer Intern ional feasibility study of December 2004 the original
project design envisaged, among ott rs, the:
E.g. the Tanzania National Road Agency (TANROADS), the Tanzania Railways Corporation (TRC) and the
Tanzania Airports Authority (TAA).

Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited  Proposed 132 kV Transmission Lines in Dar es Salaam
Distribution and Transmission Rehabilitation Project    Resettlement Policy Framework
(Dar es Salaam, Moshi and Arusha)                             Revised January 2006
*     installation of an additional 132 kV circuit to one of the two existing 132 kV
transmission lines running between Ubungo and lIala (132/33/11 kV) substations;
*     construction of a new  132 kV transmission line from  Ubungo (132/33/11 kV)
substation to a proposed new 132/33/11 kV substation (i.e. New Oysterbay) at the
TANESCO Kinondoni North regional office at Mikocheni, in the north east of the city;
*     construction of a new 132 kV transmission line from lIala (132/33/11 kV) substation to
the existing 132/33/11 kV Factory Zone IlIl substation, via the existing Kurasini and
Mbagala 33/11 kV primary substations (to be expanded and upgraded to
132/33/11 kV) and a proposed new 132/33/11 kV substation at Yombo. The purpose
of this new line was to close the southern half of a 132 kV connection from Ubungo to
llala to Factory Zone III and back to Ubungo in a ring through the southern parts of
the city.
The Lahmeyer International feasibility study of December 2004 recommended three different
transmission line designs or types to be used for the full lengths or for specific sections of
the proposed new 132 kV transmission lines. These were:
*     standard, self-supporting, steel lattice towers which normally require a ROW of 40 m.
This is often the cheapest option, in terms of construction and maintenance, but
causes the largest amount of displacement;
*     a more compact design, using steel tubular poles, which normally requires a ROW of
15 m. This design can also accommodate one or more circuits (e.g. a 132 kV line
and a 33 kV line) to reduce the width of the ROW for two or more lines following the
same route (i.e. multi-circuit line); and
.     buried underground cables which normally require a ROW of 5 m. This is the most
expensive option, in terms of construction and maintenance, but causes the least
amount of displacement. In many cases underground cables can share the corridors
being used by existing distribution lines.
For initial feasibility planning purposes, the use of standard steel lattice towers, requiring a
ROW of 40 m, was assumed for all sections of the transmission lines. From an engineering
point of view such transmission lines generally have to be routed in a straight line as far as
possible. It was found that the necessary routing of the new transmission lines would have
to pass through numerous properties of low, medium and high density and of low, medium
and high value. This would require the acquisition by TANESCO of a considerable amount
of land and cause a considerable amount of displacement with a very high compensation
cost, although the area of land required and the magnitude of displacement was not
quantified at the time
In January 2005 TANESCO commenced a project design and cost optimisation exercise.
This included a reconnaissance survey of each section of the proposed transmission lines to
estimate and compare the construction cost, amount of land to be acquired, number of
properties to be affected, number of people to be displaced, cost of compensation (i.e.
mainly cash compensation and not the cost of relocation) and the total project cost (i.e.
construction and compensation costs) for the three various transmission line design options
and their required ROWs of 40 m, 15 m and 5 m widths. TANESCO engaged two registered
property valuation consulting firms2 to carry out a spot enumeration and valuation survey to
provide estimates of the number of affected properties, number of displaced people and
compensation costs. The results of the reconnaissance comparison valuation are presented
in Table Al.1.

The results of the reconnaissance c mparison survey revealed that between 637 and 1 977
properties would be affected and an stimated 3 205 to 9 975 people would be displaced in
one way or another. A considerab  amount of physical relocation, as opposed to purely
financial compensation, would be ne  ed.
3     ALTERNATIVE DESIGN AN       ROUTING OPTIONS
In order to reduce the socio-econ  ic impacts and overall project costs, by minimising
construction costs while also min ising land acquisition and displacement, TANESCO
management reviewed its original  oposal and has proposed, in consultation with other
stakeholders3, alternative transmis  n line design strategies and routes. The current (i.e.
August 2005) proposal is based on:
.     applying an appropriate tra  ission line design (type) to reduce the width of the
ROW needed;
.     utilising, wherever possible,  ad reserves, other ROWs and existing distribution line
corridors so that no or a red  d amount of additional land is required; and
.     using, wherever possible, un ccupied, undeveloped and waste areas to reduce the
displacement impact caused  the acquisition of land for ROWs.
In addition to the original transmissi  line design options, other design and routing options
being considered by TANESCO inc  e the use of:
•     standard, self-supporting ste lattice towers in a ROW that utilises the outer parts of
existing pipeline-and other  Ws so that the additional strip of land required for the
transmission line ROW will b  ess than the normal 40 m;
.     compact design (steel tubul  poles) 132 kV transmission lines along the sides of
roads which will require a t  I ROW of between 5m and 7m that utilises an outer
corridor (e.g. 1,5 m to 3 m)  existing road reserves4. If the steel tubular poles are
erected within the centre of  full 5 m to 7 m ROW the additional strip of land to be
acquired outside the road re rve is between 2 m and 3,5 m (assuming the full ROW
is 5 m wide);
.     compact design (steel tubul  poles) 132 kV transmission lines along the sides of
roads which will require a to I ROW of between 5m and 7m that utilises an outer
corridor (e.g. 1,5 m to 3 m)  existing road reserves. If the steel tubular poles are
erected along the inner bou  ary of the corridor provided within the road reserve,
with one of the cross-arms or the actual road, no or very little land will need to be
acquired5;
3E.g. TANROADS and TRC.
4 TANROADS has offered TANESCO and  er utilities corridors of varying widths (e.g. 1,5 m and 3 m) within
some of its road reserves.
S Discussions with TANROADS have been itiated. In principle, TANROADS has no objection but existing
regulations preventing activities being unde ken under transmission lines will need to be amended and safety
measures strengthened.

(Dar es Salaam, Moshi and Arusha)                                   Revised January 2006
*      compact design (steel tubular poles) 132 kV transmission lines within existing railway
reserves where no additional land will need to be acquired6; and
*      compact design (steel tubular poles) 132 kV multi-circuit transmission lines within
existing 33 kV or I1 kV corridors, which can carry a new 132 kV line and the existing
33 kV or 11 kV line. In some cases the existing ROW may need to be widened by,
for example, 5 m.
Table A1.2 summarises the various options that are currently being considered to reduce the
amount of new or additional land required for the ROWs and to minimise displacement and
compensation and resettlement costs. Application of these options to various sections of the
proposed 132 kV transmission lines will be confirmed during detailed design.

An additional alternative considered by TANESCO was to allow people to continue to live
and use land within the ROWS as much as possible, taking into account that a strip of land
immediately under the conductors would need to be kept permanently cleared. Allowing
people to live and work within the ROWs, provided a minimum clearance under the
conductors of 8 m was maintained, would not only accommodate the wishes of affected
people who generally are reluctant to move, but would considerably reduce the amount of
displacement and the cost of relocation and/or compensation. However, it is the opinion of
TANESCO that, for safety and security reasons, it is not advisable to allow people to live in a
ROW used for high tension transmission lines. The Electricity Ordinance (Cap. 131 of 1931,
Supplementary 57) also legally prevents people living in such a ROW. However, TANESCO
has usually allowed other activities, such as growing short and temporary crops, within high
tension transmission line ROWs.
4      CURRENT TENTATIVE PROJECT DESIGN AND LOCATION
In August 2005 TANESCO management put forward a revised project design proposal which
is being discussed internally within TANESCO and with other stakeholders. According to
this current proposal the project will now involve, among others, the:

new 132/33/11 kV substation north of Factory Zone II, on an existing TANESCO plot
at Kinyerezi.
Further details of this current desig proposal are presented below. Figure 2 in the Main
Report shows the approximate loc ion of project infrastructure according to the current
proposal.
4.1   Ubungo substation to llala Ubstation
There are currently two 132 kV trans ission lines that run directly between Ubungo and llala
substations. A new 132 kV transmis ion line will be constructed between Ubungo substation
and llala substation via Oysterbay  the north-east of Dar es Salaam to close a 132 kV
circular link from Ubungo to Oysterb  to llala to Ubungo.
The existing 33/11 kV Oysterbay p imary substation will be expanded within TANESCO
property and upgraded to a 132/ /11 kV substation with the installation of additional
132/33 kV components (e.g. transfo ers and iine bays). New 132 kV line bays will also be
installed in Ubungo and llala substat ns to serve the new 132 kV transmission line.
The new line will pass through a nu  er of wards in Kinondoni and llala municipalities. The
current proposal is for the new line t ollow Sam Njoma road from Ubungo substation to the
junction of Sam Njoma and New Ba  moyo roads. It will then follow New Bagamoyo road to
the existing Oysterbay 33/11 kV pri ry substation, near the junction of New Bagamoyo and
Kawawa roads. From Oysterbay su station the proposed line will follow Kawawa road until
Magomeni where it reaches the exi ing TANESCO ROW used by the two existing Ubungo
to lIala 132 kV transmission lines. The area through which the line will be constructed
between Ubungo and Magomeni is u an with low and medium density residential areas and
commercial properties. Many of the properties in the affected area are of medium to high
value.
From Ubungo to Oysterbay to Mago eni the 132 kV conductors (i.e. cables) will be carried
by compact design tubular steel pol  which will also be used to carry additional 33 kV lines
(i.e. multi-circuit). This type of desi  requires a ROW of between 5 m and 7 m, although it
is proposed to use part of the road  erve.
From Magomeni (new take-off juncti ) to Ilala substation the new line will be installed, as a
second circuit, on one of the two exi ing Ubungo to lIala 132 kV transmission lines (i.e. llala
Line 2) that are located within the e  ting ROW. These lines are carried by self-supporting
steel lattice towers. A second optio being considered is to route the new line directly from
Oysterbay substation to Ilala substat n through the Jangwani area

Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited  Proposed 132 kV Transmission Lines in Dar es Salaam
Distribution and Transmission Rehabilitation Project     Resettlement Policy Framework
(Dares Salaam, Moshi and Arusha)                                Revised January 2006
4.2   Ubungo substation to Factory Zone IlIl substation
A 132 kV transmission line exists between Ubungo substation and Factory Zone III
substation at Kipawa near the Dar es Salaam   International Airport.  A new 132 kV
transmission line will be constructed between Ubungo substation and Factory Zone IlIl
substation via the existing 33/11 kV primary substations at Kurasini, Mbagala and Factory
Zone II in the southern area of Dar es Salaam. The proposed transmission line will be used
to close a 132 kV circular link in the southern part of the city from Ubungo to Kurasini to
Mbagala to Factory Zone II to Factory Zone IlIl to Ubungo.
The existing 33/11 kV primary substations at Kurasini, Mbagala and Factory Zone II will be
expanded and upgraded to 132/33/11 kV substations with the installation of additional
132/33 kV components. New 132 kV line bays will also be installed in Ubungo and Factory
Zone IlIl substations to serve the new 132 kV transmission line.
The proposed line will pass through various urban, rural and mixed wards in llala and
Temeke municipalities. From Ubungo the current proposal is for the transmission line to
follow the Nelson Mandela highway to Kurasini substation. This is an area of fairly densely
compacted residential housing and commercial properties.  For this section of the
transmission line a compact, multi-circuit design using tubular steel poles is being proposed.
This will require a ROW of between 5 m and 7 m although it is also being proposed that part
of the road reserve along the Nelson Mandela highway should be used.
From the existing Kurasini substation the transmission line will cross the estuary and
generally follow the TAZAMA pipeline until the existing Mbagala substation. It will pass
through Vijibweni, an area which is characterised by farming plots with low to medium
density, scattered houses and settlements, but enters a much more densely populated area
as it approaches Mbagala. Between Kurasini and Mbagala standard steel lattice towers will
be used to carry the conductors. In Tanzania this normally requires a ROW of 40 m
although it is proposed that part of the existing TAZAMA pipeline ROW may be used.
Between the Mbagala and Factory Zone II substations the proposed transmission line will be
routed partly within or parallel to the existing TAZAMA pipeline ROW for part of the way. It
will pass through medium and high density residential areas as well as farm land. Standard
steel lattice towers will be used. This would normally require a ROW of 40 m although it is
proposed that part of the existing gas pipeline ROW may also be utilised.
From Factory Zone II substation to the existing 132/33/11 kV Factory Zone IlIl substation one
proposal being considered is to locate the new transmission line within an existing 33 kV
distribution line corridor. This corridor passes through a fairly densely populated area and
even parts of the existing ROW are being used by encroachers. A compact, multi-circuit
design using tubular steel poles is being proposed for this section. This will require a ROW
of between 5 m and 7 m. A second option being considered is to use the TRC railway ROW
that runs directly between the two substations.
4.3   Factory Zone II to Kinyerezi
It is being proposed to establish a new 132/33/11 kV substation on a plot of land owned by
TANESCO at Kinyerezi (Ilala municipality), north of the existing Factory Zone II substation,
and to construct a new 132 kV line from Factory Zone II to Kinyerezi. Additional 132/33 kV
components will also need to be installed in the expanded Factory Zone II substation to cater
for the new line. The transmission line will mainly pass through medium density residential
and commercial property and will probably be constructed using standard steel lattice towers
that require a ROW of 40 m.

4.4    Medium and low voltage distribution system
To increase the size and reach of the 33 kV and 11 kV sub-transmission and distribution
system in Dar es Salaam the DTRP will support the construction or rehabilitation of 33 kV
and 11 kV lines to feed load centres from various substations. The medium voltage
distribution network usually consists of single or double circuit lines mounted on wooden or
reinforced concrete poles requiring a ROW of 5 m for 33 kV lines and 2,5 m for 11 kV lines.
However, common practice is to align these distribution lines along the sides of roads, within
existing road reserves, or within existing transmission or distribution line corridors.
Wherever possible new medium voltage lines will be installed as multi-circuit lines, sharing
poles and towers carrying other high and medium voltage lines.
In some cases, such as in Dar es Salaam city centre, buried cables may be used. For 33 kV
lines this would normally require a ROW of around 5 m although, wherever possible, they
will be installed within the corridors of existing overhead lines.
The DTRP will also support the extension of the low voltage network which will be
accomplished by the installation and rehabilitation of new low voltage supply lines using
aerial bundled cables supported by wooden poles. Low voltage lines are usually located
along the sides of roads and along boundaries between properties and no ROW is required.

The DTRP will also rehabilitate a numb r (approximately 18) of 33/11 kV primary substations
throughout Dar es Salaam.
5      ESTIMATED NUMBER OF AF        CTED PROPERTIES
The most recent estimate of the numb r of potentially affected properties has been derived
from  the spot enumeration and val ation exercise carried out by property valuation
consulting firms in August 2005, b   ed on the revised project design proposed by
TANESCO in August 2005.
Recent photomaps of the potentially  ected areas in Dar es Salaam were acquired and
geo-referenced to the survey datum   ing used by TANESCO. For each section of the
proposed transmission lines the out  edges (i.e. buffers) of the proposed ROW  being
proposed for each section were then  perimposed onto the photomaps. For each section
the number of affected properties    .g. houses and other clearly identifiable single
properties) was estimated from visual xamination of the photomaps and checked during
site visits. TableA1.5 shows that a  estimated 1 788 properties will be affected by the
acquisition of land for the project. Dun  the spot enumeration and valuation exercise it was
not possible to ascertain the exact  e, size, condition and purpose of use of all the
properties identified nor to accurately  entify other forms of loss or displacement, such as
loss of profit or business opportunity.

6      ESTIMATED NUMBER OF AFFECTED PEOPLE
Without undertaking a comprehensive survey it is not possible to know the number and
categories of people who will be affected by the acquisition of land for the ROWs and for
other project infrastructure. Nevertheless, an estimate of the number of affected people has
been included in Table A1.5 which shows that around 8 940 people will be displaced in one
form or another.. This estimate was provided by the property valuation consulting firms and
is based on applying an average "household" size of five persons to each affected property.

METHODOLOGY AND INF ORMATION SOURCES USED FOR THE
PREPARATION OF THE F ESETTLEMENT POLICY FRAMEWORK
Review of relevant backaround rep( its and documentation:  A number of background
documents on the project were obtain d and reviewed, including the Lahmeyer International
feasibility study of December 2004. R:levant Tanzanian policies, legalisation and guidelines
were reviewed to understand and recc rd their implications for dealing with displaced persons
(DPs) that will be displaced, in one fo m or another, from areas within the proposed right of
ways (ROWs). These included: the L nd Act (No. 4 of 1999); the Land Acquisition Act (No.
47 of 1967); the Village Land Act (N . 5 of 1999); the Electricity Ordinance (Cap. 131 of
1931); the Land Regulations (2001); ;nd the Tanzania Environmental Impact Assessment
Guidelines (2002) published by the I ational Environment Management Council (NEMC).
World Bank (WB) Operational Policy ( P) 4.12 was also reviewed and the preparation of the
resettlement policy framework (RPF) was also guided by several examples of RPFs and
resettlement action plans (RAPs) pre ared recently for WB supported projects in Tanzania
and other countries in the region.
Visits to possible proiect sites: In Jar jary 2005 rapid field visits were made to areas in Dar
es Salaam where the project infrastn cture was initially planned to be installed in order to
briefly ascertain the nature and magni Ide of the social impacts of the project.
Review and application of information .ontained in assessment and survey reports DreDared
by third Party consultants: The Tan ania Electric Supply Company Limited (TANESCO)
engaged an independent sociologist' 1o undertake a number of public consultation meetings
during January and February 2005 in tome of the wards to be affected by the project (based
on the transmission line designs an( routes being proposed at that time) and with other
interested parties. The objective of Ihe public consultation process was to introduce the
project, explain the need for land  quisition, explain the resettlement principles to be
applied as well as to solicit feedback. As a result of the revised transmission line design and
routing proposals put forwarded by T iNESCO in August 2005 further consultation meetings
were held in September and Novemb r 2005 in new areas possibly to be affected according
to the revised plan2. The results of t l consultation processes are presented in a draft final
social impact assessment (SIA) repor submitted to TANESCO in April 2005 and a final SIA
report submitted in November 2005. The final SIA report of November 2005 is attached to
this document as Annex 1.
A general description of the socio-ecc nomic and cultural conditions prevailing in those areas
in which the public consultation proc ss was undertaken is also included in the draft final
and final SIA reports. However, no etailed socio-economic survey of potentially affected
households was undertaken nor hot sehold profiles developed because, at the time, the
exact alignment of transmission line routes was not known so that it was, therefore, not
possible to accurately identify the aff cted properties and households. Detailed household
surveys will need to be undertaken uring the preparation of the more detailed RAP to
provide baseline information for plann ng and future monitoring purposes.
The draft final SIA report (April i005) was subsequently incorporated into the full
environmental and social impact ass ssment (ESIA) prepared by TANESCO in April 2005
1 I.e. Nyinisaeli K Palangyo.
2 As a result of the revised transmission line esign and routing proposals put forward by TANESCO in August
2005 many of the areas in which public consL ation meetings were originally held in January 2005 are no longer

Distrbution and Transmission Rehabilitation Project    Resefflement Policy Framework
(Dares Salaam, Moshi and Arusha)                              Revised January 2006
and approved by the WB review teams. The ESIA was, therefore, the main source of socio-
economic information for the preparation of the RPF.   Additional population and
demographic information was obtained from summaries of the results of the 2002 population
and household census, available on the Government of the United Republic of Tanzania
(GOT) website3.
In January and February 2005 a field reconnaissance exercise to preliminarily identify,
enumerate and value properties that would be affected by the creation of the new ROWs, as
being proposed at that time, and to estimate the number of people who would be displaced,
was undertaken by two property valuation consulting firms4 engaged by TANESCO. The
results of the reconnaissance survey were presented to TANESCO in a report in February
2005. Following the decision of the TANESCO management to revise the original proposal
on transmission line design and routing the property valuation consulting firms, in August
2005, carried out a further spot survey of the alternative routes to enumerate and value the
potentially affected properties. The results of the additional spot survey were presented to
TANESCO in a report in September 2005. For the preparation of the RPF the two
reconnaissance enumeration and valuation reports have been used as the main source of
information on the type and magnitude of expected displacement. It is emphasised that
these data are only estimations and detailed enumeration and valuation will be carried out
during the preparation of the detailed RAP.
Meetings with key Personnel and oroanisations: Meetings were held with officials from
TANESCO in January and May 2005, notably with personnel in the Corporate Planning and
Research Directorate which is responsible for environmental issues, with surveyors and with
transmission and distribution engineers. Meetings were also held with personnel from the
Tanzania Airports Authority (TM) and the Tanzania National Roads Agency (TANROADS).
Discussion and communication with the sociologist and with personnel from the property
valuation consulting firms engaged by TANESCO were maintained throughout the period of
preparation of the RAP.

Reinforcement and Upgrade of Dar es Salaam Kilimanjaro and Arusha Transmission and Distribution System Project
EXECUTIVE SUIY MARY
The report presents the results of t Social Impact Assessment study undertaken in three
regions of Dar-es-Salaam, Kilima aro and Arusha, which also include an extension of
SIA study to the new proposed rou s in Dar es Salaam region. Hamlet and Villages were
involved in the study conducted b  private (sociologist) consultant Nyinisaeli Palangyo.
The wards/villages studied were  11 that will be affected by the upgrading of the
electricity transmission lines and r abilitation of substations.
The study is part of TANESCO's fforts in the improvement of supply of energy. The
specific objectives of the project ar therefore:
*  Reducing the duration and  equency of power interruptions
*  Improving voltage conditio s at consumers premises
*  Reducing power system los s
Basically the study's key objectiv was to assess the impact of the project to the people
who will have to be resettled so  to give way for the transmission lines and  of sub-
stations structures. According to t e Land Act No 4 of 1999 those to be relocated are
supposed to be compensated of th r properties (houses, crops, land, trees, etc.), moving
allowance up to 20km and distur nce allowances. Also according to the World Bank
Operational Policies on Involunta  Resettlement (revised December, 2001), involuntary
resettlement should be avoided or  inimised where feasible after exploring all possible
altematives. But where not feasib  resettlement should be conceived and executed as
sustainable development programs.
The consultant was therefore assigr d to
1. Review  of relevant exis  g and pending environmental legislation, land
acquisition legislation and  y other relevant legislation pertaining to this project
2. Review the relevant Worl Bank policies (OP4.01 & OP4.12) and guidelines
including the pollution Pr ention and Abatement hand book (Electric Power
Transmission and Distribut n)
3. Meetings and consultations  ith the TANESCO facility management and relevant
staff in respective regions,  levant government and municipal/ town authorities,
environmental experts, p  ects affected people and other bodies deemed
necessary
4. Establish an appropriate b eline for environmental, socio-economic, health and
safety issues
5. Identify potential impacts o the project on aspects of (social, biological, physical
health and safety)
6. Prepare an analysis of alt rnatives e.g. various routes/considered for the new
transmission line, different esign e.g. underground cable, compact design. These
should put to considerat n economic technical social and environmental
parameters.
The study was carried out in th period from 5/1-21/2/05 and from September to
November 2005 for SIA extensio   study. It involved data collection, semi-structured

Reinforcement and Upgrade of Dar es Salaam, Kilimanjaro and Arusha Transmission and Distribution System Project
interviews, focus group discussions and public participatory meetings, review of
literature, transect walks and observations. The results of these methods have been
complementary.
General Observation
All communities to be affected received the information with mixed feelings.
Most of the community members showed complete anger and annoyance. They
would not understand why the Government did not plan the Right of Way before
Other members took the information casually requesting for compensation of
property and a plot to build on
The areas owned by the rich majority were the most difficult to reach agreement
and despite the reduction of area to be used for distribution they found it difficult
to let go any piece of land
In the rural areas of Kilimanjaro and Arusha regions, some people will be without
land to support the family if the acquired land will not be allowed for use to grow
short crops such as beans and maize
Most people now are more aware of their rights of their property than was the
case in the past
People have fear over the past experience when people were resettled and not
properly compensated. This situation should be avoided/controlled as much as
possible during project implementation
Key findings
Majority of those to be affected by the project will have to let go either their
houses and business or their houses and land or only land and majority are
annoyed and angry
> All people are worried of loosing their properties, businesses, other income
generating activities. They are worried that the whole exercise will reduce them to
total poverty especially when the compensation will not be fair
> People are more concerned over their psychological and sociological losses that
cannot be compensated by any amount of money
> They believe that loss of neighbourhood, friends and loss of a place one has
grown or used to and have become part of that area and community can not be
replaced by anything
People with mud/wood grass thatch, old poor quality houses, are worried that they
will lead to be discriminated and become poorer than they already are
> It is not possible to identify specific ethnic groups in town because people don't
live by ethnicity but they live mixed. It is only possible to identify ethnic groups
in the rural areas
> There was diverse opinion regarding houses and plots compensation. Some
wanted to be compensated with money, others wanted to be given another plots
while some wanted to be given a house to house
> The Ubungo -Mikocheni route had majority of people who were very resistive to
the relocation and insisted on project to use the road reserve and the underground
cable

Reinforcement and Upgrade of Dar es Salaam, ilimanjaro and Arusha Transmission and Distribution System Project
> Majority of people in Moshi Arusha route requested TANESCO to allow them to
continue using the acquired and to grow short and seasonal crops such as beans,
maize, sunflower, paddy, etq   
> People want transparent val ation process, fair and prompt compensation. They
do not like compensation  elays as happened to Airport expansion Project at
Kipawa and Kiwalani area
i It is the wish of majority hat project should relocate as minimum people as
possible either using presert technologies such as underground cable in spite of
the construction costs or re uting the transmission line since the social impact is
so huge to them even if they are compensated
Key Recommendations
From stakeholders
> Compensation should be d ie as soon as valuation of property is done so as to
keep up with shilling deval tion
> Compensation should be do e to the affected persons and not to relatives
> Compensation should be m  e by TANESCO and not by the government
> After the valuation the aff ted people should be informed of the value of their
properties (in a meeting th amount of each one has to be paid as compensation)
before payment is process  so as to eliminate /reduce the possibility of being
paid less than what each ou ht to be paid
> The project should try as m ch as possible to avoid the relocation of the people by
working hard to use open  aces and road reserves. If possible use underground
cable so as to shift as few p ople as possible or no shifting at all
> People should be assured o the project implementation rather than imposing the
psychological effect while t e project is not going to take place
> TANESCO and the contrac or should provide casual jobs/labour to the youths of
affected people during con ruction
> TANESCO should establis a mechanism to deal with affected people complaints
and to conduct information issemination
> TANESCO should deal wi    people who are still living under the transmission
line or within the right of ay of the existing transmission line for the safety of
the people and the operatio of the line
> TANESCO should consid     supplying electricity, construct roads, other social
services like schools, heal  facilities, water supply etc, to the affected village
such as Samaria, Mwanag i, Mzinga Kivule and Ulongoni so that they see the
value of development in ter s of electricity supply facilities.
The affected showed different desires for compensation. Some of them want
compensation for their properties i cash, others want compensation in terms of property
by property i.e. if a house or plot o farm is affected they should be compensated a house,
plot/farm of same size. . Many affi cted are worried of messing up with money if paid in
cash. Others want compensation  f plot and cash for the house and they will do the
building on their own. All their wi hes should be seriously considered to ensure nobody's
wishes are discriminated and avoi unnecessary conflicts in future.

Reinforcement and Upgrade of Dar es Salaam, Kilimanjaro and Arusha Transmission and Distribution System Project
Given this situation it is recommended that intensive social survey should be made to
identified individuals' wishes by place/number and name before payment is done. This
will help to control/reduce any confusion and conflicts that can occur during
compensation.
It is also recommended that the valuers should check the prices of plants particularly tree
crops from the Forestry and Natural resources department to get proper prices because
the affected are not bitter with the prices trees plants paid based on the prices from the
ministry of lands department Note a number of families get good income from tree crops
like coconut and mango meaning that when the crops are cut a source of income is
removed thus affecting the households livelihood therefore compensation should be
satisfactory to put the family in a comfortable position.
Further to the recommendations from the stakeholders, it is recommended that the
implementation of Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP) and monitoring
is vital to the sustainability of the project. Both parties, project proponent (TANESCO)
and Contractor should ensure that they fulfil their responsibilities.

1.3   Scope of Work
The Social Economic Impact Assessment will focus on new facilities to be financed under
the project. The tasks include the following:
1. Review of relevant existing and pending environmental legislation, land acquisition
legislation and any other relevant legislation pertaining to this project
2. Review the relevant World Bank Policies (OP 4.01&0P4.12) and guidelines
including the Pollution Prevention and Abatement Hand Book (Electric Power
Transmission and Distribution)
3. Meetings and consultations with the TANESCO facility management and relevant
staff in respective regions, relevant govemment and municipal/town authorities,
environment experts, projects affected people and other bodies deemed necessary
4. Establish an appropriate baseline for environmental, socio-economic, health and
safety issues
5. Identify potential impacts of the project on aspects of (social, biological, physical
health and safety)
6. Prepare an analysis of altematives e.g. various routes/considered for the new
transmission line, different design e.g. underground cable, compact design. These
should put to consideration economic, technical, social and environmental parameters
1.4   Limitations/bottlenecks
Time planned for work in Dar-es-Salaam region was disrupted and extended by the timing
and availability of the Dar-es-Salaam residents. It was difficult to arrange meetings in the
working days in most of Dar-es-Salaam Wards.
Most meetings were conducted on weekends because those were the only days people could
attend meetings. This led to extended time than expected at the beginning of the work. In
some places like Msasani it was difficult to get hold of the owners of houses and instead their
housekeepers or children represented them. It was therefore difficult to get the real wishes of
house owners. This led to arrangement of another stakeholders meeting. Even then in the
second meeting only a few tumed up but the rest were still represented by their
children/house keepers.
The work was conducted during the period when there was reshuffles for the Ward Executive
Officers thus it was difficult for Mbagala Charambe Ward to arrange a meeting with the
community to be affected until a new Ward Officer was in office thus pushing the
accomplishment of work to one more week.
1.5   Successes
Despite anger reflected during the public meetings, all the meetings ended up successfully
with useful suggestions and ideas from the people that will be affected. All people though
reluctant to accept the idea of shifting understands that the developments activities have
positive as well as negative impacts on the communities such as this one which will lead to
resettlement of people from their places of residence to another place.

With the support of District and W rd authorities, it was possible to conduct meetings in all
areas that will be affected by the J roject. This has helped to ensure that no place was left
unaddressed and this will help to mi nimise unnecessary future conflicts.
The work was a success in all the t lree regions and no place was left un-addressed and thus
leading to the output of this report.

Appendix 1-3 give detailed info ation about public consultation meetings and list of
participants and the institutions con Ited
1.7   Legal and Policy Require  nts
The Land Act, 1999
The Act stipulates procedures of ac iring land from the rightful owners and what should be
compensated. In the Act, it is  undamental principle to pay full, fair and prompt
compensation to any person wh se right of occupancy or recognized long-standing
occupation or customary use of land is revoked or otherwise interfered with to their detriment
by State under the Act or is acq ired under the Land Acquisition Act; the concept of
opportunity shall be based on the fo towing:
*  Market value of the real pro crty;
* Transport allowance;
*  Loss of profits or accommod tion;
*  Cost of acquiring or getting  e subject land;
*  Any other cost loss or capit expenditure incurred to the development of the subject
land; and
*  Interest at market rate shoul be charged
Also people's (the affected) invol ment has strongly emphasized. In that matter project
proponent (TANESCO) is obliged t involve the affected people in every aspect of acquiring
their land and ensure that it pays fai prompt and at market value prices compensation.
National Environmental Manage ent Council Act (1983)
The Act established the National E ironment Management Council (NEMC). Which means
NEMC is a legal body with a re ponsibility of advising the government on the issues
environment, which include social ssues. As this project is going to relocate people to a
certain extent, it will be the interes of NEMC to see that procedures are followed and that
people's participation in knowing their fate is given a priority to reduce social impacts that
may be caused by the project.
World Bank OP4.12: Involuntary Resettlement (Revised in April 2004)
The World Bank recognizes that involuntary resettlement may cause severe long-term
economic, social and environmen I damage unless appropriate measures are carefully
planned and carried out. The ma  objective of the OP4.12 is therefore to minimize
involuntary resettlement as far as p sible by exploring all viable options and designs before
any action is taken to resettle peopl However, if all options have been explored and find out
that resettlement is still necessary, t en it should be done in sustainable manner by providing
sufficient investment resource to e able the persons displaced by the project to share in
16
Social Impact Assessmnent Draft Final Report



Reinforcement and Upgrade of Dar es Salaam, Kilimanjaro and Arusha Transmission and Distribution System Project
project benefits. In addition, displaced persons should be meaningfully consulted and should
have opportunities to participate in planning and implementing resettlement programs.
Further, the displaced people should be assisted in their efforts to improve their livelihoods
and standards of living or at least to restore them to pre-displaced levels or to levels
prevailing prior to the beginning of project implementation, whichever is higher.
Therefore, the policy requires the following to be done though the list is not exhaustive:
- Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) should be prepared
- Prompt and effective compensation at full replacement cost for losses of assets
attributable directly to the project should be provided
- Consultations with affected people and information of the rights of the displaced
persons should be made
- Displaced people should be provided with assistance such as moving allowance
- Displaced people should be provided with residential housing, housing and or
agricultural plots according to the wishes of affected people
- Displaced people are offered support after relocation to ensure that their livelihood is
restored
- Displaced people are provided with development assistance in addition to
compensation measures such as credit facilities, training and job opportunities
- Vulnerable groups such as the elderly, women, widows, children, etc., are given
special considerations
- Ensuring that displacement does not occur unless all necessary measures for
resettlement are in place.
World Bank OPN 11.03: Management of Cultural Property
The United Nations term "cultural property" includes sites having archaeological
prehistoric, religious, and unique natural values. Cultural property therefore,
encompasses both remains left by previous human inhabitants.
The objective of this policy is to ensure that cultural properties are protected and conserved.
Policy guidance
The general policy regarding cultural properties is to assist in their preservations and to seek
to avoid their elimination: Specifically:
A) The Bank normally declines financing projects that will significantly damage-non-
replicable cultural property and will assist only those projects that are sited or
designed so as to prevent such damage
B) The Bank will assist in the protection of cultural properties encountered in Bank
financed projects rather than leaving the protection to chance. In other cases, the
project is relocated in order that the sites and structures can be preserved, studied
and restored intact in situ. In other cases structures can be relocated in order that
sites and preserved, can be studied and restored on alternate sites.

Reinforcement and Upgrade of Dar es Salaa i, Kilimanjaro and Arusha Transmission and Distribution System Project
Based on this policy therefore, it is f utmost importance that the project makes sure that the
graveyards that will be affected by he project, just as was appointed out by the communities
to be affected during the consultativ meetings, should be preserved or where need arise they
should be relocated to another ar a that will be convenient to the affected community.
However, the new site to relocate he graveyards must be agreed upon or selected by the
affected communities including reli ious leaders.

3.0   PUBLIC CONSULTATIC N MEETINGS
Public meetings were used to ident fy the people's concerns and impacts of the project. The
people's requirement and recomm ndations that were identified by people themselves are
regarded as mitigation measures of he peoples concerns and impacts caused by the project.
3.1   Sinza Ward: Sinza C
The first public meeting was held i Sinza C for the affected community members of Sinza
C. The number of attendants was 1. 4 of them were the Mtaa leaders and not residents in
the affected area.
As a start the community members were shown a map showing the way leave for the project
so as to be clear whether they all r side within the area to be affected. After the exercise the
number of the attendants was r uced from 15 to 11 out of which 4 were the local
government leaders while only 7 w re members of the area to be affected by the project.
After clearing the confusion the r eting was opened by the Mtaa chairman by welcoming
the consultants to the meeting and iequesting them to present the agenda of the meeting. The
consultant informed the members that the intention or the purpose of the meeting was to
inform them the expected TANES O project which would be implement along their area in
future, and that those who will fall within the identified area will be affected in a number of
ways but mainly might be requir d to move out of their area of occupancy and shift to
another area that will be allocate by the project. The consultant therefore requested the
members to point out their concern and opinions and what they would like the project do so
as not to be very affected by the pr *ect.
3.1.1 Stakeholders concerns
The implementation of this project will involve loss of residences, neighbourhood built over
along period of time, closeness t social services like schools, main roads, shops, health
facilities, closer to town. However given the fact that the project is for development and is
inevitable, we request the followin -
*  Before we are mov d out of our premises we should be given sufficient time
to prepare ourselve to move out- ample time to built new houses before
demolishing our ho ses.
*  The project should r iake sure that they have provided all social amenities like
school, road, trans ort services, health facilities, power/electricity water
supply, shops, etc.
*  Before people are s ifted to the new area they would like very much to have
same neighbourhoo as they are living now.
*  They pointed out if they are shifted they would prefer to be allocated in the
same district and no otherwise.

*  We would prefer to be given a chance to select a place to move to on our own
rather than being allocated a place with no preference.
*  We request the project to compensate other properties other than house and
plot like petty businesses i.e. shops, hair salons, milk cows etc.
*  Shifting involves a lot of losses physical, financial, social and psychological.
All these cannot be compensated by money but we would appreciate to be
paid disturbance allowance.
After the meeting the participants requested to be shown the route, which the project will
pass. After which it was found out that there might be no one to be affected other than the
compound wall.
3.2   Sinza Ward: Sinza A - Community Members
The meeting was opened at 5.35 pm then TANESCO engineer introduced the project to the
community members. After the introduction of the project, the community members were
invited to point out their concerns, worries and expectations.
The first reaction was anger by the information and the first reaction was to refuse the idea to
be moved out of their area. First speaker pointed out that instead of moving out the
population in that area they should find ways of reaching an agreement with the University of
Dar es Salaam so as to avoid extra costs and to avoid disturbing people who have been
settled for a very long time in that area. Because the university area is still open, the idea to
hold talk with them to get an area for the project is quite ideal.
Another speaker pointed out that she is neither interested nor intends to move out of that
place. Why not use improved technology such as underground cable so as to reduce
disturbances, reduce possible health hazards, and help future plans?
3.2.1 Stakeholders concerns
I. Physical loss- People are concerned over the loss of their residential houses
2. Loss of business houses and income.
3. Sociological loss - after staying for a very long time in this place we have developed
friends, relations and attachments with neighbours- if we move out of this place it means
we will loose all these long established relationships.
4. There is so much attachment to the place we have lived in for over twenty years period
such that it has so much psychological attachment that cannot be replaced by any amount
of money paid.
5. We are closer to town; we have all infrastructural structures that are not available in the
new place where we will be moved. How can you assure us the availability of such
services?
6. The area we live in already have and are close to all social services like schools, from
primary to secondary, colleges, good roads, reliable transport, health facilities and many
other services that are not available in the new place we will be moved to.

7. Moving some of us out of his lace would mean pushing us to quick death. Most of us
living in this area are retired  eople; we are so much used to the place therefore not
interested to move in whatever rnount of money you are going to compensate us.
8. We started living here when it v as bushy and we were young and energetic now when we
are settled, retired and powerles you come to move us to a new place. Can't you see that
I can no longer tolerate the hass es of construction and moving to a new place? In fact if I
am forced out, I will commit sui ide. It is better I die than facing the idea of moving out.
9. Why didn't the govemment fa led to project the population growth and provide space
needed for future growth? The efore, the govermnents carelessness should not become
the people's nuisance
3.2.2 Stakeholders recommenda ions
* In case a person looses a reside ce and or business house, he/she should be compensated
a substantial amount of mone y enough to enable the construction of a new house
equivalent or better than the on to be demolished.
* The people to be moved must be allocated another plot to help reduce disturbance of
search for a plot and be moved tom the place of domicile to the new place.
* We should be given a grace per nd to enable us to construct a house before the demolition
of where we are now living.
* If we move from our place   f domicile we would prefer to live with the kind of
neighbours that we have where we are now living
* We as community are recipient of government decisions so we only request to be given
optional place for next domicil . We should be given a chance to select a place of our
own preference rather than be allocated a place we won't be comfortable with. Any
allocation of new place should c within Kinondoni Municipality.
* Wherever we are moved to we should be assured of availability of public transport for
easing our movement.
* For those who will be affected we have small businesses like keeping milk cows, hair
salons, chicken keeping, and s ops we should be compensated for the lost income and
lost opportunity.
* The value of our houses and Ilots will be hot cake because of the investment on the
University side. The project sho Id take that into consideration.
3.2.3 Issues that needed further onsiderations
After introducing the project and e plaining to the people what we wanted from them, they
argued with the following comment$:
o Main argument was that th ir area is planned and in the city plans there should have
provided space for future ex ansion of the public services.
o They also pointed out that there was an open space close by on the side of the
University of Dar-es- Salaa n why not utilise that area instead of incurring so much
expenses of compensating p ople settled in this area.
o Why not use the undergi ound cable option to avoid moving people out and
demolition of their houses.
44

o  The high voltage electricity has health hazards. Have TANESCO people assessed the
impact of having a high voltage line passing close to people's residences?
o If there are other area that can be an alternative to our area let the government opt to
that.
o  This is shocking and too quick information that I can't digest the message within this
so short time to give genuine response in so short time. So give us time to digest then
we will respond back to TANESCO in writing.
o  Shifting of people will involve not only physical and financial costs but social and
psychological losses- neighbourhood, relations, safety that cannot be compensated by
any amount of money.
o  Some of us are old and retired have grand children who are used to this area and
environment moving out of this place would mean life will be disrupted completely
and will affect the children psychologically.
o The prices of the place are going up every day due to its positioning and now you
want to move us out of here.
3.3   Yombo Vituka Area
After introducing the project to Yombo Vituka residents and requested for their feelings and
expectations from project, the community members general response was that: since this was
the government's decision and it is for development purposes they can't stop it. However
they requested the following:
3.3.1 Stakeholders concerns
* Before we are moved out of our place of residence there should be proper preparations by
TANESCO.
* Make sure there is a place prepared where people will be moved to.
* Prepare and make available plots for those who will be affected, sufficient compensation
that will enable them construct a house of the same standard like the one we live in.
* Make sure that the small businesses like kiosks are also compensated since it is an
income earning activity.
* Make sure that the social amenities- schools, health facilities, roads, water supply, public
transport, market and power are available to where will be moved to.
* There should be a provision of choices for the place to be moved to- individuals have
their own preferences and they should be allowed to pick on their own a place they would
like to move to.
* One wanted to know if his/her property is half way affected, will she/he be compensated
only the affected area or the whole area? - I would like to be compensated the whole area.
* How is the assurance that those who are close by the ROW won't be affected by the ultra
radiations from the transmission line?
* How will be the evaluation of an empty plot going to be? what will be the compensation?

3.4   Kawe Ward: Mlalakuwa S *vei Area
This meeting was held on the 16th anuary 2005. Under the chairmanship of the Mtaa local
leader, a short introduction about he project was given to the community members who
attended. The members were told t it the aim of the meeting was to make the project known
to them and as well as to hear their oncerns suggestions and wishes. Then the residents had
the following views and doubts:
3.4.1 Stakeholders concerns
* One of the members wanted to know if the meeting was to request them or to inform
them of the action to take plac . The answer was that it was a request and information
about the project.
*  Majority of those that will be a fected are old retired widows and widowers who cannot
withstand the hassles of new co structions and shifting. Some of us have lived here since
1968.
* The day you transfer me from h re that day will be the announcement of my death. From
here at my age where do I go to. I'm waiting for the day of my death here.
*  We want a copy of the project roposal to see the suggested altematives in writing so as
to file it for our references.
*  In case it is necessary to mov us out it is important to know that the compensation
should include not only physic I and financial but also psychological, sociological and
social amenities which are not e sily found in new places.
*  We would like to be involved in every stage of the project.
* We will present our wishes in w iting after receiving a copy of the project proposal.
* Don't you have alternative tech iology other than lattice structure towers that needs 40m
RoW? The space is too much. Try to use the technology that will affect as less people as
possible.
*  Use the straight line along Sar Nujoma road or look for another alternative route to
avoid disturbing many people.
*  TANESCO should look not int physical and financial costs alone but look into social
and psychological costs as well
* Even the needed space of five metres for underground cable will disturb a number of
people. Why not use the road re erve.
3.4.2 Stakeholders recommenda ions
* Affected people should be invol ed in every stage of the project.
*  TANESCO should consider u ing the road reserve instead of causing much pain to
people and incur huge compensz tion
* TANESCO should consider alt mative technologies other than lattice structure towers
that need 40m ROW. The space is too much in built areas. Try to use the technology that
will affect as less people as poss ble.

3.5   Ubungo Ward
The area to be affected in Ubungo ward is the area in Abiani Hamlet located at the corner
where Morogoro road joins Sam Nujoma road at the Ubungo traffic lights. In the public
meeting held, all people in the area attended even those not affected by the project. The Ward
Officer did not attend the meeting and a place to sit was a problem
3.5.1 Stakeholders concerns
After introducing the project to the residents, the residents had the following view and
questions or doubts:
* Why not use the underground cable to reduce social impact and reduce the compensation
costs? If not possible then the issue of compensation should be done properly and directly
to the affected person and not through the government.
* Our main concern is that when one gives land the owners end up desperate because the
compensation is not enough. What we want is a proper compensation.
* We would like to be educated on our rights so that we can have proper control over our
own property.
* We want the area covering the 40 metres to be clearly identified to know the exact people
to be affected.
* We have our loved relatives' graves; we request the area to be respected in case the area
falls within the area needed for the project.
* Before we are shifted we should be provided with plots to be sure where we will move to
* I want no plot but money because I am tired of this shifting. I want to go back home
because it seems now what remains is shifting from one place to another and I'm too old
and only waiting to die.
* I'm a tenant and landlords will be compensated. Therefore it will be very difficult for
tenants to get a house to rent for a short time of a month or two; therefore tenants should
be considered too because they will also be affected by the project.
* Compensation should be done in foreign currency since the government is paid in foreign
currency by the donor.
* For those living close to the transmission lines, how are we assured of our safety from the
electricity emissions if any?
* We would like TANESCO to use private valuers and make sure there is no valuation
done by estimation outside site, but should be done through visiting individual properties.
* We request that for every step of the project we should be informed and involved as it
started.
* Each house should be evaluated according to the ongoing prices of to date.
* We request that the compensation to be done in a meeting like this and not in government
office.
The Hamlet Chairman thanked the resident members and the TANESCO delegation for the
smooth running of the meeting and wanted cooperation in every step during the
implementation of the project

* Compensation should be done properly and directly to the affected person and not
through the government.
*  Provide education for the affectc people to know their rights over compensation of their
.           properties
*  Respect burial sites in case the a ea falls within the area needed for the project.
* New plots should be provided f r those wanting the plots before people are moved to be
sure where they will move to
*  tenants should also be considere because they will also be affected by the project
* If possible compensation should be done in foreign currency to take care for depreciating
Shilling
*  Evaluation should be done acco ding to the ongoing prices of to date
* The community and local leader should be involved in every step of the project
* Valuation should not be done y estimation outside site, but should be done through
visiting individual properties
3.6   Mlalakuwa area at Mikoc eni
Only three people will be affected n the propose line. One has a small house and the other
two own two big buildings. The house owners were not available during the time of this
study.
3.7   Msasani ward: Bonde la 11Ipunga Area
This area is recommended for an underground cable. The study team had to hold two
meetings on different dates in an e fort to get hold of real owners of the houses in the area.
Most of the house owners were not present they were represented by either house caretakers
or children. After the introduction of the project to the community members the speaker
invited the members to give their id as, concems, worries suggestions and wishes.
3.7.1 Stakeholders concerns
* One respondent requested to h ve a look at the map so as to be precise over the area
being discussed
*  Why not use the road reserve reas and leave us alone or we give 2.5 metres and road
reserve give 2.5.metres. Otherw se I am not willing to move out.
* Road reserve measurements are so varied in the area why?
*  The issue of unreliable power i very crucial I agree that we give out space for passage of
electricity cable.
*  One wanted to know if it is po sible to use the land with underground cable for parking
after cables have been placed.
*  We would like to know what m ill be the health effects of the underground cable if there
are any.

Reinforcement and Upgrade of Dar es Salaam, Kilimanjaro and Arusha Transmission and Distribution System Project
*  We suggest that during valuation of property together with TANESCO's appointed
valuers should be accompanied by independent valuer selcted by the affected person.
* Since majority of the residents claim that the road reserve is varied it is important for
TANESCO to liase with the Municipal council to clear the doubts.
* In case of compensation we want updated valuation.
3.7.2 Stakeholders recommendations
* Consider using the road reserve area alternatively they may consider giving 2.5m and and
road reserve should give 2.5 metres.
* Provide more information and assurance of health effects of the underground cable if
there are any and whether other uses such as parking cars can go on after the cable has
been laid down
* During the valuation of properties it is suggest that TANESCO's appointed valuers
should be accompanied by an independent valuer selected by the affected person to
protect the right of the affected person
* Compensation should follow the updated valuation costs
* Since road reserve width varies it is important for TANESCO to liaise with the
Kinondoni Municipal Council to clear the doubts
The second meeting was kind of chaotic- people were angry and not ready to listen to any
negotiation at the beginning and even some threatened to go to court in cases their property is
touched.
3.8   Kiwalani Ward
A short introduction about the project was given to the community members who attended
the meeting. Then resident members were told that the aim of the meeting was to make the
project known to them and as well as to hear their concerns suggestions and wishes. Then the
residents had the following views and doubts:
3.8.1 Stakeholders concerns
* Look into the prices of plots, construction costs, and the compensation has to enable us
build a house and not a hut.
* It is not fair shifting from one place to another. The experience I have with TANESCO is
that they pay well but the payment for compensation is delayed, thus we want payments
to be done once (no instalment payments) with promptness. Once the evaluation has been
done payments should not be delayed.
* When TANESCO is certain about the shifting dates we should be given sufficient time to
prepare ourselves to move out so as to avoid family disappointments.
* We would prefer to direct communication between TANESCO and us and not with the
government.
* Compensation payments and relocation plots should be given soonest after evaluation so
as to start preparation for shifting.

Reinforcement and Upgrade of Dar es Salaar | Kilimanjaro and Arusha Transmission and Distribution System Project
*  We were stopped to do any dev lopment projects on our plots and we are very tired over
such situation, so we want to be ertain if we will be shifted.
*  TANESCO will have to give u alternative plots for constructing a house, money for
building, and then give us tim for construction and preparation to shift. There should
also be payment of disturbance llowance.
*  We also request to be informed of all stages of the project and progress. We request that
everything that touches our live we should be informed.
* People want to know if they co Ild proceed with their planned development activities on
their plots. The answer was yes because the visit of the consultants was to introduce the
project and collect people's ide s, concems and suggestions and not to stop any activity
on the expected area.
*  TANESCO should connect our ouses in the new areas with electricity because where we
live now we have electricity.
3.8.2 Stakeholders recommenda ions
*  Compensation payment should e done without any delayed and not in instalment once
the evaluation has been done.
*  The affected people should be informed of shifting dates and given sufficient time to
prepare themselves to move out so as to avoid family disappointments
*  There should be direct comm nication between TANESCO and the affected and not
through the government.
* People should be assured of the project implementation rather than imposing the
psychological effect while the p oject is not going to take place
*  TANESCO should connect elec ricity immediately to new houses of the relocated people
* TANESCO should inform the a fected people of every stage of the project and progress.

3.9.1 Stakeholders concerns
*  One wanted to know who will ay people who constructed on the ROW of the TAZAMA
pipeline.
*  I'm too old now if I get transfer red where will I go to at this age?
*  Since the project will touch pe  le's lives, we suggest that proper evaluation of houses be
done and we also need a one ye r period of preparation.
*  The govemment should provid compensation of plots
*  I would like to be allocated a pl t right here in this very neighbourhood.
*  We would like to be involved i every process of the project.
*  We want all that which will e affected by the project to have representation in the

*  Far from effect of loosing residences our children will be affected, we request that our
youths be involved by providing them with casual labour during construction.
*  We've lived here for over 15 years. We have neighbours and schools so we would not
like to move far away from here. So we request that we be allocated plots within this
ward -An area called Mgeni Nani has enough land where TANESCO can get us plots.
* People with houses made of mud and wood and grass thatch should be compensated well
so as to improve their lives.
3.9.2 Stakeholders Recommendations
From the stakeholders meeting the following recommendations were suggested:
* Proper evaluations of houses need to be done and one year period should be given for
people to prepare their new homes after compensation.
* TANESCO Should find new plots at Mgeni Nani area to relocate Mbagala Kuu
affected people
* Affected people participation in every process of the project is highly insisted. Or at
least involve their representative in the project committee
* TANESCO and the contractor should provide casual jobs to the children of affected
people labour during construction
* The project should consider uplifting the values mud houses to help the poor improve
their lives.
3.10  Mchikichini ward
A short introduction about the project was given to the community members who attended
the meeting. Then members were told that the aim of the meeting was to make the project
known to them and as well as to hear their concems suggestions and wishes. Then the
residents had the following views and doubts:
3.10.1 Stakeholders concerns
During the meeting the affected people raised the following concems:
* We want to be compensated for our properties
* Allocate us a place to move and construct new houses
* We would like to be compensated with already constructed houses to avoid the pain
of constructing again. Given the fact that the majority here are poor if given money
might end up misusing money and family gets disrupted so it is better if we are given
ready house than hard cash for house construction.
* I would like to be given a plot at Mbweni in Kinondoni district.
* We are used to living close to all social services i.e. we don't need transport to got to
reach Kariakoo market, big shops, Muhimbili Hospital, Fish market/ferry or schools
for our children they just walk. That means moving us out of here will mean a
complete loss of our life style. Hence the compensation should consider all such
things and the disturbances that will be involved.
* Compensation of the house should not consider the type of house rather the person
should be compensated enough to enabled the construction of a comfortable home
and also consider costs involved in constructing a house of the same size today

*  Should we stop rehabilitatin our houses if one is planning to do so? The answer was:
No one has been stopped t do her his development activities in his premises stop
order will come later after v auers have assessed everybody's property.
3.10.2 Stakeholders recommenda ions
Generally the stakeholders had  imilar recommendation as their counterpart meeting.
However the following recommend tions need to be highlighted and insisted:
* TANESCO should consider compensation of house to house compensation for some
people in Mchikichini area as most people agreed on the idea of house to house
compensation. This is becau e majority are poor and if given cash money they might
end up misusing their mone thus disrupting their families.
*  When allocating new plot for the affected people, Mbweni area in Kinondoni
District, should be considere for the affected people of Mchikichini area
* Mchikichini area people should be given special consideration during the
compensation as they are oing to miss so many social services and environment
which are now available in their area such as walking distance to reach Kariakoo
market, big shops, Muhim ili Hospital, Fish market/ferry and schools for their
children
* Compensation of the house should not consider the type of house rather the person
should be compensated eno gh money to enabled the construction of a comfortable
home

3.11  Stakeholders Concerns
The following issues and concerns were raised during the meeting:

*  If my piece of land is affected i it possible to be refunded crops and be given a plot?
*  Will we be compensated a plot  d all the crops?

informed of amount to be paid efore payment so that we won't be paid less of what we
should be paid.
*  We request that all agreement regarding properties and property payments should be
done in writing
*  We are living in a place where fve have all the social services like water supply, schools,
health facilities and transport ervices. So wherever we will be moved to, TANESCO
should make sure the social am nities are available.
*  Is one allowed to buy his /her o In plot instead of being allocated by TANESCO?

3.11.2 Stakeholders Recommendations
Generally the stakeholders had similar recommendation as their counterpart meetings.
However the following recommendations need to be highlighted and insisted:
* Qualified valuers should be contracted to do proper valuation of their properties and
people should be informed of amount to be paid before payment is processed so that
they won't be paid less of what they should be paid
* All agreements regarding properties and property payments should be done in writing
to ensure nothing is twisted from the original agreement
* There should be a provision to allowed people to buy their own plot instead of being

* TANESCO should make sure the social amenities are available in the new
resettlement area

3.12.1 Stakebolders concerns
The stakeholder meeting identified the following issues and concerns:
*  If you consider compact and underground cable technologies as expensive have you
considered the cost of compensating people if you shift them?
*  We want compensation for our houses, be given plots, and be paid disturbance
allowances.
*  Some of us don't want to be shifted if there is an option it should be adapted. The issue of
psychological and social defects is not compensable.
*  I suggest the compensation of houses should be divided into two categories- the ordinary
-50 million and the best 100 million including other properties.
*  Have you prepared a place to shift us to?
*  The area to be allocated for those to be shifted should be properly demarcated so as to
avoid unnecessary land disputes.
*  In case of complaints who should we get in contact with?
*  What will happen if I don't want to shift?
*  We would like to know the decision on the three options of technologies you have on the
table.
*  We request the project to use underground cable so as to shift as few as possible.
* I'm worried about the valuers that they could be unqualified and end up undervaluing our
properties.
*  Are independent valuers allowed so as to compare the values?
* Try to look for a place to divert the line where people to be affected will be fewer.

3.12.2. Stakeholders Recommend tions
Generally the stakeholders had s milar recommendation as their counterpart meetings.
However the following recommend tions need to be highlighted and insisted:
* TANESCO should explore the cost of all technologies and compare the cost of
shifting people and the soc I pain individual is going to be impacted. The issue of
.              psychological and social def -cts is not compensable.
*  Compensation of houses s ould be divided into two categories- the ordinary -50
million and the best 100 mil ion including other properties
,  TANESCO should prepare a place to shift people under the Resettlement Action
Plan (RAP)
* TANESCO should establish a mechanism to deal with affected people complaints and
to conduct information diss mination
* TANESCO should make a ecision immediately on the right technology option of
every location to reduce an iety and psychological impact of the people in the project
route.
*  Mivinjeni residents request IANESCO to consider the use underground cable so as to
shift as few people as possi le
*  Independent valuers shoul  be allowed so as to compare the property values
recommended by TANESC    consultants
3.13  Kurasini Ward: Minazini
The meeting was held on 215' of Ja uary 2005 starting at 4.55 pm. A short introduction about
the project was given to the comm nity members who attended the meeting. Then members
were told that the aim of the meeti g was to make the project known to them and as well as
to hear their concems, suggestions and wishes. Then the residents had the following views
and doubts:
3.13.1 Stakeholders Concerns
The stakeholders meeting identifie the following impacts and concems that will result from
implementing this project:
* The first speaker started by thanking the TANESCO for involving the affected from
the very beginning of the project. What TANESCO need to know is that we will be
very much affected by the roject because we have tuned ourselves to live here our
life time. We have school c ildren here and we have our businesses here. This project
will cause us great harm ps chologically and particularly our children.
*  We would like TANESCO    compensate us satisfactorily to the point that we will be
able to live comfortably as t e are living here.
* The compensation should  e enough to enable some one construct a good quality
house as the one living in.
*  The compensation should t paid straight to the affected person and not through the
government so as to avoid eirnbarrassment and deduction of our money
*  1 have lived here too long a id I am too old for shifting. If comes the worst and I have
to shift, make sure the compensation covers all the disturbances including
psychological defects. But I am worried that this shifting will kill me.

*  I'm very much disturbed by this information, and have been unable to sleep. If there
is anyway to avoid shifting us please try the alternative way.
* If the project knows widows and widowers they will think otherwise. I suggest they
use the open space between the Military area and the Mwalimu Nyerere SABASABA
exhibition grounds. It will reduce costs for TANESCO as well as reduce people's
disturbances and wormes.
3.13.2 Stakeholders Recommendations
Generally the stakeholders had similar recommendation as their counterpart meetings.
However the following recommendations need to be highlighted and insisted:
* TANESCO should compensate people satisfactorily to the point that they will be able
to live comfortably as they are living now
* Special consideration should be given venerable group such as the widows and
widowers during the implementation of this project.
* TANESCO should explore every alternative possible including relocating the route
via Military area and the Mwalimu Nyerere SABASABA exhibition grounds so as to
reduce costs for TANESCO as well as reduce people's impacts.
3.14  Yombo Ward: Yombo Buza
The meeting was conducted on 22nd January 2005 starting from  1.45 pm. After the
introduction of the project and aim of holding the meeting the community members were
invited to discuss their concerns, worries, suggestions and ideas.
3.14.1 Stakeholders Concerns
The stakeholders meeting identified the following impacts and concerns:
* The first speaker suggested the use of underground cable to reduce disturbance of
people.
* The second speaker suggested the use of the open space of the TPDF and the
TAZAMA pipeline ROW to reduce the number of people to be shifted as well as
costs involved in shifting people.
* The issue of compensation is not only payments but involve lot more that cannot be
compensated. There has been too much of this shifting practice. TANESCO should
use the technology that needs less land.
* From today when will we be moved out? - The answer was that until the valuers have
done their job and the work is accepted by TANESCO and the donor, after payment
of compensation has been done and time to prepare the new homes has been expired.
* We want to be provided with plots and compensation of property.
* Buildings and undeveloped plots will be affected. Will the undeveloped plots be
compensated as well?
* I hope no one is going to take away my land without compensation.
* We want to know clearly the actual area where the proposed transmission line passes
to be sure of people who will be affected by the project.
* I want to be paid for my plot and compensation of my house and I will decide where I
want to shift to.

*  Who will pay the compens tion- the government or TANESCO? The answer was:
The govenmment will be inv lved to make sure rights are being done to everyone.
*  How if the graves are aff cted will they be removed or what is the fate of the
graveyards?
*  Our experience shows that ompensation is not done on time. We therefore request
that as soon as the valuatio is done payments of compensation should be done on
time.
* When valuation is ready pe( ple should be informed on their amount they will be paid
so that it is not easy for thos handling the payments to cheat on people.
3.14.2 Stakeholders Recommend tions
Generally the stakeholders had  milar recommendation as their counterpart meetings.
However the following recommend tions need to be highlighted and insisted:
*  It is the wish of majority of Yombo Buza residents that underground cable should be
used to reduce disturbance f people.
* TANESCO should consider re-routing the transmission line to the open space
belonging to TPDF and the TAZAMA pipeline ROW so as to reduce the number of
people to be shifted as well s costs involved in shifting people
* Beside compensation Yomb Buza residents should be provided with plots
*  TANESCO should clearly   marcate the actual routing so that people to be affected
by the proposed line are cle ly identified.
*  When the valuation is alrea y done people should be informed on their amount they
will be paid so that it is not asy for those handling the payments to cheat on people

surveyors had gone to the village t demarcate the area to be used for the transmission line.
In so doing the surveyors did not c nsult the owners of the farms and to make things worse
they even cut a number of trees  thout the owners permit. So at the time of meeting the
people affected were very angry w were forced to apologize before the start of the meeting
so as to put the situation under con 1.

would be compensated a house and a plot for building the house.

affected they would prefer to be compensated a ready built house to save them from
the hussies of construction which they had already completed.
* Some of the farms have fruit trees (mango, coconuts) that support the livelihoods of
the owners, the transmission lines will lead to the cutting of the fruit trees what will
be the future of the dependants on these trees.
* The people are worried that if the compensation is to be conducted by the government
the wont be paid on time and fairly so they would prefer to be compensated by
TANESCO or if the government will do the compensation we request that
TANESCO do the supervision of the compensation so as to ensure that the affected is
paid on time and the actual of his/her property.
* Many people don't know the market price of land so they would like to be informed
of it.
* The community to be affected requested to be informed of every step that is taking
place to put them in a proper position.

to be valued when they have already been cut?
* We request that the area covering 40 meters be made clear so that we know the actual
area and those to be affected.
* We request the valuers to be fare in valuing our properties especially fruit trees, they
should not undervalue our properties because this is what makes our livelihood.
*  We would like to be informed earlier about the coming of valuers so that information
can reach those who lives outside the area but have houses or farms/plots in this area
so as to avoid missing these people during valuation.

have trees that through painful efforts have grown very nice. I have also an animal
bans. This means starting afresh again and much more efforts are needed. I am really
bitter about this information.
* How if the house is partly inside the area in question, what will happen to my house?
Will I be compensated my house or part of it? And if part of it how do you expect me
to survive?
* In case of compensation we would like to be paid money for all our property and we
will decide on our own where to go to buy land and settle.
* We women and children will be the most affected in this process, If TANESCO pays
money to men it is very likely for men to disappear with the money and the family
will be left without a place to go to. We therefore request TANESCO if possible to
provide us with land /plot or we look for land and TANESCO pays for the land and
hand over the paid land to us rather than give hard cash which will end up misused
and the family becomes desperate and miserable.
Samaria Village
* I have a house trees I want compensation for my house trees and farm.
* I have a house, trees and water well. Will I be compensated all of my mentioned
properties?
* I have a house, trees and sisal plants will I be compensated?
* How if unknowingly I bought land that is in the reserve area for the existing
transmission line will I be compensated?
*  Since our village has never benefited from the electricity despite letting our land for
transmission lines, how can villagers benefit from this project? Can't the project help
our village get power? We want to feel the benefits of having the transmission lines
pass through our village.
3.21.2 Stakeholders Recommendations
Generally the stakeholders had similar recommendation as their counterpart meetings.
However the following recommendations need to be highlighted and insisted:
* TANESCO should be considerate when compensating the properties especially if part
of the house (like toilet) which is important for that house is taken away and there is
no another space to shift then the whole house should be compensated
* TANESCO in collaboration with local leaders should work together to ensure that
compensation benefits the whole family rather than men who may run away with cash
leaving their family to suffer. Such compensation should be plot to plot and house to
house.
* TANESCO should consider supplying electricity to the affected village such as
Samaria so that they see the value of development in terms of electricity supply
3.22 Mlangarini and Moshono Wards (Rural)
The meetings in these two wards took place on 4th February 2005. The concerned village
include Olkereyani Village in Moshono Ward with total population of 2,800 with 650

given to the community members w o attended the meeting, then members were told that the
aim of the meeting was to make t e project known to them and as well as to hear their
concems suggestions and wishes. T on the residents had the following views and doubts:
3.22.1 Stakeholders Concerns
The stake holder meeting identified he following concems about the project:
Olkereyani Village
* First speaker requested to kn w the procedure for compensation.
*  Why can't you look for an  ternative technology that will need less land rather than
stick to outdated technology vhich uses 40m thus affecting people enormously.
* For how long will TANESC D keep on shifting people and disrupting people's lives/
don't you think it is high tim to change the way of your practice and services?
* We would like to know if th re is any health effects from the transmission lines rays
emissions to the people livi g close to the lines. Please let us know so that we take
necessary precautions to avo d the effects.
* We request that the proje t should consider giving our youth casual labour
(employment) as one of th benefits of having the transmission line pass by our
village.
*  For compensation rather tha being given plots, we would prefer to be given cash so
that we purchase places of o r own preferences.
* Some of us think it is not a propriate to give people hard cash because experience
shows that when people are given cash they end up misusing money and leaving the
family suffering; in this res ct we think it is better to compensate people by giving
them a plot and money for (onstruction of a house and if possible close supervision
by govemment leaders to ma e sure the money is not divert to other purposes.
Mlangarini Village (rural)
The meeting was attended by the af fected villagers and three representatives from a mission
centre and two estates in the affecte area. The following were the concems:
*  For the existing transmissio line, the affected people were not compensated. Will
they be compensated now? Fhe answer was: We ere only concemed about the new
proposed transmission line t be constructed. The past project of the existing line is
over and the land was acquir d in different Land Act and Policies back in 1983.
* All my land is gone into Tj NESCO transmission lines what is the aftermath of me
and my family?
* Given life today it is very e sy to misuse money if given cash, so we ask TANESCO
to purchase for us a new la  to transfer us to rather than give us money for land so
that when we are given hous compensation it becomes easy to construct new houses.
* I was in the existing transm ssion line but was not compensated and could not move
out. I am still living there a d cannot move out because the family is very poor and
my father is old and serious  sick in bed. This family needs assistance to be able to
move out of this dangerous rea.

3.22.2 Stakeholders Recommendations
Generally the stakeholders had similar recommendation as their counterpart meetings.
However the following recommendation needs to be highlighted and insisted:
* TANESCO should do sensitization seminars about dangers of staying under the high
tension transmission lines.
* The project contractor should consider giving local youth casual labour (employment)
as one of the benefits of having the transmission line pass in their areas
* TANESCO should categorize compensation. There those who want to be
compensated with cash and those wishing to be compensated with another plots and
cash money and there those wishing to be compensated with house to house.
3.23  Kikwe Ward (rural)
The meeting was held on the 4"' February 2005. After a short introduction about the project
was given to the community members who attended the meeting, then members were told
that the aim of the meeting was to make the project known to them and as well as to hear
their concerns suggestions and wishes. Then the residents had the following views and
doubts:
3.23.1 Stakeholders Concerns
The stake holder meeting identified the following concerns about the project:
* How if my house is 5 metres after the reserve area will I be affected by the project?
The answer was: No.
* I think it is better if TANESCO takes all my piece of land and buy me another land
far way from the transmission line because it seems that this transmission and shifting
are on going processes as long as the demand of power grows.
* The transmission lines are passing through our village and so far there have been no
benefits of the transmission line passing through our village. What will the project
help so us to feel the benefits of the transmission lines passing through our village?
* I am building a house and has reached the level of linter should I stop the construction
or what should I do while waiting for the shifting? The answer was: Proceed with any
of your development activities in your premises because we did not come to stop any
activity to those who will be affected by the project.
* I have a house, chicken ban, cows ban and a toilet will I be compensated and be
helped to shift to another place? The answer was: Yes according to the Land Act of
1999.
* I have open plain land will I be compensated? The answer was: Yes.
* We also ask the project to give us casual employment during construction.
3.23.2 Stakeholders Recommendations
Generally the stakeholders had similar recommendation as their counterpart meetings.
However the following recommendation needs to be highlighted and insisted:
* TANESCO should consider supplying electricity to the affected village such as
Kikwe Village which has about three sources where Kikwe could be connected with
less than 4km of 33kV line so that they see the value of development in terms of
electricity supply

3.24  Hai District
The meetings were held between th 2nd February 2005 and 3rd February 2005. As usual after
a short introduction about the projec was given to the community members who attended the
meeting, then members were told th t the aim of the meeting was to make the project known
to them and as well as to hear their oncerns suggestions and wishes. Then the residents had
views and doubts raised.
3.24.1 Stakeholders Concerns
The stakeholder meetings identified he following concerns about the project:
Hai Mjini Ward: Mlima Shabaha Hamlet (Rural)
This hamlet was part of Masama R ndugai Ward, but since 2000 it became a hamlet in Hai
Mjini Ward. Very few people will e affected in terms of shifting and even compensation of
land. The team conducted a dial gue with individuals by visiting him or her at their
homesteads. The raised issues inclu e:
* 1 want to get support from I e project to enable me and my family survive, as is the
case before the project.
*  1 should be compensated m  two houses a plot for construction, a place/plot where I
can shift my graveyard.
*  I need compensation for rr houses and money to purchase another land/plot for
building a house.
Longoi Village (Machame Kusini Ward)
This is the village with 5 sub-villag s having a population of about 1670 people, out of which
780 are males and 890 are females and has 345 households. In this village only two people
will be affected whose houses will e affected. The rest will be affected on their land that is
open field without permanent crops The land is used for different crops production including
paddy and vegetable irrigation.
Ngosero Village (Machame Kusin Ward)
In Ngosero Village around 16 peo le will be affected and only two out them will have their
houses affected, the rest will be I d. Issues raised by the community members were as
follows:
* How if my whole land is af ected by the project where will I go to do my agriculture?
The answer was: You will e compensated of all your land but agriculture of short-
term crops is not forbidden n the transmission lines reserve area.
* How if I have permanent cr ps like banana trees, trees for timber, shade and fruits on
my land will I be compensa ed?
*  We request to be give     casual employment during the transmission line
implementation when it rea hes our village.

*  We suggest that instead of paying us hard cash TANESCO build us houses for those
whose houses will be demolished and hand us ready houses to save us from the
construction troubles and possibility of misusing money.
* Compensate me a house, a plot and my trees.
* Our Village have very poor roads; can't the project help us improve our roads as a
contribution to our village development?
* Will areas under village government that will be affected be compensated? If yes
what will be the modalities of compensating?
Masama- Rundugai Ward: Chekimaji and Rundugai villages
The community member had the following concems and views about the project:
* People are bitter over past experiences where after valuation of property it took so
many years before payment of compensation was done
* Are we going to be compensated our properties and are we going to be allowed to do
farming on the reserve area of the transmission lines? The answer was: Yes but
TANESCO reserves all rights of using that land without notice.
* Does valuation of land and property follow actual values or estimated depending on
one place to another?
* What is the value of one banana tree? The answer was: the prices can be found in the
department of agriculture
* We request to be paid immediately after valuation has been done to avoid devaluation
of shilling.
*  W e need electricity the project should help us get electricity.
* I am located about 20m from the reserve area; I would like to know the defects I get
being close to the transmission line.
Kawaya Village
In Kawaya Village only two people will be affected. The two owns open land no house will
be affected.
Kikafu Chini and Mijongweni Villages (Machame Kusini Ward)
These villages are located close to Kiyungi substation. The affected people had the following
comments and concerns about the project:
*  The new transmission line will affect trees, bananas, houses and land. Are they going
to be compensated? The answer was yes.
* I will be affected in terms of house, my crops, permanent plants and livestock keeping
I want to be compensated. I am a widow and I have children. I own a farm, a house
and permanent plants. What will be my family destiny? The answer was: You will be
compensated.
* Can the project help women to reduce poverty by providing them with loans to help
them develop small income eaming projects?
* Will I be given another plot after compensating my land and plants? The answer was:
No; the compensation is to enable you purchase another piece of land.
* Can the project help the villages where the transmission is passing by providing them
with clean safe water and health facilities where they are not available?

3.24.2 Stakeholders Recommenda ons
Generally the stakeholders had si ilar recommendation          as their counterpart meetings.
However the following recommenda ons need to be highlighted and insisted:
!   TANESCO      should categoriz   people who want cash money and those wishing to
have new houses built for the    so as to avoid future complain.
*   The project should consider mproving road infrastructure in the villages that will be
affected by the project as prj ct contribution to village development.
*   A study should be conducte     to find if there are any health effects to people living
close to the transmission line.
*   The project should institute s all income earning projects and providing soft loans to
the young and women to help them to reduce poverty.
*   The project should provide      me social services such as clean safe water or healtbh
facilities in the villages whh e the transmission line passes and there are no such
facilities.

Njiro ward is located in Arusha Mu cipal Council. The area of concerm about this project is
about 1.5km stretch long as you ar entering the Njiro substation (see the attached Map).
During the consultative meeting reg    ding to the new proposed 132kV transmission line, the
following concems were raised:
3.25.1 Stakeholders Concerns
>   Why don't consider utilizing the 30m-  y leave already in your possession?
)i  Consider constructing a new substatio  away from urban centres like Njiro and bring to the town only
33kV feeders which take small corridor ay leave
>   Wanted to know what TANESCO does to control the noise caused by the corona effect in 220 and 132kV
lines
>   Wanted to know if the construction of ew transmission line in their area will not affect them health wise
due to electromagnetic effects
>   Wanted to know compensation modalit and how is going to be implemented. Also wanted to know what is
going to be compensated
>   Some wanted to be given other plots on op of the compensation of their lost land and houses
>   Wanted to know the protect time frame o prepare themselves
>   Wanted to be assured that electromag  tic fields do not affect people living close to the 220/132/33kV
Njiro substation and the 1 32k\' transmi ion line
!>  Wanted to know why TANESCO do s not compensate people (customers) when their properties get
damaged as a result of over voltage or o er current
>   Project should provide knowledge t the local youngsters and provide temporary and permanent
employment to them
>   Project should consider using local mat ials whenever possible
' Whenever possible TANESCO should     e the underground cable at Njiro (and other urban areas) to reduce
the social impacts that will result if con  ntional overhead lattice steel towers are used

4.0 POTENTIAL IMPACTS A ND RESPECTIVE MITIGATION MEASURES
4.1   Analysis of the social - eco omic Impacts
The impact analysis is based on the 1ilowing criteria:
Likelihood - terms to be used inclu e unlikely, likely or certain which will refer to the level
of possibility that the impact will oc ur. Unlikely will mean that the possibility of occurrence
is limited or none because of the inh rent nature of the project and design to be used; likely-
will refer to the possibilitv that the mpact may occur and certain will mean that the impact
will surely occur irrespective of the reventive measures adopted.
Duration - this will refer to the lif of the impact. The terms to be used include short-tern
(0-5 years), medium- term (5-10 ye rs), long term more than 10 years and permanent which
will refer to the impacts that will ontinue life long even if the mitigation measures are
implemented.
Intensity - this parameter assess he magnitude of the impact or violation of a certain
standard. Degree of significance - this will incorporate the above mentioned parameters
(likelihood, duration and intensityi to determine how severe the impact will be. The
categories of these parameters will b low, medium or high.
4.2   Social Impacts associated With the 132kV power line construction
All the villages and hamlets wher the proposed transmission lines pass will be directly
affected by the project either positiv ly or negatively. There will be positive impacts in terms
of temporary employment opportu ities and petty businesses along the power line routes.
However, most of the expected imp acts are of negative nature which will require mitigation
measures to be put in place to coun er react the impacts on local communities in the project
area.
The more profound impacts will be n resettlement areas of Dar es Salaam where by if design
and technology to be used will b  40m corridor, many houses, businesses, shops and
workshops located along the propos d route are going to be affected. For Arusha and Moshi
line the only major impacts will be Dn agricultural land if there will be a restriction on land
use in the right of way.
The identified impacts will occur uring the construction and operation and maintenance
phases. For each identified signific nt impact mitigation measures have been provided. The
impacts are grouped in four categori s:
Impacts on the population
)i Relocation of people and the r properties
.  Physical presence of immigr nt workers
> Psychological effects and fal e expectations of jobs, access to electricity, etc.

Impacts on the subsistence systems
> Loss of agricultural land
> Loss of crops and harvests
> Loss of business opportunities and customers
> Loss of income
Impacts on the cultural and historical system
>  Interference with historical places and cemeteries
Other impacts
- Production of dust and noise
0 Interference witlh land concessions and ownership
4.2.1 Impacts on the population
4.2.1.1 Relocationt of people and their properties
The proposed routes will traverse population settlement areas in some places. For the safety
reasons a 40m wide right of way will be required in all cases if the steel lattice structure
towers are going to be used. 1 5m wide corridor if compact design tubular towers are used or
about 5m corridor wav leave if underground cable is used. In the right of way no residences
or any type of construction is allowed. In settlement areas getting such corridors without
relocating people is difficult, thus it will necessitate relocating a number of people to pave
the way for the construction of the transmission line.
The use of 40m right of way will relocate more people which means huge impact to the
population along the proposed line route. The use of 15m corridor will significantly reduce
the number of people to be relocated compared with a 40m way leave corridor. The use of
5m corridor will further reduce the number of people to be relocated. The relocation of
people causes many side effects even if someone is compensated.
Mitigation measures
> The project proponent should do a thorough survey to determine alternative routes that
will minimize the number of people to be relocated. As public consultation meetings
indicated, in spite of the cost of underground cable, TANESCO should think us using this
technology that will reduce the corridor to only 5m which can be laid in road reserve thus
preventing a mass relocation.
> The project proponent should open the dialogue with affected families to prepare and
implement the resettlement action plan that will involve the following:
o  Financial compensation for the loss of housing, land, crops, fruit and exotic
trees
o  Availing all social services needed to the new settlement area (hospital,
schools, water, electricity, transport, roads, etc.)
o  Ensuring that compensation is paid promptly and time to construct new
housing is provided before the demolition of houses is effected

Reinforcement and Upgrade of Dar es Salaanm Kilimanjaro and Arusha Transmission and Distribution System Project
o Continuous communi ation between the people to be relocated and the project
proponent should be maintained in corroboration with local authorities to
ensure that all affecte people have appropriately compensated and resettled
4.2.1.2 Physical presence of inznzigr tit workers
The spread of information about th implementation of the project will create employment
expectations in other villages in  e regions outside the affected communities. These
expectations may lead to an influx  f strange people to the local communities searching for
employment. This will increase the I elihood of conflicts and spread of diseases.
During the construction phase camy s will be installed along the selected transmission line
route especially the long route of Ai usha - Moshi T/L to house the workers involved in the
project. These workers will of cours interact with local population and conflicts of a socio-
cultural nature and the transmission f diseases may occur.
This impact is likely to occur though it w ill be short-term only during the construction works.
The impact is of high significance if here will be no mitigation measures in place.
Mitigation Measures
> Both workers and the local    ommunities should be subject to awareness raising
campaigns, so as to promote goo relations and avoiding the unnecessary conflicts.
>  Workers and the affected commi nities should receive special health care and health care
education particularly the spread of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and HIV AIDS.
If possible condoms should be a ailable and provided to workers.
>  If the contractor does not forese hiring a large scale local work force, he should take the
necessary measures to spread th = information so as to discourage the influx of strange
people to the local communities However, communities directly affected by the project
should be given the priority.
> The contractor and the project roponent in close cooperation with local leaders and
government authon'ties should h ye the monitoring system to observe the influx of people
in the project zone and procedur s to be followed in cases of the emergence of informal
population in project sites
4.2.1.3 Expectations ofjobs anid ac ess to electricity
During the consultative meetings, the majority of local communities especially in rural
setting accepted the project in expe tation that there will be huge compensation, project will
create jobs opportunities and they wi I get access to electricity.
This impact is very likely to occui It is expected to be short to medium term impact. If
mitigation measures are not put in place there will be significant complains and
dissatisfaction with the project.
Mitigation measures

Social Imipact Asscssment Draft Final Report



Reinforcement and Upgrade of Dar es Salaam, Kilimanjaro and Arusha Transmission and Distribution System Project
> As far as possible the compensation exercise should be transparent and the affected
people should be involved from the beginning to the end. Also the project should
incorporate the local work force as far as the job vacancies allow.
> In the contractor's contract, work places of the local community should be stipulated and
the recruitment and work conditions of the local work force should be carefully
monitored.
> If the hiring of local personnel is not foreseen the proponent (TANESCO), in
coordination with the local authorities, should hold meetings with the communities to
inform them about this fact and explain the reasons.
> As far as possible TANESCO should take initiative to provide electricity to the villages
along the Arusha - Moshi route as some of the villages like Kikwe, Kikafu chini,
Kawaya, Orkereyani and Ngosero have for some time now applied for electricity
connections. This measure will improve the project acceptance to the locals and in some
way improve the lives of the local population
4.2.1.4 Sociological loss
After staying for a very long time in their place they have developed friends, relations and
attachments with neighbours- if they move out of the place it means they will loose all these
long established relationships. Basically this psychological attachment cannot be replaced by
any amount of money paid. Currently some of the residents are closer to town, schools,
colleges, good roads, reliable transport, health facilities and many other services that are not
available in the new place they wvill be moved. The impact is likely to be permanent in some
aspects but may be reduced if mitigation measures will be put into place.
Mitigation measures
> The project should make sure that they provide all social amenities like school, road,
transport services, health facilities, power/electricity water supply, shops, etc. to the new
location where people will be resettled.
> If possible people should be resettled in the same district
> People should be given a chance to select a place to move to on their own rather than
being allocated a place with no preference.
> The affected people should be paid a disturbance allowance though it does not cover at
all their socio loss and psychological effects but people would appreciate.
0 In the resettlement area the underground cable should be considered so as to move as few
people as possible.

4.2.2 Impacts on the subsistence ystems
4.2.2.1 Loss of agricultural land
During construction phase, particul ly on the sites where the pylons will be erected, there
will be permanent loss of agricultur land due to the space occupied by the pylon and if any
the opening up of the access ro d to support construction logistics and subsequent
maintenance. This loss will create serious constraints for the local communities whose
subsistence is entirely dependent on griculture.
The impact is likely to OCCui and it vill be permanent for pylons sittings and for the access
roads. The level of significance is m dium but can be lowered through the implementation of
mitigation measures.
Mitigation measures:
> Financial compensation should e paid to allow the affected to purchase another piece of
land somewhere.
> Use the existing access roads w enever possible. Access roads should be allowed only
when it is necessary to do so.
o In case new plots will be pro ided by the project proponent (TANESCO), the plots
should be located near the affect d person residence
>  There should be no restriction  n using the right of way to grow short crops such as
beans, maize, paddy, etc. thoug  farmers should be made to understand that the land in
the right of way is no longer thei s
4.2.2.2 Loss of crops antd hari'ests
During the construction phase it ill be necessary to clear the access roads that traverse
agricultural fields. If this will hap  n before the harvest is done, crops and fruit trees still
unharvested will be lost causing co straining effect on subsistence and programmed family
income.
However, the impact will be only if it is done while the crops are still in the fields. In
addition for Arusha - Moshi T/L e sting access roads will be used while for Dar es Salaam
the biggest part is built up area rath r than agricultural fields. Hence no significant impact is
expected if mitigation measures wil be implemented.
Mitigation Measures
> Fair financial compensation for the crops should be paid the crops in the proposed right
of way. In addition local com unities should be informed when the project is going to
start so that they are not caught naware thus they decide themselves to plant crops or not
4.2.2.3 Loss of businiess opportunit es, incomtte and customers
The demolition of houses and relo ation of people during the construction phase will make
businesses located in the proposed  ansmission line corridor to be destroyed or to disappear.
This demolition will make busine owners to loose opportunity of making their business
prosper; business owners wvill loose ome potential customers, and will be denied opportunity
to continue eaming some income fr m their businesses. The new location does not guarantee
him/her of customers and business opportunity. The relocation may cause long term loss of
income.

Reinforcement and Upgrade of Dar es Salaam, Kilimanjaro and Arusha Transmission and Distribution System Project
The impact of loss of income to some people may be permanent and significantly huge.
Mitigation measures will help to reduce the significance of the project but may not eliminate
the impact altogether.
Mitigation Measures
0 The project proponent should provide fair financial compensation to businesses and
economic activities located in the proposed right of way as required by the World Bank
policy and the Land Act no 4 of 1999.
> If possible in collaboration with local government authorities the project proponent
should help to find new business locations for the displaced people similar or close to the
original location
4.2.3 Impacts on the cultural and historical system
Interference with cultural places and cemeteries
In the study area, family and communal cemeteries (burial sites) and place of worships were
observed. In addition, although no places of archaeological importance have been identified
in the project area, it is possible that during excavations, old objects of archaeological values
may be discovered. These places may be affected by the project if measures and locations for
pylons are not careful selected, thus causing conflict with the local communities.
The impact on these places may occur (likely) if care is not taken by involving the local
community and local leaders to identify all areas of concerns. The destruction may be
perrnanent. However, the impact is mitigated.
Mitigation Measures
0 All burial sites, familv or communal cemetery, should be identified in collaboration with
local, religious and traditional leaders and marked to ensure that they are avoided as
much as possible. In case it is found that the T/L will interfere with these places measures
should be taken to alter the direction of the route or change the seating of the pylon.
> In case a discovery of archaeological site is found during the excavation, measures should
be taken to notify the competent authorities that will provide further guidance.
i In case is not possible to avoid cemeteries and graves, excavation should be done after all
parties have reached the consensus in terms of reburial costs and other requirements have
been fulfilled and permission has been granted by concerned relatives, religious leaders
or community
4.2.4 Other impacts
4.2.4.1 Productioi of dust anid lioise
Vegetation clearing, movement of vehicles and the operation of heavy machinery will
increase of the levels of dust and noise causing nuisance and even health problems to the

community surrounding the project s tes. In spite that the impact will surely occur, the impact
will be short term and of low signifi nce if mitigation measures will be in place.
Mitigation Measure
The contractor should take measure to infonm the communities about the start of the work
and the time limit for the night time onclusion. Water Lorries should also be used to moisten
the works site in areas near pop lation settlements and the working hours should be
according to the law. Wheniever po sible, working at night, weekends and public holidays
closer to the settlements should be a oided.
4.3   Social-economic Impacts d ring Operation and Maintenance Phase
The socio-economic impacts during he operation and maintenance phase include:
0 Possibility of accidents with ocal population
>  Electromagnetic waves on h man health
0 Visual impacts
4.3.1 Possibilitv of accidents wvitl the local population
The transmission lines may pose g at danger to the surrounding population if they are not
informed about the potential dan  rs and precautionary measures are not in place. The
impact will likely affect all surroun ing settlement and communities around the project area.
The impact is potentially long tenm  nd if there will be no mitigation measures the impact has
medium significance.
Mitigation Measures
0- Awareness raising actions shoul be carried out, in coordination with the local authorities
and local leaders, to infonn the ffected and surrounding communities about the dangers
that a high voltage transnissioi line may pose. These awareness raising actions should
include security precautions to t adopted by the local communities as follows:
> To avoid children climbing the ylons
)i To avoid children playing with ites and catapults near the line
0 To avoid people seeking shelt r next to the pylons, particularly during the rain and
thunderstonns
> To avoid pruning of tall trees n r the power line cables
) To avoid the handling of cables hat has broken
0 To avoid rebuilding or building le\ structures in the right of way
4.3.2  Impacts of electromagneti waves on human health
Even though there are no concret scientific proofs, it is thought that the electromagnetic
waves generated along the transmi sion line may cause health problems to the people who
are directly exposed to thenm for a long period of time. The exposure limits stipulated
internationally define 5k\'Vm as te maximum allowed limit for human exposure. Thus
precautionary attitude should be maintained and measures taken that may avoid the
occurrence of possible effects of th se waves to human health.

Mitigation Measures
> The recommended safety distance from power line (way leaves) regarding the
resettlement of the population along the servitude of the transmission line should be
observed.
0   TANESCO in collaboration with local authorities should alert people about the risks that
may result from the establishment of residences in the right of way and under the power
line.
> Periodic monitoring should be carried out to ensure that no one is establishing a residence
in the right of way and under the power line.

Chapter 5
SOCIO-ECONOMIC MANAGE [ENT AND MONITORING PLAN
Socio-economic management plan (SMP) contains instructions that allow the project
proponent to integrate the socio iss s that emerge from the socio-economic assessment into
the project implementation process. TANESCO as the project owner is basically responsible
for the fulfilment of these instructi ns himself or through the consultants and contractors.
This SMP contains general and spe ific recommendations that collectively constitute a basis
for management of impact during th construction and operation phases of the project.
Role and responsibilities
The SMP serves to identify the rinciples, responsibilities, activities and things to be
monitored for an effective manager lent of the socio-economic impacts during the project's
construction and operation phases.
TANESCO is committed to ensu e that construction of the power lines is undertaken
according to the recommendations f this report. TANESCO is also committed to undertake
their work in such a way that is resp ectful to the local communities and to the law of the land
in the sense that health and safet of people, their livelihood and customer services are
protected and maintained. In that r gard it is a responsibility of TANESCO or through his
consultants to:
0 Advice employees and contractc rs of safety, health and environmental requirements, and
hold them accountable for poor erformance
0 Manage activities to minimize e vironmental and human health impacts
> Monitor, evaluate and report per ormance in safety, health and environmental protection
> Provide training when needed to protect human, environment, cultural and physical
resources
The responsibilities of the contracto among other things will include:
S Comply with the requirement f the SMP as a minimum standard to minimize socio-
economic impacts on affected cc munities
S Prepare and submit plans on ho  he/she is going to comply with socio and environmental
requirements during the implem ntation of the project.
> Be open to periodic complianc audits and provide the necessary information for such
purposes
Monitoring
The contractor and TANESCO sho Id draw up appropriate protocols for site inspection and
perforn regular audits that will allow the monitoring of adherence to environmental
requirement and good practice. TA ESCO staff should always participate in this process in
the context of institutional capacity uilding for environmental management.
Workers' and local communities' health and safetv management
As malaria and HIV AIDS are am ng the deadliest diseases in the project area, contractor
should prepare and implement a p ogramme to minimize the incidences of these diseases

Reinforcement and Upgrade of Dar es Salaam, Kilimanjaro and Arusha Transmission and Distribution System Project
among the workers and the local communities in the project area. The issues to be covered by
the programme should include:
> Measures to avoid the proliferation of mosquitoes in the construction areas
> Measures to avoid workers from contracting the disease, including awareness-raising
regarding its prevention and taking protection measures in the housing and eating areas
> Measures to detect and effectively treat malaria immediately after detection
> A continuous HIV AIDS training course for workers' information about ways of HIV
AIDS and STDs transmission through workshops, posters and informal information
sessions
>  Inciting workers to submit themselves to HIV tests
>  Inciting workers to submit themselves to STDs treatment in their initial phases to
minimize the HIV infection risks
>  Supply of condoms to the project areas
>  Drawing up of a detailed construction camp management plan, including among others
prohibitions, onsite behaviour rules
Environmental and monitoring training needs
Environmental management and monitoring require a knowledgeable staff in the fields of
environment and social issues so that they accomplish their monitoring roles. The training
may be needed in the areas of health, safety and environment to enable them in the first place
do awareness raising in project areas. Further, specialized training in social and
environmental management such as environmental and social audits should be provided.

Reinforcement and Upgrade of Dar es Salaar, Kilimanjaro and Arusha Transmission and Distribution System Project
Chapter 6
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOM          E NDATIONS
From the public consultations held  30 wards and villages, the general conclusion of how
people received the project informat on is as follows:
All communities to be affected r ceived the information with mixed feelings. Most of the
community members showed co plete anger and annoyance. They would not understand
why the Government did not pla the Right of Way before
Other members took the inforrn tion casually requesting for compensation of property
and a plot to build on
The areas owned by the rich  ajority were the most difficult to reach agreement and
despite the reduction of area to b used for distribution they found it difficult to let go any
piece of land
In the rural areas Kilimanjaro a d Arusha regions, some people will be without land to
support the family if the acquir d land will not be allowed for use to grow short crops
such as beans and maize
Most people now are more awar of their rights of their property than was the case in the
past
People have fear over the past xperience when people were resettled and not properly
compensated. This situation sh uld be avoided/ controlled as much as possible during
project implementation
6.1 Key findings
Majority of those to be affected by the project will have to let go either their houses and
business or their houses and lan or only land
Majority the people to be affec d are annoyed and angry over the whole idea of being
dislocated
Majority of people to be aff cted are concerned about their fate after relocation
particularly on the availability of the social services in the new places they will be
relocated
All people are worried of loo *ng their properties. They are worried that the whole
exercise will reduce them to tot I poverty especially when the compensation will not be
fair
All people are worred over th loss of their businesses and other income generating
activities
People are more concerned ove their psychological and sociological losses that cannot
be compensated by any amount f money
They believe that loss of neigh ourhood, friends and loss of a place one has grown or
used to and have become pa  of that area and community can not be replaced by
anything
People especially businessmen aiid women are worried of loosing markets
People with mud/wood grass th tch. old poor quality houses, are worried that they will
lead to them being discriminate and become poorer than they already are

It is not possible to identify specific ethnic groups in town because people don't live by
ethnicity but they live mixed. It is only possible to identify ethnic groups in the rural
areas
There was a diverse opinion regarding houses and plots compensation. Some wanted to
be compensated with money, others wanted to be given another plots while some wanted
to be given a house to house
The Ubungo -Mikocheni route had majority of people who were very resistive to the
relocation and insisted on project to use the road reserve and the underground cable
Majority of people in Moshi-Arusha route requested TANESCO to continue using the
acquired land to grow short and seasonal crops such as beans, maize, sunflower, paddy,
etc.
People want transparent valuation process, fair and prompt compensation. They do not
like compensation delays as happened to Airport expansion Project at Kipawa and
Kiwalani area
It is the wish of majority that project should relocate as minimum people as possible
either using present technologies such as underground cable in spite of the construction
costs or rerouting the transmission line since the social impact is so huge to them even if
they are compensated
6.2   Key Recommendations
The component of the reinforcement and Upgrade of Dar es Salaam, Kilimanjaro and Arusha
Transmission and Distribution System Project, which entails the construction of 132kV
transmission line, will have social impacts particularly in built areas. According to the
stakeholders meetings people and properties will be severely impacted. Generally, majority
are reluctant to be relocated though they will be ready to move if fair compensation is paid
and after being convinced that there are no alternative available to implement the project.
This is in line with everybody's recognition and acceptance that development for our country
is necessary for our current and future generations; however the development should be
sustainable by reducing social and environmental impact as much as is possible. In
understanding that fact the following recommendations have been made by the stakeholders:
a. Compensation should be done as soon as valuation of property is done so as to keep
up with shilling devaluation
b. Compensation should be done to the affected persons and not to relatives
c. Compensation should be made by TANESCO and not by the government
d. After the valuation the affected people should be informed of the value of their
properties (in a meeting the amount of each one has to be paid as compensation)
before payment is processed so as to eliminate /reduce the possibility of being paid
less than what each ought to be paid
e. Where there is a possibility of diverting the transmission line it is better to divert it
and use open spaces so as to avoid disturbing and dispersing families
87

Reinforcement and Upgrade of Dar es Salaam Kilimanjaro and Arusha Transmission and Distribution System Project
f. If possible use underground cable so as to shift as few people as possible or no
shifting at all
g. The project should try as ml ch as possible to avoid the relocation of the people by
working hard to use open spa es whenever and wherever possible
h. Generally speaking the reloc tion leads to lots of disruptions in someone's life and
any resistance instituted by t ose affected is very natural and understood
i. Affected people should be in olved in every stage of the project
j. TANESCO should consider sing the road reserve instead of causing much pain to
people and incur huge comp nsation
k. TANESCO should consider Iternative technologies other than lattice structure
towers that need 40m ROW. Fhe space is too much in built areas. Try to use the
technology that will affect as less people as possible
1. People should be assured of 1le project implementation rather than imposing the
psychological effect while th project is not going to take place
m. TANESCO and the contract   should provide casual jobs to the children of affected
people labour during constru tion
n. TANESCO should establish   mechanism to deal with affected people complaints and
to conduct information dissei ination
o. TANESCO should deal with people who are still living under the transmission line or
within the right of way of th existing transmission line for the safety of the people
and the operation of the line
p. TANESCO should consider upplying electricity to the affected village such as
Samaria so that they see the alue of development in terms of electricity supply
q. The project should consider mproving road infrastructure in the villages that will be
affected by the project as prc ect contribution to village development
r. The project should provide s me social services such as clean safe water or health
facilities in the villages whee the transmission line passes and there are no such
facilities
Further to the recommendations froi the stakeholders, it is recommended that
The affected showed different desi es for compensation. Some of them want compensation
for their properties in cash, others v ant compensation in terms of property by property i.e. if
a house or plot or farmn is affected hey should be compensated a house, plot/farm of samne

Reinforcement and Upgrade of Dar es Salaam, Kilimanjaro and Arusha Transmission and Distribution System Project
size. . Many affected are worried of messing up with money if paid in cash. Others want
compensation of plot and cash for the house and they will do the building on their own. All
their wishes should be seriously considered to ensure nobody's wishes are discriminated and
avoid unnecessary conflicts in future.
Given this situation it is recommended that intensive social survey should be made to identify
individuals' wishes by place/number and name before payment is done. This will help to
control/reduce any confusion and conflicts that can occur during compensation.
It is also recommended that the valuers should check the prices of plants particularly tree
crops from the Forestry and Natural resources department to get proper prices because the
affected are not bitter with the prices trees plants paid based on the prices from the ministry
of lands department Note a number of families get good income from tree crops like coconut
and mango meaning that when the crops are cut a source of income is removed thus affecting
the households livelihood therefore compensation should be satisfactory to put the family in
a comfortable position.
Implementation of Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP) and monitoring is
vital to the sustainability of the project. Both parties, project proponent (TANESCO) and
Contractor should ensure that they fulfil their responsibilities.
