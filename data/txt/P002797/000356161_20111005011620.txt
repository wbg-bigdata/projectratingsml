F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The main project development objective (PDO) was to develop Tanzania’s natural gas
reserves to produce least-cost power generation for domestic and industrial use in an

                                                ii
environmentally sustainable and efficient manner. The project aimed to promote private
sector ownership and management of generation in the gas and power sectors. In addition,
it was going to encourage increased access for the poor by developing financially
sustainable rural energy schemes to presently unserved areas along the pipeline corridor.

As discussed below, the original three PDO outcome indicators were refined during a
2007 restructuring. The targets of three of the four revised indicators (indicators 1, 2 and
3) were achieved and exceeded. Indicator 4 related to electrification in unserved areas
along the gas pipeline corridor was partially achieved (about 53% at project closing). In
addition, nineteen out of twenty intermediate outcome indicators were achieved by
project closing. Intermediate outcome indicator 7 was partially achieved (1,831 of the
targeted 3,435 households were electrified).

Revised Project Development Objectives (as Approved by Original Approving
Authority)
The PDOs were not changed during project implementation. Through a restructuring
approved by the Regional Vice President in December 2007, certain changes were
undertaken to the results framework. Most of the originally envisaged activities had been
completed in 2007 and the associated targets were achieved, and new activities had been
added leading to a revised results framework wherein the PDO and intermediate outcome
indicators had been refined to better measure the outcomes of the project. The original
PDO indicators were: (i) domestic gas consumption for electricity and commercial
production (Mmcf/d), (ii) local foreign and private investment in energy and gas
infrastructure: increasing US$5 million per year from 2004, and (iii) enabling
environment established to promote gas and/or electricity exports.

The three original PDO outcome indicators were refined since this restructuring to the
following four indicators: (i) weighted average energy cost for power generated in
Ubungo for domestic and industrial use (US$ per kWh); (ii) domestic gas consumption
for electricity generation and cement production (Mmcfd); (iii) new private entities invest
capital and own and operate project in the gas and power sectors; and (iv) percentage of
electrification in unserved areas along the corridor of the gas pipeline.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives, and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Country and Macroeconomic Context

1. At the start of project appraisal in 1997, the United Republic of Tanzania (URT) was
   10 years into its transition from a socialist to a free market economy, and in 1995 the
   country transitioned to a multiparty system and the first multiparty elections were
   held, moving the country toward being a fully democratic society. Economic reforms
   in Tanzania began in 1986, and by the early 1990s household surveys indicated that
   higher economic growth was reducing poverty. However, in the mid-1990s
   Tanzania’s reform program fell off track, resulting in high budget deficits, increased
   inflation, and low economic growth. In parallel, corruption increased significantly.
   In 1995 the Government of Tanzania (GoT) committed itself to a renewed effort on
   economic reform and expressed its determination to reestablish more positive
   relations with its donors and partners in development.

2. Following this turning point, the GoT embarked on a comprehensive economic
   stabilization program and introduced deep institutional and structural reforms,
   focusing on improving economic governance, providing an enabling environment for
   private sector activities, and enhancing public service delivery for poverty reduction.
   Growth consequently increased between 1996 and 2000, averaging about 4 percent.
   In line with the Government’s priorities, a new World Bank Country Assistance
   Strategy (CAS) was approved in 2000, when this project completed its appraisal. The
   project proposed to support the following Tanzania CAS’ objectives: (i) private
   sector and infrastructure development, to support the GoT’s objective of making
   private sector the engine of growth; (ii) sustainable rural development, to improve the
   livelihood of the majority of the poor who live in rural areas; and (iii) public sector
   reform and institution building, to increase the effectiveness of public service delivery
   and improve governance.

Sector Context

3. In the 1990s, when this project was prepared, Tanzania’s power sector faced several
   issues and constraints. The main constraint at that time, with an impact on the
   country’s economic growth, was a severe shortage of supply caused by a lack of an
   adequate hydro-based and thermal-based power generation mix. Between 1992 and
   2000 there had been several major shortages of electricity caused by poor rainfall in
   Tanzania’s then predominantly hydroelectric system, and there was no sufficient
   available back-up thermal generation. At the onset of the Songo Songo project,
   Tanzania had not yet explored any of its own natural gas resources, despite having
   been discovered in 1974 and, as such, one of the availability constraints of the
   thermal generation included the high costs of imported fuel oil for thermal operations.




                                             1
4. Another constraint at the time of final appraisal was TANESCO’s inefficient
   operations and weak commercial performance. Despite a cost-reflective tariff at that
   time, TANESCO had been unable to cover its operational and maintenance costs and
   debt service requirements. Revenue shortfalls had been due largely to weak
   operational performance and poor collection rates. Consequently, TANESCO’s
   overall performance had been poor, and the utility was unable to meet the growing
   demand for electricity or to significantly increase service coverage.

5. As TANESCO’s financials were too constrained to contribute substantially to an
   increasing sector investment plan, the GoT in the 1990s tried to unlock additional
   donor finances to bridge the increasing investment funding gap. However, at that
   time donor financial resources were also limited, and the development of private
   sector projects had been constrained by Tanzania’s weak balance of payments
   situation and TANESCO’s poor commercial performance. Need, however, was not
   limited, as the access-to-electricity rate was low, at only about 7 percent of the
   population. With only 7 percent of the population having access to energy, the
   necessary investment to meet the expected annual growth in the demand for power
   and to increase access to electricity during 2000–2010 was estimated in excess of
   US$500 million for generation, transmission, and distribution facilities.

Rationale for Bank Involvement

6. Prior to this project, the Bank had provided significant financial support to the power
   sector to assist Tanzania in meeting its power generation and other sectoral
   investment needs and to improve TANESCO’s operational and financial performance.
   In spite of these efforts, the reliability and quality of power supply had been major
   impediments to sustained investment and growth in Tanzania. Broad-based economic
   growth in rural areas had been particularly constrained by the lack of infrastructure.
   In line with the Government’s power sector strategy, International Development
   Association (IDA) support had been redirected through this project, with the objective
   to address some of the power sector’s major constraints consistent with the
   Government’s overall strategy at that time. The project consequently had been
   designed to take advantage of private sector management and technical expertise in
   the operation of the gas infrastructure system, and in promoting the development of a
   commercial market for gas.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

7. The development objectives of the project were to (i) develop the borrower’s natural
   gas reserves to produce least-cost power generation for domestic and industrial use in
   an environmentally sustainable and efficient manner; (ii) promote private sector
   ownership and management of the gas and power sectors; and (iii) encourage
   increased access of the poor to electricity supply by developing financially and
   institutionally sustainable rural power schemes to presently unserved areas along the
   corridor of the gas pipeline.




                                            2
8. The original key outcome indicators were as follows: (i) domestic gas consumption
   for electricity generation and cement production (Mmcfd): Increasing from project
   commercial start in September 2003 from 24 Mmcfd to about 30 Mmcfd in 2006; (ii)
   level of (domestic and foreign) private investment in energy and gas infrastructure:
   Increasing annually from 2004 by US$5 million; and (iii) creation of an enabling
   environment to promote efficient gas utilization: Establishing a transparent pricing
   mechanism for gas production and transport; providing open access to the pipeline
   for future gas producers and users; and regulating by contract to produce efficient
   transactions (until a gas regulatory function would be warranted).

9. In order to achieve the above objectives, the following actions were proposed at the
   onset: Songas, a limited liability majority privately owned and managed company,
   was established to develop, construct, own, and operate the project’s gas and power
   infrastructure. Songas was responsible for processing gas within the gas field at
   Songo Songo Island and transporting it by pipeline to Dar es Salaam to supply the
   Ubungo Power Plant (112 MW upgraded to 125 MW under the project), the Twiga
   cement plant at Wazo Hill, and other commercial gas users. Power produced at
   Ubungo was to be made available for sale to Tanzania Electric Supply Company
   Limited (TANESCO). Ownership of the Ubungo Power Plant was to be transferred to
   Songas, and its debt to be assumed by Songas in exchange for issuance of shares.

10. Under the project, a private sector joint venture consortium between PanAfrican
    Energy Corporation Limited (PAE) and the Tanzania Petroleum Development
    Corporation (TPDC) was established. It was responsible for developing and
    marketing gas to commercial and industrial users and for developing opportunities for
    exports to neighboring countries. Under the terms of the contractual agreements,
    Songas was obligated to transport gas to end users, applying a transparent
    transportation-pricing mechanism. Almost all of the revenues resulting from
    incremental gas sales (above those to the Ubungo Power Plant) would accrue to (i)
    TANESCO, and thus power consumers in the form of a reduced transportation charge,
    which would decrease the capacity payments to be made by TANESCO to Songas;
    (ii) the Government in the form of additional gas fees; and (iii) PAE and TPDC for
    the production and sale of gas in accordance with the terms of the production sharing
    agreement.

1.3 Revised PDOs (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and Reasons/justification

11. The PDOs were not changed during the project implementation. However, there are
    small differences between the the PDO in the PAD compared to the Development
    Credit Agreement (DCA). These differences are a matter of syntax, not substance.
    Through the December 2007 restructuring, certain changes were made to the results
    framework as most of the originally envisaged activities had been completed in 2007,
    and new activities had been added through the restructuring in December 2007.




                                           3
12. The refined PDO outcome indicators since this restructuring read as follows: (i)
    weighted average energy cost for power generated in Ubungo for domestic and
    industrial use (US$/kWh); (ii) domestic gas consumption for electricity generation
    and cement production (Mmcfd); (iii) new private entities invest capital and own and
    operate project in the gas and power sectors; and (iv) percentage of electrification in
    unserved areas along the corridor of the gas pipeline.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

13. As identified in the PAD, principal beneficiaries were (i) the existing and potential
    new consumers of electricity on the interconnected power grid system; (ii) the
    villages along the gas pipeline route; and (iii) the potential businesses and industries
    which may switch to use gas for commercial purposes. It was also expected that the
    project would benefit the Tanzanian public at large through increased fiscal revenues
    and by displacing imported fuels with indigenous gas.

1.5 Original Components

Component A

14. Songas (Main) Project Component (total US$273.5 million as follows: IDA US$161.5
    million EIB US$44 million AES Corporation 1 US$50 million, and CDC US$18
    million): This component supported the project objectives of developing the
    borrower’s natural gas reserves to produce least-cost power generation as well as to
    promote private sector ownership and management of the gas and power sectors. The
    Songas component supported a gas-to-electricity public-private partnership (PPP),
    which included (i) the development of the Songo Songo Islands natural gas field, (ii)
    the construction of a 70 Mmcfd gas processing plant, (iii) the construction of a 25
    kilometer marine gas pipeline and a 207 kilometer on-shore gas pipeline, (iv) the
    privatization (by Songas), conversion-to-natural gas, as well as operation of the 112
    MW (former TANESCO owned) Ubungo Power Plant, and (v) the supply of gas to
    the Twiga cement plant.

Component B

15. Environment, Social and Project Monitoring Component (total US$13.54 million as
    follows: IDA US$11.83 million and GoT US$1.71 million): This component financed
    the main environmental and social mitigation measures of the project that were not
    already financed by the project’s private investors supported by component A. One
    main social mitigation measure of this project was the provision of water and
    electricity to people affected by the project. This component supported the project’s
    objective of encouraging increased access of the poor to electricity supply by

  The AES Corporation’s equity funding in this component was taken over by CDC in 2003, when AES Corporation
sold its interests in the project.

   developing financially and institutionally sustainable rural power schemes to
   presently unserved areas along the corridor of the gas pipeline. The component
   originally included three main subcomponents:

   B.1 Wayleave Village Electrification Scheme (WVES)

16. As part of the compensation and social mitigation package of the project,
    infrastructure development of the affected villages was to be facilitated through this
    subcomponent. About 25 villages along the pipeline were to be provided with a total
    of 1,600 solar home systems. In addition, the existing national power grid was to be
    extended to reach 5 villages located near the northern end of the pipeline, to provide
    electricity to a further 135 homes and industries. Finally, gas laterals were to be
    extended in form of a Build-Own-Operate gas-based generation scheme by the
    private sector, to the townships of Kilwa, Masoko, Utete, lkwiriri and Bungo/Kibiti,
    where 500 kW gas-fired power stations had to be erected for supply of electricity to a
    total of 3,300 customers, of whom 2,100 did not have access to electricity before (in
    Kilwa Masoko and Ikwiriri, existing diesel stations operated by TANESCO were to
    be converted to run on gas).

   B.2 Resettlement Infrastructure Development Scheme (RIDS)

17. This subcomponent related to the financing of the project’s resettlement initiatives.
    The Government had designated Kinyerezi and Sala Sala (located in the Dar es
    Salaam outskirts) as resettlement sites for the families displaced along the gas
    pipeline route. The Government intended to upgrade and provide roads, install water
    supply systems and provide electricity access within these resettlement areas.
    Through those IDA co-funded measures under the project the resettled families were
    to benefit from infrastructure facilities that were at least equal but mainly better than
    those in their former locations.

   B.3 Environmental Management Plan Compliance & Monitoring Advisors

18. This subcomponent mainly supported the monitoring by the Ministry of Energy and
    Minerals (MEM) of the implementation of the project’s Environmental and Social
    Management Plan (ESMP) that was to be executed by Songas Ltd. under component
    A. The subcomponent financed a set of consultants assisting the MEM on behalf of
    the Government to establish and execute an appropriate compliance and monitoring
    program with regard to implementation of the ESMP. This included establishing a
    database and filing system appropriate for monitoring compliance with environmental
    and social safeguard policies and training and capacity building of Government staff.
    The consultants were to periodically visit the various construction sites and worked
    closely with the Government’s counterpart team from TANESCO, the MEM and
    TPDC.




                                             5
Component C

19. MEM Capacity-Building Component (total US$8.17 million, funded wholly by IDA):
    This component financed various technical assistance measures, training and
    equipment provided under the project to assist the MEM to strengthen its sector
    policy making function and to assist the MEM with the environmental, social and
    contractual oversight to be carried out in connection with the proposed project.

1.6 Revised Components

20. The original project components A and C were not revised.. However some activities
    (in component B especially) were revised without change in objectives taking into
    account a lack of private sector interest in the build-own operate gas-based generation
    scheme proposed under subcomponent B.1 and a failure to attract qualifying bids for
    the Solar Home Systems under the same subcomponent. In addition important cost
    savings under component A led to several project restructurings introducing new
    project components as follows:

New Component D

21. First Project Restructuring: May 2004, Board Level: The project’s DCA was
    amended to add a new project component D— conversion of 10 Wartsila 38
    generation sets from heavy fuel oil to gas firing. The new component proposed to
    finance the conversion of an existing, private-sector-owned power plant (Independent
    Power Tanzania Limited, or IPTL) to gas-firing ability. This restructuring was
    processed together with a closely related new emergency investment loan to the
    power sector (Cr.39160), which is the main reason why those changes were processed
    at Board level. (For further details, see under Section 2.2.)

Change in Scope of Subcomponent B.1

22. Around the time of the first restructuring in May 2004, this subcomponent’s
    implementation was significantly delayed. The outcomes of the related procurement
    processes for (i) the 1,600 solar home systems for 25 villages and (ii) gas-based
    generation scheme to 5 villages showed that the private sector was not interested in
    carrying out those activities on a build-own-operate basis as originally planned.
    Consequently, an alternative institutional structure was proactively developed under
    this subcomponent whereby TANESCO would implement the gas-based generation
    scheme with a single 7.5MW power station making use of natural gas from the Songo
    Songo gas pipeline.

New Component E

23. Second Project Restructuring: December 2007, RVP Level): The project’s DCA was
    amended a second time to add new project component E (Ubungo Expansion Project
    Capacity Charge Reduction). This proposed to support TANESCO’s expansion of



                                            6
   power generation capacity by reducing the capacity charges payable to Songas under
   the Ubungo Expansion Project. As in component D, this restructuring made use once
   again of the remaining substantial project savings under the project, this time after the
   original component A was fully implemented. The restructuring made use of project
   savings of US$43 million to reduce the cost of power purchases TANESCO incurred
   under the power purchase agreement with Songas Ltd. This restructuring was also
   consistent with the PDO, and since it was thereby only a reallocation of proceeds, this
   restructuring was approved at the RVP level. In addition, and to maximize the use of
   available project savings through this restructuring, several new technical assistance
   measures were also introduced, mainly providing financing for certain strategic and
   sectoral studies of TANESCO. Those technical assistances were included under the
   original components B and C.

1.7 Other Significant Changes

24. Major project changes are described in section 1.6 above. These were approved
    through various restructurings that are summarized in annex 10.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Project Preparation

25. This project was prepared over a relatively long time frame, with close to eight years
    between concept stage approval (December 1993) and Board approval (October
    2001). The main reasons for this longer than usual preparation time frame was a
    three year “preparation standstill period? called by the Bank, due to issues in the
    Tanzania power sector around another (non-Bank financed) independent power
    producer (IPP) project. Since this other project underwent an arbitration proceeding
    and its outcomes had some important effects on the overall power sector finances that
    were also relevant for the due diligent process under this project, the Bank put the
    preparation process on hold. Despite this longer time frame, the project preparation
    was continuously monitored, and underpinning background analyses were updated in
    the context of several management review meetings, including (i) two project
    appraisals (one in June 1996 and a reappraisal in September 2000); (ii) three Regional
    Operations Committees (ROC meetings in September 1993, May 1996 and April
    2001); and (iii) two Operations Committee (OC meetings in November 1993 and
    September 1995).

26. Project preparation of the main component A (the gas and power generation
    infrastructure component) was well prepared and supported by a large number of
    technical, financial, economic, environmental, and social studies.

27. Key lessons learned as noted in the original PAD were duly incorporated in the
    design of the project as follows:



                                            7
   a) Importance of fundamental reform to ensure power sector financial viability.
      Through the capacity building in component C, the project supported the GoT in
      its sector reform efforts at the time. The largest subcomponent under component
      C was for the financing of technical, economic, and legal advisors to the MEM,
      provided throughout the lifetime of the project.

   b) Importance of commercializing energy sector operations and promoting private
      sector participation: Through the introduction of a competitively selected private
      investor under component A, the GoT made efficient use of the private sector’s
      ability to design, build, and operate an important additional unit to power
      generation after securing a well-structured financial package with the support of
      the IDA and the European Investment Bank (EIB). The design of the main project
      component as a public private partnership helped to improve the efficiency and
      performance of the thermal power generation sector, with the Songas owned and
      operated plant regularly being at the top of the thermal generation dispatch orders
      by TANESCO since commercial operation began in 2004.

   c) Importance of making investment decisions based on technical, financial, and
      economic merits consistent with macroeconomic and sector development
      objectives. The preparation of this project followed a comprehensive least-cost
      planning analysis that confirmed that the power development program based on
      Songo-Songo gas was the least-cost for Tanzania. This is also underlined by the
      fact that up to project closure there have not been any contractual disputes
      between the GoT and the private investor, while other power generation projects
      entered into arbitration proceedings, some of which were ongoing at project
      closing.

   d) Importance of establishing an experienced, knowledgeable team to manage
      project implementation and adequate training to counterpart staff: The
      implementation of the project’s component A relied from the onset on the
      expertise of a private sector company, which established a strong technical and
      commercial team. The project design effectively leveraged the private sector’s
      knowledge and experience for a technology that was new to Tanzania as the
      project supported the first gas-processing, pipeline, and gas power generation
      facility in country. Component A was duly implemented with only a nine-month
      delay, which is partially attributed to certain changes of the procurement strategy
      that ultimately led to significant cost savings. While this lesson was applied well
      for component A, there were some important delays in setting up an adequate
      GoT team responsible for the implementation of component B (see also section
      2.2).

28. Overall the project was well prepared, given the complexity of its undertakings in a
    new energy subsector for the country. Preparation of component A was very
    comprehensive and solid, which ultimately was proven by the timely implementation
    of this component. Component B was prepared by applying the same lessons learned



                                           8
   as used for the preparation of component A, by focusing on the promotion of private
   sector participation, but in retrospect this preparation approach was proved not to be
   feasible.

Project Design

29. The development and utilization of a new domestic gas infrastructure for Tanzania
    required strong technical and commercial expertise that could ensure timely and
    reliable construction, operation, and maintenance of the new energy resource. Those
    requirements were addressed by the design of component A, relying on the private
    sector’s expertise, which was well integrated in a comprehensive set of contractual
    arrangements between the public and private sectors. Through this design choice, the
    development outcome of component A was achieved if not exceeded.

30. For certain subcomponents under component B, the design choice was only partially
    proven satisfactory. The original design of the Wayleave Village Electrification
    Scheme (WVES) under this component was based on the assumption that the private
    sector could be attracted to this rural electrification scheme. However, this concept
    was proven unsustainable during project implementation, and the design of this
    subcomponent was substantially changed. The new approach worked well, and the
    expected outcomes of this activity were partially achieved by project closing, but only
    after a much longer than expected implementation period.

Assessment of Risks

31. Overall the project risk was rated as Substantial at appraisal. Several risk factors were
    assessed and mitigation measures considered as follows:

   a) Government commitment to power sector reform is not maintained. This risk was
      assessed as Modest, and the following mitigation measures were proposed: (i) a
      government-agreed power sector reform plan under implementation by mid-
      September 2001; (ii) adequate progress toward unbundling and divestiture by end-
      2003; and (iii) institutional and technical support provided for the establishment
      of EWURA under a separate IDA credit. This risk did not materialize, since the
      GoT ultimately pursued a comprehensive power sector reform, which set up an
      independent regulatory agency (EWURA), established a new electricity act, and
      pursued a private sector management contract for TANESCO. The unbundling
      efforts initiated with the management contract eventually stalled, since the
      management contract was not extended and TANESCO fell back under public
      management. While certain reform efforts were thereby not leading to the
      expected results, they had no negative consequences on the project’s outcome.

   b) Interim steps prior to completion of the privatization program to improve
      TANESCO’s operational and financial performance do not materialize, thereby
      jeopardizing Songas’ financial viability. This risk was rated Substantial but did
      not materialize as the proposed mitigation measure of the establishment and



                                             9
       funding of a revolving liquidity facility efficiently back-stopped some late
       payments by TANESCO under the PPA.

   c) A stable macroeconomic environment (and liberalized foreign exchange regime)
      is not maintained. This risk was rated Substantial but did not materialize.
      Tanzania made significant progress during the project’s implementation time to
      achieve and maintain macroeconomic stability, becoming one of the best
      performers in sub-Saharan Africa. The economic growth had been around 7
      percent since 2000. Sound macroeconomic policies, market-oriented reforms, and
      debt relief had ensured a positive environment for Tanzania’s steady economic
      growth, which also benefited the implementation of this project.

   d) Gas and power infrastructure system construction delays with cost overrun,
      system not operated and maintained in line with international power and gas
      industry practice. This risk was rated Modest at appraisal and did not occur.
      While there was a nine month completion delay, it did not lead to any cost
      increases under the originally planned budget. There were neither issues of
      operation nor maintenance occurring during operation.

   e) Adequate managerial, technical and financial capacity in place to ensure WVES’
      commercial viability. This risk was rated Modest. Proposed mitigation was
      private sector run gas-based electricity and solar home schemes under the WVES
      subcomponent. As already described, this original design of the subcomponent
      involving the private sector had to be fundamentally revised. Consequently this
      risk materialized and the mitigation measures foreseen were proven insufficient to
      avoid a substantial delay in implementation of this subcomponent.

Quality at Entry

32. In 2002 a Quality Assurance Group (QAG) review was done for the quality at entry
    of the project. Overall, the quality at entry assessment of the project was rated
    Satisfactory by QAG, mainly justified by a strong project rationale and
    acknowledgment that preparation was done by a strong task team that was able to
    keep up with a very complex and sometimes uncertain deal over a long period of time.

33. The ICR team comes to the same rating conclusion, mainly given (i) the adequacy of
    appraising the country context, (ii) background studies and analysis of the energy
    sector, and (iii) alignment of the project and its development objectives with the
    objectives of the GoT at the time of preparation. The design of component A with a
    strong focus on private sector involvement proved to be strong, leading to a timely
    implementation and achievement of project outcomes in 2004. At the same time, the
    design of the WVES subcomponent under component B in retrospect was proven
    wrong and the original misconception led to important delays of the project’s closing
    date, which could have been avoided by a more careful preparation of this
    subcomponent. However, given the relatively small size of this subcomponent and
    taking into account that the ultimate outcomes of this electrification scheme were



                                           10
   substantially achieved by project closing, the overall quality at entry rating remains
   Satisfactory.

2.2 Implementation

34. The Songo Songo Gas Development and Power Generation Project (hereafter Songo
    Songo project, or the project) was approved on October 9, 2001, and became effective
    on November 27, 2001. The project was restructured three times with closing dates
    extended accordingly to complete components B and the new components D (later
    dropped) and E. These restructurings were also used to utilize savings of about
    US$78 million achieved through competitive procurement under component A.

35. The implementation of component A was overall satisfactory and without major
    delays. The gas-processing plant and converted power generation assets were
    commissioned in 2004 with only a nine-month delay. While the total project cost
    estimates for component A were indicated with US$274 million at the time of
    appraisal in 2001, the final costs contracted under this component amounted to only
    US$232 million. Including formerly planned but un-used contingency amounts and
    interest during construction, the total cost savings under the IDA credit in 2004
    amounted to about US$78 million at the then applicable SDR exchange rate.

36. The significant cost savings were achieved through a modified procurement strategy.
    The initial project costs used at project appraisal in 2001 were based on bid prices
    received during an initial tendering of the equipment carried out in 1997. While this
    initial tendering was cancelled after the project was put on hold in 1997, during the
    final appraisal of the project in 2001, the task team used the former bid prices
    received as the applicable cost estimates. This approach was confirmed by the
    Quality Enhancement Review in 2001 as being adequate. When the new tendering
    was carried out in 2001, the project’s sponsors decided to change the bid strategy for
    the gas infrastructure packages by allowing qualified contractors to make combined
    offers for the gas pipeline and the gas production/processing facilities. This revised
    strategy resulted in significantly lower prices than estimated at appraisal, which
    ultimately led to the important cost savings under this project.

37. While the implementation of component A was overall swift and in accordance with
    the original plan, component B’s implementation faced several challenges
    throughout the project’s lifetime and was one of the main reasons for the extension of
    the original project closing date by an aggregate of more than four and half years. At
    the onset of project implementation, the responsible project management unit (PMU)
    for this component situated at the MEM was set up with a significant delay of more
    than a year, due to a slower than expected hiring process by the MEM. This initial
    delay of the PMU establishment consequently had an impact on the implementation
    schedules of all other activities supported by the IDA credit in components B and C.

38. The second major implementation issue that arose under component B was the
    required redesign of the WVES subcomponent (see previous section). When the
    revised concept for this subcomponent was agreed between the Bank and the GoT in


                                           11
   2003, implementation responsibility was given to TANESCO, which immediately set
   up a special implementation unit. Despite this new implementation arrangement, now
   designed as a TANESCO-owned infrastructure, the implementation process
   continued being delayed. Consequently during the Mid-Term Review in 2004, the
   Bank team suggested to TANESCO that it outsource certain WVES components
   situated on Songo Songo Island to Songas Ltd., which then assumed the
   implementation of the water and electrification infrastructure on the island. In
   addition, the Bank agreed with GoT on a revised and accelerated implementation plan
   of the remaining WVES components. It was only at the end of 2005, four years after
   the project’s original approval date, that all major contracts for the WVES were
   procured and under implementation. At that time already 90 percent of the original
   activities supported by the project were duly completed under component A.
   However, cancelling component B and closing the project was not an option given its
   importance for the livelihoods of the affected beneficiaries.

39. While the construction of the WVES work started in early 2006, additional hurdles
    further delayed the implementation of this subcomponent, including some unforeseen
    changes to the power plant site conditions in Somanga and an unexpected realignment
    of road works adjacent to the electrification lines, which required additional
    compensation for rerouting of the line.

40. The implementation of another subcomponent under component B, the Resettlement
    Infrastructure Development Scheme (RIDS) experienced a similar delay that had
    mainly the same root causes earlier outlined for the WVES, including (i) an initial
    delay caused by the set up of the MEM PMU, (ii) slower than anticipated
    procurement execution, and (iii) several construction issues during implementation.
    The RIDS subcomponent was completed in 2008 and further assessment of its
    impacts are described under section 2.4 below and annex 11.

41. The implementation of component C was initially delayed by the late set up of the
    PMU supported by component B. At the same time, implementation of the main
    activities accelerated during the original lifetime of the project and additional
    capacity-building measures were added to this component when the project was
    further restructured in 2007, and these were duly implemented by the final project
    closing date.

42. The formerly mentioned significant project savings realized under component A led
    to two important restructurings of the project in 2004 and 2007, which resulted in the
    introduction of two new components: component D in 2004 and component E in 2007.

43. When component D was introduced to the project in 2004, the power sector in
    Tanzania faced a major power generation shortage crisis, which was caused by the
    fact that TANESCO was unable to pay for expensive fuel oil imports for thermal
    generation assets to mitigate important hydropower generation shortfalls. To lower
    its generation and power purchase costs, TANESCO wanted to increase the use of
    natural gas provided by Songas for the operation of existing thermal generation assets,



                                           12
   which led to the introduction of this component. Subsequently, the preparatory
   studies for the design of the conversion were duly implemented and the supported
   works were ready to be procured. However, the implementation of this component
   could not start since the gas supply capacities of the project-supported Songo Songo
   infrastructure had already reached its maximum level, and it was therefore uncertain
   if sufficient gas supplies would become available. While processing capacities were
   ultimately increased, by optimizing the operation regime of the existing infrastructure,
   the associated IPTL plant’s private owners subsequently got into a legal dispute with
   TANESCO under its power purchase agreement and filed an ICSID arbitration case.
   Those legal disputes continued up to the project’s closing date, which ultimately led
   the GoT to request that this component be dropped and to use the cancelled credit
   proceeds under the IDA’s new investment lending reform procedures to transfer those
   amounts to another IDA-supported energy sector project. This transfer was approved
   through the last project restructuring in December 2010.

44. In 2003, because of the continued delays in increasing energy access as well as the
    continuing power crisis, GoT requested the use of project savings for the addition of
    component D, and also requested the preparation of another component under this
    project supporting important transmission and distribution rehabilitation works for
    Tanzania, in line with the wider objective of this project to improve the power
    sector’s overall performance. Various preparation studies for this potential new
    component were subsequently undertaken and financed under component C. In 2006
    TANESCO faced yet another power generation shortage crisis, which further
    impacted TANESCO’s financial performance when it again had to rely on expensive
    thermal emergency generation measures at a time when retail tariffs had remained
    unchanged for several years. At that time the Bank revisited its ability to further
    support TANESCO and the sector with additional financial assistance, and the
    decision was taken in 2007 to prepare a separate, new project supporting the earlier
    requested transmission and rehabilitation efforts. The separate IDA project approved
    in 2007 was the Tanzania Energy Development and Access Project (TEDAP).

45. At that time the newly available savings amounts, earlier earmarked for the
    transmission and distribution rehabilitation works under this project, were proposed
    to be used for a capacity charge buy down (as described under section 1), which led
    to the creation of component E under this project. This component was implemented
    within one year.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation, and Utilization

46. The M&E design was appropriate for the project and included relevant outcome and
    measurable intermediate indicators with baseline targets. Through an RVP-approved
    restructuring in December 2007 certain changes were undertaken to the results
    framework considering that (i) most of the originally envisaged activities had been
    completed in 2007 and (ii) new activities had been added through the restructuring in




                                           13
    December 20072. The revised results framework (RF) also refined the PDO indicators
    and intermediate outcome indicators to better measure the outcomes of the project. In
    the revised RF, the team also anticipated the new Bank core indicators and
    reformulated the wording in some of the indicators subsequently cleared by the Africa
    Region’s Core Operations Services (AFTOS; formerly AFTQK).

47. Quality data was collected by TANESCO and Songas throughout project
    implementation. Data reporting on component A was done effectively by the Songas.
    After the restructuring of component B, the quality of the reporting was also
    satisfactory. Data collection for components C and E was satisfactory. Component D
    was cancelled and data was not collected.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguards

48. Overall compliance with applicable safeguard policies (OP4.01, OP4.36, OP4.11,
    and OP4.12) is considered satisfactory. Since 1993, 29 environmental and social
    research studies, investigations, and impact assessments have been conducted to
    identify possible negative impacts associated with the activities supported by this
    project. The private sponsor had prepared environmental and social assessments and
    a management plan report that synthesize the related impacts of the project and
    provided a detailed environmental and social management plan (ESMP) for
    eliminating or mitigating and monitoring these impacts. There were limited
    environmental impacts on forests, fauna, and seagrass beds along the marine part of
    the pipeline. The major impacts of this project related to resettlement and land
    acquisition. The conversion of the Ubungo Power Plant from a liquid fuel to a gas-
    firing operation had a positive environmental impact. The environmental impact
    assessment and the ESMP were consistent with the requirements for a category "A"
    project under IDA Guidelines. Key environmental and social safeguards issues that
    arose during implementation are described in annex 11.

Fiduciary

49. Financial management and procurement aspects of the project were continuously
    rated Satisfactory or Moderately Satisfactory throughout project implementation.
    Overall, financial management covered adequately the project’s accounting and
    reporting arrangements, internal control procedures, planning and budgeting,


2
  The original PDO indicator measuring the processed gas output under component A was kept, but also complemented
but a second indicator relating to the outcomes of component A and the expected outcomes of components D and E,
which all contributed to lower than existing costs to TANESCO under its power purchases. The original PDO indicator
relating to private sector investments was also kept but reformulated since the original target values of US$5 million
private sector investment per year starting in 2004 had been achieved and exceeded by 2007, when more than US$30
million had already been invested in the sector. The PDO indicator relating to component B was refined and aligned to
the Bank’s expected energy CORE indicators regarding rural electrification.




                                                         14
   counterpart funding, funds flow arrangement, external audit reporting arrangements,
   and project accounting staff issues.

50. In addition, all project components were implemented following the Bank’s
    applicable procurement guidelines for works, goods and services. This included
    procurements under component A, which was implemented by the private sector,
    through the application of World Bank procurement guidelines for the provision of
    major works and goods under this component. The important cost savings under
    component A were generated after the project’s sponsors decided to change the bid
    strategy for the gas infrastructure packages by allowing qualified contractors to make
    combined offers for the gas pipeline and the gas production/processing facilities.
    This change in the procurement strategy was reviewed and approved by the Bank’s
    authorities.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

51. The infrastructure financed by component A has been well operated and maintained
    since 2005 by Songas Ltd. The current contractual provisions in place between
    Songas, the GoT, and TANESCO obligate the private company to continue ensuring
    proper operation, availability, and maintenance during the next 13 years. The
    necessary funds for the operation and maintenance of the gas-processing plant and
    power generation assets are sourced from the gas and power sales revenues.

52. The infrastructures, financed by component B (mainly the RIDS and WVES) are duly
    completed. With regard to the WVES infrastructure of the 7.5 MW Somanga power
    station and related transmission lines, this equipment underwent a substantial
    overhaul during commissioning and has only recently started operation. TANESCO
    acquired a set of spare parts for this infrastructure at the start of operation and will
    finance future maintenance and overhaul expenditures from its corporate budget.
    TANESCO staff had also been adequately trained for the operation of the Somanga
    power station, and as the national grid operator it is well qualified in the operation
    and maintenance of the grid infrastructure supported by the project. The RIDS
    infrastructure has been duly handed over to the district authorities of Kinyerezi and
    Sala Sala and future maintenance of the roads and water infrastructure will be carried
    out by TANROADS and DAWASA, respectively. With regard to the Songo Songo
    Island community jetty rehabilitation works, the financing of this outstanding activity
    has been secured through the World Bank Tanzania Transport Sector Support Project
    (TSSP).

53. The project’s component C significantly strengthened institutional capacity in
    government agencies and in the private sector through multiple technical assistances,
    which had all been duly implemented by project closing. The experience gained by
    agencies such as the TPDC allowed them to implement or prepare other projects in an
    effective manner with several potential successful transactions in the making.




                                            15
54. The success of component A led to a further expansion of gas production and further
    investment in generation capacity as well as related investments elsewhere. Songas
    Ltd. recently received approval by the regulatory authority EWURA and the GoT to
    expand its processing facilities by two additional trains, which will double the current
    capacities. The institutional strengthening in the national natural gas sector, mainly
    supported through component C, has been well received, and the enhanced sector
    framework led to additional projects and private investments in Tanzania’s mineral
    resources sector. The domestic market for natural gas in Tanzania is still small but it
    has a good potential for growth. During the project’s implementation there have been
    significant offshore gas discoveries. It is expected that the deep offshore gas
    development will be a game changer for Tanzania, with first production in
    approximately 10 years.

55. While the Songo Songo project provided satisfactory support to the development of
    the full value chain of the initial natural gas resources discovered at the time of
    project preparation, the private sector is preparing a gas upstream development for the
    offshore discoveries based on export of liquefied natural gas (LNG). The
    Government needs to start building additional capacity immediately to make timely
    policy decisions on using these promising large quantities of gas resources. The
    World Bank, therefore, recently has been requested by the GoT to support its efforts
    in building additional capacity in this new environment of deep-offshore gas
    exploration. The Bank’s Africa Energy Team (AFTEG) in collaboration with the
    Sustainable Energy Group–Oil, Gas, and Mining Division (SEGOM) recently started
    preparation of a follow-on project to the Songo Songo project supporting a
    comprehensive technical assistance program (ESCAP project), which builds on the
    overall good results and outcomes resulting from this closed project.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation

56. The Songo Songo Gas Development and Power Generation Project made a significant
    difference. The objectives of this project were well aligned with GoT’s CAS
    objectives at the time of original appraisal supporting the former CAS objective of the
    promotion of sustainable growth. In the context of the current Tanzania CAS which
    pursues the promotion of inclusive and sustainable private sector-led growth and the
    provision of infrastructure and deliver services including increased access to
    electricity, the objectives of this project remain highly relevant today. In addition,
    during the implementation of the project in 2003/2004 and 2006 as well as this year
    (2011) the power generation from hydropower resources has been severely curtailed
    by regional drought. As a result, if it wasn’t for the Songo Songo project there would
    be even more severe shortages of electricity today and an even more significant
    impact on the sector’s finances if the country’s thermal generation assets were to rely
    entirely on costly imported fuel.




                                            16
57. The Government also commented positively on the project’s relevance. According to
    the Government, “The project has been able to provide reliable power supply to the
    country at the time when the petroleum prices in the world market were rising and
    increased in volatility, and coupled with bad hydrology in the country that made
    contribution from hydropower low.?

58. Consequently, the continuing high relevance of the Objectives also reflects positively
    on the overall design of the project by choosing the private sector’s efficiency for the
    implementation of the main component A. While it is acknowledged that the design
    of the WVES subcomponent under component B should have followed a different
    approach from the onset, the subsequent adaptation measures proactively pursued
    during implementation have led to an overall satisfactory outcome. Relevance of
    design is rated substantial.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

59. The achievement of the PDOs is overall rated Satisfactory. The outcomes achieved
    with regard to the project’s objective in developing the borrower’s natural gas
    reserves to produce least-cost power generation have clearly been realized, and
    outputs assessed at project closing strongly exceeded the targets made at preparation.
    While the original target value for this PDO indicator was set at 30 Mmcfd, the target
    value achieved at closing was around 75Mmcfd. The achievement of this objective of
    the project can therefore be rated as Highly Satisfactory. The second objective, of
    promoting private sector ownership and management of the gas and power sectors,
    has been achieved as well and has led to a Satisfactory outcome, with outputs that are
    in line with expectations. Finally, the third objective, which aimed at encouraging
    increased access of the poor to electricity supply in presently unserved areas along the
    corridor of the gas pipeline, has also been achieved, though taking into account that
    one of the output targets with regard to rural electricity connections was only partially
    met, this objective’s achievement is rated Moderately Satisfactory. Further
    justification of those ratings is given in Annex 12, by describing the main outputs and
    their contribution to the PDO outcomes.

Development of the Borrower’s Natural Gas Reserves to Produce Least-cost Power

60. Thirty years after the first discovery of natural gas in Tanzania, through the support of
    this project the first natural gas processing and transport infrastructure became
    operational in Tanzania, in 2004. In addition, in that same year Tanzania was able to
    make use of this natural gas for power generation purposes, thereby significantly
    reducing the operational costs of thermal power generation supply in country.
    Furthermore, soon after the start of the operation the natural gas production by the
    project’s facilities further increased and in the last two years of the project’s
    implementation phase regularly exceeded the outcome indicators of domestic gas
    consumption for electricity generation and cement production as previously
    mentioned.




                                             17
61. The view of the GoT is that the Songo Songo project performed well during the six
    years of operation. The project also stimulated gas markets; 35 local industries were
    connected for gas, replacing the use of heavy fuel oil and other types of petroleum
    fuels. From the environmental perspective, the project has significantly reduced air
    pollution by reducing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. It has been
    estimated that 1.8 million and 0.73 million tons of CO2 were reduced from power
    generation and local industries respectively since 2004 and up to December 2010.

Promotion of private sector ownership and management of generation in the gas
and power sectors

62. During the implementation phase of this project, from 2001 until closure in 2010,
    other private investors have invested in both the petroleum, natural gas, and power
    subsectors. According to the GoT, in the upstream petroleum and gas sector, GoT
    and TPDC managed to enter into 23 production sharing agreements (PSAs) with
    exploration companies, and this culminated in more natural gas discoveries both
    onshore and offshore—including those in deep water. In addition, and while
    component A was still under implementation, Songas Ltd. also decided to expand its
    power generation capacities initially funded through Songas equity. Songas currently
    operates 189 MW of natural-gas-fired generation assets in Tanzania. Finally,
    following the PPP model structure of this project, the GoT in 2006 also managed to
    attract a private investor, Artumas Ltd., for the early development of another gas field
    in Mtwara, which to date supplies a gas-fired power generation station of 12 MW
    with an isolated grid serving the cities of Mtwara and Lindi as well as several rural
    villages. Just by applying the investment of US$35 million made by Artumas Ltd. up
    to 2006, the original PDO outcome indicator of US$15 million in new private
    investments was already met and exceeded by the original closing date. In conclusion,
    the successful structuring and implementation of this project helped to create an
    enabling environment to promote efficient gas utilization and power generation. This
    environment ultimately led to an increased level of (domestic and foreign) private
    investment in the energy and gas infrastructure.

Encourage increased access of the poor by developing financially sustainable rural
energy schemes to presently unserved areas along the pipeline corridor:

63. While the very positive outputs under component A were clearly leading to a
    successful outcome of the first two objectives, the achievement of the third objective
    needs some more detailed explanation. At original approval in 2001, the key
    performance indicators that were to measure achievement of this objective related to
    the electrification initiatives under the WVES subcomponent under component B.
    While the main outputs under the WVES related to the number of people connected
    to electricity services in townships (target of 3,300), other planned outputs also
    included the provision of 30 water wells, 1,600 solar home systems and 2MW of gas
    based generation assets installed. As previously mentioned the WVES subcomponent
    subsequently underwent a significant design change and expected output targets were
    adapted to this new design and further refined during the project restructuring in 2007.



                                            18
   After the restructuring output indicators related to the WVES kept the original target
   of people connected, the number of water wells and increased the amount of gas
   based generation assets from 2MW to 7.5MW. At the same time the output target of
   the 1,600 solar home systems was no longer measured due to the design change. At
   project closing those revised main output targets were all achieved except for the
   number of targeted people with access to electricity. This output target was only
   partially achieved at closing with 1,464 customers for the WVES and a total number
   of connections of 1,831. The main reason for this lower output target is explained by
   the late completion of the related electrification infrastructure as further explained in
   annex 2. Taking into account that most outputs were achieved and that a financially
   and institutionally rural power scheme was ultimately built as per the original PDO,
   but also acknowledging that one main output target was only partially achieved, the
   ICR team concludes that the achievement of this objective is Moderately Satisfactory.

3.3 Efficiency

64. Efficiency is rated substantial, based on excellent economic and financial results but
    also taking into account the four year extension needed to complete component B.
    The economic analysis of the project is detailed in annex 3. Table 1 below shows the
    economic internal rate of return (EIRR) and the net present values (NPVs) estimated
    during project appraisal as reflected in the PAD and at the time of the preparation of
    this ICR. The result shows that the project is still economically viable and has
    contributed to improve the economic welfare in Tanzania.

              Table 1: ENPV/EIRR and FNPV/FIRR for Component A

                           ENPV (at 12%)         EIRR   FNPV (at 12%)         FIRR
    Estimation in PAD          179 Mil           26%         63 Mil           21%
    Estimation in ICR          423 Mil           35%        166 Mil           20%

65. In comparison with the estimation in the original PAD, the project has achieved better
    economic results than projected during original appraisal. The Financial Rate of
    Return (FIRR) has been slightly lower than expected at original appraisal, which can
    be explained mainly by the reduced capacity charges the private company received
    after the capacity buy-down was applied and financed through this project’s
    component E. Overall the project has generated substantial economic and financial
    benefits. More detailed information about those outcomes is given in annex 3.




                                            19
3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

66. The overall outcome rating is Satisfactory, based on high relevance of objectives,
    substantial relevance of design, satisfactory achievement of outcomes, and substantial
    efficiency.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes, and Impacts

Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

67. Because of the relationship between power supply, economic development, and
    poverty alleviation, the project intended to contribute to the reduction of poverty by
    unlocking an important and genuine new source for power generation. While the
    power cuts that occurred during the various generation shortage crises had an impact
    on the country’s economic growth, those negative impacts would have been even
    larger without the project’s implementation. It is therefore likely that the project’s
    main component positively contributed to poverty alleviation.

68. In addition, while the implementation of the rural electrification scheme was sub-
    optimal, the activities under component B nevertheless contributed positively to the
    improvement of the lives of the affected people in the project’s wayleave. According
    to the Government, “The project has improved socio-economic life in rural areas
    especially for those electrified villages and township whereby the nature of income
    generation had shifted from non-electricity dependent to electricity dependent such as
    seafood processing and storage in Island and part of Kilwa Masoko.? Similar positive
    effects could also be recorded after the completion of the RIDS, which has brought
    benefits to affected people along the wayleave and resettlement areas whereby 13
    kilometers of roads, 24 kilometers of water distribution lines, 1.2 kilometers
    telecommunication line, and 18 kilometers of power lines were put in place.

Institutional Change/Strengthening

69. Various studies financed under component C show that the project positively
    contributed to the strengthening of the gas sector regulatory framework. Since 2006
    the regulatory authority EWURA has been fully functional and assumes regulatory
    responsibility for the gas and petroleum sector’s mid and downstream activities. At
    the project’s closure the MEM had also prepared and submitted for approval a new
    gas act, which currently is under review by the attorney general. Moreover the
    project also helped in strengthening the capacities in the various project-
    implementing agencies and mainly within the MEM. The Bank approved a MEM
    capacity-building program in two groups in November 2004. Between 2004 and
    2005, 42 employees successfully attended various courses in the region and abroad.
    MEM also financed a portion of TANESCO’s capacity-building program by using
    proceeds from the MEM components B and C. At the same time it must be noted that
    most of those institutional-strengthening measures supported by the project were


                                           20
   implemented with a certain delay limiting the project’s impact on the sector
   framework in the earlier years of implementation.

Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

70. As mentioned previously, the volumes of natural gas processed for power generation
    and industrial usage increased significantly and at a much faster pace than originally
    anticipated. Because of the availability of gas, many businesses expanded capacity
    and made investments that might otherwise not have occurred. This also meant
    increased employment and other ancillary benefits, which were not originally
    foreseen by the project, at least not in that magnitude.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

71. There was no beneficiary survey done in the context of this ICR. However, during
    the ICR mission, the ICR team interviewed a random sample of beneficiaries of the
    Wayleaves’ rural electrification program, and it was reported that the introduction of
    access to electricity and water in the villages had made a tremendous difference to the
    well-being of the villagers.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Negligible to Low

72. The risk to the development outcome of this operation is overall Low. With regard to
    the natural gas and power supply objective, it is clear that the project has supported
    installation of the gas processing facilities, gas transportation infrastructure, and
    power generation assets that will sustain their operation over the long term as agreed
    in the contractual agreements between the private sector company and the GoT.
    Further, measures are being taken to increase the use of natural gas in country,
    including new deep-sea off-shore drilling projects undertaken by several private
    sector companies. It has been proposed that those new exploration efforts will be
    supported by the Bank through various technical assistance measures in form of a
    follow-on project, currently under preparation. In that sense the exploration,
    production, and usage of natural gas in Tanzania is now a core element in Tanzania’s
    energy and industrial sector.




                                            21
5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

73. A quality-at-entry review was performed by the QAG in 2002. The QAG report
    issued in August 2002 came to the conclusion that the overall quality at entry for this
    project can be rated as Satisfactory, as discussed in para. 32. At the same time the
    ICR team noted that the QAG report raised an important number of follow-up
    questions and recommended a stage two review. However, the task team at that time
    responded with comments to the QAG report that gave detailed answers and
    additional information to the issues raised by the QAG. Since a stage two review did
    not occur in the follow-up to the original report, the ICR team assumes, that the
    additional information and answers given at that time were considered satisfactory.

74. While an overall Satisfactory rating is justified, given the positive project outcomes
    and timely implementation of the project for most of the activities, the ICR team also
    noted that the efforts made by the task team at preparation with regard to the main
    activities under component B could, in retrospect, have been stronger. The
    fundamental redesigning of the WVES subcomponent demonstrates that his activity
    was not ready for implementation at the original Board approval. Equally, the ICR
    team reviewed the preparation of component D and notes that the component was
    ultimately cancelled, implementation not having started after several years. The ICR
    team comes to the conclusion that the preparation of component B was still
    Moderately Satisfactory and the preparation efforts for component D were overall
    satisfactory. This assessment with regard to component D is based on the fact that the
    ultimate reasons hindering the implementation of this component are related to legal
    disputes that were outside the Bank’s control and that, in the ICR team’s view, were
    not necessarily foreseeable at the time of approval to this component D.

Quality of Supervision

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

75. The quality of supervision is judged less than satisfactory mainly due to certain
    shortcomings in supervision relating to component B and to a smaller extent with
    regards to component C. Since the project closing date was ultimately extended by a
    total of four years, bringing the implementation time frame to over eight years under
    the leadership of as many as four different World Bank task team leaders over the
    duration. Significant changes in team composition throughout a long implementation
    period were certainly one of the causes for delays in the Bank’s responsiveness to
    implementation issues under both components. In addition, certain delays on the
    implementation of component B might also have been avoided had supervision been



                                            22
   more intense and closer to the ground in the early years of implementation. In this
   regard, the Bank eventually made the right decision by putting in place a resident task
   manager for the sector starting in 2006.

76. Given the long duration, and complexity of the project, it is remarkable that overall
    there were no major issues with the fiduciary and safeguards policies, which were
    adhered to and supervised relatively well by the Bank team. It is also acknowledged
    that with regard to component A and component E the Bank team facilitated a smooth
    implementation of those components. The various task teams also demonstrated
    proactivity and flexibility with regard to the important cost savings that arose under
    component A and adaptability with reference to component B. Ultimately, close to
    all targets were met and in some cases exceeded by project closure.

Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

77. In view of the Bank performance at entry and during supervision, but also weighing
    the importance of supervision in this project slightly higher, the ICR rates the overall
    performance of the Bank as Moderately Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

78. The government performance hereunder is assessed based on the performance by
    central government stakeholders of the project, including mainly the MEM but also
    the MOF as borrower on behalf of the United Republic of Tanzania. While the MEM
    also held an important role in the implementation of the project, the MEM’s project
    implementation performance is rated in the following section with regard to the
    assessment of the day-to-day management of the project by the PMU.

79. The Government’s commitment to the development objectives was overall strong
    during the preparation phase and also during most of the implementation phase.
    Further evidence that the Government remained committed to the project throughout
    the implementation phase is that at project closing, except for component D, all
    activities had been duly completed and most of the project outcomes were achieved
    with mainly satisfactory results. The MOF provided good support to the project,
    including certain tax exemptions and adequate counterpart funding, though
    sometimes with certain delays in taking action.

80. At the same time there were a number of areas of improvement that result in a
    Moderately Satisfactory rating. With regard to the MEM, there was a significant
    delay of more than a year in setting up the PMU. In addition, during the



                                            23
   implementation of the WVES’ transmission lines there was also an important delay
   due to disagreement between different government departments regarding the
   crossing of the Rufiji River by using a road bridge. While there were several
   initiatives and interactions between the MEM and the Ministry of Infrastructure
   Development (MOID), this issue was only resolved by the prime minister at the
   behest of the Bank after a two year delay.

81. There was also a mismatch between the tariff regime for rural electrification and
    affordability of the connection for rural poor. Tanzania has a unified countrywide
    tariff, and people in rural areas pay the same tariff as more affluent people in Dar es
    Salaam. Finally, the IPTL project preceded the Songo Songo project and was to be a
    private-sector-led emergency power generation project using heavy fuel oil. The
    Government’s design of this project was flawed as both the tariff and the cost of fuel
    proved to be too onerous very soon after the plant was commissioned against the
    advice of the Bank. As a result the project fell into dispute and continues to be under
    litigation at present.

Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

82. The project was implemented mainly by Songas Ltd. (component A) and the PMU
    under the leadership of the MEM (components B and C). In addition, TANESCO
    increasingly assumed an implementation role within the WVES subcomponent under
    component B and after the restructuring of 2007 with regard to several technical
    assistances in component C and full responsibility for the execution of the buy-down
    financed by component E. While Songas Ltd. has legally not been directly a
    borrower of the IDA credit (credit was passed on to Songas by the MOF and MEM),
    the private company played an important role in implementing the main part of the
    project. Consequently Songas’s implementation performance is also taken into
    account in this implementing agency assessment and later in the overall borrower
    performance.

   Songas Ltd. Implementing Agency Performance

83. Songas Ltd. managed to successfully implement a technically complex project with
    only a very minor delay. Throughout the implementation process, Songas ensured
    great efficiency in implementation, which also led to important cost savings under
    the overall project, following a strategic change in the procurement process. In
    addition, Songas Ltd. duly followed the World Bank procurement guidelines and
    managed to maintain high level of transparency and information provision throughout
    this large procurement, involving several high value lots. The company was also
    prepared to take over certain WVES activities from MEM situated on Songo Songo
    Island, including the construction of the water and electrification infrastructure on the
    Island. Overall the ICR Team therefore assesses the implementation performance by
    Songas Ltd. as Satisfactory.



                                             24
   GoT Implementing Agencies Performance

84. Both GoT implementing agencies faced serious procurement capacity constraints
    throughout the project, which led to delays in the hiring of advisors and subsequently
    also delayed the implementation of the various, works, goods, and services financed
    by the project under component B and component C. Despite additional assistance
    from the Bank through the financing of additional trainings and advisories to both
    implementing agencies, the procurement functions at the PMU and later at
    TANESCO improved only slowly over the years.

85. The delays that occurred in the set up of the PMU then also had an impact on the
    timely submission of project monitoring reports and lack of capacity to prepare timely
    and complete quarterly progress supervision reports in early years. In addition, when
    the PMU situated at MEM transferred the implementation responsibility of the
    WVES to TANESCO, coordination issues occurred and led to a suboptimal transition,
    which created further delays. Similar coordination issues between the MEM and
    TANESCO were noticed with regard to the handling of payment requests from
    contractors employed on the WVES infrastructure.

86. The overall performance by the GoT implementing agencies is therefore rated as
    Moderately Unsatisfactory, taking into account the lack of timely actions in several
    cases that led to substantial delays that could otherwise have been avoided.

Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

87. Taking into account both overall ratings attributed to the Government’s and the
    implementing agencies’ performance, the overall performance of the borrower is
    rated as Moderately Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

88. The following lessons were among the most significant:

   a) The skill sets required for the power generation and gas components are different
      from the skill sets required to design and implement rural electrification.
      Component A dealt with large corporate entities, heavy engineering, and
      technologically sophisticated approaches. The experience and skills required to
      design and implement a project such as this are quite different from those required
      for rural electrification where the TTL deals with small-scale investments, and
      rudimentary technologies and intense social issues. Comingling the two
      components into one project under one TTL raises the question of a mismatch of
      skills.

   b) Project implementation planning must acknowledge different time frames needed
      for different types of project components. There is a strong imperative to
      complete large, capital-intensive projects on time, otherwise losses and penalties
      could be significant, whereas small-scale rural and rural electrification projects by
      their very nature involve social issues and several different constituencies and are
      likely to take much longer. Thus it is important that in future projects, the Bank
      examines closely the rationale of comingling these types of components under the
      same project.

   c) Social services and infrastructures for new sites where affected people are going
      to be relocated need to be in place before the process of relocation takes place.
      Due to the delayed completion of the RIDS certain project affected people
      preferred to sell their assigned plots rather than moving to an incomplete
      resettlement site.

   d) For innovative project implementation structures that have not been previously
      tested a market sounding before or during appraisal should be envisaged. The
      initial shortcomings of the design of component B may have been avoided, if the
      Task Team had been able to test the interest of the private sector on those
      electrification schemes during appraisal.

   e) Optimization of procurement strategies can lead significant project saving. The
      application of innovative procurement strategies led to substantial cost savings
      under component A.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

Borrower and Implementing Agencies

89. The borrower in its own ICR report raised the issue that approvals by the World Bank
    on procurement were not granted in time, thus contributing to delays in project
    implementation. While the ICR team could not verify the statistics of all the
    procurement decisions under the project, it is likely that there may have been delays
    on some procurement cases, especially before the TTL was relocated to the country
    office.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

COMPONENTS                              MAJOR OUTPUTS
                                        This main component in terms of project cost has been complete
                                        since 2005: the gas-processing plant, gas pipeline, and power plant
                                        have been constructed, and gas-fired thermal power is being
                                        produced. The component’s outcome indicators have been exceeded
                                        since original Board approval, as the gas-processing plant is
                                        producing more gas than originally anticipated. The Songo Songo
                                        Island gas infrastructure and the pipeline to Dar es Salaam have
                                        become a major backbone in Tanzania’s power generation mix, since
                                        Songo Songo Island gas is providing the necessary fuel to run up to
Component A: Gas                        60% of the country´s generation dispatch.
Infrastructure                          The gas-processing plant at Songo Songo Island has been operating
                                        in the past 24 months (mid-2009 to mid-2011) on average beyond its
                                        full-crated capacity of 70 Mmcfd. The plant operated around 75
                                        Mmcfd at project closing and the maximum processing volume in
                                        2010 was reached on September 10, 2010 with a total volume of 92
                                        Mmcfd. This included a processed volume of 75.98 Mmcfd for
                                        power generation and an additional 16.39 Mmcfd of gas for
                                        Tanzanian industries (including 3.96 Mmcfd of protective gas for
                                        Twiga cement and 0.2 Mmcfd for one additional industry generating
                                        its own power: TCC).
Component B: Social and
Environmental and M&E
                                        Around the time of the first restructuring in May 2004,
                                        subcomponent B.1’s implementation was significantly delayed. The
                                        outcomes of the related procurement processes for (i) the 1,600 solar
                                        home systems for 25 villages and (ii) gas-based generation scheme to
                                        five villages showed that the private sector was not interested in
                                        carrying out those activities on a build-own-operate basis as
                                        originally planned. Consequently, an alternative institutional
                                        structure was developed under this subcomponent whereby
                                        TANESCO would implement the gas-based generation scheme with
                                        a single 7.5 MW power station making use of natural gas from the
      B.1. Wayleave Village             Songo Songo gas pipeline.
      Electrification Schemes
                                        This subcomponent, as amended, was duly completed before the end
                                        of the project on December 31, 2010. Main outputs included the
                                        following:

                                            Somanga Power Station: The power plant was completed in
                                             August 2010 and early commissioning of all three units occurred
                                             at that time. Shortly after commissioning, the contractor of the
                                             electrical equipment, Renco Spa, discovered that due to the long
                                             storage of the electrical equipment on site,3 all three units
                                             needed some operation and maintenance work. The overhaul of
                                             all three units started in a phased manner in fall 2010. Phasing

                                       was programmed in such a way that the plant could be kept
                                       running at all times to satisfy the maximum demand on the
                                       plant, which was about 1.8 MW (1 unit) at peak at project
                                       closing. The complete overhaul was finalized in mid-2011. The
                                       initial low level of load is due to the delay in new connections,
                                       as explained in the following.
                                      Gas based 33kv and LV transmission linesto Singino-Bungu-
                                       Utete towns (Gas Based Electrification Scheme): The few
                                       remaining stringing works on the mainland’s electrification
                                       infrastructure were completed just before the closing date in
                                       December 2010, and the entire Wayleaves’ transmission and
                                       distribution infrastructure was energized before project closing.
                                       Due to the late commissioning of the power station, customer
                                       numbers and new connections had not reached levels as set by
                                       the project target values. According to TANESCO, customers
                                       had been reluctant in the former years to pay the connection fee
                                       and get connected to the grid without having comfort that the
                                       related Somanga Power Station would be completed. However,
                                       in the few months before closing, the numbers of connected
                                       customers started to improve and had reached a level of 1,464
                                       for the WVES and 1,831 overall at closing. Overall the utility is
                                       confident that the number of customers can be steadily
                                       increased.

                                   Dar es Salaam outskirts) as resettlement sites for the families
                                   displaced along the gas pipeline route. This subcomponent was

                                   people from the pipeline wayleave have sold their properties to move
                                   to other areas of Dar es Salaam, since the infrastructure upgrade
                                   works were delayed for some years. At the same time, the people

                                   This subcomponent mainly supported the monitoring by the Ministry
                                   of Energy and Minerals (MEM) of the implementation of the
                                   project’s Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP) that
                                   was executed by Songas Ltd. under component A. The
B.3. Environmental Management
                                   subcomponent financed a set of consultants assisted the MEM on
Plan Compliance and Monitoring
                                   behalf of the Government to establish and execute an appropriate
            Advisors
                                   compliance and monitoring program with regard to implementation
                                   of the ESMP. This included establishing a database and filing
                                   system appropriate for monitoring compliance with environmental
                                   and social safeguard policies and training and capacity building of


                                                 29
                                 government staff. The consultants periodically visited the various
                                 construction sites and worked closely with the Government’s
                                 counterpart team from TANESCO, the MEM, and TPDC.

                                 This component financed various technical assistance measures,
                                 training, and equipment provided under the project to assist the
                                 MEM in strengthening its sector policymaking function and to assist
                                 the MEM with the environmental, social, and contractual oversight
                                 to be carried out in connection with the proposed project. All
Component C: Capacity Building   MEM’s procured consultancies have been fully implemented by the
                                 project closing date and final deliverables were submitted before
                                 December 31, 2010. Equally, all contracts under this component
                                 related to TANESCO technical studies were also fully implemented
                                 before the project closing date, and final deliverables have been
                                 submitted as well in time.
                                 Subsequent to the introduction of component D during the first
                                 restructuring of the project in May 2004, related preparatory studies
                                 for the design of the conversion were duly implemented and the
                                 supported works were ready to be procured. However, at that time in
                                 2006 the implementation of this component could not start since the
                                 gas supply capacities of the project’s supported Songo Songo
                                 infrastructure had already reached its maximum level and it was
                                 therefore uncertain if sufficient gas supplies would become available.
                                 While additional gas-processing volumes were ultimately secured,
                                 the associated IPTL plant’s private owners subsequently entered into
                                 a legal dispute with TANESCO under the related power purchase
Component D: TEGETA Power        agreement of the IPTL plant and filed an ICSID arbitration case.
Plant (cancelled)                Those legal disputes continued up to the project’s closing date,
                                 which ultimately led the GoT to request the drop of this component
                                 and use the cancelled credit proceeds under the IDA’s new
                                 investment lending reform procedures to transfer those amounts to
                                 another IDA-supported energy sector project, which faced a
                                 significant funding gap.

                                 Through the fourth restructuring of this project on December 16,
                                 2010, the World Bank approved the GoT’s request to cancel this
                                 component (project funds of DR 17.2 million—about US$27 million
                                 at the time of cancellation).

                                 This component was fully implemented in August 2009 and

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

1. At the time of appraisal, net economic and financial benefits, in terms of net present
   value (the economic internal rate of return, or EIRR) and financial internal rates of
   return (FIRR), were estimated for the project’s main component implemented by
   Songas and supporting the construction and operation of the gas-processing facilities
   and Ubungo Power plant conversion (component A). This annex adopts similar
   methodologies to those used in the ex-ante economic and financial analysis, subject to
   the availability of data.

2. For this ex-post economic and financial analysis, some key assumptions are made.
   Where realized data could not be obtained or was insufficient, the analysis relied on a
   combination of actual and estimated figures. The assumptions adopted are described
   in such instances.

A. Financial Analysis Assumptions Made

3. The key assumptions used in the calculation of the FIRR are the following:
   a) The actual investments in the infrastructures supported by component A amount
      to US$312 million. It is important to note that the investment includes a further
      addition of the capacity expansion originally financed by Songas equity and later
      bought down by the proceeds of component E.

   b) As per the original financial analysis, the investments under component B and
      component C have not been considered as their benefits have were not considered
      at appraisal.
   c) The revenue is generated from the 112 MW gas power plant which supplies an
      average of 725 GWh per year and the gas processing plant which also supplies the


                                           31
       Twiga cement plant with an 1,444mmcf per year of the natural gas equivalent of
       34,000 tons of HFO.
   d) The Songas purchase tariff is adjusted from 2007 due to the capacity charge
      reduction caused by the capital buy-down of US$ 43 million, thereafter
      maintained. This capital buy-down results in the capacity charge reduction,
      approximately to US$ 0.036/kWh in 2010.
   e) Commercial operation date of the Project is on July 2004, which was delayed
      from 2003.
   f) Additional investment of Turbine No. 5 and No. 6 for 68 MW Gas Power Plant
      was made in the amount of US$56 million and the revenue was generated from
      2005 onwards also included in the financial analysis.
   g) The IDA credit by the Government was on-lent to Songas (20 years tenor
      including 3.5 years grace period at the interest rate of 7%) and EIB loan also is
      supposed to be on-lent to Songas (20 years including the 4 grace years period at
      the interest rate of 7%).
   h) A discount rate of 12% has been used to calculate the financial net present value
      (FNPV).

B. Economic Analysis Assumptions Made

4. The assumptions made for the financial analysis were also applied for the economic
   analysis. In addition, certain complementary assumptions were made for the
   assessment of the economic analysis.

5. The additional key assumptions used in the calculation of the EIRR are:
   a) At original appraisal, the economic benefits were assumed to be measured by (i)
      an additional incremental gas to power generation capacities from the 38 MW gas
      power plant; (ii) fuel cost savings from gas to electricity power generation by
      using natural gas, (iii) additional fuel cost savings by supplying 4mmcf/d of gas to
      the Twiga Cement Plant, replacing HFO with natural gas for the operation of the
      kiln, and (iv) the repayment installments of the IDA and EIB loans to Government
      on-lent to Songas.
   b) The economic costs assumed at original appraisal were the (i) borrowing costs of
      the IDA and EIB facilities to the GoT; (ii) capacity charge payments; (iii) variable
      operating costs; and (iv) the incremental distribution cost.
   c) Ex-post, a few changes have been made to the cost-benefit analysis. The main
      changes in the economic benefits assumptions are (i) the higher than anticipated
      capacity additions of gas to power generation, which were increased by 68 MW
      instead of the originally assumed 38MW; and (ii) the much higher actual fuel
      prices for HFO (US$ 317/ton) than the originally assumed prices of US$ 116/ton.




                                           32
       d) The major changes in the economic costs are (i) the reduced capital expenditure
          from the reduced borrowing amount of EIB and IDA loan compared to the values
          applied at appraisal stage4; and (ii) the reduced electricity purchase costs (capacity
          and variable charges) from US$ 0.09~0.12/kWh at the appraisal to US$ 0.6/kWh
          after the capital buy-down.
       e) A discount rate of 12% has been used to calculate the economic net present value
          (ENPV).

C. Overall Results of the Financial and Economic Analysis

6. The results of the updated economic and financial analysis and initial results
   estimated at the original appraisal in 2001 are as follows:

                  Table A3.2 Results of Updated Economic and Financial Analysis
                                      ENPV (at 12%)             EIRR      FNPV (at 12%)               FIRR
        Estimation in PAD                  179 Mil              26%             63 Mil                 21%
        Estimation in ICR                  423 Mil              35%            166 Mil                 20%

7. In comparison with the estimation in the original PAD, the above table shows that the
   Project has achieved a higher EIRR and a similar level of FIRR. From the simulation
   and analysis of each of the assumptions, this can be explained by the following
   positive and negative factors:

       a) Positive factors
                There was a cost savings of about $42 million in EPC costs due to the lower
                 costs for the gas infrastructure and pipeline, than estimated at appraisal. EPC
                 cost savings had a very positive impact on the economic and financial
                 viability of the Project.
                The economic benefits in form of the fuel cost savings generated through
                 replacing HFO fuel with natural gas for the power plant and the cement plant
                 under this project have been significantly higher than assumed at appraisal.
                 While the Task Team at appraisal assumed an average price for HFO of
                 U$ 116/ton the actual average cost for HFO during implementation up to
                 project closing has been about US$ 317/ton. This fuel cost savings enhanced
                 significantly the EIRR beyond the levels assumed at appraisal stage.
                The revenue generated from the additional 30 MW power plant units that were
                 built with Turbine No. 5 and Turbine No. 6 had a positive impact on the
                 project’s financial return. The underlying analysis assumed the revenues


4
    Those reductions arose from the reduced investments costs due to the project costs savings under component A.




                                                           33
       generated from the 180MW Songas plant, while at appraisal the total size of
       the plant was only estimated with a total capacity of 150 MW.
b) Negative factors
      The revenues generated by Songas were reduced after 2007 due to the
       capacity charge reduction caused by the capital buy-down of US$ 43 million.
       At the appraisal stage, the tariff including the capacity payment was projected
       at 0.092~0.120 US$/kWh. However, the actual costs are around
       US$/kWh0.06 after capital buy-down. This reduction in revenue contributed
       to the slight reduction in the FIRR. This is the main reason why the FIRR is
       projected to be at a similar level estimated during project appraisal.
      While the commercial operation date was slightly delayed, the impact was
       relatively limited.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower’s ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR


1. Initially the Songo Songo Gas Development and Power Generation Project had three
   major components: (i) the Songas component (Songo Songo Gas to Electricity
   Project) implemented by the sponsor, CDC Globeleq Tanzania as part A of Credit
   Development Agreement No. 3569 TA; (ii) the socioeconomic monitoring and
   environmental compliance component implemented by the Ministry of Energy and
   Minerals (MEM) as part B; and (iii) the capacity-building component also
   implemented by the MEM as part C. In 2000 the MEM prepared the project
   implementation plan (PIP), which covered parts B and C of the Credit Development
   Agreement No. 3569 TA implemented by the Government of the United Republic of
   Tanzania (GoT) under the supervision of the project monitoring unit (PMU) of the
   MEM. Between 2004 and 2008 two components—Tegeta Power Plant (IPTL
   Conversion of 10 Wartsila engines from Heavy Fuel Oil to gas firing) and the
   refinancing for the Ubungo Expansion Project—were introduced. The later enabled
   the reduction of the project’s capacity charge. However, the conversion of IPTL was
   shelved due to court cases and absence of the lenders’ consent. The refinancing
   supported by component E resulted in a significant reduction of the capacity charge,
   approximately US$1.0 million per month.

2. The borrower, acting through the MEM, has supervised all components of the project
   preparation, implementation, and operation for six years. In 2009 Songas celebrated
   the fifth anniversary of producing electricity using natural gas up to 189 MW with 90
   percent availability. The financial impact of the gas-to-power project for the major
   consumers has been assessed and indicates significant positive savings from using
   natural gas as fuel in place of liquid petroleum fuels.

3. The Songas component included (i) tie-in of two onshore wells (SS3 and SS4) and
   three offshore wells (SS5, SS7, and SS9) through installation of two gas flow lines of
   four-inches in diameter ( SS3 and SS4) and three flow lines of 6-inches in diameter
   (SSS, SS7, and SS9), respectively; (ii) installation of gas-processing plant capable of
   processing 70 million cubic feet per day; (iii) construction of 25 kilometer marine
   pipeline of 12-inches in diameter stretching from Songo Songo Island to the landfall
   site at Somanga Fungu; (iv) development of the Songo Songo Island infrastructure;
   (v) construction of 207 kilometer onshore pipeline of 16-inches in diameter stretching
   from Somanga Fungu to Ubungo Complex; (vi) installation of integrated
   communication systems of fiber optics on the onshore portion of the pipeline; (vii)
   rehabilitation of Ubungo power plant; and (viii) construction of 8-inches in diameter
   spur line to Wazo Hill, 16 kilometers north of Ubungo. Songas commissioned the
   Wazo Hill lateral on July 15, 2004, and the main project on July 20, 2004.

Social and Environmental Issues

4. More efforts were made on component B of the project involving socioeconomic
   infrastructure development. The Wayleave Village Electrification Scheme (WVES)



                                           39
   and the Resettlement Infrastructure Development Scheme were completed and
   provide water, electricity, and roads services as planned. Implementation of the MEM
   component experienced serious delays.

5. However, due to passage of time and the market responses, the original concepts,
   scope of work, and stakeholders under WVES and the Resettlement Infrastructure
   Development Scheme (RIDS) had to be modified, e.g., for construction of tarmac
   roads instead of gravel roads in the resettlement areas and a change from installation
   of stand-alone generation sets to one generation plant at Somanga Fungu Power
   Station.

6. Management of WVES faced a number of challenges, which included the MEM
   having to transfer control of the management of the project to TANESCO except for
   making payments to consultants and contractors. In November 2004, the World Bank
   advised the MEM to transfer management functions of WVES to TANESCO and
   recommended that interim arrangements should be made while contractual
   arrangements were being sorted out. Despite the agreement reached, no contract was
   signed until February 2008. Procurement cycles were lengthy, and approvals by the
   World Bank on procurement were not granted in time, thus contributing to delays in
   project implementation.

Contract Compliance

7. Generally the parties complied with the basis and financial agreements. This category
   included the services of consultants in capacity building in monitoring the entire
   project.

Capacity Building

8. The World Bank approved the MEM capacity-building program in two batches in
   November 2004. Between 2004 and 2005, 42 employees successfully attended
   various courses within Tanzania, in the region, and abroad, costing the equivalent of
   US$497,243. The MEM also financed a portion of TANESCO´s capacity-building
   program by using proceeds from the MEM program at US$198,810.

Conclusion

9. The opinion of the GoT is that the Songo Songo Natural Gas to Power Project has
   performed well during its six-year period of operation. The project has been able to
   provide reliable power supply to the country at the time when the petroleum prices in
   the world market were rising and experiencing increased volatility, and when low
   hydrology conditions in the country led to reduced hydropower output.

10. The project also stimulated gas utilization and gas markets; by December 2010 35
    local industries had been connected for gas use to replace the use of heavy fuel oil
    and other types of petroleum fuels.



                                           40
11. From an environmental perspective, the project has significantly reduced air pollution
    by reducing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. It has been estimated
    that 1.8 million and 0.73 million tons of CO2 were reduced from power generation
    and local industries, respectively, since 2004 to December 2010.

12. In the rural areas, the project has improved socioeconomic life, especially for those
    electrified villages and townships, where income generation has shifted from
    activities not dependent on electricity to activities that are electricity dependent, such
    as seafood processing and storage in Island and Kilwa Masoko.

13. WVES and the RIDS implementation have brought benefits to affected people along
    the wayleave and resettlement areas. Thirteen kilometers of roads, twenty-four
    kilometers water distribution lines, one kilometer of telecommunication lines, and
    eighteen kilometers of power lines were put in place.

14. The private investors have shown keenness to invest in both the petroleum and power
    subsectors of the economy. In the petroleum upstream, GoT and TPDC have managed
    to enter into 23 production sharing agreement with a number of exploration
    companies. This has culminated in more natural gas discoveries both onshore and
    offshore, including in deep water.

15. The MEM is very grateful to TANESCO, TPDC, PAT, the World Bank, EIB, Songas,
    government agencies, local government, and other stakeholders for the support given
    during the implementation of all the components of the project.

Annex 10. Summary of Project Restructuring History

1. Major project changes as described in section 1.6 of the report were approved through
   the restructurings that are summarized below. These restructurings further led to
   certain project proceeds reallocations and cancellations (see table A10.1 for details).

      i.   First restructuring (Board level), May 2004, added component D to scale up
           gas-fueled power generation and extension of original closing date to October
           31, 2007
     ii.   Second restructuring (RVP level), December 2007, added new component E
           and extension of project closing date to December 31, 2009
    iii.   Third restructuring (RVP level), December 2009, approved extension of
           project closing date to December 31, 2010
     iv.   Fourth restructuring (RVP level), December 2010, approved partial credit
           cancellation and drop of one component.

2. The ICR team also analyzed the reasons and justifications given for the accumulated
   extension of the project closing date by more than four years, also analyzing whether
   any project extensions were purely given to make use of important project savings.

3. First it has to be noted that the initial restructuring of 2004 did not require an
   extension of the original closing date, which remained unchanged at that time. The
   first closing date extension was approved in March 2006 to allow for the completion
   of the main activities under component B, which just had started implementation after
   the WVES subcomponent underwent a substantial design change. The second major
   extension of the project closing date then was approved in December 2007 extending
   the closing date up to December 2009. The justification given at that time was to
   facilitate the implementation of incomplete activities under the original component B
   and the formerly introduced component D and also to allow for the implementation of
   the new activities introduced to the project in the Restructuring of December 2007 to
   be fully implemented. Finally the closing date extension by another 12 months from
   December 2009 to December 2010, was justified by allowing for full completion of
   component B activities, that were about 90% complete at the time of extension and
   implementation of component D.

4. In the ICR team’s view the justifications approved with each project closing date
   extension do not reveal evidence that the project closing date was only extended to
   make use of project savings.

Environmental:

1. Overall the project has been executed in compliance with the World Bank’s
   Environmental Safeguard Policies and Environmental, Health and Safety Guidelines.
   In addition, during implementation of the project, the Bank-supported Ubungo Power
   Plant received ISO certification for environmental management (14001) and health
   and safety (18001). During implementation of component A, the conditions of an
   earlier drilled but unused gas well (Wellhead 6) deteriorated due to corrosion, and for
   safety reasons it was recommended to decommission and seal this well. This
   mitigation measure was ultimately supported by the project, and the wellhead was
   closed in 2008. In addition, after commissioning of the gas-processing plant on Songo
   Songo Island, local villagers complained that the operation of the offshore wells had a
   negative impact on their seaweed production. The project subsequently supported a
   study by an independent consultant who did not find any evidence on negative
   impacts arising from the gas-processing activities on seaweed production.

2. The implementation of the project resulted in some 3,100 affected households, which
   includes 2,945 households in the WVES who were affected in various degrees,
   including loss of crops, land (including farm land), and some structures, including a
   number of houses. Out of those 3,100 households, 155 needed to be physically
   resettled from the pipeline corridor to two sites designated for this purpose on the
   outskirt of Dar es Salaam—Kinyerezi and Sala Sala. In addition, 38 households were
   resettled along the rural section of the pipeline wayleave between Somanga Fungu
   and the outskirts of Dar es Salaam. The resettlement action plan, prepared in 1997,
   and its addendum of 2000 described the basis of compensation. In 2010 a second
   addendum was prepared due to changes in the WVES.

3. In the last year of implementation the project financed a community livelihood and
   impact assessment and socioeconomic survey (social impact assessment), which
   concluded that the RAP and its addenda were comprehensively implemented as per
   its reviewed scope. At the same time this social impact assessment also made some
   recommendations for follow up actions that the task team agreed upon with
   TANESCO and MEM at the final supervision mission. With respect to cultural
   properties, people were compensated for cemeteries and grave yards in the entire
   project areas and they were also paid for reburial ceremony. Details of social impacts
   and mitigations follow:

   a) Wayleave Village Electrification Scheme: Even though the majority of affected
      people were those living along the wayleave, the level of impact was not major.
      The main impact considered farmland and crops, with few households compared
      to the total number of affected households. During the design, the choice of the
      pipeline route was considered carefully to minimize impact on structures and


                                           46
   areas with perennial crops. The average land loss due to the project in the
   wayleave ranges between a quarter to half an acre. In most places the pipeline
   passed either through abandoned or unused farms.

   In general, according to the social impact assessment report, the compensation
   along the wayleave was fully and fairly paid. In 2010 a second addendum to the
   RAP was prepared due to changes in the routing of the transmission line in a 40
   kilometer stretch between Manzese and Somanga along the WVES, affecting six
   villages. The rerouting mainly was a result of a road upgrade in a certain section,
   causing 95 additional affected people. The impact was mainly on crops and
   farmland. However, 15 houses were also affected. The related documents have
   been disclosed in the Infoshop and the country. During the final supervision
   mission and after project closing, the task team was informed that some newly
   affected people had complained about their compensations through the grievance
   mechanism. The task team agreed with the GoT to follow up on this issue even
   after project closing.

   In addition, an assessment shortly before closing found that while all of the
   villages on the WVES now have access to electricity, the number of connections
   was still limited at the time of project closing since the power station supplying
   the new electrification scheme was commissioned only a few months before the
   project’s close in 2010.

b) Songo Songo Island: Songo Songo village has substantially benefited from this
   project. Prior to the project, the quality of water in the village was very poor and
   all villagers relied on one source of water, which was an uncovered well in poor
   condition.      Under a community development project, Songas provided the
   villagers with clean drinking water from communal stands located in different
   distribution points in the village. Waterborne disease, according to the social
   impact assessment, dropped by about 80 percent after the construction of the
   water project.

   In addition, more than 100 households have been legally connected and utilize
   electricity generated from natural gas obtained from the island, while there had
   not been any electricity before the project. However, there are several households
   that have made illegal connections, while many more are yet to be connected to
   electricity. Issues about whether Songo Songo villagers should pay for electricity
   continue to hamper the expansion of this service to many people, thus forcing
   some to take risky decisions to make illegal connections. In the last supervision
   mission the task team received confirmation from TANESCO that this issue will
   be addressed in the near future.

   The major issue of the project on the island was the replacement of the Songo
   Songo community jetty with a new one. The new jetty, though, had to be
   upgraded due to inadequate length and height and upon the request from the
   community. Since the upgrade of the jetty could not be implemented in the



                                        47
        remaining lifetime of this project, this outstanding activity was transferred to the
        Bank-financed Tanzania Transport Sector Support Project (TSSP) through an
        additional financing. In preparation of this transfer an impact assessment was
        undertaken to understand the issues related to the new jetty in order to improve it
        based on the community’s needs (completed in April 2010).

    c) Resettlement Infrastructure Development Schemes (Kinyerezi and Sala Sala):
       These sites were unplanned areas where 155 households were already residing,
       before another 155 households, residing in the pipeline wayleaves were to be
       resettled to these areas. So after resettlement the areas were supposed to host up to
       310 households. Under the project, needed infrastructure such as roads, water,
       electricity, and telephone lines were constructed in these settlements. However,
       since the infrastructure construction was lengthy (finished in 2008, about seven
       years after the start of the project), only 10 households resettled in Sala Sala out
       of 88 who were supposed to move there. The rest sold their plots and resettled in
       other areas.

        The situation was similar in Kinyerezi. In addition, in Kinyerezi, at the time of
        the social impact assessment, 75 affected people still needed to be provided with
        land plots, though they had been duly compensated already. 5 This is a good
        lesson to learn for future Bank’s projects. When physical resettlement is involved,
        issues of speed in preparing the resettlement site and the possibility that people
        may sell their land due to increased value as a result of the site preparation should
        be considered carefully, and proper measures should be in place to ensure that
        people will be resettled to the designated resettlement sites.

  Compensation was paid to affected people as per World Bank requirements and Tanzanian law. In
addition to compensation in monetary terms, plots were allocated to the people who were affected by the
project wayleave. In addition, the social impact assessment states that GoT officials indicated that those
who were not allocated a plot will be given plots in another ongoing government project of surveying plots
in Kinyerezi.
