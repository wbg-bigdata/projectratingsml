and Distribution System
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
*          1.0   Background
The demand for electric power in Tanzania has been on increase due to the g owing economic
and social situation in the country. Good govemance, good policies, investor ' confidence and
economic recovery programmes have stimulated the economic growth and sc cial activities. In
1986, Tanzania introduced and embarked on Economic Recovery Programme (E RP) backed by a
I          series of IMF inspired structural adjustment programmes. ERP concentrat d on reforming
agriculture, opening up the private sectors, deregulating food marketing, libe ralized trade and
lifting foreign exchange controls. These programmes have resulted into urb nization and the
I          growth in mining sector. The implication of these programmes to TANES O has been the
increase of a number of customers in major cities in need of electricity conn ctions. However,
most of the infrastructure have reached their capacities and cannot allow c nnection of new
ii |customers unless they are rehabilitated. The most affected are the substations and their voltage
carriage lines located in Dar es Salaam, Arusha and Moshi town centres.
l          Tanzania's economy still faces considerable difficulties and many necessary r forms remain to
be implemented. It is important then for TANESCO and the Government of Ta nzania to support
the industrial sector recovery by preventing frequent power outages and impro ie power quality.
This involves putting new investment in distribution systems and development f new sources of
electricity.
In Tanzania, only about 11% of the population (34million)' enjoys the ele tricity. The total
number of customers (residential, industrial and commerce) connected by the nd of June 2005
was 570,665 with average growth of between 6-9% since year 2000.2 In terms f generation, the
total available installed capacity is 890MW. The sources include TANE SCO (590MW),
SONGAS (200MW), and the Independent Power Tanzania Limited-IPTL (1001 4W). TANESCO
also imports power from Uganda and Zambia for Kagera region and Tunduma, Sumbawanga and
Mbozi towns respectively.
l  TANESCO has a number of substations scattered all over the country. Some s bstations are for
the stepping-up from e.g. l1kV to 220kV using 11/33/66/132/220kV conver ion transformers
and some are step-down substations which reduce the transmission voltage into distributien
I          voltage, say from 220kV to 1 kV. This environmental audit study was condu ted on some step
down substations ranging from 220/132/33kV to 33/1 1kV.
I           In 2002, TANESCO in collaboration with Japanese International Cooperatio Agency (JICA)
..           prepared a Master Plan to improve the power systems in major towns o Dar es Salaamn,
Kilimanjaro and Arusha. The current power demands for these regions are on iverage 240MW,
30MW and 38MW respectively.3 The Master Plan outlines areas of priority and investments
needed to solve the frequent power outages experienced in major cities. Fu ther, TANESCO

|                          Reinforcement and Upgrade of Dar es Salaam, Kilimanjaro and Ar sha Transmission
and Distribution System
3 l         undertook several studies including Relief Project 2 done by NetGroup Solu ions (Pty) Ltd of
South Africa in 2004 and feasibility study on the Reinforcement and Upgrade f Dar es Salaam,
l          Kilimanjaro and Arusha Transmission and Distribution system done by Lahm yer Intemational
of Germany in September 2004. All these studies identified areas of pri rity and type of
investment needed by TANESCO to improve the transmission and distribution ystems.
l           Based on the above-mentioned studies, TANESCO consulted various fi anciers to seek
assistance in implementing different components of the Master Plan. The Wo Id Bank (WB) as
one of the contacted financiers showed interest in supporting TANESCO in t at respect. Hence
I          TANESCO and the International Development Association (IDA)/World B  k are currently
preparing a distribution rehabilitation and transmission reinforcement compo ent as part of the
Songo Songo Gas Development and Power Generation Project (Credit 3569- A). The amount
under discussion with the WB is about US$ 57 million.
l          2.0  The Project
The proposed project to be owned by TANESCO and co-financed by the W rld Bank and the
Nordic Development Fund (NDF) at an estimated cost of 70m USD consists of wo components:
The first component involves the rehabilitation of 18 existing substation  at Oyster Bay,
Mikocheni, Msasani, Factory Zone I, Factory Zone II, City Centre, Factory  one III, Sokoine,
Kurasini and Ilala in Dar es Salaam. Others are Mount Meru, Unga Ltd., Kilt  Ltd, Themi and
Njiro in Arusha and Boma-Mbuzi, Trade School and Kiyungi in Kilimanjaro region. These 18
substations out of all substations in Dar es Salaam, Arusha and Kilimanjaro h ve been selected
for the rehabilitation because they are located in the areas with fast growing p wer demand and
the systems have reached the capacity limit hence they are overloaded. Furth r there will be a
repair and upgrade of the 11/33 kV distribution systems. This rehabilitatio of Distribution
l          Facilities involves:
*  Supply and installation of 22 additional 15MVA, 33/llkV transform - rs to relieve the
overload in the existing substations (i.e. replacing low capacity transfo  ers e.g. 5MVA
with medium capacity of 15MVA transformers)
*  Supply and installation of about 33, 33/llkV circuit breakers and  24 llkV circuit
breakers with associated switchboards
I              *  Supply and installation of 50MVA 132/33kV transformer with a ircuit breaker at
Kiyungi, Njiro, and Kurasini Substations.
;-|            *  Supply of materials and equipment for repair/upgrading of the distributi n systems which
. |               make a provision for the following: reconductoring, protection syste ns, auto-reclosers
and auto load break switches, SCADA, section analysers, boosters, ligh ening protection,
13                distribution transformers, new 33/1 1kV lines and statistical metering
Upgrading of substations means replacement of power transformers by a hi her rated power
transformer and its associated breakers. This will involve mainly upgrading of he foundations to
a higher bearing capacity, thus necessitating having temporary measures in pla e to avoid power
outages.
* The second component involves the construction of new 132kV trans nission lines that
will connect the Ubungo Main substation with upgraded 132/33kV Oys er Bay, Kurasini,

2.1  Project Objectives
The project will achieve the following objectives:
X              *  Reducing the duration and frequency of power interruptions
* Improving voltage conditions at consumers' premises
*  Reducing the power system losses
*  Improvement in marketing by facilitating the possibilities of connecting more customers
* Improvement of TANESCO image to the public (less complains from cl istomers)
l  Attraction of more revenue for the company
* The project will contribute to the effort by the Tanzanian Government of improving the
livelihood of ordinary Tanzanians through the National Strategy for the Growth and
Reduction of Poverty in Tanzania (MKUKUTA)
Component 1 of this project requires a comprehensive Environmental Audit A ssessment (EAA)
I           which is reported in this report while component 2 has separate comprehensiN e reports namely;
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA and SIA) and Resettlement Action Pla i (RAP).
l           3.0  The Purpose of the Environmental Audit Assessment
World Bank requires that all investments comply with the World Bank Safes uard Policies and
*           Environmental Guidelines as presented in the Pollution Prevention and Aba ement Handbook
(1998) and IFC Environmental Guidelines. It is also a Tanzanian requiremer t that all projects
l           should undertake the Environmental Assessment before the implementatio . The Tanzanian
Environmental Management Act (2004) section 81(1-4) stipulates that it is the obligation of the
project proponent to undertake environmental impact assessment study of the p oject.
*           Hence, for this study the following major guidelines and policies will be appli d: Electric Power
Transmission and Distribution guidelines (IFC), Occupational Health & Safety (IFC), and
Natural Habitat (OP 4.04) because of potential oil pollution. Additionally, nat onal requirement
as reflected in various Tanzania's sectoral policies, the National Environrrent Management
Council (NEMC) Environmental Impact Assessment Guidelines (2002 apdate) and the
Environmental Management Act (2004).
The purposes of the Enviromnental Audit Assessment are:
l  To identify present inadequacies in environmental management, and o cupational health
and safety issues in the facilities to be rehabilitated. Of particular interc st are the present
pollution if any and its potential clean-up costs
0  To determine the need for remedial actions necessary to bring the sub. ect facilities into
compliance with World Bank Safeguard Policies and
0 To recomrnend actions to be taken to improve and strength n TANESCO's
environmental, health and safety management

Reinforcement and Upgrade of Dares Salsam, Kilimanjaro and Ar isha Transmission
and Distribution System
J           3.1  Scope of Work
The Environmental Audit Assessment focused only on the 18 existing substati ns earmarked for
rehabilitation in Dar es Salaam, Arusha and Kilimanjaro as outlined above plus one additional
substation at Chalinze in Coast Region. The Audit took place in November and December 2004.
4.0  Methodology and Approach
To accomplish the audit assessment the following approach was applied:
4.1  Reviewing records and relevant documents
All available relevant in house documents were reviewed. The documents i clude: the Master
Plan Study on the Power Sector for Major Towns in the United Republic of Tanzania (2002) by
EPDC of Japan; Reinforcement and Upgrade of Dar es Salaam, Kilima jaro and Arusha
Transmission and Distribution System Feasibility Study Report (200 ) by. Lahmeyer
International; Environmental Management Act (EMA   -2004); NEMC s Environmental
Guidelines (2002); various Tanzanian sectoral policies; World Bank .Operatior at Policies; World
Bank, (IFC) Pollution Prevention and Abatement Handbook; environmental and occupational
health and safety guidelines and standards. These documents formed a founda ion of conducting
this environmental audit through a checklist.
The checklist identifies issue as per the following criteria as deduced fr m the guidelines
mentioned above.
* General environmental management;
l              * Waste management practices;
* Hazardous materials management;
* Groundwater and soil contamination control;
X              * Occupational health and safety management; and
* Noise management (Noise level measurements were taken in some su stations to get an
3                 overview of the noise levels in the substations)
4.2  Site Observations and Interview
All 18 substations in Dar es Salaam, Kilimanjaro and Arusha were visited for ssessment plus an
additional one at Chalinze. Consultations with NEMC and Municipal auth rities were made
before the site visit. Also during the site visit, interviews and brief meetings  ith relevant staff
l           and residents around the substations were conducted.
4.3 Use of secondary data
l           Due to resource constraint, this assessment used available data and laboratory test results for
identifying polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) in transformers and switchgeirs conducted by
previous studies in the same substations. The studies include Situation Assessment and
Environmental Audit, Power Sector Restructuring Project- Final Report Versi n 2.0 prepared by
Stone & Webster Consultants, May 2004 and Inventory of Electrical Equipn ent Suspected to
Contain Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) prepared by the Vice Presidents Of ice June 2004.
4.4 PCB identification methods
The PCBs identification methods used in this study include:

l l ~~~Manufacturer's narneplate informnation; Elimination method cut off year assur ed 1980; Density
test; Chlorine frame test; Dexsil test kits; and Laboratory testing (gas chromatogr phy with electron
capture then comparing results against standard chromatograms for known arochlors).
Transforner found to contain concentration of less than 50ppm of PCB was lassified as PCB
free. Equipment found to have 50ppm   or above but below  500ppm  vras classified as
l          contaminated. Equipment found to contain 500ppm and above of PCBs is classi fied as pure PCB.
4.5 Findings evaluation
l          Through field observations, site screening tests, laboratory analysis, checklist and professional
judgment the audit findings were evaluated and prioritized as of high, mediui or low concern
depending on the severity of the problem and health, safety or environnen al impact it may
cause.
5.0  Report format
*          This environmental audit report comprises of five chapters, introduction o the project and
methodology; legal framework; baseline information and the audit findinE s; environmental
management plan & monitoring; and conclusion and recommendation. The rep rt has appendices
that include location map of substations, photo documentation, PCB laboratory results of some
substations, the criteria checklist of audited substations and list of consulted pe ple.
6.0  Public Concern
The major public concern was a health risk due to electromagnetic effect. No n ise complains or
I          concerns were reported during the survey.
I |        7.0  Remedial Costs
The identified weaknesses are small and could be covered in region's repair and maintenance
budgets. Regions need to provide the remedial budgets as appropriate so t at the costs are
included in the annual budgets for approval.
Note: Laboratory analysis of the soil sarnples under the transformers susp cted of PCBs is
awaiting the budget. When budget is secured soil samples will be sent for the la oratory analysis.
8.0. Training Needs
3          It is proposed that as part of this project, training should be considered foc sing on capacity
building of the environmental unit in areas of Environmental Audit, Social Imp ct Assessment &
management, health and safety awareness seminars and work procedure for Substation
l          engineers, technicians and operators. The anticipated cost for the training and quipment for the
year 2006 is about USD 69,300.
l          9.0  Environmental Management Plan (EMP)
Environmental Management Plan (EMP) and monitoring have been included. E dP has identified
environmental impacts and their mitigation measures. Monitoring plan has sti ulated indicators
I          to be monitored and required resources to ensure that mitigation measures ar implemented. It
important that TANESCO provide resources estimated to be USD 11,000 annu lly to implement
the EMP as shown on the plan.

I          10.0 Major Audit findings and Recommendations
Below are the recommendations following the audit findings. Correction o these observed
3          weaknesses and shortcomings is important so as meet the minimum World Ban; requirement:
*          High Priority
1. TANESCO should ensure that transformers identified having PCB cont mination (below
500ppm) are not moved from where they are located. In addition substation -ngineers should
I             ensure that there is no leakage to the soil or water. Further there should b appropriate oil
handling at all times while waiting for the national strategic plan to elimina e POPs prepared
by the Vice Presidents Office (VPO)
2. Although training has been taking place in TANESCO, trainings specific illy designed for
substation engineers, technicians. and operators have been scarce and lim ted to very few
I .           individuals. TANESCO (Head office which coordinates employees' trainin s in cooperation
with regional offices) needs to organise regular courses (tailor made train ng programs) to
suit different cadres of substation employees and others. such as training n ay include work
procedures, health and safety matters, hazardous material handling and emergency
preparedness and response
l          3. Since it was observed that no clear identification of who has been assigned responsibility of
taking care for the environmental matters of the substations. Therefore, sub tation engineers
or supervisors should be assigned also such a responsibility and re uired to report
performance in monthly reports
4. Waste management need to be improved in all the substations as this was seen to be a
*             problem in most substations. Substation management should designate spec al areas (points)
for waste collection before safe disposal. Special bins can be used to store ollected wastes
3             such as pieces of cables, insulators and other wastes in the substation site bef )re disposal
5. Raise awareness of people working in the substation on the potential hazard f oil spill to the
l l           environment and how to handle it appropriately during refilling, oil filtering r maintenance.
l          6. TANESCO Regional Offices -are required to provide toilets and askari kios facilities in the
substations for the convenience of workforce. There are some which need repair and some
which need to be constructed. With exception of Njiro, Kiyungi, Ilala, and FZ III all other
substations lack toilet, askari kiosk or both.
7. TANESCO (Regional Offices) should collect all old transformers dumped a substation sites
which some of them have oil leakage and dispose them or store them in appr priate designed
areas that may contain or prevent the oil leakage into the soil.
*          8. TANESCO should provide adequate fire fighting equipment in a right propo tion (foam, C02
and powder) to fight any fire type in the substations and ensure that equipm nt are regularly
checked to be sure that they are working properly. Some substations had inadequate fire
fighting equipment or right proportion.

and Distribution System
9. TANESCO should provide resources estimated at least USD 11,000 ann ally to facilitate
implementation of the proposed ESMP and monitoring plan. Other mitiga ion costs will be
covered in construction costs.
10. TANESCO Regional Offices should budget and urgently replace all lost o broken lids and
l             slabs to improve the safety in the substations as some of the cable trench labs were found
broken or missing increasing a safety risks at night and in emergency cases.
l          11. TANESCO's substation engineers in collaboration with their Regiona Offices should
reequip the First aid kits as required since most of first aid kits are n t equipped with
l             essential drugs.
12. TANESCO should ensure that fences are repaired, security lights worki g again and all
danger signs replaced to alert people of the potential dangers as they approa h the fences
Medium Priority
l          13. TANESCO needs to prepare an emergency response plan in the event of fir , major accident
or major oil spills. All audited substations didn't have the plan. Workers nee to rehearse and
understand the information flow in case of the emergency so as to check Nhether the plan
works as intended. Information flow charts should also be posted at a visible place
14. Since TANESCO has so far no formalized Environmental Management ystem (EMS) in
spite of having an environmental unit, which deals with environment 1 matters. Then
TANESCO has to develop an EMS suitable to its activities or adopt ISO 1 000 standard in
order to improve its environmental management performance. In ad ition, fund for
implementing management plans should be made available
15. TANESCO   should strengthen  environmental management both   a  Head   Office
Environmental Unit and at the implementing Regions or plants
l          16. TANESCO departments and substation engineers should prepare work pr cedure manuals
and instructions where such instructions are very essential and make .thein available in a
known language to all substation workers. Many substations had n-o workin procedures and
instructions at all or had instruction written in a language not understandable by majority.
Overall TANESCO Management Response
I          TANESCO acknowledges the corporate responsibility and shall take correctiv measures of
the identified environmental and health aspects. The work and budget will be i cluded in the
company's business plan and eventually incorporated in the Company E vironrniental
Management System (EMS).
TANESCO is committed to follow the country's policies and continue to comn unicate with
relevant sectors and ministries to ensure that environment is protected and hea h and safety
of workers and people around our facilities is guaranteed.

Reinforcement and Upgrade of Dares Salaam, 1ilimanjaro and Ar sha Transmission
and Distribution System
Chapter 1
I          Introduction
1.0  Background
*          The demand for electric power in Tanzania has been on increase due to the g owing economic
and social situation in the country. Good governance, good policies, investor ' confidence and
economic recovery programmes have stimulated the economic growth and s cial activities. In
1986, Tanzania introduced and embarked on Economic Recovery Progr   e (ERP) which
concentrated on reforming agriculture, opening up the private sectors, d regulating food
marketing, liberalized trade and lifting foreign exchange controls. The ERP wa later replaced by
a three year plan called the Economic and Social Action Plan (ESAP) backed b a series of IMF
inspired structural adjustment programmes. These programmes have resulted nto urbanization
and the growth in mining'sector. The implication of these programmes to TA 1ESCO has been
the increase of a number of customers in major cities in need of electri ity connections.
However, most of the infrastructure have reached their capacities and cannot all w connection of
new customers unless they are rehabilitated. The most affected are the sub ations and their
voltage carriage lines located in Dar es Salaam, Arusha and Moshi town centres
Further more, Tanzania's economy still faces considerable difficulties and many necessary
reforms remain to be implemented. The industrial sector being in the process o recovery, suffer
from frequent power outages and deterioration of power quality (under volta e) caused by the
ageing infrastructures in spite of the rectification efforts taken so far by T NESCO and the
Government of Tanzania. This system overload experienced in many substation and distribution
network needs urgent improvement in terms of new investment in distribu on systems and
I          development of new sources of electricity if TANESCO is to continue to se ve its customers
with quality power and connect new customers.
l          In Tanzania, only about 11% of the population (34million)' enjoys the elec ricity. The total
number of customers connected by the end of June 2005 was 570,665, m inly residential,
industrial and commerce.2 The average growth of the customer base since 200 was between 6-
I          9%. In terms of generation, the total available installed capacity is 890MW. Th sources include
TANESCO (590MW), SONGAS (200MW), and the Independent Power Tanza ia Limited-IPTL
(IOOMW). TANESCa also imports power from Uganda for Kagera region and from Zambia for
I          Tunduma town, Sumbawanga and Mbozi districts. The total generation for t e month of July
2005 reached 307,187,363 kWh (SONGAS contributing about 31%, IPTL 180/ and TANESCO
contributing about 51%)3.
TANESCO has a number of substations scattered all over the country. Some s bstations are for
the stepping-up from e.g. llkV to 220kV using 11/33/66/132/220kV convers on transformers.
These are mainly used at generating source to prepare the generated power ready for

transmission purposes. There are also step-down substations which reduce the transmission
voltage into distribution voltage, say from 220kV to 11kV. This is done thr( ugh a substation
having 220/132/33/1 lkV conversion transforners. In this audit study the subst ations are of step
down transformation ranging from 220/132/33kV to 33/1 IkV.
In 2002, TANESCO in collaboration with Japanese International Cooperatio  Agency (JICA)
I          prepared a Master Plan to improve the power systems in major towns of Dar es Salaam,
Kilimanjaro and Arusha. The current power demands for these regions are on average 240MW,
30MW and 38MW respectively.4 The Master Plan outlines areas of priority and investments
I          needed to solve the frequent power outages experienced in major cities. F  her, TANESCO
undertook several studies including Relief Project 2 done by NetGroup Solu ons (Pty) Ltd of
South Africa in 2004 and feasibility study on the Reinforcement and Upgrade f Dar es Salaam,
I          Kilimanjaro and Arusha Transmission and Distribution system done by Lahm yer International
of Germany in September 2004. All these studies identified areas of pri *ty and type of
investment needed by TANESCO to improve the transmission and distribution ystems.
Based on the above-mentioned studies, TANESCO consulted various fi lanciers to seek
assistance in implementing different components of the Master Plan. The Wo d Bank (WB) as
one of the contacted financiers showed interest in supporting TANESCO in th it respect. Hence
TANESCO and the International Development Association (IDA)/World B; nk are currently
preparing a distribution rehabilitation and transmission reinforcement compon Nnt as part of the
Songo Songo Gas Development and Power Generation Project (Credit 3569- A). The amount
under discussion with the WB is about US$ 57 million.
1.1 The Project
The proposed project to be owned by TANESCO and co-financed by the W  rd Bank and the
I fl       Nordic Development Fund (NDF) at an estimated cost of 70m USD consists of wo components:
The first component involves the rehabilitation of 18 existing substation at Oyster Bay,
Mikocheni, Msasani, Factory Zone I, Factory Zone II, City Centre, Factory 2 one III, Sokoine,
I          Kurasini and Ilala in Dar es Salaam. Others are Mount Meru, Unga Ltd., Kilte Ltd, Themi and
Njiro in Arusha and Boma-Mbuzi, Trade School and Kiyungi in Kilimanjaro region. These 18
substations out of all substations in Dar es Salaam, Arusha and Kilimanjaro h ve been selected
for the rehabilitation because they are located in the areas with fast growing p wer demand and
the systems have reached the capacity limit hence they are overloaded. Furth r there will be a
repair and upgrade of the 11/33 kV distribution systems. The expected life cyclc of the substation
*          is about 30 years though it may continue to provide service after that per od is over. This
rehabilitation of Distribution Facilities involves:
*  Supply and installation of 22 additional 15MVA, 33/1lkV transform rs to relieve the
I                overload in the existing substations (i.e. replacing low capacity transfor ners e.g. 5MVA
with medium capacity of 15MVA transformers)
*  Supply and installation of about 33, 33/llkV circuit breakers and  24 IlkV circuit
breakers with associated switchboards
*  Supply and installation of 50MVA 132/33kV transformer with a circuit breaker at
l                Kiyungi, Njiro, and Kurasini Substations

Reinforcement and Upgrade of Dar es Sal2am, Kilimanjaro and A sha Transmission
and Distribution System
* Supply of materials and equipment for repair/upgrading of the distribu on systems which
make a provision for the following: reconductoring, protection syste s, auto-reclosers
and auto load break switches, SCADA, section analysers, boosters, lig itening protection,
distribution transformers, new 33/1 1kV lines and statistical metering
Upgrading of substations means replacement of power transformers by a h gher rated power
I           transformer and its associated breakers. This will involve mainly upgrading of the foundations to
a higher bearing capacity, which may mean also power outages of several day or weeks in some
places if temporary measures of using mobile substations are not opted.
The second component involves the construction of new 132kV transmissi n lines and new
132/33kV substations as follows:
*  132kV T/L Ubungo 220/132kV S/S to Oyster Bay 33/11kV S/S (t be upgraded to
132/33kV S/S). The line will pass through Samu-Nujoma Road o the I ft hand side up to
Mwenge then follows new Bagamoyo Road on the right hand side up t Oyster Bay S/S
*  132kV T/L from Ubungo S/S to Factory Zone III (via Mandela roa to Kurasini S/S,
Mbagala S/S and Factory Zone II Gongo la Mboto)
*  132kV line from Factory Zone II -Gongo la Mboto 33/llkV S/S to proposed new
132/33kV Kinyerezi S/S to be located at Kinyerezi TANESCO plot
*  132kV T/L from Moshi (Kiyungi S/S) to Arusha (Njiro S/S) and res ective upgrade of
I                 both substations and with new 132/33kV substation near Kilimar aro Intemational
Airport (KIA)
l           1.1.1  Project Objectives
The project will achieve the following objectives:
* Reducing the duration and frequency of power interruptions
*  Improving voltage conditions at consumers' premises
* Reducing the power system losses
l  Improvement in marketing by facilitating the possibilities of connectin more customers
* Improvement of TANESCO image to the public (less complains from c stomers)
*  Attraction of more revenue for the company
U              *  The project will contribute to the effort by the Tanzanian Governmen of improving the
livelihood of ordinary Tanzanians through the National Strategy fo the Growth and
Reduction of Poverty in Tanzania (MKUKUTA)
Component 1 of this project requires a comprehensive Environmental Audit Assessment (EAA)
and component 2 requires a comprehensive Environmental Impact Assessme nt (EIA and SIA)
I           and Resettlement Action Plan (RAP). Therefore, this report presents the En ironmental Audit
Assessment findings for component 1 above (i.e. 18 substations in Dar es Sa aam, Arusha and
Kilimanjaro and one additional substation at Chalinze in Coast Region).
World Bank requires that all investments comply with the World Bank Safel uard Policies and
Environmental Guidelines as presented in the Pollution Prevention and Aba ement Handbook
(1998) and IFC Environmental Guidelines. It is also a Tanzanian requiremer t that all projects
should undertake the Environmental Assessment before the implementatio . The Tanzanian

and Distribution System
Environmental Management Act (2004) section 81(1-4) stipulates that it is the obligation of the
project proponent to undertake environmental impact assessment study of the pi Dject.
Hence, for this study the following major guidelines and policies will be appliel: Electric Power
Transmission and Distribution guidelines (IFC), Occupational Health & S fety (IFC), and
Natural Habitat (OP 4.04) because of potential oil pollution. Additionally, nat onal requirement
as reflected in various Tanzania's sectoral policies, the National Environrn nt Management
Council (NEMC) Environmental Impact Assessment Guidelines (2002     pdate) and the
Environmental Management Act (2004).
1.2 The Purpose of the Environmental Audit Assessment
The purposes of the Environmental Audit Assessment are:
I             * To identify present inadequacies in environmental management, and oc upational health
and safety issues in the facilities to be rehabilitated. Of particular intere st are the present
pollution if any and its potential clean-up costs.
I            - *  To determine the need for remedial actions necessary to bring the subj ct facilities into
compliance with World Bank Safeguard Policies and
*  To recommend actions to be taken to improve and strength n TANESCO's
environmental, health and safety management
1.3  Scope of Work
The Environmental Audit Assessment focused only on the 18 existing substatio s earmarked for
rehabilitation in Dar es Salaam, Arusha and Kilimanjaro as outlined above pl s one additional
substation at Chalinze in Coast Region. The Audit took place in November and December 2004.
1.4 Methodology and Approach
l          To accomplish the audit assessment the following approach was applied:
1.4.1 Reviewing records and relevant documents
I          Reviewing all available relevant in house documents including the following: the Master Plan
Study on the Power Sector for major towns in the United Republic of Tanza ia; prepared by
Electric Power Development Co. Ltd., Japan, September 2002, Feasibility tudy Report on
I          Reinforcement and Upgrade of Dar es Salaam, Kilimanjaro and Arusha T ransmission and
Distribution System, Prepared by Lahmeyer International October 2004 and various sectoral
policies. We also reviewed the World Bank, (IFC) Pollution Prevention and Abatement
I          Handbook, environmental and occupational health and safety guidelines and standards. Others
include EMA (2004), 2002 environmental guidelines by NEMC and water stan ards. Basing on
the selected criteria to be audited a checklist was then prepared to assess the ondition of the
substations and facilities.
I          1.4.2  Site Observations and Interview
All 18 substations in Dar es Salaam, Kilimanjaro and Arusha were visited for a sessment and an
additional one at Chalinze. Interviews and brief meetings with relevant staff an residents were
conducted at Ilala, FZ III, Kiyungi, Unga Limited and Njiro Substations. How ver, majority of

Kiyungi and Factory Zone III. During the visit we conducted visual insp ctions and cross
checked the critical issues using the prepared checklist. The checklist identifi s issue as per the
following criteria as deduced from the guidelines mentioned above.
l  General environmental management;
* Waste management practices;
* Hazardous materials management;
I              * Groundwater and soil contamination control;
* Occupational health and safety management; and
* Noise management (Noise level measurements were taken in some sub tations to get an
overview of the noise levels in the substations)
1.4.3  Use of secondary data
Apart from reviewing the available records, this assessment used data and lab ratory test results
conducted in the same substations for identifying polychlorinated bip enyls (PCB) in
transforners and switchgears however, for different purposes. These assessm nts are: Situation
Asses-sment and Environmental Audit, Power Sector Restructuring Project- Fin I Report Version
2.0 prepared by Stone & Webster Consultants, May 2004 and Inventory of Ele trical Equipment
Suspected to Contain Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) prepared by the Vice residents Office
June 2004.
l           1.4.4  PCB identification methods
There are several practical methods in use to deternine if the equipment (e.g. tr sforner, switch
I          gear or capacitor) contains PCBs. The first method is the elimination method. I i this method we
have assumed the cut off year to be 1980. Thus by checking manufacturers' re ords (nameplate)
all transforners manufactured before 1980 and those having no information a -e assumed to be
I          PCB suspects while all transformers made after 1980 and have full info  ation about the
dielectric fluid used (not listed in PCBs common names) are assumed to be PCB free. After
elimination, further tests follow to ascertain whether the assumption is true or not. The methods
I          include density test, chlorine frame test, dexsil test kits and laboratory testing (gas ch omatography with
electron capture then comparing results against standard chromatograms for known arochlors). In this
assessment all methods mentioned above were applied except the chlorine frame test.
1.4.5  Findings Evaluation
Using field observations, site screening tests, laboratory analysis, checklist  d professional
judgment the audit findings were evaluated and prioritized as of high, mediu or low concem.
For instance, if transformer was found to contain less than 50ppm it was classi ied as PCB free.
This is the threshold level in most countries required by the law. If the equipm nt has 50ppm or
above but below 500ppm, the equipment is classified as contaminated thus ne d to be properly
labeled and controlled though it can be retained in service until the end of useful life. Hence
there is low to medium concem about this group. If equipment is foun  to have PCBs
concentration above 500ppm this is classified as pure PCB and this is of very high concem. If the
concem is rated high it means a call for immediate attention or action.

Policy, Legal and Institutional Framework
Environmental management has become a global challenge and Impact Assess ent is a requisite
for every major project at local and international level. Financiers, govemmel ts, environmental
agencies and the public are demanding environmental responsibility of every action taken by
corporate. This is due to the fact that any development activity has the p tential to impact
negatively or positively to the environment and the society is the one, which benefit or looses.
l           Therefore any development must be sustainable so as to provide goods and ervices for many
years without compromising the ability of future generations to survive.
l           One of the useful tools in ensuring that the environment is given a due c nsideration is the
Environmental Audit and Assessment (EAA). EAA provides an opportunity o assess past and
present actions against standard believed to be the best practice in order to kn w deficiencies in
the practices thus initiate corrective actions to remedy or improve t se environmental
performance.
l          This chapter reviews policies, legal, and guidelines, which guide actions to wh t is believed to be
environmental management best practices. In order for the project to be accept ible it has to fulfil
the Tanzanian policies and laws and at the same time must comply with the World Bank
I          requirements. Hence, this chapter has categorized these requirements as Tanza rian, International
Agreements (of which Tanzania is a signatory) and the World Bank.
2.1  Tanzanian requirements
2.1.1 The Environmental Management Act, 2004
This Act provides for legal and institutional framework for sustainabl management of
environment; outlines principles for management, impact and risk assessmen s, prevention and
control of pollution, waste management, environrnental quality standards, p iblic participation
1          and enforcement; it provides basis for implementation of economic and fi iancial incentives
designed to influence behaviour to ensure sustainable use of natural resources and protection of
environment; it provides for implementation of the National Enviromnental P licy and it repeals-
I          the National Environmental Management Act, 1983 and provides for continued existence of the
National Environment Management Council (NEMC).
l           The proposed project needs to recognize the Act in the sense that environmen al management is
a duty and that it is the right of every person living in Tanzania to live in clea r, safe and healthy
environment. Under the Act, environmental liability has been imposed to m magers of bodies
I          corporate. If the corporate commits an environmental offence, the man ger is liable for
prosecution and faces fine or impnsonment.

2.1.1.1 Environmental audit review
The prepared environmnental audit report shall be submitted to the Council  MC) for review
by the Multi-Sectoral Technical Review Committee (TRC) for the purpose o establishing the
accuracy and coverage of key issues and providing appropriate recommendat ons for remedial
measures.
l          2.1.2  Water Utilization Act (1974); amended in 1981
The Act establishes a central Water Board with the authority to regulate th use of water, to
I          control water pollution, and formulating standards for effluents and stream q ality. The Water
Board grants the discharge consents. The 1981 amendments include Standa ds for Receiving
Waters, based on their classification (i.e. Category 1, 2 or3). The Act provi es standards for
l          Temperature, pH, organic substances and inorganic substances, oil and grease, tc. The standard
allows the maximum limit of lOppm of any discharges of oil and grease to rece ving waters. Any
discharge of oil and grease in excess of 1Oppm must be treated before  eing discharged.
Therefore, -any discharges from the planned or operating facility must abide by I hese limits.
2.1.3  The Land Act, 1999 (No 4)
One of the fundamental principles of this Act is to ensure that land is used pro uctively and that
any such use complies with the principles of sustainable development. The Act also stipulates
I1         procedures of acquiring land from the rightful owners and the required compen ations. However,
this component of the project is expected to utilize the existing land alre dy occupied by
TANESCO. Nevertheless, if need to acquire more land for the upgrading of ubstations arises,
then all procedures of acquiring land as stipulated in this Act must be followed.
Further, the proponent should know that after the useful life of the Substatio is over the land
should be left in a state where others can use it. Hence, the projec should do the
decommissioning of the project when the project activities come to an end.
2.1.4 The Village Land Act 1999 (No 5)
In case the concerned land is in rural areas, the law to be used shall be the vil age Land Act of
1999 known as land Act number 5. This Act provide for the management and dministration of
land in village and related matters.
2.1.5 The Occupation, Health and Safety Act 2003
The Act repeals the Factories Ordinance 1950. It makes provisions for the s fety, health and
welfare of persons at work in factories and other places of work. It also provi es protection of
people other than persons at work against hazards to health and safety arin ing out of or in
I          connection with the activity. Therefore, health and safety is must for the emp oyer, employees
and people around the facilities.

1          2.1.9  Petroleum (conservation) Act, 1981 (Act No. 18 - 1981)
This Act provides for regulation of the impact, transport, storage, distribution, sale and use of
petroleum products and connected matter. Substations have oil in transformers and switch gears
l          which require proper management and handling.
l          2.1.10 National Environmental Policy (NEP 1997)
The National Environmental Policy provides the framework for making fun amental changes
that are needed to bring environmental considerations into the mainstream of de cision-making. It
I          also seeks to provide policy guidelines, plans and guidance to the determi ation of priority
actions, and provides for monitoring and regular review of policies, plans and p ogrammes.
3          The policy among other environmental issues, it insists on prevention and cont al of land, water,
vegetation and air degradation, which constitute our life support systems. It also requires
protection of biological diversity of unique ecosystem.
2.1.11 Sectoral Policies
The following sectoral policies recognize the importance of environment  protection and

environmentally sound manner.
2.1.11.2    National Water Policy (2002)
The policy insists on the integrated water resources management involving ll stakeholders. It
further emphasises that water resources shall be conserved and water po lution should be
avoided. The relevancy of this policy to this audit study is to remind the pro ect proponent the
need to avoid any kind of oil spills, wastes of harmful substances or any oth r substances that
may cause water pollution of the source or water body of any kin during project
implementation, operation and decommission.
2.1.11.3    The National Land Policy (1996)
I           The policy developed with the main aim of ensuring wise use of land, it guid s land allocation,
resolve conflicts and prevent degradation. The policy gives guiding principl s and mandate to
local authority on issues related to environmental management. The relevanc of this policy to
the project is about land tenure and right of occupancy. Further the policy ives guidance on
protecting sensitive areas by not allocating such areas for social or economic d velopment.
l           2.1.11.4    National Human Settlement Development Policy (2000)
The policy is under Ministry of Land and Human Settlements Development an it emphasizes on
the integration of all human activity processes - residence, work, educati n, health, culture
leisure and the physical structures that support the human settlement. Hence A ith good intention
of the government in facilitating adequate delivery of shelter and improvin development of
sustainable human settlement in the country, the supply of reliable electricity i these settlements
is vital in ensuring the quality of life.

endangered and threatened species of flora and fauna and their habitats.
2.1.11.7    Other Relevant Policies
There are other relevant policies to this study, which are worth mentioning. Th se include Health
Policy particularly on the issues of occupational health; and Construction Indu try Policy (2003).
3           All these policies emphasize the importance of project proponent to consider 11 aspects ranging
from the welfare of the workers to other people who may be affected negative y or positively by
the project. They are also insisting on the best practice on environmental n anagement. Early
consideration of all aspect will make the investment to be sustainable.
2.2 International agreements on environment
l           Tanzania has also committed herself to a number of international agreemen s on environment
and development. The relevant international agreements to this environmental tudit include:
* Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), adopted in May 1992.  The aim of this
*              convention was on developing national strategies for the conservation and sustainable use of
biological diversity
* The Climate Change Convention adopted in June 1992 and ratified in March 1996. The
major aim of this convention is to combat the global warming by reducing emission of green
house gases
* Convention concerning Protection of Workers against Occupational Haza s in the Working
Environment due to Air pollution, Noise and Vibration, adopted in 197 . The aim of this
convention is to ensure the safe working environment for the workers
+ Basel Convention on Trans-boundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and environmentally
sound management of hazardous wastes (April 1993). The conven on provides the
guidelines on hazardous waste management.
*           * Stockholm convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs). The conv ntion calls for all
countries to properly manage the pollutants such as Polychlorinated bip enyls (PCBs) and
advises restrictions on the marketing, use and disposal of PCBs
2.3 The World Bank requirement
The World Bank, through the Intemational Development Agency (IDA) and the IFC has
established Safeguard Policies and environmental guidelines of which a lender needs to comply
depending on the nature of the project. For this Environmental Audit Assessr ent the following
l           policies and guidelines may apply.
l           2.3.1  WB Safeguard Policies

project) require the Environmental Impact Assessment.
OP 4.04: Natural Habitat: Aims to promote and support natural habi at conservation,
protection, maintenance, and improved land use. It insist on precautionary ap roach to natural
resource management to ensure opportunities for environmentally sustainable d velopment
Applicability of thle policy to tlhis project
This policy is applicable in the sense that it is required to control oil pollution n land (soil) and
water and any behaviour that will affect natural habitat or degrade the land which can be used
for other purposes
OP4.12: Involuntary Resettlement: Aims to minimize the involuntary resett ement whenever
|          possible. Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) is needed to reduce impacts to t ose who will be
displaced by the project.
Applicability of the policy to this project
l          It is anticipated that rehabilitation of the substations will not need extra land. Vowever, in case
substation designs change and extra spaces are required, procedures for acqu ring land will be
followed including the preparation of Resettlement Action Plan that will be sub itted to the local
authority and the WB.
OPN 11.03: Cultural Property: requirement to protect and conserve cultural si es
I          Applicability of the policy to this project
For the sites to be rehabilitated, no cultural properties are expected to exist n the site as the
rehabilitation work will be on the already disturbed land sites. However, it sh 11 be considered
in case of new Substations and new transmission lines.
1          2.3.2  Pollution prevention and Abatement Handbook Guidelines
The purpose of the guidelines among other things is to identify environmental, health and safety
problems and recommend cost-effective measures that could improve the envi onmental, health
and safety performance to meet the WB standards. The guidelines that have b en considered in

* Although Lawati Substation was in the WB terms of Reference, it was left out in this study after discussion with
Kilimanjaro Senior Engineer that the concerns are on Trade School substation and not Law iti Substation. Hence
Trade school substation replaces the Lawati substation.
'It was also recommended that Chalinze Substation be included in the project though it is outsH e the above
mentioned regions.
This Environmental Audit was conducted between 9th November 2004 and 10 December 2004.
I            The audit was based on criteria stipulated below:
* General environmental management;
* Waste management practices;
I               * Hazardous materials management;
* Groundwater and soil contamination control;
* Occupational health and safety management; and
* Noise management (Noise level measurements were taken in some su stations to get an
overview of the noise levels in the substations)
*            These criteria were translated into a checklist which was used to identify issue of strength to the
subject substation or issues that need corrective actions (weakness) so as to iaeet the minimum
required standard.
The approach to this audit included the site inspection, equipment and mat .rial identification
(PCB content transformers and switch gears), interview of personnel and re idents working in
the substations or living near the substation. Available records or documi ntation were also
verified.
Substations which have been audited using the criteria above include the foliol ring:
S TANESCO has four operational regions in Dar es Salaam which are Kinondoni North Kinondoni South,
Ilala and Temeke all located in Dar es Salaam administrative region

iv. Fire fighting equipment is inadequate need to be adequately suppl ed in the required
proportions (foam, carbon dioxide, powder, etc.) and recharged whe expire
v. The substation site will require an extra land if expansion is needed
3.2 Oyster Bay 33/11kV Substation
This substation is located in a plot at the junction of Ali Hassan Mwinyi road nd Kawawa road
in Kinondoni district. On the north there is Ali Hassan Mwinyi road and o the west of the
substation there is Kawawa road. The eastern side is bordered by residential ouses and on the
south an empty space. This substation is remotely controlled from Ilala and UJlungo substations.
The area is dominated by the noise of passing vehicles. The potential environ nental risks come
from oil, SF6 and CFC gasses, and safety risk mainly from electric shock.
The substation (see photo 2:1-3 in Appendix 2) is currently equipped v ith one 33/llkV,
15MVA   transformer (1993) with two stand-by transformers of capac ty 5MVA    each
I          . manufactured in 1963. The substation is overloaded and requires immediate ittention. A 33kV
line to Ilala and Mikocheni connects the substation.
The proposal recommends among other things the following rehabilitation: c anging 33kV and
11 kV switchboards, circuit breakers, cubicles, installation of two new 33/1 lk V, 15MVA power
transformers.
3.2.1 Audit findings and the required remedial actions: Oyster Bay Subs ation
From the site investigation and checklist the following issues were identified:
1. The substation has transformers and oil circuit breakers of 1963 and 1993. Hence by
elimination method one transformer in the substation has got no PCBs. H wever for the two
transformers of 1963 the laboratory tests showed some traces of Aroclor 254 and Aroclor
1260 with concentration 405 ppm and 352ppm respectively. This result c ncludes that these
I              two transformers are PCB contaminated. Therefore, appropriate handling is required including
prevention of leakages and restriction on moving them
2. The transformers are oil leaking however they are labelled and restricte from shifting to

1. The substation has a transformer of 1967, which make the substation a PCB uspect. However,
the study by the Vice President's Office in August 2004 concluded the su station has PCBs
compounds below 50ppm based on the density detection method as the wei ht of the oil and
density of the oil were provided by transformer manufacturer. No labora ory analysis was
performed. Hence the substation is concluded by the study as PCB free.
2. The transformer has traces of oil leaks presumably due to overloading an I oil mishandling
I              during maintenance activities
3. It has no equipment suspected to contain chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) particularly R12
refrigerant which is commonly used as air conditioning refrigerant in Tanzani
4. The substation transformer has no oil leakage containment, which means lea s will soak into
the soil and then to surface and underground water
I           5. Although it is remotely controlled, there are security guards at site who r quire convenient
shade for rain and sun and toilet facility. The substation is located in indus rial area where a
substation noise will not exceed 70dB as shown in measured substation
6. The substation is earthed to minimize radiation and magnetic field effects

l l         3.10.1 Audit findings and the required remedial actions: Factory Zone 11 'ubstation
The audit found the following:
|            1. The substation has transformers and oil circuit breakers of 1979 and 196 respectively. By
elimination method the substation is classified as PCB suspect. However, sin e TANESCO has
fl              a tendency of doing refilling of new oil to all transformers in substations fror time to time and
*               that no pure PCB has been found in TANESCO transformers it may be assumed that the
substation is also free from PCB in most cases (i.e. below 50ppm) even tho gh no laboratory
3 |             tests has been conducted on this substation.
2. No oil leakage was observed
3. It has no equipment that may contain chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) particular y R12 refrigerant
which is commonly found in AC and refrigerators in Tanzania
4. The substation has no transformer oil containment which means any leaka e goes to the soil
l l             and eventually to surface and underground water
5. The substation is remotely controlled and the average ambient noise on the s vitchyard is 48dB
during the day. Few residential houses are located about 20-40m from the ubstation and the
Mandela road is also located some 50rn from the substation
6. The substation is earthed and has protective shields to minimize radiation aid magnetic field

3.11 Njiro 220/132/33kV Substation
This substation (seen on photo 11: 1-2 in Appendix2) is located at Njiro hills in Arusha town. It
receives energy from Singida through the 220kV transmission line and  om Kiyungi and
Pangani Hydro Systems through the 132kV transmission line. Residential ho ses are located as
far as 150-300m from the substation.
The substation has 220kV, 132kV, and 33kV voltage levels bus bars an  220/132kV and
132/33kV transformers. The 220kV connects with the national grid from Sing da and the 132kV
connects to the hydropower stations of the Pangani Hydro Systems through  ame and Kiyungi
substations. The substation has two 132/33, 20MVA transformers manufactu ed in 1981 while
those of 220/132 20MVA were manufactured in 1996. The transforme s are overloaded
I            especially at peak hours and the oil temperature reaches more than 90 °C. T etransformers are
of cooling type ONAN and the extension will convert to ONAF thus increasin the rated load to
30MVA each.
The proposal is to exchange the two 132/33kV, 20MVA transformers with tw  132/33, 50MVA
transformers or install additional 132/33kV, 50MVA transformer and relate transformer bay
equipment to support the existing two transformers. Also it is proposed to in tall 132kV bay to
connect the new 132kV line from Kiyungi S/S via Kilimanjaro International Airport (KIA). For
distribution system two additional 33kV line bays are being proposed to fee New Kiltex and
new Njiro B substations.
3.11.1 Audit findings and the required remedial actions: Njiro Substation
The audit found the following:
1. The substation has transformers of 1981 and 1996 and switch gears use SF gas hence by the
elimination method the substation is PCBs free
2. Small oil leakage was seen one of 132/33kV transformers
3. It has few window type air condition units, which may contain chloroflu rocarbons (CFCs)
particularly R12 refrigerant which is commonly used in Tanzania. Howe er, no disposable
units were seen at the site
4. The substation has oil containment for newly installed transformers (220/ 32) but lacks the
containment for the old installations (132/33kV transformers)

1           3.15 Unga Limited 66/33/llkV Substation (Power Station)
This substation (seen on photo 15:1-2 in Appendix 2) is located at Unga L mited area in the
Arusha old power station compound. The substation receives energy from K yungi through the
I           66kV transmission line. It supplies energy to the industrial and residential a eas. According to
the consultant the equipment has reached its useful life and upgrading or reha ilitation makes no
l           sense.
The substation has 66kV, 33kV and I IkV voltage levels bus bars. After rec iving 66KV from
Kiyungi it steps down to 33kV through the 66/33kV transformer. The subs ation is currently
equipped with two 33/1 1kV, 5MVA transformners erected in 1966. There are ther five off line
transformers laying at the compound.
l           It is therefore proposed to rebuild the substation adjacent to the. existing ite as an indoor
33/1 IkV substation with one 33/1 lkV 15MVA power transformer with provi ion of adding the
second one. It is further proposed to add one transforner bay, two 33kV feeder bays and
provision of spare feeders.
3.15.1 Audit findings and the required remedial actions: Unga Limited Su station
The audit found the following:
l           1. The substation has transformers and oil circuit breakers of 1966 making the substation a PCB
suspect. However the laboratory test conducted for two transformers in Mar -h 2004 by Stone
and Webster did not find any traces of PCB compounds in the samples. This oncludes that the
existing transformer oil has been changed several times and the substation is CB free
2. Oil leakage was seen almost on every transformer and breakers
3. No equipment was observed which may contain chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs particularly RI 2
refrigerant comnmonly in AC repair work in Tanzania
4. The substation has no oil containment for the installed transformers. This m eans any spillage
will contaminate the soil and eventually surface and ground water
5. The control room for the switchboard operators is not convenient for the worl ing staff. In spite
l             of having ventilation, the machine hall exposes operators to cold during cold times and lots of
mosquitoes in other times. It has been very difficult to control the insects beca se the hall is too
big. The machine hall needs to be compartmentalized to have sufficient and onvenient rooms
which can be easily controlled temperature-wise and insects-wise.
6. Noise wise the substation is quiet and does not need any ear protection against noise.
I          7. The substation is earthed and has protective shields to minimize radiation ar d magnetic field
effects
8. The substation fenced but needs repair and warning signs to prevent the ger eral public from
electrocutions

3.16 Kiyungi 132/66/33kV Substation
Kiyungi substation (seen on photo 16 in Appendix 2) is located about 8km to the South of the
Moshi town centre on the left bank of the Kikafu River next to the large s gar cane estate.
Kuyungi S/S is the main station in Moshi area connected to the 132kV system t y the 132kV line
from same-Hale and from Njiro S/S.
The S/station has one 132/66kV, 15MVA transformner of 1974 and one 13 /33kV, 20MVA
transformer of 1989. Also there are two 66/33kV, 5MVA transformers ard one 66/33kV,
. s l~IOMVA trunsforrner of 1967. Different vector group are connected to the seco idary side of the
*132/66kV main transformner. Apart from SF6 circuit breakers, still there are s me oil breakers
mainly for 66kV and 33kV circuits dating back from 1967 to 1984.
The proposal is to exchange 132/33kV, 20MVA transforners by a 132/33, 50M VA transformer.
It is also proposed to install 132kV bay to connect the new 132kV line from Kiy ingi to Njiro S/S
via Kilimanjaro International Airport (KIA). The 33kV outdoor substation shal be rehabilitated
and extended or rebuild as a new indoor substation. For distribution system two additional 33kV

line bays are being proposed to feed Machame and Boma Mbuzi substation and refurbish the
existing 33kV feeder bays.
3.16.1 Audit findings and the required remedial actions: Kiyungi Substat on
The audit found the following:
1. In this substation, the PCB concerns are the transformers dating back  1974 and 1967.
Transforrners dating above 1980 are considered non-PCB transformers. It s believed that the
retro filling, which has been going on in the substation, may have neutralize the concentration.
The PCB study conducted by the Stone & Webster found out that out of f )ur sanples taken,
three were found to contain traces of Aroclor 1254 and Aroclor 1260 c mpounds of PCB
ranging from o.5ppm to 205ppm. These values indicate that the oil has tra es of PCB, hence
PCB contaminated. The conclusion made from the sarnple result is hat all suspected
transformers dating back before 1980 are contaminated though in different c ncentration.
2. Oil leakage was seen on TI and T2 breakers
3. The substation  has few  window   type air condition  units, whi h  may contain
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) particularly R12 refrigerant which is commonl used in Tanzania
in AC repair work. However, no disposable units were seen at the site
4. The substation has oil containment for newly installed transformers but lac s the containment
for the old installation. No oil leaks were seen on the transformers thoug . The site has no
designated storage room for the oils instead it uses the regional stores
5. The workroom is air conditioned to maintain workplace air quality and the oom is quiet. The
outside noise level is below 50dB during the day. No complains has s far reported by
3              residents over noise levels
6. The substation is earthed and has protective shields to minimize radiation and magnetic field
effects
7. The substation is well fenced and has warning signs to prevent the ge eral public from
electrocutions
3           8. The substation needs improvement in the following areas:
i. Regular training of all personnel in safety & safety procedures, work procedures,
accident and accident prevention and health risks
ii. Availing more reference materials of which employees could refer t or improve their
knowledge
iii. Emergency preparedness, prevention and response plan needs to be prepared and

3.17 Boma Mbuzi 33/l1kV Substation
This substation (seen on photo 17:1-2 in Appendix 2) is located along the TP  road. There are
some residential houses nearby substation.
The substation is currently equipped with 2 33/1lkV, 5MVA transforme  of 1980. The
I           substation is located north of Kiyungi and connected to the 33kV line Kiyungi - Boma Mbuzi -
Rombo. It is suggested to rebuild the substation to the new 33/1 lkV standard It is designed to
cover the load in the surrounding areas and be the starting point for the 33kV I ne to Rombo and
1 I kV feeders to the surrounding areas.
It is proposed that the substation be an indoor 33/11kV equipped with one 3/11kV 15MVA
I           power transforner with a provision to add a second transformer. It further prop sed to add a full
33kV transformer bay, two 33kV feeder bays, one equipped spare bay an space for four
l           additional feeders.
l           3.17.1 Audit findings and the required remedial actions: Boma Mbuzi Sub tation
The audit found the following:
I. The sub station has transformers and oil circuit breakers of 1980. This me Is by elimination
method the substation can be classified as PCB free substation
2. No oil leakage was observed neither on the circuit breaker nor transformers
3. The substation is remotely controlled from Kiyungi substation. Hence no eq ipment that may
have contained chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) was seen on the site particularl R12 refrigerant
which is commonly applied in Tanzania.
I           4. The substation has no oil containment thus oil leaks may contaminate undergr und water
5. The substation is earthed to minimize radiation and magnetic field effects
6. The substation is fenced to restrict access to the substation by unauthorized p ople however, it
needs repair
7. The substation needs improvement in the following areas:
i. Repair of security lights, put more danger signs

3.18 Trade School 33/11kV Substation
This substation (seen on photo 18:1-2 in Appendix 2) is located off Moshi- asha road near the
junction to Bonite Bottlers Limited. It seemed to have switch board & control oom building and
fencing rehabilitated recently.
l           The substation is currently equipped with one 33/11kV, 5MVA transforme of 1975 and one
33/1 IkV IMVA of 1983. According to the technical consultant the substati n has reached its
|           useful life and needs to be rebuilt.
It is proposed to rebuild the substation as an indoor 33/llkV substation v ith one 33/llkV
15MVA power transformer with a provision of adding a second transfor ner. It is further
proposed to add a full 33kV transformer bay, three 33kV feeder bays, one equ pped spare feeder
bay and space for three additional feeders.
3.18.1 Audit findings and the required remedial actions: Trade School Su station
The audit found the following:
1. The sub station has transformers and oil circuit breakers of 1983 and 197 . This makes the
substation a PCB suspect on one transformer. As general observation the ubstation may be
PCB free or contaminated based on the studies made in March 2004 by Sto e & Webster and
July 2004 by Vice President's Office
2. Oil leakage was observed on the transformers which were off the circuit t at are waiting the
disposal
*           3. The substation is remotely controlled from Kiyungi substation. Hence no eq ipment was seen
! S            that may have contained chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) particularly R12 re rgerant which is
commonly applied in Tanzania
4. The substation has no oil containment thus any oil leaks will contaminate s il and eventually
surface and underground water

3.19 Chalinze 132/33kV Substation
This substation is located at Chalinze on the left hand side of the Dar - M rogoro road. The
substation has two transformers which are not working due to some malfunctic ning. One is rated
132/33kV; 1OMVA was manufactured in 1962 and the other is 132/33kV; SMN A also of 1962.
It is proposed to upgrade the substation by installing two new power transform nrs in the range of
I OMVA together with switchgears. Other tasks will include changing the circuit breakers,
current transformers, protection and control devices, supporting structures, add ng surge arrestors
on all line feeders. Also the civil works will cover the upgrade of the intemal and external fence,
substation drainage system and the building.
|l          3.19.1 Audit findings and the required remedial actions: Chalinze Substat on
The audit found the following:
1. The sub station has transformners and oil circuit breakers of 1962. Hence by e limination method
(i.e. transformers and switchgears made after 1980 are classified as PCB fre ) the substation is
-PCB suspect. However the weight of the oil is 25,800 British pounds (11,72 .3 kg) and volume
l              of the oil is 2,990 British gallons (13,593 litres), which means the densit i of the liquid oil
(11,727.3 kg/13,593 Its = 0.86 kg/Its3) is less than the density of water (no e: density of PCB
*              oil is heavier than water i.e. 1kg/lts3)
. U          2. There was an oil leakage in one transformer
3. It has three (3) window air conditioning units which may contain chlorofluc rocarbons (CFCs)
.i |particularly R12 refrigerant which is commonly used in Tanzania for repair Morks
4. The substation has no transformner oil containment to prevent oil from cont uninating the soil
l l            and ground water in case of spillage. Spare oil is stored in the above groun d tank which also
has no any containrment apart from gravels

5. The substation noises come from the passing vehicles which is hardly heat d when you are in
the control room. Hence it is not dangerous to the workers
6. The substation is fenced and has waming signs to prevent the ge eral public from
l              electrocutions
7. The substation has poor drainage which needs to be improved
8. The substation needs improvement in the following areas:
. *                   i.  Improvement in general cleanness of the substation and removal f scraps
ii.  Emergency preparedness, prevention and response plan needs t be prepared and
3 |                      rehearsed. A summary of important items of the plan need to be anged on the wall
for the reference of everyone
iii.  A toilet needs some repairs to be in a standard condition and a se urity guard kiosk
is also needed. In addition, broken or missing cable trench slabs n ed to be replaced
iv.  Fire fighting equipment is inadequate need to be adequately suppi ed in the required
proportions (foam, carbon dioxide, powder, etc.) and recharged w en expire
v.   Personal protective equipment such as helmets need to be supplie
vi.  Training of personnel is needed. One person attended a course 20 years ago but
others have not attended any course
vii.  Improvement in waste handling
! *               viii.  The substation needs more gravels
ix.  Work procedures and safety guidelines need to be available in a k iown language to
l  l                    substation operators
3.20 Public Concerns (Substation)
The major concern of the public regarding the substations was a he th risk due to
electromagnetic effects. Although there is no proof yet of the effect here in anzania, people
raised their fear based on the information available in the Intemet. Th  World Health
Organization (WHO) guidelines however, suggest that the level should not exceed 5000V/m.
There were no complains or concems about the noise levels around the substa ions. Up to now
no any complaints have been received or reported to Substation authorities du ng the course of
the study.
Note: TANESCO shall perform a laboratory analysis of the soil samnples under the transformers
suspected of PCBs in the year 2006 budget. When the fund becomes available a d the laboratory
capable of delivering the required analysis locally is found the soil sarnples shal be taken for the
l           analysis.
3.21 Prioritised Audit Findings and Recommendations
l          Below are the prioritised audit findings and recommendations. These facilities  ill comply with
the World Bank minimum standard requirement after correction of the observed weaknesses and
shortcomings in the following areas in the order of high concerns- high pri rity and lower
concern- lower priority:

implemented on site by the responsible regions or plants. TANESCO sh uld strength1en
environmental nmanagement botlh at Head Office Environmental U it and at tlhe
implementing Regions or plants
2. Waste management and handling was also seen to be a problem in most su stations. Pieces
of solid wastes and scraps had no specific and designated area for collect an and eventual
disposal. Facilities (substations) should designate special areas (po nts) for waste
collection and collect all unwanted scraps for a safe disposal. Wastes o substation site
such as pieces of cables and other wastes could have special bins
3. Almost all of the transformers in use in the audited substations owned by T NESCO can be
classified as non-PCB. This is because among the samples sent for the labo atory tests from
the audited areas, PCB was not detected or was below 50ppm. In one su station traces of
3             PCB of less than 500ppm cut off point compounds were detected in transf rmers (i.e. some
transformers are PCB contaminated). This might be 6f concem to the World ank. However,
the Vice Presidents Office (VPO) has labelled all these transformers a d they are not
allowed to be moved from where they located without the permission from the VPO office.
As these identified transformers are waiting for the National Strategic P an to eliminate
POPs TANESCO should ensure that they are not moved from wher they are and
I             substation engineers should ensure that there is no leakage to the s il or water. In
addition there should be appropriate oil handling at all times.
l          4. In some substations, some of the old transformers dumped at substatio  sites have oil
leakages, which contaminate the soil. TANESCO (Regional Offices) sho ld collect these
transformers and dispose them or store them in appropriate designed area that contains or
I             prevent the oil leakage to the soiL For all new transformer installations transformer oil
containments should be considered
l          5. Fire fighting equipment is inadequate in right proportions (foam, CO2, pow er). TANESCO
should provide adequate fire fighting equipment in a right proportion foam, CO2 and
l             powder) tofigght anyfire types in the substations
6. Environmental Management Plan and Monitoring of the substations is ab ent. TANESCO
should implement the prepared EMP and provide resources estimated at l ast USD 10,500
annuallyfor monitoring plan.
7. Some of the cable trench slabs are broken or missing thus causing a safety sks at night and
in case of emergency. TANESCO Regional Offices should plan the bud et and urgently
replace all lost or broken lids and slabs
1          8. First aid kit is not equipped and lack essential drugs. Substation engineers n collaboration
with Regional Offices should reequip the First aid kits as required
l          9. Some of the substations have their fences damaged, security lights not w rking and their
danger signs missing or wom out. TANESCO should ensure that dam ged fences are

repaired, security lights work again and all danger signs are replaced to j Prevent and warn
the public ofpotentrial danger as they approach tlhefences
10. There is no clear identification of who has been assigned responsibility of t king care for the
environmental matter of the substations. There is a need to assign re ponsibility to a
substation engineer who has to report performance in monthly report
Medium Concern - Medium priority
I 1. Except for Njiro, Kiyungi, Ilala, and FZ III, which have askari kiosks and oilets majority of
the substations, have no such facilities. Security guards have got neither shade nor toilets
making their work difficult and dangerous in some cases such as rain s ason or at night.
TANESCO is required to provide such facilities at the workplace for th convenience of
workforce. It is recommended that security guard kiosks and toilets shou d be constructed
for those, whicl don 't have, and for those such as Sokoine city centre and Oyster Bay,
l  which have the kiosks but toilets are out of order, should be restored and X vaintained
12. Working procedures and instructions are missing. TANESCO and subs ation Engineers
should prepare work procedure manuals and instructions and make thlel I available to all
substation workers
13. Emergency preparedness, prevention and response plan was seen to e lacking in all
substations audited in case of fire, major accident or major oil spills. Although some
substations had radio calls and telephone lines no clear line of communi ation in case of
emergency was seen. TANESCO needs to prepare an emergency respons plan. The plan
should be frequently practiced (hold regular drill to check whether the Ian performs as
intended) and each employee should know all the information flow in case of the
I             emergency. Informationflow charts should be posted at a visible place
14. Although training has been taking place in TANESCO, trainings specific ly designed for
I             substation engineers, technicians and operators have been scarce and li ited to very few
individuals. TANESCO   (Head office which coordinates employee ' trainings in
cooperation withl regional offices) needs to organise regular courses (tail r made training
I        -    programs to suit different cadres of substation employees and others) .su h as training on
work procedures, health and safety matters, hazardous material handling and emergency
preparedness and response
15. Oil spill is not a big problem in many substations. However, improveme t in oil handling
during maintenance is required to all employees working in the substa ions. Substation
a             engineer and maintenance supervisor should ensure oil handlers improve the oil handling
to prevent oil spillage duringfi lling up of Oil Circuit Breakers (OCBs) nd transformers
or during retro filling and filtering the oil and all oil leaks from ti ansformers and
switchgears are contained
16. TANESCO has so far no formalized Environmental Management System  EMS) though it
has a unit, which deals with environmental matters. The Major bottleneck to undertake the
environmental programs is lack of budget. TANESCO has to develop and EMS suitable to

be made available
*          17. Public Concern: the major concern of the public was a health risk due to electromagnetic
effect. No noise complains or concerns were reported during the survey. Ts NESCO should

Environmental Management Plan
Construction and operation of the substation may have various impacts to   he enviroment.
Environmental Assessment as a management tool could be used to identify t    impacts before
I           the construction of a substation. However, the audit assessment found no rcc  ds showing that
there was any environmental impact assessment for the substations. This may  e due to the fact
that majority of these substations were constructed more than 20 years ago wh  EIA was given
I           little attention. The audit study has identified the environmental impacts that a e likely to occur
in the construction and operation of the substation. The significance of these impacts may be
reduced if mitigation measures and monitoring are put in place.    This ch pter provides a
summary of impacts, mitigation measures and monitoring plan.
3           In order to ensure that there is a system to track compliance with the WB an  Government of
Tanzania policies; Laws and guidelines, TANESCO have to commit itself a Id ensure that it
establishes the Environmental Management System (EMS). The advantages of having the EMS
at TANESCO      include: having people who are responsible for ensunn        environmental
management, having a systematic way of tracking the environmental problem   and addressing
them in all aspects of company activities, having proper records and assignm -nt of budget to
3           environmental programs.

Chapter 5
l          Conclusion and Recommendations
The overall conclusion is that majority of the substations meet the Work Bank minimum
requirement with only few minor corrections. The remedial costs are to be co ered in Regional
repair and maintenance budgets. It is proposed that Regional offices review the document to
I          understand the shortcomings of the substations in their area and workout the ac ual budgets to be
approved by the regional administration.
It is the responsibility of TANESCO Regional Offices of which these substati s fall in the area
of their jurisdiction to ensure that they do corrective measures so as to fully comply with the
World Bank minimum requirement. TANESCO Head Office shall provide as stance whenever
necessary to the regional offices.
1. TANESCO    should  strengthen  environmental management both      Head  Office
Environmental Unit and at the implementing Regions or plants
2. Since TANESCO has so far no formalized Environmental Management ystem (EMS) in
spite of having an environmental unit, which deals with environment I matters. Then
TANESCO has to develop an EMS suitable to its activities or adopt ISO 4000 standard in
order to improve its environmental management performance. In addition, fund for
implementing management plans should be made available
3. Although training has been taking place in TANESCO, trainings specific ly designed for
substation engineers, technicians and operators have been scarce and li ited to very few
individuals. TANESCO (Head office which coordinates employees' trainin s in cooperation
with regional offices) needs to organise regular courses (tailor made trai ng programs) to
suit different cadres of substation employees and others. such as training  ay include work
procedures, health and safety matters, hazardous material handling and emergency
preparedness and response
l          4. Since it was observed that no clear identification of who has been assigned responsibility of
taking care for the environmental matters of the substations. Therefore, su station engineers
or supervisors should be assigned also such a responsibility and re uired to report
performance in monthly reports
5. TANESCO needs to prepare an emergency response plan in the event of fir , major accident
or major oil spills. All audited substations didn't have the plan. Workers nee to rehearse and
I             understand the information flow in case of the emergency so as to check  hether the plan
works as intended. Information flow charts should also be posted at a visible place
6. Waste management need to be improved in all the substations as this iAas seen to be a
problem in most substations. Substation management should designate spec ial areas (points)

for waste collection before safe disposal. Special bins can be used to stor collected wastes
such as pieces of cables, insulators and other wastes in the substation site b fore disposal
7. Raise awareness of people working in the substation on the potential hazard of oil spill to the
environment and how to handle it appropriately during refilling, oil filtering or maintenance.
l          8. TANESCO Regional Offices are required to provide toilets and askari kio k facilities in the
substations for the convenience of workforce. There are some which nee repair and some
! 3            which need to be constructed. With exception of Njiro, Kiyungi, Ilala, ar d FZ III all other
I             substations lack toilet, askari kiosk or both.
9. TANESCO (Regional Offices) should collect all old transformers dumped at substation sites
which some of them have oil leakage and dispose them or store them in ap ropriate designed
areas that may contain or prevent the oil leakage into the soil.
*          10. TANESCO should provide adequate fire fighting equipment in a right prop rtion (foam, CO2
and powder) to fight any fire type in the substations and ensure that equip nent are regularly
checked to be sure that they are working properly. Some substations h d inadequate fire
fighting equipment or right proportion.
11. TANESCO departments and substation engineers should prepare work p rocedure manuals
and instructions where such instructions are very essential and make th m available in a
known language to all substation workers. Many substations had no workii g procedures and
I              instructions at all or had instruction written in a language not understandabl by majority.
12. TANESCO should provide resources estimated at least USD 11,000 annually to facilitate
I              implementation of the proposed ESMP and monitoring plan. Other mitiga tion costs will be
covered in construction costs.
13. TANESCO Regional Offices should budget and urgently replace all lost c r broken lids and
slabs to improve the safety in the substations as some of the cable trench slabs were found
broken or missing increasing a safety risks at night and in emergency cases.
14. TANESCO's substation engineers in collaboration with their Regional Offices should
reequip the First aid kits as required since most of first aid kits are n t equipped with
essential drugs.
15. TANESCO should ensure that transformers identified having PCB cont  ination (below
500ppm) are not moved from where they are located. In addition substation engineers should
ensure that there is no leakage to the soil or water. Further there should le appropriate oil
handling at all times while waiting for the national strategic plan to elimin; te POPs prepared
by the Vice Presidents Office (VPO)
16. TANESCO should ensure that fences are repaired, security lights work ng again and all
danger signs replaced to alert people of the potential dangers as they approa h the fences

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
l            ES1:   Introduction   TANESCO is a public power utility in Tanzania re ponsible
for generation, transmission, distribution and sale of
electricity. Due to the nature of TANESCO's activiti s, there
*                                  are always impacts on or from the environme , which
need to be considered during operation and dev lopment
3                                  decision-making processes.
There has been growing concern both nation lly and
internationally for full incorporation of envir nmental
I                                  protection in decision-making processes for Economic
activities. The approved National Environment il policy
(NEP) and passed of the Environmental Managen ent Act,
2005 (It is unified environmental legislation to eal with
the environmental issues). This Act is expected to become
effective any time in 2005. All these require every
developer to achieve sustainable . developm nt that
maximises the long-term welfare of both the pre ent and
*                                  future generations of Tanzanian population.
In order to comply with relevant legal and rE gulatory
requirements, TANESCO is in process of establi hing its
own Environment Management System (EMS). he EMS
will ensure that environment is given ap ropriate
consideration in all company development activi ties and
3                                  decision-making processes.

l              1.0 INTRODUCTION
1.1 GENERAL
The worldwide evolutions of stringent environmental regulations and pub ic awareness
have forced many organisations to integrate environmental managem nt into their
I              development activities and decision-making processes. Companies ha e introduced
environmental management policies, which encourage preventive measu es in order to
minimise corrective environmental costs, loss of public image and penal ies.
Achieving sound environmental performance requires organisational con mitment to a
systematic approach of addressing environmental obligations through Environmental
I              Management system (EMS). Environmental Management System (EMS) 1 i defined as a
system which includes organisational structure, planning of activities, re ponsibilities,
practices, procedures, processes and resources allocation for developing, i plementing,
achieving, reviewing and maintaining the environmental policy.
An environmental management system form a framework within which to organise and
l l             plan activities required to achieve environmental goals and objectives of he company.
It comprises guiding principles, policies, and directives, operational g idelines and
procedures that provide a structured format by which operations can be riaintained. It
I              is internationally accepted as a common sense approach to ensure that rganisational
environmental liabilities (and risks) are properly identified, minimised an managed.
l              TANESCO is a public utility, the only main company so far in Tanzania r sponsible for
generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity. The comp ny owns and
operates power systems comprising of both hydro and thermal power stations and
I              associated structures such as transmission & distribution lines, substat ons etc. The
power system network is distributed throughout the country and continue to expand to
meet ever-growing power demand. In the future, because of technological
advancement and increase in demand, TANESCO may resort to other sour ces of energy
such as coal, wind, solar etc.
I              Due to the nature of its operation and development activities, there are in pacts on and
from the environment, which have to be taken into account at all stages o such works.
Apart from generation, transmission and distribution, TANESCO i teracts with
environment through non-core services such as transportation of eq ipment and
materials, fumes, disposing of old equipment and papers etc. In doing its development
I                'ISO 14004: Environmental Managemcnt Systems-general guidelines on principles, systcms an supporting techniques



i



and operational obligations, TANESCO may therefore cause environmen al impacts to
air, water, land, natural resources, flora, fauna, humans and ecosystem. A nex I, shows
the linkage between TANESCO activities and environmental impacts.
TANESCO, like any other developer is obliged to adhere to the principles f sustainable
development by ensuring that environmental issues are not outweighed by economic
pressures. For that matter TANESCO has been spending substantial reso rces on EIAs
and monitoring of the projects impacts on or from the environment.
There are several set backs to the present TANESCO approach of a dressing the
environmental issues. Currently TANESCO has no established system fo dealing with
environmental matters within the company. Furthermore, the compan has neither
environmental policy nor environmental objectives. More usually, environmental
considerations are integrated in donor-funded projects, mainly in the lanning and
I              construction phase. Unless there is a direct environmental problem hin ering power
generation or there is a donor support, TANESCO does not bother mu h about post
I              construction phase environmental problems.
As a remedy to the above set backs, TANESCO is in process of es ablishing an
Environmental Management System (EMS). The EMS will form a frame ork through
U              which all environment matters will be fairly addressed and integrated i all company
business, services and products.
l              In the Southern Africa Power Pool (SAPP), of which TANESCO is a nember, the
Environmental subcommittee (ESC) has been formed to advise the rnanagement
committee on environmental issues, keep abreast of regional and world i sues related
l1 *to environmental quality and also liase with their respective governmen s on matters
pertaining to environment. Some utilities in the region such as ESKOM o South Africa
and ZESCO of Zambia already have their own Environmental Managem nt System to
I              take care of the environmental matters and are in good position to cope well with the
new developments. The Environmental subcommittee (ESC) of the Sou hern African
Power Pool (SAPP) has conducted environmental workshops with the aim f improving
I              environmental awareness among the regional power utilities. TANESCC as an active
member in the Southern African Power Pool (SAPP) has to keep pace with other
l              regional utilities by developing and implementing EMS.
l1.2 PREVIOUS WORK
TANESCO recognised the importance of integrating of environmental con iderations in
its activities in 1996 when it formally accepted a proposal for an ENV RONMENTAL
I              MANAGEMENT SYSTEM prepared by the consultants for the PFRP, IVO- ORPLAN. In
April 1996, TANESCO in collaboration with NEMC organised a workshop on
"ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS RELATED TO POWER PRODUCTION IN T NZANIA" at
*              Hale. At this workshop the then proposed TANESCO Environmental Management
System (EMS) was discussed and its implementation recommended.



I



TANESCO's Field Studies Unit by then now the Research and Developme t Department
l              in cooperation with IVO INTERNATIONAL of Finland prepared a de ailed project
document entitled: DEVELOPMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR
TANESCO in 1997 - 99, for soliciting of funds for implementation of EM . The project
I              never started, because 1996 was a bad financial year for TANESCO an FINNIDA did
not approve the requested fund.
I              Since then TANESCO tried to solicit funds from different donors and inter ally but up to
date no substantial amount of fund is provided. In 2001 during the Kiha si Spray Toad
saga the Lower Kihansi Environmental Project (LKEMP) financed by \Norld Bank set
I              aside US$ 65,000 to help TANESCO in the process of establishing its own EMS. So far a
study tour to ESKOM and ZESCO for 5 staff 1 from Kihansi Power Pla t and 4 from
Directorate of Corporate Planning and Research has been done, with ma n objective of
I              gaining a knowledge and experience on establishing and implementing an EMS in power
utilities.
l              This proposal therefore include foreign assistance, be it finance or t chnical. It is
proposed that financing is to be covered by the World Bank thro gh proposed
Transmission and Distribution Rehabilitation Project and the technica part will be
I              carried out by TANESCO staff in collaboration with local and foreign  nvironmental
consultants as far as necessary. SAPP member utilities that have EMS r lay be visited
*              and consulted for advice.
2.0 PROJECT PURPOSES AND OBJECTIVES

1              3.3   ASSUMPTIONS
For smooth execution of this work and achieving the intended results, the following
assumptions have been made:
.    The work will continue to enjoy full support from TANESCO top t anagement
*   *  Appointed and/or recruited staff will be capable and interested in :his important
I                    field
*    World Bank to finance the establishment of EMS
*     Research and Development Department under Environmental Unit to co-ordinate
and execute this work
4.0 WORK PLAN AND METHODOLOGY
4.1 GENERAL APPROACH
In recent years, several organisations have developed, or are developing guidelines for
EMS. These include the British Standards Institute, Canadian Standards Association,
European Community ('Euro-Audit'), the Canadian Chemical Produce s Association
*              (Responsible Care Program), the Canadian Petroleum Association (Envirc nmental Code
l X            of Practice) and the International Standards Association (ISO). Internatic nal Standards
Organisation (ISO) has developed a series of environmental manage ment system
standards, which have been adopted by more than 100 countries worldw de as national
standards and have proved to be successful.
In establishing and implementing TANESCO EMS, recommendation contai led in the ISO
14000 series will be followed, i.e. preparatory review, drafting cf policy and
-   implementing the policy. Phase I of this work will consist of all activities f r establishing
the EMS i.e. preparatory review, drafting of the policy and planning for fulfilling the
policy. Phase II will be an implementation phase in which all planned ac tivities will be
executed.
4.2 DRAFTING OF CORPORATE ENVIRONMENTAL POLCY
Because TANESCO does not have a formal environmental management sy stem, the first
I              step will be to establish the current position with regard to the environmental

I  .     .E           ,       ,~~~-   .       .                            I''U
management by means of a preparatory review. The preparatory revie will identify
the environmental aspects arising from the organisation's past, existing r planned ac-
tivities, products or services. It will also examine all existing environmental management
practices and procedures, legal requirements and previous incidents and non-
compliance. The review will establish the main impacts due to TANESCO activities and
I              the current means of dealing with them. This will form a base for i entifying the
priorities to be addressed in the environmental policy. Few field trips o generating
stations, transmission and distribution lines, on going projects etc. wil be made to
I              confirm results of the review and to collect additional reports and inforn ation.
This work will involve drafting of an appropriate corporate environmenta policy that is
l              current and consistent with overall corporate priorities, managemen philosophy,
practices and environmental legal requirements and obligations. It will in olve utilising
results from the preparatory review and current guiding principle for impl mentation of
I              EMS. Since formulation of the corporate policy is the heart of the whole exercise, the
three months time will be allocated to the management to read and con ment on the
draft environmental policy. The final policy statement and management commitment
1              statement are expected to be ready in three months time after receivi g comments
from management.
l              Environmental Unit will do the preparatory review of drafting of corporate nvironmental
policy in collaboration with local or foreign consultant. Consultatio  with other
stakeholder's i.e. government environmental bodies, NGO's, affected pe ples on some
issues might be necessary.
1 l            4.3 PLANNING FOR FULFILLING THE COMPANY POLICY
For fulfilling the environmental policy, appropriate corporate environmen al objectives
I              and targets will be established and environmental programs (environr ental quality
control, monitoring and auditing etc.) documents prepared. The ways f integrating
environment management into the company structure will be cha ed out and
I              responsibility clearly defined. Approval of the management is required a this stage to
make sure that the proposal is acceptable and is not in any way conflic ing company
l              structure expansion plan.
Parallel to preparation of the environmental programmes, training nee s programs;
schedules and budget will be established. It is expected that the traini g will target
I              three groups; the management, Research and Development (Environme tal Unit) and
general staff, each category receiving training according to the role each roup plays in
l              the implementation of EMS.
Another important task to be accomplished in this phase is prepa ation of the
environmental management system documentation, communication and r cords control
systems. A two-way interactive information flow and reporting system, Which involve



I

i



It~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
input from each and every staff at his working station meanwhile allowini 1 appropriate
data collection and analysis, interpretation and decision-making, will be c attered out.
For smooth implementation of the EMS, the training of management and key research
and development staff in environmental management will start in thi phase and
I              extended through the implementation phase is important. Details on the training
requirements are presented in section 5.
I              A final draft EMS report will be submitted to the management for approval at the end of
this phase. The draft report shall contain the corporate environmental polic y, objectives,
targets, budget and schedule for implementation.
Planning and drafting of the environmental programmes will require inputs from
different experts. It is therefore expected that in this phase external exp rtise, mainly
I              from UDSM, NEMC, DoE and appropriate NGOs will be required. The progr ammes need
to be discussed in the workshops and comments incorporated prior to th eir adoption.
4,4 IMPLEMENTA TION OF EMS
l              The implementation of the EMS will consist of all activities that will facilita e integration
of environmental policies and programmes into TANESCO strategic plans, ractices and
activities. The objective of this phase will be to align TANESCO structure employees,
I              systems, strategies and resources allocation towards achievement of company
environmental objectives. The main activities to be carried out under this phase are:
. Training, educating and motivating employees to conduct their a tivities in an
environmentally friendly manner and aiming at achieving company e rvironmental
objectives, goals and targets. This will involve conducting ei vironmental
I                    meetings and seminars for disseminating education and awareness to TANESCO
personnel in the head office and in the operation regions and distri cts, all hydro
3                    and thermal systems and transmission line teams around the cour try.
. Follow up of allocation of appropriate human, material (facilities ani i equipment)
and financial resources essential to the implementation of company
environmental policy and achievement of objectives.
l  Follow up of integration of EMS into existing overall managemen system and
practices, e.g. harmonising policies, influencing resources allocatior 1, operational
controls and documentation, information system, training and development,
appraisal system, quality control, measuring and monitoring and co munication
J                    and reporting. Assisting to balance and solve conflict between e ivironmental
management and other business objectives and priorities.

* Follow up of effectiveness of environmental accountability along responsibility
lines, organisation structure, work processes and assignment of r sponsibilities
to employees.
* To establish a process for communicating and reporting of nvironmental
I                    activities of the company in order to raise awareness to employees, ommunicate
compliance and demonstrate management commitment to environ nent. For this
purposes the  following  publications will be  prepared,  rganisation's
environmental profile, environmental policy objectives and targets and
environmental performance evaluation.
5.0 PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
1              5.1 GIENERAL
*  .    TA     TANESCO'S Research and Development under Environmental Unit will c -ordinate all
activities for development and implementation of EMS. Services of local and foreign
consulting firms and competent institutions and bodies such as Univer ity of Dar Es
Salaam (UDSM), DoE, NEMC, NGO's and individuals will be utilised to pro ide expertise
not available in TANESCO and where outside opinions on specific issues re required.
It is anticipated that Services of local and foreign firms, NGOs, Division of Environment
I              (DoE) and National Environmental Management Council (NEMC)) and indiv duals outside
TANESCO will be fully utilised in conducting meetings, seminars a d education
campaign to TANESCO employees. This approach has many advantages; he main ones
being strengthening of local capacity, demonstrating due diligence and xposing the
TANESCO EMS early to criticism.
l              The whole project period is 5 years; the first 2 years will be utilised for dra ting the EMS
whereas the last 3 yrs will be for initiating of its implementation. The d aft final EMS
will be concluded by a review report explaining the achievements, setba ks, and what
*              need to be done to improve the EMS. The action plan and time-activity chedule are
presented in Annex II and III, respectively.
5.2 ORGANISA frONAND ADMINISTRA TiON
I              The department of Research and Development, which, is under Directorat of Corporate
Planning and Research (DCPR) with the help of Environmental sectio  will do the
execution of this work. The department is headed by a Manager and Chief engineer and
*-             it has another five informal sections; hydrology, survey, engineering geology and
geotechnics and hydropower engineering The main tasks of Research and evelopment
department, with others is dealing with environmental issues related to t e company's
activities and to undertake and performing 'pre-feasibility and feasibilil studies for

I              capability in terms of human resources, experience, skills, equipment a d materials.
The organisation chart of Research and Development department is shown as Annex I.
i |            A department of Research and development has resourceful personnel wit knowledge,
expertise and experience for execution of the work, but some addition I training is
required to strengthen their capability. The experts have had close coo eration with
foreign and local consultants.
Currently department of Research and Development with the help of envirc nmental unit
I              is, on behalf of TANESCO, coordinating and carrying out the auditing o existing 18
substations to be rehabilitated and upgraded. Also it carries studies of e vironmental
and social impact assessment of transmission and distribution rehabilitatic n project for
I              Dar es Salaam, Moshi and Arusha to be financed by World Bank. It is Ilso working
closely with Lower Kihansi Environmental Management project (in coo eration with
NEMC). Further it does environmental planning and monitoring pro rammes for
transmission and distribution system.
5.3 TRAINING
I              Essential to the functioning of the EMS is the staff awareness of environme tal issues to
enable them to carry out their daily activities appropriately. It is therefore mportant to
conduct relevant training to various groups depending on the role each g oup plays in
the implementation of EMS.
As stipulated in the previous proposals, an environmental awarenE ss seminar,
I              workshops and training to the management and the trainers is a prereq isite for the
successful implementation of the EMS in TANESCO.   Short-term  nvironment
management courses abroad are recommended for the TANESCO manac ement team
*              and environmental unit experts for raising awareness. It is anticipated hat courses
conducted by IHE Delft, Holland, IMAC and ACP Institutes Manzini Swazil nd, ESAMI,
ITC Holland, ICH of Norway are of meaningful and affordable. TANESCO s ould ensure
that executing staff, management and even operational staff attend thes courses.
Trainers and facilitators need to be equipped with appropriate skills an knowledge
either in Tanzania or abroad. The best option would be to have a trip in the region such
as South Africa and Zambia or other SAPP countries to learn from their ex erience. For
staff who are expected to be permanently engaged in environmental issue s, long term
courses abroad are recommended.
5.4 EQUIPMEHTAND MA TERIALS
Through TANESCO's major projects namely; PFRP, Kihansi and Power VI, Research and
Development department has acquired equipment for field studies and offic works. The

available equipment are enough for carrying out site investigatior s for dams,
transmission lines, substations and shallow foundations. Also water qualit analyses kits
I              have been acquired. But due to the age and new technology some of th equipments
like Decibel Meter, Air quality equipment, PCBs test kits, GPS, Digital camera and
l              Equipments to measure radiation from electromagnetic waves have to b bought.
Recently there is growing laboratory testing capacity in the country. Te ting facilities
available at UDSM, Maji, materials Ujenzi, EAMRDC and elsewhere wil be used for
testing the samples.

Objectives of the Environmental Audit
The objectives of this environmental audit are:
o To identify present environmental impacts and other environme tal inadequacies
on existing facilities. These include pollution, inadequatE environmental
management practices, and occupational health and safety issu s in the facilities
to be rehabilitated
o To determine areas that need remedial actions and their potential costs
l                necessary to bring these facilities into compliance with World Bank Safeguard
Policies, and
o To recommend actions to improve and strengthen TANESCO' environmental,
health and safety management
Guiding Principles
I          A consultant will carry out a comprehensive Environmental Audit (E ) in accordance
with and be fully responsive to IDA's "safeguard" operational policies nd according to
the existing laws and guidelines of the land (Tanzania). The audit report shall be
subject to review by a Multi Sectoral Technical Review Committee te m (TRC) under
the supervision of the Nationai Environment Management Council (NEMC). Upon
acceptance by the TRC the audit document will be submitted to IDA i support of the
proposed project.
3          Scope of Work
