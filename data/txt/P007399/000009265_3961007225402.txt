MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF HONDURAS
FOR A BASIC EDUCATION PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed development credit to the Republic of Honduras (GOH) for SDR 20.4 million
(US$30.0 million equivalent) to help finance a Basic Education Project. The credit would be
repayable on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years, including a 10 year grace period.
The project would also be assisted by the Government of Germany, through parallel financing
in the amount of DM 20.0 million (US$13.3 million equivalent) from the German Credit
Institute for Reconstruction (KfW).  The Ministry of Education (MOE) would be the
implementing agency for the project.
2.    Background. Although Honduras experienced some economic progress over the last two
decades, per capita GNP in 1994 remains low at an estimated US$580. One-third of the
population of 5.5 million lives in extreme poverty and 80 percent of the poor live in rural areas.
The promising economic trends of 1991-92 were not sustained in 1993. As the elections
approached, the fiscal deficit, which was targeted to fall to 3.8 percent of GDP in 1993, reached
over 10 percent. A new Administration took office in January 1994, inheriting serious fiscal
and balance of payments problems. Inflationary pressure began to build up in 1993, and foreign
exchange reserves have now been depleted. The present Administration is committed to the
resumption of sustainable economic growth, through the implementation of a medium-term
program that aims to reduce the fiscal deficit, reform the public sector to ensure more efficient
use of public resources, and raise significantly the level of human capital accumulation through
improved quality and equity in the provision of basic education and health services.
3.    Education indicators reflect the country's widespread poverty. In 1992, the illiteracy rate
for the adult population was still at 32 percent, and 42 percent in rural areas. For the population
as a whole, the average educational attainment is estimated at about 3.5 years of schooling.
Although the coverage of primary education expanded rapidly in recent decades, affording
approximately 80 percent of children aged 7-12 attendance in primary school (net enrollment
rate) in 1992, the level of academic achievements of students is low, reflecting the poor quality
of the services provided. Grade repetition rates in primary schools are high at 28 percent on
average and 46 percent in the first grade in 1988. These rates have not changed considerably
in recent years. Only 36 percent of students entering the first grade in 1988 were likely to
complete the sixth grade in 1994, and it took on average 10 years to graduate from primary
school. Approximately half of total primary classes are multigrade, but multigrade classrooms
are poorly managed because teachers do not have the appropriate training, teaching materials are
unsuitable, and physical facilities are inadequate. Standard textbooks on four subjects (Spanish,
mathematics, sciences and social studies) became available for primary students since 1987 with
financing from USAID, but they require substantial content revisions. Reprinting and improved
distribution is urgently needed, since some textbooks have already exceeded their five years of
usable life. For the poorest rural and indigenous children, access to schooling is still limited and
learning conditions are especially deficient due to overcrowding, insufficient teaching staff,
shortage of didactic materials, and dilapidated school building which often lack safe water and



2
sanitary facilities. The Honduran Social Investment Fund (Fondo Hondureflo de Inversi6n Social
- FHIS), supported by IDA Credits 2212-HO of 1992 and 2401-HO of 1993, has contributed to
improve education infrastructure by rehabilitating approximately one-third of all public primary
schools during the 1990-94 period, but considerable needs remain.
4.    Public expenditures on education in Honduras are relatively high at an estimated 4
percent of GDP in 1993, up from 3.3 percent in 1979, exceeding that of most Central American
countries. But sector resources are not used efficiently and are unequally distributed, favoring
the richer urban areas at the expense of rural areas where most of the poor live. The share of
primary and secondary education over total sector expenditures declined by 6 percent during the
1980-92 period, while administrative expenditures grew by 8 percent, and higher and technical
education expenditures rose by 3 percent. Since 1980, the MOE salary bill grew faster than the
total sector budget, and so did transfers to higher education. In 1993, salaries represented 65.6
percent of the education sector budget and non-salary expenditures per student were extremely
low--less than 2 percent is invested in teacher training, education materials, classroom aids and
school buildings. These trends, combined with a rapid expansion of enrollment during the
1980s, have resulted in a 20 percent reduction of the MOE non-salary expenditures per student
for preschool and primary education over the last 13 years. On account of the high grade
repetition rates and low completion rates, for each student that graduates from primary school,
the system must finance 10 student years instead of 6. Although substantial savings would
accrue, in the long run, from more efficient student flows through primary grades, the education
sector budget would have to increase on the short term, to finance substantial improvements in
the equity and quality of basic education which are preconditions to higher internal efficiency.
To ensure more efficient use of resources and a sustainable financial basis for the sector,
administrative restructuring and institutional strengthening would be necessary, because the MOE
has limited institutional capacity to undertake the required education reforms, due to a
dysfunctional organizational structure and obsolete management practices.
5.    Government Strategy. In October 1994, the Government stated its commitment to
providing quality basic education for all as the first priority for the country's development and
for the creation of a more just and democratic society. Through the publication of the "Escuela
Morazdnica," the GOH called for a profound transformation in the content and management of
basic public education, with emphasis on improving the quality and efficiency with which the
MOE delivers education services, and on promoting more active community involvement. To
achieve these objectives, the GOH is committed to increasing public resources for basic
education to carry out specific measures aimed at improving students' academic achievements.
These measures include: (i) increasing the relevance of the school curriculum by revising
existing textbooks; (ii) enforcing compliance with the school calendar; (iii) enhancing teachers'
skills and enforcing technical criteria when hiring new teachers; (iv) introducing performance
incentives for teachers, with community participation; (v) introducing flexible grade promotion
based on academic modules; (vi) providing complementary educational materials and classroom
libraries, particularly in the poorest areas; (vii) strengthening supervision at the school level;
(viii) providing bilingual instruction in indigenous areas; (ix) expanding classrooms and teaching
staff in the poorest rural areas where schools are currently overcrowded; (x) establishing a
system of independent evaluation of student achievements; and (xi) expanding coverage of
preschool education in poor rural communities. These measures are expected to raise the overall



3
level of schooling in society, retain more students in the school system, raise their academic
achievement, and improve student flows from first grade to primary school graduation.
6.    To increase the public sector's capacity to deliver education services efficiently, the MOE
will be restructured to eliminate redundant units and functions, and decentralized services will
be strengthened to better support the operation of the schools. Personnel policies will be revised
to provide incentives for improving the performance and accountability of teachers and for
reducing the number and enhancing the skills of the administrative staff. Planning, budgeting
and financial management functions will be strengthened through enhanced management
information systems, streamlined procedures, and improved office technology. Basic to the
restructuring plan is the transfer to departmental offices of key operational functions associated
with management of teachers, didactic materials and technical supervision of schools, redefining
the role of the central administration as basically normative. The proposed restructuring of the
MOE is part of a broader public sector management reform aimed at reducing the size of the
state and improving its efficiency, which will be supported by a proposed IDA operation
currently under preparation. To make national education more democratic and relevant to social
development, the GOH is committed to promote community involvement in various aspects of
school life, drawing on the commitment of teachers, parents, students, education authorities, and
community members and leaders. Municipal governments will be directly involved in school
management, by assuming responsibility for school maintenance and distribution of textbooks
within their jurisdiction. Parents would play a key role in monitoring teacher attendance and
will be informed on a regular basis of their children's academic progress and of the importance
of their continued school attendance.
7.    Project Objectives. The objectives of the proposed project are to improve the quality
of learning and student performance, inspire better teaching, increase school attendance, and
create more effective learning conditions, thereby reducing student dropout and repetition rates,
and raising student's academic achievements at the primary level. The project also aims at
strengthening the MOE's institutional capacity to deliver basic education services at higher levels
of efficiency and fiscal accountability, leading to reduction in administrative costs.
8.    Project Description. The project has been organized into two major components: (a)
improving the quality of basic education; and (b) institutional strengthening.
(a) Improving the Quality of Basic Education (US$38.2 million or 72 percent of total
project costs including contingencies) to provide for: (i) training and assistance to upgrade the
skills of preprimary and primary teachers, principals and supervisors, and to improve pre-service
teacher training and accreditation; (ii) educational materials including textbooks, didactic
materials, classroom libraries, and improved distribution facilities; (iii) bilingual education in
indigenous areas for the GarYfiuna and the Miskito communities; (iv) external evaluation of
students' academic achievements; and (v) infrastructure improvements for overcrowded rural
schools, including additional teachers and access to community-run preschool education in poor
rural areas.
(b) Institutional Strengthening (US$14.9 million or 28 percent of total project costs
including contingencies) to provide for:  (i) technical assistance for the restructuring and



4
decentralization of the MOE, and improved technical supervision; (ii) a pilot Teachers'
Performance Improvement Program; and (iii) project administration, monitoring and evaluation.
9.    Project Costs and Financing.  Total project cost, including physical and price
contingencies, and local taxes, is estimated at about US$53.1 million equivalent, of which an
estimated US$24.7 million (46 percent) is in foreign exchange. The proposed IDA credit of
US$30.0 million equivalent would finance 62 percent of total project costs net of taxes and
duties, including 64 percent of foreign exchange expenditures and 50 percent of local
expenditures. The amount of local cost financing by IDA is in line with other IDA credits for
Honduras due to its difficult fiscal situation, and the relatively low foreign exchange costs of
education projects. The KfW concessional loan of US$13.3 million equivalent would finance
27 percent of total project costs net of taxes and duties. The Government of Honduras would
finance US$9.8 million equivalent, or 18 percent of total project costs, including taxes and duties
estimated at US$4.6 million equivalent. A breakdown of estimated costs and financing are
shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement and the
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events
and the status of Bank Group operations in Honduras are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 13891-HO, dated March 7, 1995, is also attached.
10.   Project Implementation. The proposed project will be implemented over a five year
period. The MOE will be the principal implementing agency, but the FHIS, the Municipalities,
the National Pedagogic University (UPNFM), and local communities will also have a major
implementation role. FHIS will carry out classroom construction and school rehabilitation as
well as construction and remodelling of departmental offices under norms provided by MOE.
The Municipalities will gradually take over primary school maintenance, starting with the
schools expanded under the project, and will be responsible for ensuring the timely distribution
of education materials to the schools in their jurisdiction. The UPNFM has created a technical
unit for measuring students' academic achievements which will be contracted by MOE to prepare
and apply student achievement tests yearly, as part of the external evaluation subcomponent of
the project. Preschool programs will be run by local communities, and parents will be directly
involved in the pilot Teachers' Performance Improvement Program. MOE has established a
clear strategy for administrative restructuring and decentralization which received the approval
of the Presidential Commission for the Modernization of the State, the coordination agency for
the GOH's public sector management reform. Implementation of the institutional reforms would
be phased, in order to allow for adjustments to the normative framework, preparation of
operations manuals, staff training, and installation of improved information systems. Project
implementation will be coordinated by a Project Coordination Unit (PCU). The PCU has
already been created under the Vice-Minister for Technical Affairs of the MOE, and the
proposed project director and key technical staff have been named.
11.   The project would be implemented nationwide, covering all public primary schools.
However, specific interventions would be targeted to poor rural communities that are presently
underserved (para. 22). The targeted activities comprise (i) expansion of community-run
preschool programs, (ii) improved access to primary education through additional classrooms
and teachers, (iii) bilingual education at schools serving the Miskito and Gar(funa indigenous
communities, and (iv) provision of classroom libraries and complementary educational materials.
To facilitate reaching all public primary and preprimary teachers throughout the school year, in-



5
service teacher training will be highly decentralized, using an existing network of 1,500 teacher
training centers (Centros de Aprendizaje Docente - CADs) that function on weekends in primary
schools throughout the country.
12.   Project Sustainability. With a conservative target of reducing the repetition and dropout
rates by 10 percent over a period of five years, the financial impact of incremental recurrent
project costs and of the increased number of students due to efficiency gains and population
growth, will require annual increments of the current primary education budget between 0.6
percent and 6.3 percent during the project implementation years. This will be covered by the
projected education sector budget increases of about 4 percent a year, in line with projected GDP
growth. In the year 2000, after project completion, the incremental recurrent costs generated
by the project are estimated at US$6.3 million per year, or the equivalent of 3.4 percent of the
projected education sector budget. This level of budget growth is within the possibilities of the
country, and will be more than offset by the savings accruing from lower administrative costs
resulting from restructuring of the MOE and from increased efficiency of student flows in
primary school.
13.   Lessons from Previous Bank Involvement. Recent Bank Group experience in Honduras
shows that project start-up is slowed by unfamiliarity with Bank legal, procurement, and
disbursement procedures, and that Borrower's ownership of the project is important to
implementation success. The experience of the Rural Primary Education Management Project
(Ln. 2804-HO, 1987) shows that when a project implementation unit is created separately from
the existing organizational units, existing units often miss the opportunity to acquire technical
expertise during the process of project implementation and to strengthen their institutional
capacity. To avoid this problem, the PCU for proposed project has been established as part of
the MOE, with staff drawn from the operational units who prepared the project. To strengthen
project management, building upon lessons learned from the FHIS-I and FHIS-II projects (Cr.
2212-HO, 1991 and 2401-HO, 1992), the proposed project will adopt a Project Operational
Manual containing explicit guidelines for financial management, procurement and staffing. The
FHIS experience also shows that when school maintenance is not ensured at the local level,
schools tend to fall in disrepair. This finding is reflected in the design of the proposed project
which provides for the gradual transfer of school maintenance from the MOE to the
Municipalities. The experience with implementation of the Nutrition and Health project (Cr.
2452-HO, 1993), which supports the GOH's Family Assistance Program (PRAF), shows that
coordination problems tend to delay project implementation when several executing agencies are
involved. The proposed project will not need complex coordination mechanisms since all
participating entities will work under contract with MOE. In order to avoid start-up delays
associated with lack of familiarity with Bank procedures, the proposed project will hold a project
launch seminar upon credit effectiveness, to orient and train Borrower personnel.
14.   Feedback from several education projects in Latin America indicates that a proper policy
framework and adequate institutional capacity are major factors in determining the success of
project implementation. The proposed project focuses on improving the quality and efficiency
of primary education on the basis of: (a) a clearly stated government policy framework; and (b)
improvement of the institutional capacity of the MOE at the central and departmental levels.
Other specific lessons learned from basic education projects in Latin America which have been
incorporated in the design of the proposed project include: (i) the need increase education



6
expenditures and other compensatory efforts, targeted to the poorest regions, to promote higher
student achievement; (ii) community participation in school management and maintenance to
encourage better teacher and administrator performance; (iii) effectiveness of financial incentives
to improve teachers' performance; (iv) positive impact of classroom libraries to complement
teachers' strategies and stimulate students' interests and reading habits; (v) importance of
learning materials complementing textbooks to stimulate more active learning in schools; (vi)
high returns from bilingual education in primary grades; (vii) environmental education, promoted
in the early years of a child's life, to form a positive attitude towards natural resources and
public facilities; and (viii) appropriately designed school furniture to stimulate cooperative
classroom work when students sit in small circles around collective tables, instead of rigid
benches with attached writing surfaces. All these elements have been taken into account in the
design of the proposed project.
15.   Rationale for I]DA Involvement. The proposed Basic Education Project is consistent
with IDA's most recent Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Honduras which was discussed
at the Board on occasion of the presentation of the Agricultural Sector Adjustment Credit on
August 5, 1993. The strategy focuses on reducing the public sector deficit, alleviating poverty,
investing in human capital, and strengthening institutional capacity as key instruments to promote
sustainable economic growth. Low productivity of the labor force is one of the fundamental
causes of poverty and it is partly the result of low access among the poor to basic education and
health services. IDA's involvement in the proposed project complements the GOH's targeted
social safety net programs of nutrition assistance and small scale social infrastructure through
PRAF and FHIS, supported by IDA credits 2401-HO and 2452-HO, respectively. By supporting
the proposed Basic Education Project, IDA assistance will play a catalytic role in: (a) increasing
investments in primary education, thus helping to accumulate human capital, the lack of which
is a serious constraint to growth; (b) addressing the needs of the poor and contributing to a more
equitable distribution of educational and economic opportunities; and (c) improving the efficiency
of scarce public sector resources. IDA assistance for the proposed project will also help
mobilize support from other donors for the improvement of basic education, as the Government
of Germany would allocate DM 20 million in parallel financing through the KfW and
approximately DM 1 million in technical assistance through the German Agency for Technical
Cooperation (Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Technische Zusammenarbeit - GTZ).
16.   Agreed Actions. The Borrower has submitted (a) guidelines for the restructuring of the
MOE, satisfactory to IDA and evidence that a technical group has been established at MOE to
design and implement the restructuring plan; (b) an action plan for the improvement of teacher-
training schools; (e) a draft Agreement between MOE and FHIS for the implementation of civil
works contemplated in the project; and (d) evidence of access to land for the construction of 13
departmental offices, thus complying with the agreed upon conditions for negotiation.
17.   During negotiations, agreement was reached on: (a) a detailed teacher training plan for
the first project year and assurances that training plans for subsequent years will be presented
as part of the annual Project Implementation Plans; (b) a model Municipal Educational Materials
Distribution Agreement to be entered into by MOE and the Municipalities; (c) a draft Agreement
to be entered into by MOE and UPNFM for the measurement and reporting of primary students
academic achievements; (d) terms of reference for the execution of a school census and
assurances that the results of such census will be presented to IDA not later than six months after



7
Credit effectiveness; (e) a model Municipal Maintenance Agreement for the maintenance of
primary schools expanded under the project, and assurances that continuous maintenance will
be provided; (f) Project Implementation Plans which shall specify, inter alia, the annual program
for construction, rehabilitation and equipping of classrooms, allocation of teaching staff to
expanded primary schools, and provision of counterpart funds; (g) presentation to IDA by MOE,
not later than July 31, 1996 of evidence that MOE has established a system, satisfactory to IDA,
to administer employment and salaries; (h) Project Monitoring and Impact Evaluation Indicators;
and (i) the carrying out by MOE of Annual Project Reviews, in July of each year and a Project
Midterm Review, with IDA, not later than July 31, 1997.
18.   Conditions of Effectiveness. As conditions of credit effectiveness, the Borrower will
present evidence that: (a) an agreement between MOE and FHIS for construction and
rehabilitation of schools and other facilities has been entered into by the parties thereto; (b) the
MOE has adopted (i) the Project Operational Manual; (ii) the Project Implementation Plan for
the first year of the Project; and (iii) a program, satisfactory to IDA, to strengthen MOE's
management capabilities and information systems; (c) an agreement between MOE and UPNFM,
providing for the establishment of a unit for the external evaluation of students' academic
achievements, has been entered into by the parties thereto, and that such unit has been
established; and (d) the PCU has been established.
19.   Conditions of Disbursement. As conditions for disbursement of Credit proceeds (a) for
the purchase of goods allocated to Departmental Directorates of Education, the MOE will have
appointed the 18 officers who will manage such Departmental Directorates; and (b) for payment
of teachers' incentives, the MOE will present evidence that a Teachers' Performance
Improvement Program, satisfactory to IDA, has been initiated.
20.   Environmental Aspects. The proposed project is rated "C", because it would enhance
environmental conservation practices through the introduction of environmental themes in the
primary school curricula and teacher training program.
21.   Program  Objective and Poverty Category.  The project falls under the Program
Objective Category of poverty reduction and would support a program of targeted interventions
as part of the GOH's national policy of equitable access to education opportunities, by
channelling resources especially to rural and indigenous areas, thus contributing to poverty
reduction and development of human resources.  The Miskito and Garffuna indigenous
communities were selected as priority for the introduction of bilingual education based on the
fact that they represent 60 percent of the indigenous school age children in Honduras, as
indicated by anthropological research carried out during project preparation (Map IBRD
26279R). Single classroom multigrade rural schools, targeted for expansion, were chosen based
on the 1992 school map and enrollment figures for the 1992- 1994 period that show
overcrowding of more than 60 children per teacher and classroom and a steady enrollment
growth trend over the past three years. Classroom libraries and didactic materials other than
textbooks, will be targeted to primary schools with three or less teachers, therefore covering
practically all rural primary schools and most schools located in poor urban neighborhoods.
22.   Participatory Approach. Representatives of parents and teachers, as well as municipal
authorities and teacher unions, have been actively involved in discussing the main features of



8
project design with MOE. Municipalities have expressed enthusiasm to participate in the
distribution of textbooks and didactic materials. Municipalities are also supportive of assuming
responsibility for school maintenance, provided that schools are first rehabilitated by FHIS.
Eight indigenous ethnic groups have actively contributed to the design of the bilingual and
intercultural education program for primary schools over the last year, and have indicated their
commitment to help its implementation. Since 1990, rural communities have successfully run
a community-based preschool program with assistance from UNICEF which will be supported
and expanded under the project. To launch the pilot Teachers' Performance Improvement
Program, the MOE plans to carry out, in cooperation with Municipalities, a series of community
meetings and information campaigns to promote the participation of parents as well as teachers.
Throughout project implementation, the MOE intends to disseminate information on the
academic achievements of students to parents, teachers and the public at large, thus sustaining
over time the participatory approach used in project preparation.  Children's learning
achievement improvements and teacher incentives will encourage parents and teachers to
participate actively in the project.
23.   Project Benefits. By raising children's cognitive achievement as well as their probability
of completing the primary education cycle by a conservative 10 percent, the main project
benefits would consist of a higher rate of human capital accumulation, contributing to economic
development. Due to the project's emphasis on rural areas and bilingual education, project
benefits will also include more equitable distribution of economic opportunities among Honduran
children, especially for the poorest and the underserved indigenous populations, and the project
will contribute to the Government's goal of redressing inequity in primary education. The
project will improve efficiency of public resource use by reducing repetition and dropout rates
by about 10 percent, and by increasing the amount of investments with high social rates of
return. Approximately half of the children who will benefit from an improved quality of
educational services would be girls; their access to higher levels of education and better work
opportunities would thus improve. Further benefits can also be expected, as research has shown
that increasing the education levels of women has a significant positive effect on the health status
and on the educational attainment of children, and also contributes to lower fertility. The impact
may be particularly significant for indigenous girls. Teachers, supervisors and principals will
improve their productivity through systematic on-the-job training, and will contribute to the
quality and efficiency of the primary education system nationwide. Institutional strengthening
will contribute to a better allocation and increased productivity of human resources within the
MOE, a reduction of about 29 percent in administrative costs, and an enhanced capacity to carry
out, evaluate, and monitor educational policies and programs. Altogether, approximately one
million primary school children, and over 26,000 preprimary and primary teachers, school
directors and supervisors, and MOE managers will raise their human capital.
24.   Project Risks. Project implementation may be delayed if the strengthening of the MOE
institutional capacity takes longer to achieve than anticipated. To mitigate this risk, the project
would: (i) provide technical assistance in the areas of planning, management information
systems, and evaluation; (ii) utilize successful models and lessons learned under previous
projects; and (iii) implement sector reforms supported by the proposed Public Sector
Management Reform project. There is also a risk of inadequate provision of counterpart funds
due to high budget deficits. This risk would be minimized through savings accruing from the
MOE institutional reform and annual sector expenditure reviews.
