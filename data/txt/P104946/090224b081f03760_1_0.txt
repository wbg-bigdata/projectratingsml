                         which reflects the improvement in performance based indicators. The accumulative total number of deliveries to date reached 10,147 and a total of 12,423 women attended health
                         education sessions.
                         In comparison to previous years, the total enrollment in quarter 16 reached 1979 compared to 936 in Q13, 1051 in Q14 and 1449 in Q15. The activation of a third satellite clinic
                         played a significant role in increasing the number of enrolled women in the project which applies to the number of women who attended health education sessions as well.
