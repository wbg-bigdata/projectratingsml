                         Due to the impact of last year’s situation in Yemen, the Saudi Yemeni Health Care/Saudi German Hospital (SGH) decided to not to continue to receive grants under this project to
                         provide maternal care services. Al Mawarid/University Science and Technology Hospital (USTH) will be the sole service provider. Based on the project’s realistic projections, the end-
                         of-project target has been amended to provide quality maternal care to 15,000 eligible women in the targeted districts in Sana’a and the project's closing date of June 30, 2012 has
