                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The objectives of the project are to: (a) provide quality maternal care to about 30,000 eligible women in targeted districts in Sana'a and (b) design and implement
                         a model of maternal care which demonstrates how Yemeni public policy on maternal and child care can be effectively integrated with private health provision.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Mawarid Company for Education and Health Services and Saudi German Hospital (SGS)/Saudi Yemen Health Care Company (SYHC). To-date, USTH met the targeted number;
                         whereas SGH established only one SC. The seven SCs were verified and certified by the Independent Verification Expert (IVE).

                         Results of the Mid-term Review (MTR) and Project Restructuring: The unit cost per beneficiary was increased and a revised price list for maternal and neonatal health services was
                         established. With the new price list, the grant allocated for service provision (US$5,403,960 ) could only cover the subsidies for 30,000 beneficiaries. Consequently, the three Grant
                         Recipients requested that the first Project Development Objective (PDO)/end of project target be reduced from 40,000 beneficiaries to 30,000.
