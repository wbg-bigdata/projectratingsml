7a. Project Development Objectives/Outcomes
Original/Current Project Development Objectives/Outcomes

The objectives of the project are to: (a) provide quality maternal care to about 30,000 eligible women in
targeted districts in Sana'a and (b) design and implement a model of maternal care which demonstrates how
Yemeni public policy on maternal and child care can be effectively integrated with private health provision.



7b. Revised Project Development Objectives/Outcomes [if applicable]

The revised objectives of the Project are to: (i) provide quality maternal care to eligible women in the
targeted districts in Sana’a; and (ii) design and implement a model of maternal care which demonstrates
how Yemeni public policy on maternal and child care can be effectively integrated with private health
provision.

A.      Summary

1.       The changes proposed are: (i) extension of the project closing date; (ii) amendment of the revised
project development objective (PDO); (iii) reallocation of Grant proceeds; and (iv) cancellation of a
portion of the unused grant funds.

B.      Project Status

2.      Original and Revised PDOs: The Grant in the amount of US$6,232,100 became effective on
June 11, 2008. The original PDOs were to: (i) provide quality maternal care to about 40,000 eligible
women in the targeted districts in Sana’a; and (ii) design and implement a model of maternal care which
demonstrates how Yemeni public policy on maternal and child care can be effectively integrated with
private health provision. On March 22, 2011, the PDO was revised to read “(i) provide quality maternal
care to about 30,000 eligible women in the targeted districts in Sana’a; and (ii) design and implement a
model of maternal care which demonstrates how Yemeni public policy on maternal and child care can be
effectively integrated with private health provision.?

3.      The Grant Recipients: The recipients of the Global Partnership on Output-based Aid (GPOBA)
grant are: Saudi Yemeni Health Care Company (SYHC); Al-Mawarid Company for Educational and
Health Services; and SOUL for Development. SYHC and Al Mawarid provide maternal and neonatal
health services while SOUL (an NGO) is responsible for marketing the program and enrolling
beneficiaries.

4.      Suspension of Disbursement: The escalating unrest in the country which started in January 2011
resulted in delays in disbursements. When violence erupted in June/July 2011, the Bank officially
suspended disbursements to all Yemen projects on July 28, 2011.

5.      Enrollment Rates: As a result of disbursement suspensions for Yemen, the Project (which is
based on pre-financing by the Grant Recipients) began facing serious cash flow constraints and
enrollment into the program steadily declined (see Table 1). Suspension was lifted on January 20, 2012.
As of March 31, 2012, 9,378 beneficiaries were enrolled (this number was verified by the Independent
Verification Expert on April 30, 2012).

6.       Performance of the Grant Recipients: SOUL and Al Mawarid/USTH, two of the Grant
Recipients, have been performing satisfactorily whereas SYHC/SGH has consistently under-performed
throughout the life of the Project. Al Mawarid/USTH was able to establish the six satellite clinics as
originally designed by the program, compared to only one clinic established by SYHC/SGH. During the
last five quarters (January 2011 to March 2012), SOUL and Al Mawarid/USTH have shown increased
commitment to the program; this was indicated by the steady numbers of assisted deliveries even during
the crisis and suspension periods (see Table 2). These numbers are much higher compared to the
proportion of deliveries of 25% nationwide in 2003 (DHS).

                                                                                                                                  1

7.       Withdrawal of SYHC and Amendment of the End-of-Project Target: Due to the impact of
last year’s situation in Yemen, the SYHC/SGH will no longer continue to provide maternal care services.
Consequently, a revised specimen letter will be submitted to the Bank and signed only by Al Mawarid
and SOUL for Development. As Al Mawarid/USTH will be the sole service provider and based on the
project’s realistic projections, the end-of-project target will be amended to provide quality maternal care
to15,000 eligible women in the targeted districts in Sana’a.

8.      Audit Reports: The audit reports ending December 31, 2010 for the three Grant Recipients were
unqualified and there are no outstanding audit reports. The audit reports ending December 31, 2011 will
be submitted to the Bank on or before the due date of June 30, 2012.


C.           Proposed Changes

9.     Extension of the Project Closing Date: This is the first extension for the project. The closing
date would be extended from June 30, 2012 to February 28, 2014, in order for the Project to reach the
new end-of-project target of 15,000 beneficiaries (see Table 4: Enrollment Action Plans, July 2012 –
February 2014).

10.      Amendment of the PDO: The PDO would be revised to read “(i) provide quality maternal care
to eligible women in targeted districts in Sana’a; and (ii) design and implement a model of maternal care
which demonstrates how Yemeni public policy on maternal and child care can be effectively integrated
with private health provision.?

11.     Amendment of the End of Project Target: This would be amended to 15,000 beneficiaries
instead of 30,000 beneficiaries.

       The total numbers of deliveries and assisted deliveries under the Project are 7,900 and 5,273, respectively.
                                                                               4
12.     Reallocation of the Grant Proceeds and Cancellation of Unused Project Funds: The
reallocations needed to finance activities and service delivery subsidies during the extension period and
the cancellation of the Grant Amount as per Recipients’ request dated April 11, 2012, are indicated in
Table 3 below.
