LAND MANAGEMENT AND CONSERVATION PROJECT
(CREDIT 1897-LSO)
PREFACE
1.    This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Land Management and
Conservation Project (LMCP) in Lesotho, for which Credit 1897-LSO in the amount of US$
16.0 million was approved on May 26, 1988 and became effective on December 22, 1988.
2.    The Credit was closed on June 30, 1995; the original closing date had been December
31, 1997. The Government of Lesotho requested cancellation of US$ 4.27 million in SDR
equivalent on March 6, 1994, and a cancellation of the unutilized balance (then estimated as
US$ 2.3 million) on January 31, 1994. The final disbursement took place on February 13,
1995. Parallel financing in the early stages of project implementation was provided by the
Swedish International Development Association (SIDA).
3.    The ICR was prepared by Mr. Peter G. Moll, whose task manager was Mr. Raymond
Noronha of the Agriculture and Environment Division of the Southern African Department, and
was reviewed by Mr. Steven Jaffee, Acting Division Chief AFIAE, and by the acting Project
Adviser, Ms. Jacomina de Regt. The Borrower provided comments that are included as an
appendix to the ICR; SIDA did not provide any comments.
4.    Preparation of this ICR was begun in a mission by Mr. Peter G. Moll, March 14-24,
1995; the completion mission by Mr. Raymond Noronha having occurred previously, January
18-27, 1995. The ICR is based on material in the project file as well as on information
collected during the March 1995 mission to Lesotho. The borrower contributed to the
preparation of the ICR by contributing views reflected in the mission's aide-memoire. In
addition, an independent beneficiary assessment was carried out by staff from the National
University of Lesotho at Roma. Thus, this report incorporates the beneficiaries' point of view.

LAND MANAGEMENT AND CONSERVATION PROJECT
(CREDIT 1897-LSO)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.    The Land Management and Conservation Project (LMCP) was the first project in the
Southern Africa Department to aim to develop local skills in the planning and management
of the use of natural resources through a participatory approach. This summary, therefore,
seeks to meld the conclusions of three evaluations of project design, implementation and
impact - that of the Bank, the Government of Lesotho (GOL) and of the intended
beneficiaries. The goal is to present a "three-dimensional" perspective of the project, rather
than the customary assessments only of the Bank and GOL.
The Project
2.    LMCP was identified in October 1987, prepared in January/February 1988, and
appraised in April/May June 1988. It sought to implement GOL's thrust towards "democratic
decentralization" in the transfer of powers of planning and management to democratically
elected District and Village Development Councils (DDCs and VDCs) enacted in the
Development Councils Order, 1986. LMCP focused on one aspect, albeit the most
important, of the process, viz., land use planning and management. As originally appraised,
the project was to commence in two districts of Lesotho (Mokhotlong and Qacha's Nek) and,
over a project life of nine years, would be extended to seven of the ten districts of the
country. The process of implementation would involve preparation of 47 Resource
Management Plans (RMPs) directed to improved land management of both range and village
lands and which would foster the adoption of land conservation measures which the VDCs
would plan and implement. GOL, and the donors would merely assist in the process of
village identification of needs and implementation.
3.    Thus, the "building blocks" of the project were: (a) A process of decentralization in
which the VDCs would define priorities, prepare plans and implement them with the
assistance, primarily, of the Ministries of Agriculture (MOA) and Home Affairs (MOHA);
(b) institutional re-orientation of the normal government approach from "top down" and
"control" modes of action to "bottom up" and "service"; (c) a legislative framework,
through the amendment of the Development Councils Order and the Land Act to permit
greater village control of lands, and the ability to raise, retain and use revenues; and, (d)
donor assistance, in which IDA would provide finance for administration, training (both of



-111-
civil servants and the councils) and for RMPs and SIDA would provide continued technical
assistance to the Land Use Planning Division (LUPD) of MOA which would have the crucial
role of assisting in the preparation of land use plans (a pre-condition to the formulation of
RMPs).
4.   In November 1992, the DCA was amended to include a "drought recovery
component" in response to GOL's request for assistance to alleviate the effects of two years'
drought in Lesotho. Funds, amounting to US$4 million (approx.) which were deemed
surplus, were reallocated for (a) thefinancing of input supplies (mainly maize and fertilizer)
which were purchased by farmers with a 20 percent subsidy; and (b) the construction of
tubewells in rural areas which would provide longer-term assurance of water supplies. This
component was managed under FAO technical assistance.
Implementation Experience
5.   Implementation of the project, which became effective on December 22, 1988, was
fraught with problems almost from the onset. For the puiposes of this summary and greater
efficiency, the analysis divided into two major parts: (a) the "main" project-- all the
components other than drought recovery; and (b) the drought recovery component.
The Main Project
6.    The main features of implementation were:
(a)   Delays in start-up. Project implementation could in reality be said to have
commenced in July/August 1991 with the appointment of the second Project
Coordinator and an expatriate Facilitator/Trainer. Efforts, over a period of nearly two
years, to appoint a local facilitator were frustrated; the first Project Coordinator was
soon diverted from his duties as coordinator. However, a little over a year after her
appointment, the second Coordinator was elevated to the position of Deputy Principal
Secretary and thus could not devote adequate time to the duties of coordination.
(b)   Coordination between Ministries. Implementation of the project was
founded on coordination between the MOHA and MOA. While MOHA was the lead
ministry in the project, a major portion of implementation (assistance in the
formulation, preparation and implementation of RMPs) was the task of MOA. With
little movement on the ground, by the end of 1992 it became apparent that there were
major problems of communication and coordination between the two ministries.
Efforts to restructure project management in 1993 to provide for greater autonomy of
action, and budgets, for MOA were to no avail.
(c)   Preparation of Land Use Plans. LUPD, responsible for the initial
preparation of land use plans, a preconditon for RMPs was assisted by SIDA under
parallel financing. There was little coordination between SIDA plans and those of the
project. Further, SIDA gradually withdrew its assistance and LMCP was then
compelled to reallocate funds to support LUPD in 1992. This late infusion of funds,



-iv -
however, did not motivate LUPD to further preparation. Ultimately, only three RMPs
were prepared, of which two were only partially implemented.
(d)   Restructuring of the project. In November 1992, the project was
restructured to provide for a drought recovery component, and the numbers of RMPs
were scaled down to 25. In March 1993, MOA was requested to prepare a work
program which could be separately funded in view of the problems of coordination
with MOHA. This was not prepared. By September 1993, the Bank informed GOL
that if there was no progress in implementation, the disbursements would be
suspended, followed by cancellation. In October 1993, the project was further
reduced to eight RMPs and GOL requested cancellation of the SDR equivalent of
US$7 million. An "Action Plan" was prepared with the express understanding that if
the plan was not implemented IDA would be entitled to suspend disbursement.
However, in January 1994, when the Action Plan had not been complied with, it was
mutually agreed that the project should be terminated on December 31, 1994. It was
also agreed that a few important components that could be completed within a period
of six months (in the RMPs and the drought recovery component) should be allowed
to continue till the end of the year. GOL request immediate cancellation of a surplus
of the Credit, estimated at US$4.23 million, and the balance of the unused funds to be
canceled on termination. The date of cancellation was extended to January 31, 1995,
to permit completion of the drought recovery component. In sum, out of an
anticipated total cost of US$20.2 million, the actual cost was US$4.79 million, of
which US$4.0 million was borne by IDA.
(e)   Training. An essential element in the project was the training both of
members of the VDCs and officials. The former, to facilitate understanding of their
rights and duties in management of village resources under the legislation; the latter,
in understanding their altered roles as facilitators of local development. The Lesotho
Distance Training Center (LDTC) was entrusted with VDC training. Unfortunately,
the results of this training were not easily visible since there was a turnover of VDC
members (the result of two elections) and more continuous training was not provided
under the project. Apart from an initial workshop, ministry officials both at
headquarters and district level, did not receive further training. The expatriate
Facilitator/Trainer failed to provide any formal training to the District Planning
Officers who were sent, in the last years of the project, for training abroad. The
benefits of this training therefore, were not received by the project.
(f)   Legislation. The enabling legislation amending the Land Act and the Grazing
Regulations was enacted only in 1992; while the Development Councils Regulations,
specifying the manner in, and purposes for which councils could raise revenues were
promulgated only in May 1993.
(g)   Accounts. The first project accountant was well-qualified but failed to
maintain accounts in a proper manner. In consequence, applications for
replenishment of the Special Account were not regularly made. When he left, at the
end of 1992, his replacement was ill-qualified. She was also left with a backlog of



- v -
claims for reimbursement which had not been made and her lack of qualifications
only served to exacerbate the chaotic state of the accounts. Several training sessions,
both by staff from the Bank's Disbursement Division and Bank procurement staff
failed to make an appreciable change. In the result, GOL lost a considerable sum
through failure to make regular applications for reimbursement.
(h)   Political stability. Throughout the period of implementation Lesotho went
through periods of political instability due to events both endogenous and exogenoe s
(in particular the momentous changes occurring in the Republic of South Africa).
This instability affected project implementation through changes in governmental
structures and the ability to take consistent decisions regarding the role of chiefs and
the powers of the Development Councils, as well as amendments to land legislation.
In the last years of the project, the resurgence of democracy brought to the local level
a new factionalism based on political affiliation. Any assessment of project
implementation must take into account the underlying political conditions prevailing
in Lesotho.
The Drought Recovery Component
7.   In April 1992, GOL sought Bank assistance to fund this component which aimed to
alleviate the impact of two consecutive drought years -1991, 1992. An amendment to the
DCA for this component became effective on November 15, 1992. The drought recovery
program was managed under FAO technical assistance. There were two sub-components --
under the first, the input supplies sub-component, mainly maize seed and fertilizers were
imported and sold at a subsidy to farmers. In the first phase of implementation of this sub-
component, these commodities arrived too late to be taken up by most farmers. The
assistance was therefore extended to the 1993 winter season, to draw down stocks of fertilizer
and, with reluctant Bank agreement, covered a wheat subsidy as well. When this sub-
component closed in July 1993, the balance of fertilizer stocks were taken over by GOL and
the value of these refunded to the Bank.
8.    The second sub-component related to the construction of tubewells in rural areas.
This was designed to stabilize water availability during drought years. The agreement
between GOL and FAO came into effect only in March 1993. Thereafter, there were delays
occasioned by FAO consultant's unfamiliarity with Bank procurement procedures (which had
been relaxed to permit speedy procurement), disagreements between the Bank and GOL, and
one mistake on the Bank's part. In the end, of the original target of 150 wells, which had
been reduced to 100, only 73 wells were constructed.
Findings and Lessons Learned
9.    LMCP, in its various alterations, was a project which provides important lessons, not
only for future projects in Lesotho which seek to develop local capacity for managing
resources, but for all other project where questions of participation and a sense of project
ownership are vital for implementation. The most important of these are:



-vi -
(a)   Programs which seek to rely on local capacity, priorities and
implementation need careful and detailed preparation. An approach, which
affected LMCP design and its repercussions was the speed with which the project was
prepared. It appears that there was an assumption that the Development Councils
Order reflected a reality of which both government officials and the councils were
aware and with which they agreed. In fact, few officials and even fewer villagers
were aware of the provisions of the Order and, consequently, of their rights and
obligations. More thorough preparation and participatory work would have revealed
this inconsistency.
(b)   Thorough preparation would have revealed the strengths and weaknesses
of both the Ministries and the councils. Detailed examination would have shown
the extent of training that was required. Training both in perceptions and changes in
these from an authoritarian or "do good" approach characteristic of ministries, and the
needs of the villagers (training in management, in decision-making, in conflict
resolution, in the need for equitable choice). As a result, project targets would have
been lowered right from project inception. Further, programs with conflicting
approaches ("food for work") and their impact would have been more carefully
assessed. An essential tool in the process would have been provision, at preparation
stage, of Systematic Client Consultation (SCC).
(c)   Should there have been a pilot? Views about this are not easily reconciled.
The ICR is firm in its view that there should have been a learning phase. GOL, on
the other hand, is of the view that since the project was extended only to two districts,
with implementation of only two RMPs, these should be deemed to have been a pilot.
However, it is apparent on the basis of the project implementation schedule that had
the project been implemented as anticipated, there was insufficient learning time for
the lessons from ongoing implementation to be fed into subsequent RMP preparation.
(d)   The choice of districts. The ICR, and to an extent, the Beneficiary Impact
Study, suggest that the project should have commenced in more hospitable districts
than the mountain districts of Mokhotlong and Qacha's Nek. It is suggested that the
choice of these districts where living facilities were inadequate and which were
remote from the capital, Maseru, should have been postponed until the project had
been first implemented in districts with adequate facilities and which were close
enough to Maseru to allow for regular supervision. GOL, however, points out with
some justification that the initial project districts had always been neglected for the
same reasons which others justify project commencement in more developed districts.
Further, GOL also notes that if the project had succeeded in a low-lying district, its
success could be attributed to factors other than project design. Also, the reasons for
success could not necessarily be replicated in the mountain districts where conditions
differed. In effect, if the project had succeeded in the mountain districts, that is in the
most difficult area, the conditions for success would be more easily replicable in the
low-lying districts.



-vii-
(e)   Organizational design. Considerations of the choice of district inevitably
lead to a discussion of the project's organizational design. The project design
envisaged a series of organizational layers -- from the VDC, to the DDC, to a
Coordination Committee at the level of headquarters. From Lesotho, VDC proposals
had to be submitted to Washington. This series of layers was both time-consuming
and, with hindsight, not efficient. What is more appropriate and would be far more
effective in future is to bring the level of decision-making to the lowest level possible
-- in this case, the VDCs. In effect, what is needed at the local level is assistance,
monitoring and, possibly, an intermediary between the local and higher levels of
government. The monitoring could find expression in reporting (both physical and
financial); the interlocutor could be, more effectively, a trusted NGO.
(f)   Flexibility of design. The organizational design of the project was relatively
inflexible. It did not take into account the reluctance or inability of GOL ministries to
work together. At the time when the project was being implemented this inability to
coordinate affected project implementation. Changes that were proposed were made
too late to win participation from either ministry. Project design should have a built-
in flexibility allowing for modifi cation of targets and project structure without
necessitating amendments to the Credit Agreement.
(g)   Legislative framework. Where amendments to legislation, or enactment of
new legislation is essential to project implementation, these should be in place before
negotiations or be a condition of Board presentation. Such amendment would be an
indication of government concurrence with the goals of the project/program.
(h)   Parallel financing. Where an essential element of a project is financed by
another donor, care should be taken to determine whether the assistance would be
continued throughout the project life and at the level originally envisaged. In LMCP,
not only did SIDA assistance for LUPD wane and disappear but, as the Beneficiary
Impact Study points out, the land use plans were prepared with reference to the plans
and goals of LUPD, not the VDCs. Nor could these plans or the assistance be
modified or altered to take into account VDC wishes.
(i)    Conservation programs. Programs of soil conservation and range
improvement in southern Africa should be modest, and undertaken with care. There
have not been any successful programs. A result which is, in part, largely due to the
ignorance that pervades regarding the factors which motivate "overstocking" and
"overgrazing". In the result, partly as a result of being compelled to complete sub-
programs within a period of six months, most of the activities selected by VDCs were
for projects with an immediate income benefit, not for major conservation works with
delayed returns.
(j)    Disbursement suspension. When project implementation is dragging for
some time, measures should be taken to suspend project disbursement, restructure the
project or convince government to cancel the Credit. There are clear grounds in
IDA's "General Conditions" for doing so. However, these are employed reluctantly.



Yiii-
The Africa Region has adopted clear guidelines for setting performance standards for
projects that perform "unsatisfactorily". These should be applied with rigor.
(k)    Emergency relief. The Bank is not the most efficient institution for providing
emergency relief Occasions when it called upon to do so should encourage in-depth
scrutiny and a re-direction of the request to agencies that are better suited to the
provision of speedy relief.






PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
LESOTHO
LAND MANAGEMENT AND CONSERVATION PROJECT
(CREDIT 1897-LSO)
I. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A.   DESCRIPrION OF THE PROJECT
Introduction: The Objectives Of The LMCP
1.    The Land Management and Conservation Project (Cr. 1897-LSO) was intended to
carry out the drive of the Government of Lesotho (GOL) for "democratic decentralization"
exemplified in the Development Councils Order of 1986. The objective of this legislation
was to permit development councils at the village and district level to plan and administer
their resources themselves. It was intended as a "bottom-up" approach to development and
self-government. The LMCP limited itself to one of the most important resources, namely
land, and aimed at improving rangeland management and promoting land conservation
measures. The project was planned to cover seven of the ten districts of Lesotho, and would
entail the compilation of 47 Resource Management Plans (RMPs), all of which would be set
in motion before the termination of the project. The life of the project was to be nine years
because it was felt that the legal and social changes required for its success would be slow.
2.    There were four chief ingredients in the vision of the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR)l:
(a)   Decentralization: The development and implementation of RMPs based on
the informed choice of rural villagers. The latter would examine their resource base,
with the assistance of the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) and the Ministry of Home
Affairs (MOHA; then MICARD). They would then democratically make decisions
about its uses. They would have the right to raise revenues and use the money for
projects of any kind they deemed suitable.
(b)   The civil service: The civil service would change its orientation from "top-
down" to "bottom-up", perceiving itself as the assistant to people at the local level.
The initiative would henceforth lie with the Village Development Councils (VDCs).
The MOA and MOHA would tailor their own resources of personnel, training and
materials to helping the VDCs to implement their plans.

(c)   The donors: The International Development Association (IDA) would
provide financing for the administration of the project, for training the VDCs and
members of the MOA and MOHA, and for projects which the VDCs wished to carry
out. SIDA would provide technical assistance to GOL through the Land Use
Planning Department, and training in land use planning would be provided.
(d)   Legislation: In accordance with the new drive for decentralization, the VDCs
were to be given the power to raise revenues and to spend the moneys collected by
their own sovereign decision.
3.   In the following sections, more flesh is added to the above outline of events. A brief
narrative of the events from 1989 to 1995 is given in the remainder of this section; this is
followed by a summary of the final outputs of the LMCP, enabling the reader to compare the
objectives mentioned above with what was actually achieved. In sections I.B and I.C, the
drought recovery scheme and the vetiver grass scheme are analyzed at greater length. In
section I.D we return to the main part of the project, and discuss the chief reasons for the
failure of the LMCP. Following this, a series of other problems is discussed in section I.E.
Finally, the key lessons learned are summarized in section I.F.
A Brief Account Of Events, 1989-95
4.    Next to nothing was achieved in the first two years of operation of the LMCP (1989-
90) o wing to staffing difficulties. The first Project Coordinator left after a relatively short
period of duty. Furthermore, SIDA steadily withdrew the technical assistance that it had
promised to GOL, so that the crucial land planning side of the project was neglected.
5.    New life was breathed into the project in 1991 with the appointment of a more
dynamic Project Coordinator and of a Project Facilitator/Trainer. Activities commenced in
the first two districts, Mokhotlong and Qacha's Nek. By mid-1992, however, the project had
not yet completed any of the originally anticipated 47 Resource Management Plans (RMPs).
Accordingly the project was scaled down: in the remaining five years of the life of the
project, 25 RMPs would be designed and executed. The savings of US$ 4 million were
allocated to a drought recovery scheme.
6.    The restructuring did not have the anticipated effect of spurring performance. Barring
the drought recovery scheme, project implementation was still minimal by mid-1993. It was
clear by this time that the chief impediment to progress was the unwillingness of the Ministry
of Agriculture officials to cooperate with MOHA. The MOA argued that it had no control
over the funds and resented being subject to the tutelage of MOHA, the lead ministry for the
project. Other problems included the inability of the Facilitator/Trainer to provide suitable
training for the District Planning Officers (DPOs); difficulties in staffing at the district level;
and poor accounting practices.
7.    Meanwhile the drought recovery scheme was proceeding, under FAO management.
The World Bank and GOL provided the finance to buy fertilizer and improved maize seed.
These inputs were sold at subsidized prices, with the World Bank financing the subsidy



-3 -
element. Due to difficulties with the procurement procedures, the goods arrived too late for
most of the intended beneficiaries to take them up for the 1992 planting season; only one-
quarter of the fertilizer was sold at this time.2 The subsidy scheme was extended to a winter
wheat subsidy in mid-1993, and this drew the stocks down. The GOL took over the balance
of the unsold fertilizer and returned the value of the balance to the World Bank.
8.    The other component of the drought recovery scheme had to do with water supplies.
The Village Water Supply Section (VWSS) of the MOHA took responsibility for hiring
contractors to sink boreholes and install aprons; by the end of 1994, 73 had been completed.
VWSS also purchased five Mercedes Benz trucks for tankerage purposes, though no
tankerage was done since the trucks were delivered only in June 1994.
9.    To return to the main project, the participants attempted to redefine the roles of the
two implementing ministries (MOHA and MOA) and to improve communication through an
ad hoc inter-ministerial committee at the level of Principal Secretary. The committee was
chaired by the Principal Secretary, Ministry of Planning (MOP). These attempts largely
failed. Only two RMPs (Mosuoe-Tsepiso at Qacha's Nek and Motsitseng-Phahameng at
Mokhotlong) had been written by the end of 1993, and only the former was under
implementation. At the October 1993 Supervision, it was agreed to slim down the numbers
of RMPs again, this time to eight RMPs. GOL and the Mission agreed upon a time-bound
Action Plan, the failure to execute which would trigger closure of the project.
10.   The terms of the Action Plan were not met within the specified time, and so the GOL
canceled US$ 7.0 million of the Credit (February 1994). Again, the MOA had been
responsible for the bulk of the tasks in the Action Plan but had failed to act. Implementation
of the two RMPs was permitted to run until the end of 1994, and the drought recovery
scheme was hastily completed. The LMCP was closed on June 30, 1995.
11.   The LMCP was thus a failure from the point of view of implementation. It is argued
below that the primary cause of its downfall was the uncooperative posture of the Ministry of
Agriculture. There were other serious problems as well: a lack of understanding of
conservation in the original conception of the project; staffing problems; and the failure of
the drought recovery scheme to reach its intended beneficiaries. Finally, the important
question must be raised whether a different mechanism should have been at work which
would have induced earlier closure of the project.
Summary Of The Final Outputs Of The LMCP
12.   The outputs of the LMCP may be stated as follows.
(a)   Legal changes: All the legal changes anticipated in the Staff Appraisal Report
(SAR) were eventually obtained, though with a lag which would have been
inconvenient had the project been operating at full speed. The Land (Amendment)
Order, 1992, and the Range Management and Grazing Control (Amendment)
2. Discussion with Mr. A.M.Gugushe, Chief Marketing Officer, MOA.

Regulations, 1992, were passed in March 1992. The Development Councils
(Amendment) Order, 1992 were enacted in July 1992, and the Development Councils
Funds Regulations were promulgated in March 1993. The Agricultural Leasing
Regulations were promulgated in May 1992. For the LMCP, it was vitally important
that VDCs have the right to raise and spend revenues, and this right was finally
obtained in satisfactory form only with the promulgation of the Development
Councils Funds regulations in March 1993: a delay of four years. In the event, this
tardiness did not hamper the LMCP, because a host of other factors had intervened to
slow the project down. In future projects, consideration should be given to making
effectiveness conditional upon enactment of the most crucial items of legislation
required by the DCA.
(b)    Resource Management Plans (RMPs): Three3 were prepared, and of these two
were partially implemented. Implementation meant: the repahi of a bridge, the
purchase of Scotch carts, knitting machines, sewing machines, rams, and fruit trees
(Mokhotlong); and the establishment of communal gardens, the partial construction
of a feeder road (Qacha's Nek).
(c)    Civil works: two staff houses, a brick-and-concrete office and a caravan office
in each of the two districts (Mokhotlong and Qacha's Nek)4; and an extension officer's
house in Mokhotlong. These will serve as an incentive to future District Planning
Officers to work in these districts.
(d)    Training: four District Planning Officers received training abroad, most for a
period of between 8 and 13 weeks; approximately 176 Village Development
Councilors were trained by the Lesotho Distance Training Center5; and chiefs,
treasurers and secretaries were brought to Maseru for training, for a total of about 18
people. This training was little used during the course of the project, but may come
into use in other projects in the future.
(e)    Drought recovery assistance: Assistance was given to the value of about $2.07
million (see Table 8A), in the form of seed subsidies, fertilizer subsidies, and 1 00
6
boreholes, of which 73 were fitted with aprons and handpuMps .
3. Note: Mr. F. Lefata, District Planning Officer of Mokhotlong (while the project was in progress), stated that seven
Resource Management Plans had been completed. It appears to be a matter of definition, the Ministry of Agriculture
contending that certain parts of the RMPs had not been done to the required standard.
4.  As of March 1995, the DPO's house in Qacha's Nek was not yet complete: the doors, the floor, the ceiling, the roof and the
electrical connections had not yet been installed. The accounts clerk's house in Qacha's Nek was complete but for the
fence and the electrical installations.
5.  viz. 8 members of each of 22 Village Development Councils.
6.  The original plan was for 150 boreholes, but due to a long exchange of correspondence and ensuing delays, it had to be
revised downwards to I 00.



- 5 -
(f)   The planting of a few thousand vetiver grass slips; compliance in this scheme
by the Ministry of Agriculture was less than 13 percent (see section I.C).
13.  In terms of cost effectiveness, the LMCP operated, at this author's estimate, at a level
of 18 percent of what could reasonably have been the case, when all costs are taken into
account and more modest objectives are substituted for the optimistic ones in the SAR.
Stated differently, the LMCP cost five times as much per "benefit unit" as could have been
the case with a well-oiled project. (The rationale and workings for this estimate are presented
in Table 9: Economic Costs and Benefits.)
B.   DROUGHT RECOVERY SCHEME
14.  In light of the failure of the 1991 and 1992 crops, the FAO and the Ministry of
Agriculture devised a drought recovery scheme including two components: input supply and
water supply. In April 1992, the World Bank agreed to finance the scheme through the
savings arising from the reduction of the scope of the LMCP from 47 to 25 RMPs. The
change necessitated a revision of the original credit agreement; the negotiations for the
Amendment were completed on September 24, 1992. The amendment became effective on
November 15, 1992.
Input Supply Component
15.  It was decided to give farmers an approximate 20 percent subsidy on purchases of
maize seed and seed of other summer crops, and on fertilizer. The program was managed by
FAO technical assistance.
16.   Given the limited time available following the signing of the Amendment, the normal
ICB procedures required by the World Bank would not have permitted delivery of the inputs
before December. Therefore the World Bank supervision mission recommended a waiver of
ICB to permit direct procurement. Final approval for this was given by the World Bank only
on November 17, 1992. Though orders were placed speedily, the fertilizer and seed arrived
only after November 27, by which time the traders had already made the bulk of their
purchases. Only one-quarter of the fertilizer purchased by GOL was sold at the time.7 Some
of it disappeared due to poor organization and some rotted due to insecure storage. There
were accusations of poor financial accountability. Over 95,000 individual sales transactions
and subsidy claims were recorded from 25 traders participating in the scheme. The total
amounts involved were: 495 (metric) tons of maize seed, 9,908 tons of fertilizer and a total of
88 tons of other seeds. In order to draw down the remaining stocks, and to enable farmers to
recover fully from the drought, the scheme was extended in 1993 to provide subsidized
fertilizer and wheat seed for winter wheat.
7. Estimate from Mr. A.M. Gugushe.

17.    Individual sales transactions receipts were required under the scheme. Field audits to
verify the validity of the transactions were undertaken. At the closure of the scheme, all
documents were in the possession of the Government.
18.    A more fundamental question must be posed regarding the supply component,
namely: did it reach the intended beneficiaries? From the many documents generated by the
drought recovery scheme, there emerge three distinct readings as to whom the scheme was
intended to benefit:
(a)    According to certain of the documents, the drought recovery scheme was
aimed at the rural poor. Specifically, in one component of the FAO report on the
scheme, it was aimed at "alleviating the misery" of "drought-stricken and starving
people ... the rural poor" (Lamrock, 1993, p. 5). In the same document, the "target" of
the assistance is stated to be the "smallholder farmer" (p. 14).
(b)    In other FAO and IDA documents, the rationale was that Lesotho had suffered
the worst drought in living memory, so that what was needed was the "restoration of
agricultural production in the forthcoming season through provision of affordable
agricultural inputs", which would "lessen food dependency and the need for more
food imports" (quoted in Lamrock, 1993).8 In this and similar documents, explicit
discussion of the effects of the scheme on the distribution of incomes is absent.9
(c)    Others again have argued that the two consecutive droughts had affected
everyone in Lesotho, and so the purpose of the scheme was to enable a general
recovery. While the recovery may have been general in terms of output (e.g. 50
percent of the sown area may have been sown to subsidized grains), the issue for IDA
is rather whether it was general in terms of recipients (e.g. whether it helped at least
half of the population of farmers). The median lowland farmer has about 2.1 to 2.9
hectares of arable land;'0 farmers with over 5 hectares constitute about 32 percent of
the farmer population."I If, then, the drought recovery scheme could be reasonably
expected to assist either the lower half of the farmer size distribution (all those up to
2.1-2.9 ha) or the upper half of the farm size distribution (all those above 2.1-2.9 ha)
or some other combination of 50 percent of the farmers, it would deserve to be called
a "general recovery". Below, the question will be addressed: did at least 50 percent of
the farmers benefit?
8.  DA/R92-125, September 23, 1992.
9.  Another consideration is the long-term effect of drought recovery assistance on incentives. Certain kinds of assistance are
counter-productive, inducing farmers to take undue risks and implicitly penalizing farmers for prudent farming methods.
Producers could learn to respond to risk by saving and diversifying and should not be enccuraged to become dependent on
govemment-subsidized bailouts.
10. Survey by Plath and others (1987) in the Nyakasoba area, southeast of the capital, Maseru.
11. Author's estimate, using data from Table 6 in Africa (1994).

19.    The input supply component probably had a minimal impact on the rural poor, for the
following reasons:
(i)    Fertilizer subsidies do not help the rural poor. The median cropping area of
farmers in one part of Berea district is 2.9 hectares. In other lowland areas, the median
is estimated to be "one or two hectares",12 and the sample of Plath and others (1987)
had an average of 2.1 ha. Farmers in this size range and below sometimes use manure
but do not ordinarily buy chemical fertilizer. None of the members of Plath's (1987)
sample were using chemical fertilizer. In a sample of five villages in the Semonkong
area in the southeastern part of Maseru district the use of commercial fertilizer was
"practically non-existent". 13 Probably the chief beneficiaries of the fertilizer subsidy
were farmers with 10 ha or more, constituting some 4 percent of the lowland farming
population14. A senior government official who had been involved in the input
supply component believed that is was "probably the well-off tarmers" who had
benefited from the fertilizer component.
(ii)   Improved maize seed reaches few of the rural poor. The FAO opined that
50 percent of cropland in Lesotho is planted to improved maize seed so that the
benefits of the scheme were widely spread. There were no data to corroborate the
view. The figure of 50 percent is probably exaggerated. For one thing, farmers in the
mountain areas rarely have access to improved seed. For example, in the (mountain)
district of Mokhotlong the government shop selling improved seed (among other
items) had been closed down. Even if the figure of 50 percent were supported, the
category of the "rural poor" probably falls entirely into the other 50 percent which
does not use improved maize seed. Around Nyakosoba (south-west of Maseru),
peasants did not use improved seed as of 1986 (Plath and others, 1987). Around
Semongkong (Maseru district) in 1984, farmers did not purchase improved seed, but
used their seed, saved from previous years or bought saved seed from other farmers
(Kross and others, 1984, p.62).
(iii)  Improved wheat seed is bought primarily by better-off farmers. 16 In the
winter wheat scheme, both fertilizer and wheat seed were sold on a subsidized basis.
The bulk of the fertilizer was sold in Maseru district, and the bulk of the wheat seed
went to Mafeteng and Maseru districts. In the lowlands, wheat is grown mainly by
larger farmers using subsidized tractor and combine services. Some small farmers

14. Author's calculations, using data from Africa (1994), Table 6. The sample consisted of farmers with some arable land in
the Berea district. In the sample, 3.9% had over 10 ha and 32.3% had over 5 ha.
15. Certain proponents of the scheme defend it by pointing out that there were many small purchases of inputs (50kgs. of seed)
which were accompanied by fertilizer purchases. On the other hand, small purchases can be made by both large and small
farmers. Hence examination of the 95,000 purchases is unlikely to be revealing.
16. This point was brought to the attention of the FAO and GOL representatives.



- 8 -
may have benefited indirectly if they rented land to these larger farmers, but the
proponents of the scheme had no data on the extent of such rentals. Smallholders in
mountain areas, where maize responds poorly, frequently grow wheat for their own
consumption and for fodder; but they did not benefit from the subsidy scheme
because they use local varieties. The World Bank had noted that the improved wheat
seed went to better-off farmers, and was reluctant to proceed with the scheme.
20.    What of the argument that a "general recovery" was being sought? Suppose, as is
likely, that the fertilizer subsidies helped approximately the largest 20 percent of farmers, the
improved maize seed the top 40 percent, and the improved wheat seed the top 10 percent.
Then, even though total grain output may have risen considerably, it would not be possible to
argue that even half of the farming population had benefited. Alternatively stated: the
program did not leave the distribution of incomes unchanged; it probably shifted it in favor of
the top 10 to 40 percent of the farmer population. 7
21.    There would have been more justification for intervention by IDA had the designers
of the scheme investigated the possibility of inexpensive methods which would have targeted
the rural poor. For instance, subsidizing maize seed in selected regions - probably omitting
the lowlands where larger farmers are likely to capture the benefits - would constitute a rough
form of targeting.
22.    Two important lessons can be drawn from the input supply component of the drought
recovery scheme. First, even in cases of emergency actions there should be careful and
explicit consideration of the impact of the scheme on income distribution, poverty and
investment incentives. Second, objective, not anecdotal, information should be used to
determine whether the emergency scheme is likely to reach its intended beneficiaries.
Water Supply Component
23.    The Village Water Supply Section (VWSS) of the MOHA undertook to sink
boreholes and install aprons in the rural areas worst affected by the 1990-92 drought. It
would have been ideal to have had a listing of villages with an estimate of precipitation
received and the state of their water supplies. This would have enabled an objective and
transparent decision-making process so as to achieve maximum relief per dollar spent. No
17. Lamrock (1993, p.14) states: "Frequency distributions of sales size compiled by the database application indicate that the
majority of transactions for maize inputs were for 10kgs of seed and either one or two 50kg bags of fertilizer. This relates
to an average planted area per fanner of 1.5 to 2ha. This indicates that the Scheme reached its target of smallholder
farmers directly, as opposed to larger commercial farmers or intermediate traders". The fact that purchases were small
does not necessarily imply that the purchasers were smallholders. The purchasers and organizers knew that the objective
was to reach smallholders, and there was nothing to prevent farmers from purchasing many times in small quantities each
time. There was also nothing to prevent small farmers (or any members of the general public) from purchasing inputs and
then reselling them. Unfortunately, the organizers of the scheme did not investigate in detail what use was made of the
inputs after purchase: what proportion of the inputs ended up on the fields of smallholders, and what proportion on the
fields of middle and large farmers? In the absence of such evidence, the investigator is forced to consider what the usual
practices of farmers in Lesotho are. On the basis of the limited information available - discussions with officials,
discussions with farmers in various regions, some survey data from the 1980s - it appears that the chief users of the
fertilizer and of most of the improved seed was the larger-farm group. This conclusion is tentative, as as the data sources
are limited. If further evidence is brought to bear, the inferences would be reconsidered.

such document appears to have been available; a government document (Ministry of
Planning, Economic and Manpower Development, 1992) said regarding rural water supplies
that they were "unable to give an equivalent detailed breakdown of supply times, works and
funding to that provided for the urban areas". Officials of VWSS stated that the organization
had done a survey of 20 rural locations in each district, but were unable to furnish the author
with a copy. Hence it is not clear on what basis the beneficiary areas were selected. On the
other hand, data of the kind ideally required is rare in any less developed country, and there is
ample justification for making provision for drought in the long term even though these data
are absent.
24.   Three districts were selected (Leribe, Maseru and Mohale's Hoek) for World Bank-
funded assistance. The proffered reason for allocating these to the World Bank was that the
African Development Bank and the Overseas Development Administration had funded water
supply activities in the other districts.
25.   Delays soon occurred due to procurement difficulties. In the World Bank's
understanding, the complex ICB tender procedures had been waived due to the emergency
nature of the aid, to be replaced by "prudent shopping" arrangements. On the GOL side,
however, the understanding was that even though the World Bank had waived its tender
procedures, the GOL still had to respect the tender procedures of its own Tender Board. So
instead of using prudent shopping, tenders were put out. The fact that tenders had been put
out, however, revived the normal World Bank procurement procedures; and it was soon
disco-'ered that, for instance, the Tender Board requirements permitted the naming of "trade
names" (e.g. "Toyota trucks"), whereas the World Bank protocols excluded these in favor of
purely engineering descriptions. The ensuing misunderstandings and disagreements cost
much effort by all three parties (FAO, Bank and GOL) and resulted in lengthy delays.
26.   One of the causes of the misunderstanding was that the consultant appointed by the
FAO to undertake the procurement for the scheme proved to be poorly skilled in handling the
World Bank's procurement procedures. In addition, at least one procurement error was made
by the World Bank staff. There were accusations and counter-accusations of delays in
replying to urgent letters and faxes.
27.   Argument persists as to which party - the FAO, the GOL or the World Bank - should
accept the larger share of the onus for the delays. It is, however, unnecessary to go into detail
in order to distribute the blame accurately; for the World Bank the lesson ought to be clear
that drought relief is not its strong hand and that emergency actions of this nature are best left
to specialist organizations and NGOs.
28.   By the end of 1994, some 73 boreholes had been sunk and fitted with aprons.
29.  In addition five Mercedes Benz trucks were purchased for use as water tankers. The
trucks were delivered in June 1994 and sent to the districts some months later; no tankerage
was actually effected. Of course the tankerage trucks may be used in future years of drought
- but if the intention had been to furnish GOL with a long-term drought relief capability,
different channels would have been chosen than the emergency relief channels selected.



-10-
30.   Recall that the drought had decimated the 1991 and 1992 harvests, and that the World
Bank had started in April 1992 to prepare to assist GOL with the drought recovery scheme.
There were good rains in the latter half of 1992, which prompts the question why tankerage
trucks were necessary. These would have made sense only if a drought was imminent or
current and the relevant institutions were confident that the trucks could be purchased swiftly
enough to be able to use them.
C.   VETIVER GRASS SCHEME
31.   The vetiver grass scheme was begun in November 1993. The Ministry of Agriculture
agreed to identify ten farmers in the Leribe and Buthe-Buthe districts, each of whom would
plant 4,000 vetiver grass slips, which would after three years be sold back to the Ministry,
with a view to popularizing their use for erosion control throughout the country. In exchange
the ten farmers would receive fencing for the plot, a barrel of fertilizer, and technical
assistance. The February/March 1994 supervision mission evidently believed that
compliance by the MOA had been considerable, concluding that "five farmers each in Leribe
and Buthe-Buthe Districts [were] identified, trained and vetiver slips planted".
32.   The author visited two of the farmers in March 1995, together with Mr. J. Molapo, the
Conservation Officer of the Ministry of Agriculture. The farmer in Kolonyama village
(Leribe) had planted about 2000 slips, of which about three-quarters were in good condition;
however, the Ministry had not yet given him the promised fencing. The plot in Malesaoana
village (Leribe) showed no sign of any planting, and the fencing had not yet been given. It
was clear that the Ministry of Agriculture had not been providing supervision for the five
farmers. On the basis of this sample, compliance by the Ministry of Agriculture was about
25 percent'8 - or less, in view of the failure of the Ministry to give the farmers the fencing
promised. Mr. Molapo said that only five farmers had been contacted thus far; he had no
plans to identify the remaining five. Hence overall compliance is less than 13 percent19. By
mid-January 1994, however, the LMCP was already slated for closure on account of the lack
of MOA cooperation, and the GOL agreed to close it. Since the amount of money involved
in the vetiver grass scheme was relatively small, it seemed pointless to the Supervision

D.   REASONS FOR THE FAILURE OF THE LMCP

as laid out in the SAR: the lack of a pilot, the decision on the starting districts, and the focus
on conservation.
The Lack Of Cooperation Of The Ministry Of Agriculture
34.  In the opinion of many participants, the factor that killed the project was the inability
of the two executing ministries to work together. The adversarial relationship between the
Ministry of Home Affairs and the Ministry of Agriculture can be traced to the initial
conceptualization of the project. MICARD (later MOHA) was the lead ministry, but most of
the work of the project had to be done by the MOA. The MOA repeatedly failed to compile
the Land Use Plans in the time allotted, and to have the subject matter specialists make their
respective contributions to the RMPs. When confronted in the course of the Supervision
Missions, the MOA indicated that it wished to have control over its own funds. Eventually
the decision was taken that the MOA would write up a single proposal for presentation to the
MOHA and IDA, and would thereafter be free of the tutelage of the MOHA. The proposal
was never written.
35.   When the author asked various MOA officials why they had not made efforts to
cooperate with the MOHA, several of them stated that MOA had rejected the LMCP at the
beginning. This is a curious response, since there were MOA officials involved as
counterparts to the preparation and appraisal missions, and they had strongly endorsed the
concept and promised the cooperation of their ministry. The MOA had also been involved at
the stage of negotiations. If the MOA officials had objected at that time, the organization of
the project could have been modified.
36.   Some observers felt that it would have been better to have had two budgets from the
beginning, one for each executing ministry; or alternatively to have the MOA take the lead in
the LMCP. But again, if the MOA had wished to have its own budget, it could have made its
position clear at the start. Perhaps there were differences of opinion within the MOA which
emerged with greater clarity only long after appraisal and negotiation. Even if this were the
case, the MOA would be responsible for its failure to attain a common mind among its
officials.
37.   MICARD/MOHA was designated as the lead ministry because the chiefs and VDCs
fall under its authority, and because MOHA was needed in order to implement the
Development Councils Order. Even if the MOA had its own budget, or had been the lead
ministry, there would have been a need for close cooperation with MOHA. It is common
cause that the MOA was overloaded with projects from donors and lacked the absorptive
capacity for another large project. Perhaps this underlay the thinking of the appraisal team
and led to the decision to place the MOA under the aegis of the MOHA.
38.   Obviously a rural development project would require the cooperation of both the
MOHA and the MOA. There was probably some justification for suspecting that the MOA
did not have the capacity to run the project; but if so, it is no solution to assign a chief
responsibility to another ministry. It may be that there simply was not the institutional
capacity for running the project.



-12-
Absence of a Pilot
39.    The ultimate objective of the project was to enable self-government at the local level,
with participation by villagers in development decisions. This difficult task requires getting
villagers unaccustomed to exercising their powers to participate fully in development
decisions, to study reports, and possibly also to take risks in opposing the will of powerful
individuals. This process requires unusual sensitivity on the part of the District Planning
Officers and MOA officials involved. They have to have the patience to nurture the growing
buds of democracy without seeking to accelerate it by taking over the functions of the Village
Development Councils. (One of the DPOs took over all procurement activities of the VDCs
in his area, depriving the villagers of the learning experience that was one of the principal
aims of the LMCP!) Inevitably false starts will be made.
40.   In view of this complexity, it would have been ideal to have a pilot which should run
to term so as to move all the participants up the learning curve. It would also have been ideal
to start in an area where all the conditions are favorable, to ensure a reasonable degree of
success at the beginning.
41.    But in fact the SAR did not include a pilot.20 The plan was to initiate two RMPs in
year two, a further six in year three, a further eleven in year four, and so on. Each RMP was
supposed to be implemented over a four-year period. Thus the second round of RMPs (in
year three) would commence after only one year's worth of effort on the first round; hardly a
sufficient period to provide significant learning. It is not clear to the author whether the
appraisal mission felt itself to be under pressure to engineer a high rate of disbursements
early on in project implementation.
42.    Some observers felt that the LMCP was itself a pilot in practice - as witness the
repeated scaling down and the completion of only three RMPs. That the LMCP ended up at
pilot magnitude cannot be denied. But it was not intended as a pilot and the infrastructure it
required was vastly in excess of what a pilot alone would have required. A pilot is intended
as a quick, small and cheap version of the real thing so that important lessons can be
acquired.
Starfing in Mountain Districts
43.    The decision was taken to start in the mountain districts of Mokhotlong and Qacha's
Nek and then to spread to the other districts. These outlying districts afford extremely
difficult communication due to the poor status of the roads. The districts are far from
Maseru, making inspection by the project officers and World Bank staff arduous and hence
infrequent. The towns lack the comforts of urban living and it was considered a
"punishment" in the MOHA service to be posted there; the government rejected a suggestion
20. There had been "some limited experience" (SAR, p. 31) in the area of conservation before. These earlier efforts may not
be considered a pilot for the LMCP because (a) they were done by different parties (b) they used different methods and (c)
they had mostly failed. See SAR, p. 3, which refers to Government-supported efforts since 1935. The following
discussion refers to the absence of a pilot within the context of the LMCP.



-13-
21
that incentive pay be offered for these posts  . It could have been foreseen that posts would
often be vacant.
44.    It is a mystery why these districts were selected. The only reason stated in the SAR is
that the faraway mountain districts had been neglected in the past. Yet that is an argument - a
legitimate one - for giving attention to these districts, even if it be half-way through or
towards the end of the LMCP; it is not an argument for initiating an intricate project in those
districts. Certain informants mentioned that there were officials in the ministries who had
links with these mountain areas, and that they would likely have a strong commitment to the
success of the project. This, too, is a reason for including the mountain areas in the project; it
is not a reason for starting the project there. Discussion with the participants revealed that
this decision was not based on any objective criterion or on any data.
45.    Possible objective criteria for the decision about the starting location could be: the
ease of inspection by World Bank officials; the ease of supervision by the Project
22
Coordinator; and the attractiveness of the location for the MOA and MOHA officials
46.    Was the location decision the fault of the World Bank appraisal staff or that of the
government? The government insisted on starting the project in Mokhotlong and Qacha's
Nek and is to this extent responsible for the decision; but the World Bank appraisal mission
was under no obligation to accede to a demand which was not based on objective criteria, and
must therefore accept some share of the responsibility.
The Focus on Conservation
47.    The SAR noted, correctly, that rural Lesotho is passing through an environmental
crisis caused by overstocking which depletes the ground cover, increasing the runoff rate,
resulting in the loss of topsoil and the creation of gullies.
48.    In identifying the social causes of the crisis, the SAR assumed that uncontrolled
erosion has two main causes: the "tragedy of the commons" and a lack of technical expertise
and markets. In terms of the "tragedy of the commons", the benefits of adding an extra beast
to the commonage are realized by the owner, whereas the costs of so doing are borne by the
community.23 The owner ignores the external effects of his/her stocking rate (SAR:3-5, esp.
para. 1.16). As far as the second cause is concerned - the lack of technical expertise and
markets - the owners have little financial interest in selling their beasts because the price is
held down artificially by the government marketing monopoly, so that the offlake rate is low,
24
and they prefer quantity (number of beasts) over quality (dressed weight, health)
21. Interview with Mrs.H.M.Mhlanga, Project Coordinator, March 14, 1995.
22. One informant said that Berea and Maseru districts would have been better because the DPOs could have lived in Maseru
and commuted to their places of work.
23. The SAR refers to the "current communal free-for-all grazing practices" (SAR, p. 5), and to the 'inefficiencies of present
tenurial systems" (ibid, p. 11).
24. The SAR notes: "Recognition of the finiteness of the range resources and the extent of their degradation should enhance
the development of an integrated livestock management program on a national scale, combining resource improvement



-14-
49.    These theories make for an exemplary donor-supported project. Regarding the
"tragedy of the commons", the government can pass legislation enabling Development
Councils to impose charges for grazing and to spend money on development projects such as
soil conservation works. The donor can provide finance to assist the learning process of the
Development Councils - in itself a valid social objective, entirely in accord with the
government's campaign for decentralization. The externalities are therefore internalized; by
the logic of the new system, villagers will have an interest in reducing their stock numbers to
"rational" levels. The project would be self-sustaining with no need for subsidies.
50.    As for the problems of deficient technique and dysfunctional markets, the donor can
provide finance for upgrading the quality of the herd, and can also induce the government to
relinquish its cattle marketing monopoly, which would raise prices and induce a supply
response. These financial incentives would in turn drive autochthonous conservation efforts.
51.    The SAR reasoned that the villagers would apply these lessons after receiving
training: "village, ward and district development councils should become more effective in
regulating livestock movements, to reduce land degradation and encourage farmers to invest
more in crop production and animal husbandry" (SAR, p. 23). Key to the process was a
range management plan in the RMP which limited livestock numbers and introduced
rotational grazing; the novelty of the LMCP approach was that the villagers themselves were
to draw up the plan so that there would be greater cooperation. The SAR did not digress on
the possibility that villagers would reject livestock regulation, nor consider whether they
might have valid reasons for doing so - valid, that its, in terms of their individual and
communal long-term interest.
52.    The philosophy of the SAR can be criticized. One must first ask the Coasian question
why these shrewd people had not already found ways of costing the externalities; and why
similar attempts to promote "rational" community decision-making in the Southern African
region have failed. For example, certain of the Grazing Associations in Lesotho determined
that members would pay a fee of M1.00 for each large stock unit up to ten, and nothing
beyond.25 This stunning reversal of the prescriptions of the theory of the commons would
26
have impoverished the already poor and exacerbated overstocking by the less poor.
together with quality improvement of livestock and encouraging active marketing in improved livestock to provide the
necessary incentives" (SAR: 11).
25. Interview with Mr. B. Motsamai, fornerly Chief Range Officer, MOA, March 15, 1995. A problem not addressed by the
SAR was the skewed distribution of livestock. Why should the commoner care about the extra head of cattle when the
chief (and his clients from outside the village) herd hundreds of animals on the village range at no cost? The VDCs,
chaired by the chief, would be hard pressed to apply effective livestock stinting. The author thanks Rogier van den Brink
for pointing this out.
26. Another example, from the LMCP itself, is the spending priorities of the villagers in the two RMPs which were finally
implemented: namely, directly remunerative investments such as layers, improved rams, knitting machines and fruit trees.
There is nothing objectionable about these priorities, and the SAR provided for alternative uses of funds for directly
productive purposes. The point is that the villagers themselves did not spend on conservation activities.



-15-
53.   Perhaps the villagers have a different maximand from the one we would prefer, such
as the probability of survival, or prestige; or perhaps the inequality of wealth or power within
the village arrests the process of rational decision-making; or perhaps the villagers have a
short time horizon or a high discount rate for their decisions. One can imagine a host of other
convincing reasons for the failure of conservation projects.
54.   Suppose the true social cause of uncontrolled erosion is the villagers' short planning
horizon, which in turn stems from their observation that people are moving to the towns in
search of better wages, health care, convenient shopping, schooling and entertainment. In the
absence of negotiable land rights, it is rational for the majority to draw down their land
capital.27 Only the minority - and no-one knows in advance who they will be - have an
interest in maintaining their land capital. Then the policy implications are quite different to
those propounded in the SAR. They might, for instance, include a campaign for negotiable
land rights or for rural-urban migration. If this theory is true, a conservation project would
not be sustainable, because people would continue to draw down their capital once the
external funding had dried up.
55.   Given our limited understanding of the social causes of erosion, it is not clear if there
is yet any justification for directing public funds at the problem. Note that it is not submitted
that short planning horizons or any of the above-mentioned factors is the prime social cause
of erosion; only that given our present state of knowledge it is impossible to assemble a
project which can be assured to issue in a sustainable reduction of erosion.
56.   None of the above criticism of the conservation aspect of the LMCP constitutes a
rejection of the decentralization aim of the project. As was mentioned, the decentralization
aspect is justifiable in and of itself because it brings decision-making capability closer (in
institutional and physical terms) to the locus of the resources. Under the right circumstances,
this should lead to efficiency gains, as well as to the growth of local democracy. Indeed the
LMCP could have been written instead as a Rural Management Project, shorn of the
conservation emphasis, and in this simplified form may have had a better chance of success.
E.    OTHER PROBLEMS EXPERIENCED BY THE LMCP
Parallel Financing
57.   The parallel financing arrangement with SIDA was not successful because SIDA soon
withdrew its support, reducing the number of technical assistants in land use planning from
seven to three and finally to none.
Difficulties in Suspension of the Project
58.   The LMCP was labeled by the Supervision Reports as "3" or "U" for most of the six-
year period of its operation. The issue arises whether there ought not to have been a
27. The arnended Land Act did recognize negotiability in land rights to the extent of leasing. However, there was inadequate
publicity and training with regard to these rights.



-16-
mechanism or a rule of thumb which would have led to earlier closure and consequently to a
considerable saving of money by the World Bank and the government, in terms of staff
supervision time, travel, hotel expenses, committee meetings, and the like.
59.    Some observers stressed that it is extremely difficult for the World Bank to suspend
projects, because a large number of entities in the World Bank have to be convinced that this
is the best course of action. They underscored the fact that suspension is a blunt weapon
because it entails informing all World Bank member countries dealing with the country and
could have unpredictable repercussions. Others, however, indicated that suspension is not
difficult from the legal point of view25. Yet others felt that no institutional or legal change is
necessary, and that if they so chose, division chiefs and directors could improve the
efficiency of their projects by availing themselves of the suspension clauses more frequently.
60.    The author inclines to the last view. The World Bank cannot micromanage projects -
nor would this be desirable. It can, and does, offer advice on the running of projects through
six-monthly supervisions, and in the case of the LMCP the supervisions were a fine example
of timely counsel. Yet in the face of repeated non-cooperation by sectors of the borrowing
government, the only sanction available to the lender is suspension. For this to be effective,
the rules surrounding suspension should be objective, transparent, and non-discretionary. It
should be clear in the minds of Task Managers and the governments with which they
converse that these rules constitute a "credible threat".
61.    Apparently the Africa Region of the Bank has already adopted rules which cater for
these situations. A "problem project" is supposed to be placed under "intensive care",
receiving three supervisions a year; and if the project's performance is labeled unsatisfactory
twice over, the project has to be restructured or terminated. Had this objective and non-
discretionary rule been applied, the LMCP would have been terminated much earlier, and at a
considerable saving of time and money. No new rules appear to be necessary; it would
suffice for the Directors to insist that their Division Chiefs apply this, or a similar rule of
thumb in a deternined manner.
Staffing
62.    Various staffing problems were experienced during the course of the project. These
were partially caused by tightness in the labor market owing to competition with the Lesotho
Highlands Project which was able to offer higher wages than those in the public sector.
Other staffing problems, however, could have been corrected. The most important of these
are briefly listed here:
(a)    Project Coordinator: Two Project Coordinators came and went in the first two
years; this tended to slow down project execution. A more dynamic Project
28. IDA legislation permits (unilateral) suspension by the lender in the event of failure to perform obligations in Development
Credit Agreements. The language used is the following: "Section 6.02. If any of the following events of suspension shall
have occurred and be continuing, the Association may, by notice to the Borrower, suspend in whole or in part the right of
the Borrower to make withdrawals from the Credit Account: ... (b) The Borrower shall have failed to perform any other
obligation under the Development Credit Agreement." (International Development Association, 1985, p. 8.)



-17-
Coordinator was appointed in 1991, but this person later became Deputy Permanent
Secretary and was therefore able to devote only a small proportion of her time to the
project.
(b)    Facilitator/Trainer: In August 1991, an expatriate Facilitator/Trainer was
appointed. Although he expended a considerable amount of time and effort in
visiting the project areas, he did not give the DPOs and others the formal training he
was required to. Careful examination of the correspondence and the documents he
produced indicate that his failure to do formal training was not due to a lack of time.
The Facilitator/Trainer left due to ill-health in mid- 1993. This debacle was the more
unfortunate because there was a Lesotho national available who was qualified to take
the position of Facilitator/Trainer; and he may have been less costly than the
expatriate.
(c)    Senior Accountant: The person appointed as Senior Accountant in late 1993
had no prior training in the area, either at the school level or the post-school level.
The Senior Accountant had to face several problems bequeathed by the Financial
Controller who had previously been in charge of the project's accounts: the Vote
Book had been lost and he had left a substantial backlog of claims against the Special
Account. Hence some of the Senior Accountant's time was spent clearing the backlog
of claims. Nevertheless, on account of the Senior Accountant's lack of experience in
the area, difficulties occurred repeatedly.26 For instance, VWSS complained of the
project's tardiness in arranging payments for suppliers in the drought recovery
scheme; there were delays in the payment of salaries of project employees; a World
Bank staffer had to give special one-on-one instruction on how to operate the Special
Account. The Auditor-General's reports of 1992 and 1994 urged that a cash book be
kept to record expenditure from the Lesotho Bank account, and that monthly
reconciliations be prepared; by March 1995 this had not been done. The Auditor-
General's report of 1994 mentioned that the fixed asset register was incomplete; the
author's on site inspections confirm this. For instance, there was an entry
"Typewriter" with a purchase price, with no indication of how many typewriters there
were or where they were located; the fixed assets had not been numbered physically
to permit tracking. In 1994, payments were made without proper supporting
documents. 27
(d)    District Planning Officer: One of the DPOs insisted on executing all
procurement decisions of the VDCs in his area, robbing the villagers of the learning
experience that was one of the primary aims of the LMCP. The villagers complained
of his unjustified intervention.
29. A Procurement Specialist from the Southern Africa Department of the Bank provided training on more than one occasion.
In addition, a specialist from the Disbursement Division of the Bank also conducted a training course.
30. There had also been payments without proper support documents in 1992 and 1993 when the Financial Controller was in
charge.



-18-
63.   Part of the responsibility for the deficient performance of the Senior Accountant and
the District Planning Officer lies with the Project Coordinator who could have intervened and
insisted on higher standards.
Finance and Accounting
64.  In every year from 1992 to 1994, the Auditor-General's reports (Stewart 1992,
Molapo 1993, and Stewart 1994) mentioned that payments had been made without proper
supporting documents. This was partly due to the state of disorganization of the project's
financial documents and accounts. Despite the Auditor-General's urging in 1992, monthly
reconciliations with bank statements were not undertaken. The Auditor-General's report of
1994 stated that "no reconciliation had been carried out between the Project's Vote Book and
the Treasury print-out during the year" (Stewart 1994, p. 3).
65.  In particular, there was a lack of clarity about the accounts of the input supply
component of the drought recovery scheme. The Auditor-General reported in 1993 that
"there was no system of control over such sales on which I could rely for the purpose of my
audit, and there were no satisfactory audit procedures that I could adopt to confirm
independently that all cash sales were properly recorded" (Molapo, 1993).
Civil Works
66.   The Ministry of Works proved to be extremely tardy in building staff houses and
offices, and the prices charged were substantially higher than would have been charged under
competitive private sector conditions. As has been mentioned earlier, some of the works
were still not complete in March 1995. In future projects, IDA should insist on getting
agreement from GOL that civil works can be contracted out.
F.   KEY LESSONS LEARNED
Pilot Projects
67.  In a complex project such as one dealing with conservation and with decentralization
to the village level, it is essential that a pilot project be mounted.
Legislative changes
68.   Consideration should be given to making effectiveness conditional upon legislative
changes agreed to in the Development Credit Agreement. In the case of the LMCP, crucial
legislation regarding decentralization of revenue generation and spending rights was passed
in 1993 when it should have been passed in 1989.
Inter-ministerial Cooperation
69.   The lack of cooperation from one of the ministries was one of the most serious
problems faced by the LMCP. Yet it is not obvious that the World Bank can derive any
"lesson" from this for future projects; the ministry concerned must take responsibility for
having committed itself to the LMCP in 1988 and for then neglecting to live up to its
promises. Providing separate budgets for the ministries involved is not a panacea; indeed,



-19-
this merely shifts the problem to a different area; for if either of the ministries fails to
execute, the project is stopped anyway.
Emergency Drought Recovery Assistance
70.   World Bank procurement procedures are not a suitable vehicle for short-term or
emergency drought recovery assistance.
Suspension
71.   The World Bank's existing rules regarding restructuring and suspension of non-
performing projects should be applied with more determination.
Suggestions for Future Work in Decentralization
72.   This paragraph explores the possibility of a different model of decentralization which
attempts to correct some of the deficiencies of the LMCP model. The mechanism for
decentralization used in the LMCP was to:
(i)   have the government pass enabling legislation;
(ii)  train the DPOs as facilitators of the democratic process;
(iii)  have DAOs and others compile RMPs with the assistance and participation of
the villagers;
(iv)  train the Village Development Councilors and chiefs; and
(v)   grant the VDCs funds and let them make decisions as to their disposal.
73.   The process was waylaid at the legislative step and at the step of compilation of
RMPs. In the end, despite the training in conservation received, the VDCs opted against
investments in conservation in favor of investments which would raise their incomes in the
short term.
74.   An alternative would be the following. The aim would be greatly simplified:
"encourage the development of local government". The conservation emphasis is dropped
because it is poorly understood by the donor community and is unlikely to be followed by the
VDCs in the long run. Then the most direct route towards decentralization is chosen: by
letting the donor work directly with the local communities (however defined) without the
"middleman" of the central government. The MOHA would act as a conduit for funds only.
75.   Competent NGOs would be hired for training and would be asked to play a
"watchdog" role. The local community (however defined - possibly the DDC or the VDC)
must put together a plan; and may hire people or institutions with appropriate skills, possibly
from the NGOs, to assist. IDA funding would help them to accomplish the plan. The only
constraint on the content of the plan is that it should not entail the purchase of resources that
lend themselves to monopolization by a handful of individuals, otherwise the donor could
become locked into a situation of corruption, and there is then no learning experience on the
part of the villagers and cynicism sets in.



-20-
76.  In order to ensure real commitment - and to provide a basis for selection of the most
promising VDCs - a leaf is taken from the Grameen Bank book: The community must first
open a bank account and deposit into it a small amount of money on a regular basis over a
period of six months. The money should be collected as a tax. Only when this is
accomplished does the donor provide finance for the community's project. This is a test of
financial responsibility and is a method of selecting VDCs which will eventually be able to
avail themselves of the ability to tax. If the VDC is unable to collect anything at all, it is a
sign that either (a) the people have not understood what the VDC is for, or (b) they do not
feel a strong commitment to the concept or (c) the leaders do not enjoy public support.
77.   The government would still have to pass enabling legislation permitting VDCs to
collect and deploy funds, and to this extent there would still be a considerable risk of failure.
For special projects of this kind, the World Bank would do well to consider creating a kind of
"conditional" credit which swings into action only on condition of prior compliance (e.g. in
legislation by the central government).

Estimate: division into "Foreign" and "Local" is done in proportion to the division under Appraisal Estimate, unless
otherwise specified. GOL contribution, viz. the sum of Incremental Recurrent Costs (Salaries, Vehicles and Equipment,
and Buildings) was assumed to be in direct proportion to the ratio of actual to planned World Bank disbursements, viz.
multiplied by 2,875,035.14 + 11,700,000 (using SDR figures from Goorman [1995b]). Note: the figures in the table are in

TABLE 9: ECONOMIC COSTS AND BENEFITS
It was not anticipated in the SAR that an economic rate of return or net present value would be
calculated. Hence the following is an estimate of the cost effectiveness of the project in achieving its
objectives. Since the measures of effectiveness are necessarily qualitative they should be interpreted
with due caution.
The approach is to set realistic, modest goals for the project and to compute the cost in US$ of
achieving these goals, per project area. This per-unit cost may roughly be described as "the cost, in
US$, of achieving either a decentralization objective or a conservation objective in one project area".
Then this per-unit dollar cost is compared to the actual per-unit cost. This is reported as the "benefit
units accomplished per million dollars spent"; the measure of cost effectiveness is the ratio between the
actual and the anticipated. Cost effectiveness for the main part of the project (that to do with RMPs) is
estimated to be 17 percent.
As for the drought recovery scheme, the approach is to estimate, using whatever data or items of
anecdotal evidence are at hand, the percentage of disbursements reaching the rural poor (as opposed to
the rural middle class). This number is compared to an "ideal" figure of 50% - since it is accepted that
100% targeting to the rural poor is impossible, particularly in an emergency situation. Cost
effectiveness for the drought recovery scheme is estimated to be 20 percent.
Finally, these two measures of cost performance - for the project proper and for the drought recovery
scheme - are averaged, using as weights their contributions to actual costs as laid out in Table 8A.
Overall cost effectiveness is estimated to be 18 percent.

of better estimates, set identical to actual staff costs, which are drawn from Table 12.
bViz. Number of project areas (RMPs) in which the objective of decentralization or conservation was attained.
'The SAR was over-optimistic in assuming that decentralization objectives could be attained in 47 project areas in nine
years. Assume that something less than half of these - 20 - could realistically have been done.
The SAR over-optimistically assumed that all the Resource Management Plans would be focused on conservation. This is
not realistic, since most Lesotho farmers (perhaps rationally) do not place conservation high on their list of priorities. More
modestly, I assume that conservation objectives are addressed in halfof the RMPs executed.
' Drought recovery scheme: The water supply component is ignored because there was not enough time to inspect it in loco.
Only the input supply component is considered. It is not realistic to assume that 100% of emergency drought expenditures
could reach the rural poor even under ideal management. It is reasonable to imagine that 500/o would do so with appropriate
selection of benefits (see main text, section I.B, "Input Supply Component").
f The Motsitseng-Phahameng (Mokhotlong) VDC selected its spending items and did its spending itself; score of 1. The
Motsue (Qacha's Nek) VDC selected is spending items but the DPO did most of the spending, without proper
accountability; score 0.5.
'Neither of the VDCs had a conservation aspect in their spending plan.
h These numbers are informed guesses. See the main text for a discussion (section l.B, "Input Supply Component").

This delay in enacting the legal changes was due to misunderstanding over the pwpose of the original agreements.
In 1991 the government enacted legislation specifying that DCs could collect grazing fees but that these would
constitute 'public funds' and would be transferred to the Consolidated Fund. The latter proviso then had to be struck
out, enabling the DCs to spend the funds themselves (Nov. 1991 SPN, p. 3). The new legislation took the form of
the Land (Amendment) Order, 1992 and the Range Management and Grazing Control (Amendment) Regulations,
1992, which came into force on March 10, 1992 (Mar. 1"92 SPN, p. 4). The Development Councils Regulations
were promulgated in about May 1993.

LAND MANAGEMENT AND CONSERVATION PROJECT
IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPOPT
AIDE-MEMOIRE FOR MISSION, 13-24 MARCH, 1995
A meeting chaired by Mr. T. Ncholu (Deputy Principal Secretary, Ministry of Planning)
was held on 24 March 1995 to conclude the mission by Mr. P.G. Moll (Consultant) for the
Implementation Completion Report for the Land Management and Conservation Project. There
were present Ms. Qobosheane, Mr. T. Mapetla, Mr. M. Mohapi, Mr. F. Lefata (Economic
Planner, Ministry of Home Affairs), and Mr. P.G. Moll (Consultant, World Bank).
Mr. Moll expressed his thanks to the many people who provided him with information.
They are listed in the order in which they were interviewed, with the positions they held when
they were involved in the LMCP: Mr. F. Lefata (former District Planning Officer,
Mokhotlong), Mr. K.W. Lesaoana (Senior Engineer, Village Water Supply Section), Mr. M.
Rahman (Village Water Supply Section), Ms. V. Qobosheane (Senior Economic Planning
Officer, Ministry of Planning), Mrs. H.M. Mhlanga (Deputy Principal Secretary, Ministry of
Home Affairs), Mr. M. Sejanamane (Chief Executive, DRIG), Mr. J.O. Kakonge (Resident
Representative, UNDP), Ms. L.K. Mdee, Mr. D. Gilmozzi (Resident Representative, F.A.O.),
Mr. B. Motsamai (Chief Range Officer, Ministry of Agriculture), Mr. K. Letsie (formerly
Economic Planner, Ministry of Home Affairs), Mr. T. Borotho (Chief Land Use Planner,
Ministry of Agriculture), Mr. A.M. Gugushe (formerly Marketing Officer, Ministry of
Agriculture), Mr. K. Letsoisa (former District Secretary, Mokhotlong), Mor. S. Lerotholi (Area
chief, Motsitseng, Mokhotlong), Mr. Emmanuel Matalasi (Extension Officer, Motsitseng), Mr.
W.P. Leshota (District Secretary, Mokhotlong), Mr. G.H. Lekhanya (District Secretary, Qacha's

D.S. Seahle (Acting Chief, Mosuoe, Qacha's Nek), Mr. M. Nqojane (District Planning Officer,
Qacha's Nek), Mr. J. Molapo (Conservation Officer, Ministry of Agriculture), Ms. M. Stewart
(Auditor, Ministry of Finance), Ms. P. Malefane (Senior Accountant, Ministry of Home
Affairs), Ms. L. Lefosa (Senior Economic Planner, Ministry of Planning), Ms. R.M. Mofokeng
(Lecturer, Lesotho Distance Teaching Center) and Mr. E.M. Motjoli (Lecturer, Lesotho
Distance Teaching Center). Mr. Moll expressed particular thanks to Mr. F. Lefata who
arranged his itinerary and to Mr. S. Rakhare, the project driver.



-38-
Mr. Moll offered a few observations on the causes of the failure of the project,
emphasizing that these are still hypotheses since the information-gathering stage of the
Implementation Completion Report is not yet complete:
* The Staff Appraisal Report was excessively ambitious in its neglect to undertake a pilot
and its decision to start the LMCP in two of the most distant parts of the country,
Mokhotlong and Qacha's Nek.
* The Ministry of Home Affairs and the Ministry of Agriculture experienced difficulty in
cooperating.
* Staffing proved to be a major problem due to, among other things, competition with the
parastatals.
* In the ensuing discussion, several further points were mentioned, amongst others the
unclear assignation of duties among the ministries, and the importance of terminating
projects after a period of unsatisfactory performance.

B.   BORROWER'S COMMENTS ON THE ICR
Reasons for Failure of the L.M.C.P.
The Land Management and Conservation Project was a project with the broad
objectives of improving land management and halting resource deterioration and thereby
improving both crop and livestock production. This was sought to be achieved through
strengthening the capabilities of MICARD and MOA to assist the newly established
Development Councils. The project was the first of its kind to involve already existing
government structures for its implementation. This methodology was a new phenomenon in
project implementation in the country. Reasons laid down in the ICR are acceptable with the
following slight modifications:
Absence of a Pilot
Though the exact words "pilot project" were not used for a project that was to
eventually operate in seven (7) districts, a start in two (2) districts whose performance would
determine the course to be followed in the remaining five (5) districts could be equated to a
"pilot".
The problem in the choice of districts could be that they both were in the mountainous
region and there was no comparison with a low lying region which could have had a different
sort of problems so that the failure could not be apportioned only to the hazards of a difficult
terrain.
Starting in the Mountain Districts
The project started in the two mountain districts of Mokhotlong and Qachas'nek
because it is generally believed that these districts were totally neglected by the previous
governments yet they are the ones contributing to the general growth of the country's
economy. The largest population of improved livestock is concentrated in these mountain
regions and their proper management could lead to the achievement of the major objective of
the project. They (the two districts) offered a lot of challenges to the project., e.g., poor
infrastructure, whose improvement could be a big achievement.
Starting in a district where everything was already working smoothly would still
require a "test district" like the ones chosen. Otherwise, one could conclude that the project
succeeded not because it was good but because every project has a high probability of
success in that district and which could be attributable to external forces other than project
design itself.
A district which has a combination of lowlands and highlands which could have
provided the contrast we are looking for, Mohales Hoek, was rejected by MOA for the reason
that they had too many projects which were already partially addressing similar objectives as
those of LMCP in that district. We had to withdraw our DPO from there.



-40-
The implied personal interest of some officials in the two districts cannot be proved
and leaving it out will not affect the quality of the report.
We do not remember the choice of these districts as having been a subject of dispute
to the extent that one had to insist on the choice. The only thing that may hold as an
argument is that there were no clearly set out criteria for the choice of the districts/areas to be
regarded as ideal for the project activities.
Focus on Conservation
Before the village was moved into, the project idea was sold and it was upon interest
shown, an understanding of the project concept established and an expressed commitment of
the villages to the project idea that the village would be included in the list of beneficiaries.
The fact that the activities ultimately undertaken had nothing to do with land
management and conservation was a result of the termination of the project and the time
within which the projects were initiated had to be completed. The villagers could only
implement those activities that could be completed within "six months." It was also agreed
that while it was not a fault of the villagers that there was no progress and that they had their
hopes raised. They had been ready for a long time while the government seemed to be
dragging its feet, it was only fair to allow the villages to do the most they could in that period
hence projects like sewing, etc. were allowed to go through.
The suggestion that the LMCP could have been written as a Rural Management
Project could have certainly removed it from the specific focus that it was given. A broad
term like that usually creates problems for monitoring and evaluation as almost everything
qualifies while the too diversified direction results in minimal impact.
The main set-back in this regard was the time in office of the Development Councils.
The first two years were normally spent on training these councils, the third year (the last)
was when the results of the training could be expected. Unfortunately, a new set of
Development Council Members were elected. Nobody is to dictate to the people whom to
choose.
The project would once again train these fresh members and the process would
continue as before. The time in office of these local government members should have been
extended especially when these were determining the success of L.M.C.P.
Other Problems Experienced by the L.M.C.P.
Staffing
We are not aware of a Lesotho National who was readily available and qualified to do
the job that was done by the Facilitator/Trainer, who left prematurely. It would not have



-41-
made sense to us if this had been the case to have attempted to recruit internationally, which
we did.
The lack of adequate knowledge by the Senior Accountant to handle the finances
adequately had been addressed through several in-house training sessions given by the World
Bank. It only became apparent that the lady was "untrainable" and "uncooperative" towards
the closure of the project when her replacement would not have benefited anybody as the
handing over process and the training of a new person was certainly not going to answer the
problem before the wrap-up of the project.
The given model would still not have been possible even if the local government had
been strengthened. The central government should be the middleman between the donor and
the local authorities. The central government is accountable for all the loans signed on behalf
of the nation since in the final analysis these loans are to be paid back oy the nation not a
particular district community. The idea behind involving the government in implementing
such projects was to assist the communities to gain maximum benefits from the loan. The
L.M.C.P. approach of strengthening and giving the communities and other decentralization
structures more power once the other stages had been passed, with GOL having a monitoring
role on these structures, is still the best.

have been undertaken have either failed completely or have borne minimal benefits. Some
arguments used to explain why this happened are that most often the development plans were
too ambitious and were always not based on people's needs and aspirations. The wonderful
visions, which the planners created and presented in impressive documents were thus seldom
translated into reality. The ideas about self-government, decentralization and participation of
local communities in development are the result of the sad experiences drawn from the era
immediately after independence.
Ideas about decentralization are today not only viewed as an attempt to "de-concentrate"
government, but also as a necessary step towards the "devolution of power" which is one of
the cracial elements of democracy. In its ideal, it would mean getting the communities at the
lower levels to identify their own needs and potential and developing guidelines for
prioritizing those needs and then working out strategies for meeting them. In this approach,
the professional planner becomes the coordinator assisting people to come up with their own
plans and helping them to translate those plans into development activities.
The approach described above is the one that many donors would buy today. A number of
governments in Africa are also beginning to w elcome the need for involving local
populations in development planning. Therefore, it could be agreed that the LMCP did not
come out as an odd project by adopting this kind of attitude. However, being a new idea, the
approach which the LMCP proposed required careful implementation strategies which would
successfully mobilize the communities and also keep the public servants acting as catalysts.
All these efforts would have led to autonomous development in the villages and districts.
The results presented in this report indicate that the approach is in several respects ahead of
times. Examining circumstances that were prevailing both at the ministerial level and among
the communities at the village level, it is now obvious that it was a misconception to have
expected instant results. The approach demands more patience than the planners are
normally able to command. Perhaps our democracy is also still too young for us to
appreciate fully the demands of the participatory approach. However, it remains the reason

for optimism. The decentralization of government administration would go a long way
towards changing the perception of the rural population in Lesotho.
There is a lot we can learn from the LMCP. In many cases, village communities are able to
plan their future more especially when they are provided with the institutional, technical and
intellectual support they require. Communities may never become active participants in the
planning process unless planning can be made a component of their philosophy. What needs
to be examined is how far the coordinators and extension workers sent out by the
Government of Lesotho were able to achieve this.
This report is divided into several parts the contents of which are described in detail under the
Methodology section which appears at the end of the report as APPENDIX I. The main
headings under which the results are presented are as follows:

The success of any project based on the participatory approach would depend highly on
whether planners and villagers speak and understand the principles of the approach in the
same manner. They must agree on the meaning of important concepts and terms built into
the approach. The philosophy of the participatory approach demands that the villagers must
become the actors, while the planners must act as catalysts. The authors strongly believe that
in the long term, only the participatory approach will be able to mobilize the wealth of
original ideas of the local population and promote real development in the country as a
whole.
THE PROJECT OBJECTIVES
BRIEF SUMMARY OF PROJECT OBJECTIVES
The Land Management and Conservation Project (LMCP) had the following major
objectives:
i]    To improve land management by curbing soil erosion and other resource
deterioration in order to improve agricultural productivity. The major focus was mainly on
land related activities whose ultimate purpose was to bring about the rehabilitation and
maintenance of resources such as the soil itself, range and water. Planting of trees and grass,



-44-
building dams and water-tanks for watering, Range Management and establishment of
communal gardens were to be some of the activities.
ii]   To strengthen the local structures such as the Village Development Councils
(VDCs) and the District Development Councils (DDCs) so that they could be able to prepare
and execute basic land resource management programs for their communities.
The project aimed at promoting grassroots participation by decentralizing activities to
these local structures. As a means of bringing about the critical capacity building at the
grassroots level, the councils were to receive relevant basic training that would enable them
to mobilize communities into identifying and prioritizing needs and working out appropriate
simple resource management activities and programs, executing them and ensuring their
maintenance and sustainability.
In addition to strengthening the "official" local structures, the project wished to
ensure that the communities actually regarded the LMCPfacilitated programs and activities
as their own and that they had to take the responsibility to protect and generally take care of
them. Consequently, there was no "FOOD FOR WORK" component which had been the
common feature in most of the earlier donor funded projects.
iii]   To support land policy implementation. This was somewhat a long term
objective.
These were the stated goals of the LMCP. Many government officials believed that
they were well written and clear. The Ministry of Home Affairs and the Ministry of
Agriculture (MOA) of the Government of Lesotho were to be critical in providing the
necessary logistical support and expertise that would ensure the successful implementation of
the project.
1.    PERCEPTIONS AND UNDERSTANDING OF THE OBJECTIVES
al    The Government Officials.
The MOA officials saw the LMCP as a duplication of what they were already
doing i.e. promotion of conservation of soil and other resources. Their attitudes and
perceptions of the project objectives seem to have been affected adversely by the fact that
while they had the expertise, their efforts at implementation often got frustrated by the fact
that they did not have control over the funds. As a result, they were not readily and
timeously available as and when they were needed.
On the other hand, the Ministry of Home Affairs officials saw this as a
legitimate arrangement since the VDCs and the DDCs whose capacity the LMCP sought to
promote and develop were their responsibility. To them the most important objective as to
help these Councils develop to the level and extent that these could be improved and more
efficient local government that would manage resources at the local level and mobilize
communities into voluntary involvement in development initiatives without expecting any
pay whether in cash or kind.



-45-
b]    The VDC members and other members of the Community.
1.    Since the committees were already involved in resource conservation
activities initiated by the MOA, they understood the objective of the LMCP in this regard. In
other words, the principle and idea of conservation was well received.
2.    The objective of enhancing the capacity of the development councils
so that they could clearly run their own affairs was also equally well received. However, the
members found it somewhat difficult to actually outgrow the condition where they would be
entirely independent and take decisions on their own because of their familiarity with the
extension service that tended to guide and "carry them along" as it were.
III. THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE PROJECT OBJECTIVES WERE
REALISTIC:
a]    Official opinion
At the technical specialist level, the objectives that dealt with resources
conservation seemed to have been realistic particularly for the MOA.
For the Ministry of Home Affairs, on the other hand, the objectives were a bit
unrealistic because of lack of technical expertise in the areas in which the Development
Councils whose capacity it sought to develop were to independently operate.
The Ministry's authority over control of funds was not by itself going to
ensure the realization of the objectives set by the project.
b]    The VDCs opinion
Members of the development councils felt that even with the training they
had, they still needed a lot of logistical and other support from the government officials.
Their capacity to manage and take independent decisions on matters relating to the project
activities left a lot to be desired. So, in this regard, the objectives had been somewhat
overambitious and unrealistic.
Because of the long tradition of development projects that have rewarded
participating members of the community with "Food" or "Cash", people expect the same
benefit out of all projects. The most immediate pressing needs in the families force people to
settle for activities that promise immediate pay offs or rewards. Consequently project
activities such as the LMCP's whose benefits would be realized only in the long term turn
people off. They need food and or cash NOWto address their needs. The LMCP's objective
of having people work "For Nothing" somewhat distanced itself from the realities on the
ground. No component of "Food For Work" in poor rural villages where people are hungry
and unemployed was seen as very unrealistic. There was not much that attracted people to
participate.
The LMCP emphasized that people should do things for themselves and perhaps, not
even engage expert personnel in the building of offices for the VDCs or on the road



-46-
construction activities. The intention was to use labor intensive approaches. Yet it was
obvious, as in one major case of the VDC office we saw at Ha Mosuoe in Qacha's Nek
district, that had an expert builder been hired to do the job, the building would not be falling
apart as it now is even before it is complete or properly in use. Again in the same area, the
community has not been able to proceed with the road project. The major reason advanced
by both the government district level officials and the community is that some technical
expertise is necessary to break up the hard rock on the mountain side before people can come
in with hammers, picks and spades to level it all out and build strong walls on the sides. The
LMCP's failure to accommodate this has left the people with a resentful feeling that they
were let down. This is regarded as one of the unrealistic conditions of the project which has
only served to frustrate people.
When LMCP decided that it would use labor intensive approaches in getting the
communities involved, it would have been expected of the planners to remember that in the
majority of the rural villages in Lesotho, only old,sickly or retired men can be found. The
majority of the home-based human resource are Women who, in most cases, are not
physically capable of undertaking too heavy manual work such as knocking down a hard
rock. Strong healthy men are gone to the mines in South Africa or other urban areas in the
country to seek paid employment so that they can support families back home. This is one of
the major factors that project planners often seem to ignore.
It was unrealistic of the project plan to expect the VDCs to assume the entire
responsibility for the implementation of the project activities. This point is made in the light
of the fact that VDCs life span was very short since members were elected for a tenure of
three years after which new councils would be elected. Often the membership changed; thus
causing the Council to lose people who had already undergone training. The result was a
lapse in some VDC's capability to go on with the job as new untrained members joined them.
It has generally been expressed by the officials and the VDC members themselves that the
training provided was not even intensive enough. They felt that there had to be more
continuous or regular and rigorous training activities provided over the different phases of
the project. Given that the VDCs are voluntary and popularly elected, and also given their
doubtful quality, in terms of capabilities to read and write, engage in fund raising, keeping
correct financial and other records and their legal power to generally manage community
affairs to the extent that they can impose levies, the project expectations have proved to have
been too high and beyond their capability levels.
The same observation can be made of the chiefs who, in all cases, served as
chairpersons of the VDCs. They had a heavier mandate than they could carry. Most of them
have similar short comings as those outlined above in respect of the VDCs. The chiefs
cannot control the people. It was even suggested during the interviews that the chiefs should
be given more of basic leadership and "management" skills training. They perceived
themselves and were perceived by other people as being very vulnerable because the
communities and the VDCs are highly politicized. Consequently chiefs can no longer
impose control like they used to in the past. Perhaps they also find it difficult to adjust to the
changes that have caused the people's voice to be stronger.



-47-
One of the major objectives was to promote unity among the people so that they could
work together in the project activities. But the LMCP experience shows that because of the
failure of the local structures such as the VDCs to successfully mobilize people into action,
individual projects succeed at the expense of the group activities. A clear case was related to
the communal gardens where participating villagers have individual plots and plots that
belong to all of them. Vegetables seem to be thriving more on the individual plots.
Timing has also been one of the issues that has cast doubt on whether the objectives
of the project were realistic or not. People in rural villages engage in seasonal activities such
as ploughing the fields, sowing, weeding and harvesting. During these periods each person
concentrates on matters that affect his/her individual household. As a result the level of
commitment to join community activities comes down a bit, and some of the intended or
already running projects suffer.
To conclude this section, it could be mentioned that much as in the "twilight" of the
project's life, communities were asked to submit their needs, the initial project plans had no
input whatsoever from the communities. Consequently the objectives tended not to be
realistic as people were expected to implement other people's ideas entirely on their own.
ACHIEVEMENT OF PROJECT OBJECTIVES
The project has minimally achieved its objectives. The only activities which have
been achieved are those which neatly phased into what the MOA was already doing i.e. the
soil conservation measures through tree planting: Trees have been planted on the mountain
slopes. In some areas the fruit trees have thrived while in others very few have survived.
Some have been eaten by animals or just dried up and died in the process of being delivered.
The other items secured under the project, as will be shown in the next table were
incidental items which were not part of the initial objectives. They got secured when
everybody realized that time was running out and the bulk of the funds would have not been
used up when the project wound up. However, these "incidental items" are the ones which
were requested by the communities when they were asked to indicate their needs.
Capacity building among the VDC members has equally failed for reasons such as
that from the beginning, most members were illiterate and the training provided could not
have much effect: secondly, the VDC's did not seem to regain the control they used to have
over communities to get them to do things. They seem not to have been able to mobilize
them into voluntary action for development. People have on the whole not liked the idea of
working for "nothing". For them the project activities were seen to be the potential for jobs
that would pay in cash or kind to enable people to solve the immediate problems of hunger
and disease.

THE PROJECT SECURED ITEMS THAT WE SAW IN THE VILLAGE
DISTRICT          VILLAGE            ITEMS SECURED
Mokhotlong        Motsitseng         Scotch-cart, two knitting machines, two sewing
machines, three Rams, Fruit trees other types of
trees, a small bridge.
Sekoka            Two sewing machines, two knitting machines,
Fruit trees, other types of trees.
Phahameng         Scotch-cart, Poultry, Fruit trees, other types of
trees, Rams, sewing and knitting machines.
Makhabane's       Scotch-cart, Rams, Fruit trees, other types of
trees, sewing and knitting machines.
Qacha's Nek       Ts'episo          An Office building, fruit trees, other types of
trees, fencing for the communal orchard, water
tanks, incomplete road.
Mosuoe            Fencing for the communal vegetable garden,
water tanks, seeds, watering cans, wheel-
barrows, spades, an office building and
furniture.
In the above table, Tree Planting to curb soil erosion had been part of the project plan. The
trees are still young. They have not yet yielded any fruits or wood as such. But it can be
concluded that those trees planted on the mountain slopes are helping to hold the soil together
thereby contributing to curbing soil erosion.
Rams:
These have been sold and money deposited in the village account book. It was
indicated in some cases that this money would be used to purchase more rams to sell to
interested farmers on request.
In one village in Mokhotlong (Motsitseng) the Rams are kept and used by farmers to
improve their livestock.
Knitting and sewing machines:



-49-
This equipment is kept by the VDCs at the chief's place. It was only in one case at
Sekoka in Mokhotlong where the machines have been taken away by the SMS. On the
whole, the machines are not in use because the villagers are yet to be taught how to use them.
They are expecting the Home Economists/Nutritionists based in the areas to give them
training. But this has not been possible. The SMSs seem to be more interested in organized
Woman's groups.
Women at Motsitseng in Mokhotlong are knitting jerseys that parents buy for children
as school uniform.
The scotch-carts:
In almost all cases the reason for buying the scotch-carts was to assist the villagers to
transport their crops from the fields and to carry fertilizers into the fields. In some villages
these are being rented out and charges are determined by the villagers themselves. The
money collected is saved in the village's bank account. In one case, the villagers were
refusing to pay for the use of the scotch-cart arguing that it has been given free by the "World
Bank" and they should just use it without paying.
The Poultry (Layers):
In the one village where there are chickens, the already existing Poultry Association
has taken over the care and the use of the Poultry - under contract. The eggs are sold in the
village and in the nearby district administrative center. The major problem is that of
transporting the eggs to this center. The villagers use the scotch-cart to carry the eggs on a
very rugged road. They incur a loss through breakage.
It was explained that as soon as the association had made enough profit, some money
would be paid into the village bank account in order to finance other development projects.
The Communal gardens:
These are common in the Qacha's Nek district. Because of the Water-tanks that have
been built near the gardens, the vegetables are thriving because there is enough water.
Fencing has also protected the vegetables and fruit trees from being destroyed by animals.
Villagers get fresh supply of vegetables from these gardens, they sell the surplus to
other members of the community who are not active participants in the communal garden
schemes. Sometimes the MOA SMS help transport some to the district administrative center
or even interest the nearby high schools to come and buy vegetables to feed the students.
Smooth marketing of the produce still remains the major problem. Other non-participating
villagers steal the vegetables and destroy the fencing. The garden equipment is being put to
good use.
Office building and Furniture:
These have been built at Mosuoe's and Ts'episo's. The one at Ha Mosuoe is already
falling apart. All the walls have such wide gaping cracks that the whole structure is better off



-50-
knocked down before it collapses on the VDC members holding meetings in the building.
The "Dining room suite" which has been purchased is not appropriate furniture for an office:
neither is the thick mat which is lying rolled up in some corner of the office. At Ts'episo's,
the office has been built on somebody's site. A dispute might ensue.
These offices are useful in that they have provided proper meeting places for the
VDCs who otherwise had to just sit outside in the rain or hot sun. It was reported that the
chiefs also use them in their day to day administration since they otherwise had to work from
their own homes.
Incomplete Road:
In Qacha's Nek some funds had been made available to support construction of a road
by the villagers. This project was not completed because some heavier equipment was
necessary to knock down the hard rock first before people could work with picks and spades.
When funds were not forthcoming the whole project was abandoned. By way of a comment,
it could be said that items such as the scotch-carts, trees of all types, communal garden and
water tanks and garden equipment have somehow contributed to minimally improve the lives
of the people concerned. But the extent of the impact is very difficult to establish.
Finally, we should mention the facilities that have been provided by the project for
the government officials. These include:
1.    Office building in Mokhotlong and Qacha's Nek. They are being put to good
use by the government officials, and have help ease "congestion" in the offices.
2.    Residential houses in both districts: Again these have helped address the
chronic problem of shortage of housing for the government officials. The unfortunate thing
is that some of these structures are not yet complete (in Qacha's Nek) and they seem to be
neglected.
3.    Vehicles: The project has left quite a good number of these vehicles which
have minimized transport problems and made it possible for the officers to reach the villages
and provide the necessary assistance.
Even so, it did emerge during the Interviews that sometimes officials hoard the
vehicles and refuse others permission to use them even for project related activities. The
researchers feel that this is just a matter of poor management and could be improved with
some proper managerial effort by the supervisors.
IMPLEMENTATION RECORD
In general, the implementation record of the LMCP has been described by the beneficiaries as
not a very good one. It was very slow, and the time factor seems to be the most prominent
factor, among the many others, which affected the project.



-51 -
1.    GOVERNMENT LEVEL
Within government circles the project was accepted as a very good one. Its focus on
land oriented activities was acceptable to everyone. The selection of project areas was
considered generally satisfactory, however, their distance from the center (Maseru) was
questioned by some government officials. For example, selecting Mokhotlong as one of the
project areas proved acceptable because the District had not benefited from many other
earlier development projects and also because soil erosion has affected the land badly taking
away all the top soil.
Discussions with various government officials especially those in the two involved
Ministries, Agriculture and Home Affairs, reveal that there were extreme delays in
implementing the project. In their opinion, this is the main reason which caused the project
to subsequently drift from its stated goals. In the end, the project appears to have
implemented activities that were no longer land use based because the project time was
running out.
Several factors at the government level appear to have affected the project and how it
performed in implementing its objectives. The most outstanding ones are the Interministerial
conflicts, highly centralized and deeply authoritarian system of government and the elitist
approach of governnent officials and professionals to planning, poor conceptual
understanding of the public participation process in a project, lack of cooperation among key
role players in the two implementing ministries from central level (Maseru) to District level
and lack of preparedness on the part of government officials.
1.1 INTERMINISTERIAL CONFLICTS AND STRUGGLE OVER
CONTROL
It seems that it was a well recognized fact that while the Ministry of Home
Affairs had control over the administrative and financial aspects of the project, the expertise
to implement the project was concentrated in the Ministry of Agriculture. This is the major
factor that contributed to the conflicts and personal clashes between staff in the two
Ministries.
The decision to place the Ministry of Home Affairs in charge of the project
according to the government officials, was made based on past experience whereby many
projects in the Ministry of Agriculture had failed tremendously resulting in a lot of financial
losses. The idea of having the LMCP under the control of Home Affairs was from the
beginning not acceptable to the Ministry of Agriculture personnel. To them, Home Affairs
had accepted responsibility over a project which it would not be in a position to put into
effect. This produced a lot of suspicion, animosity, lack of cooperation and undermining of
each other's authority. Implementation of the LMCP activities got frustrated as a result of the
fight over 'who should be in charge'.
Several government officials seem to hold a strong view that the project
should not have involved two ministries and that it is this kind of arrangement that made
conflicts and differences in opinion unavoidable. Staff in the Ministry of Agriculture could



-52-
not appreciate why Home Affairs would go on to accept a loan agreement while there were
many donor grants intended for development activities. There is a strong feeling among
these officials that the Ministries in the Government of Lesotho cannot be expected to
cooperate because even in their structuring they were intended to act independent of one
another. The kind of cooperation that the LMCP was trying to encourage is still perceived as
a distant vision.
1.2 POOR CONCEPTUALIZATION OF PUBLIC PARTICIPATION IN
PROJECT PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION
The majority of the key informants who were interviewed cited a number of
problem areas which confronted the professionals and decision-makers in government in
initiating and sustaining the participation of the beneficiary communities in the project. To
begin with, it became obvious during implementation that some government officials were
not clear of what roles they were to play and how far their roles stretched some ended up
carrying out responsibilities that were spelled out as the mandate of the VDCs and conflict
arose involving different role players.
From the verbal accounts of what actually took place on the ground, it is
apparent that the participation of the communities came rather late in the stages of the
project. In selecting the project sites, for instance, the communities were not involved. The
project made use of the Land Use Planning Areas already designed by the Ministry of
Agriculture personnel based on their own interests. Because of this, in one instance in
Mokhotlong, part of the village of Motsitseng was left out of the project yet the VDC itself
consisted of members from that same part of the village. In other words, the Land Use
Planning Areas failed to realize the central role that the VDCs were designed to play in the
LMCP. This further complicated efforts made to mobilize and solicit the people's
cooperation.
In addition, government officials have over a long period of time been used to
doing things on behalf of the communities. The expectation under the LMCP that they
would have to provide only guidance and advice to communities involved in LMCP activities
was not very clear to them. Those interviewed mentioned that for them to grasp the idea of
"community participation" more vividly, some training would be required. They further
indicated that in implementing the LMCP it became clear that even as government officials
they held different notion of what the concept means.
1.3 ORGANIZATIONAL FACTORS AND PROJECT PERSONNEL
Another kind of factor that affected the project implementation was the long
chain of command from the lowest level of the planning exercise, that is the community in
the concerned villages, through the VDCs, the DDCs, the Interministerial Review
Committee, to the highest level which is the World Bank. Things took too long before they
could be approved and the people's expectations were frustrated.
The LMCP was slow to implement its plans. The fact that the project had not
employed its own personnel means that the personnel already charged with other duties both



-53-
at the central level in Maseru and in at the District level in Mokhotlong and Qacha's Nek had
to carry additional workload because of activities of the LMCP. Preparations for this were
not made well in advance and for quite some time a lot of things remained bleak. For
example, the posting of District Planning Officers (DPOs) to Mokhotlong and Qacha's Nek
were not done timeously. Worse still these officers found that housing, office space,
transport and other job requirements were not yet in place when they finally got to the
Districts. For some time, therefore, they had to share office space, share transport with the
District Secretaries, a facility which was also used by the Principal Chief as well.
No arrangement had been made for anyone at the district level to receive the
DPOs. In Mokhotlong the DS was too busy and could not give time to the project. People
had different understandings of the role of the DPOs. One consultant had described them as
an "eye of the project" at District level which understandably made other government officers
look upon them with a lot of suspicion. No one had given a thorough explanation to the
officers already functioning at District level of what the role of the DPOs would be and how
it would relate to what they were already doing. The DPOs were employed on the basis of
terms set by the Ministry of Planning and only attended to the LMCP business when other
ordinary planning duties in the District where they were placed had been attended to.
The relationships of the DPOs and staff of the MOA were not harmonious
ones. The feeling of the majority of the MOA personnel was that their Ministry had rejected
the project, therefore, they had nothing to do with it. Even the project facilitator, Robin
James, could not resolve these conflicts. The main issue still revolved on why Home Affairs
had been put in charge with the responsibility over project funds. The relationships even at
District level were very tense and according to many key informants and other respondents
they filtered up to the village level and to some extent were used to create certain kinds of
attitudes about the project among the beneficiaries. Suspicion reigned, to an extent that
DAOs and DPOs did not seem to see eye to eye and relationships remained sour for most of
the project duration.
2.    VILLAGE LEVEL
2.1   PROLIFERATION OF DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS IN THE
PROJECT AREAS AND THE SURROUNDING VILLAGES
As the LMCP was being implemented, there were several other development
activities going on in the very same Land Use Planning Areas or in nearby villages. Some
were the Ministry of Agriculture projects e.g. forestry and other conservation activities, some
were Water Supply activities, some even rural development activities under the Ministry of
Home Affairs. These various projects adopted different approaches and were guided by
different policies. The most significant one which affected the implementation of the LMCP
was the "food for work" approach adopted by many of these other development projects.
The LMCP approach endeavored to encourage the beneficiaries to do things
for themselves in the name of development. The beneficiaries would be strengthened
otherwise and be given expert support, but they would get no pay in kind or cash for
activities performed under the project. From discussions with beneficiaries, this message



-54-
seemed to have been transmitted to them quite effectively. However, confusion began to
emerge as the other projects continued to give some things of immediate benefit to those
people who engaged in activities under their auspices. People began to make demands for
similar kinds of benefits from the LMCP. The construction of the Road at Ha Ts'episo in
Qacha's Nek is one of the LMCP activities which suffered due to this kind of expectation.
People insisted they wanted to earn something for the work done on the road.
From the discussions with the beneficiaries, particularly in Mokhotlong, it
became apparent that the people could not draw a clear-cut distinction between activities that
fell under the scope of the LMCP and those that belonged to other projects. This led to a lot
of suspicion and confused efforts towards ensuring the success of the LMCP. As some
government officers were involved in both the LMCP and project activities, this kind of
confusion could not be easily avoided. LMCP became associated with the individual DPOs
in the two districts.
2.2   POLITICAL CLEAVAGES
One of the difficult realities that the LMCP had to live with and which
affected its implementation is the divisions of village people along political lines. Both the
government officers operating at the District level and the beneficiaries themselves admitted
the existence of intense political cleavages in the villages and spoke of how they affect
involvement of the people in various activities.
It was admitted by various categories of respondents that this is a long
standing phenomenon. For a long time, it has been recognized that, for instance, the VDCs
have been highly politicized. That the majority of their membership were supporters of the
former BNP Government. The coming into power of the BCP Government in 1993 shook
the roots of these councils as BCP members wanted to take control over these local
structures. This has resulted in serious tensions in the villages and also has contributed to
feelings of fear, insecurity and helplessness on the part of the BNP supporters who are still
serving on these councils. The LMCP had to compete with the changing face of government
in Lesotho and the move towards democratic rule. In this sense too, the timing of the LMCP
was considered not proper.
In several villages, for example at Motsitseng - Phahameng there have been
attempts to get BCP supporters onto the membership of the councils. In Mokhotlong, it was
reported that BCP supporters ("Makalana a BCP") are recruited to work in the "food for
work" projects to the exclusion of the BNP supporters and this is being done outside the
knowledge of the chiefs and the VDCs. In some instances, the people are actually being paid
cash on a monthly basis for engaging in these project activities. This has embittered many
people and this is the kind of political climate in which the LMCP is said to have survived
with great difficulty. The project came at the wrong time when preparations for elections
were under way some politicians used the project to entice their followers claiming it would
offer them employment. When the project did not pay them, they went on to complain to the
politicians. This led to further confusion.



-55-
The political tensions are reported to be worse in villages where chiefs
proceeded to show their true political inclinations thus forgetting the commitment they have
to serving all members of their communities regardless of their political affiliations.
Generally, people at village level cannot draw a line of demarcation between development
and politics. Political party membership has come to dominate various aspects of the
people's lives and it is a phenomenon that has to be grappled with if villagers are to be
expected to cooperate with one another.
2.3   DEPENDENCY SYNDROME
For a long time, projects carried out development activities for the
communities and nothing much was done to encourage beneficiaries to get to do things for
themselves. People have become so dependent that the approach suggested by the LMCP
was not easy to sustain.
The Subject Matter Specialists in Qacha's Nek described how difficult they
found working with people at Ha Mosuoe and Ha Ts'episo. They spoke of how difficult it
was to get the people organized and to mobilize them to cooperate with one another.
According to the SMSs, communities got used to working for "Liphallelo" (mainly "food for
work") over a long period of time. For them this represents an easy way out of their difficult
life situation. Therefore, they find the idea of working for nothing quite unacceptable. A lot
of effort, education would be needed to conscientize people to do things for themselves and
to get them out of this present habit of dependency.
According to many respondents the dependency syndrome in the villages is
quite entrenched. Many people want to be employed in the formal sense. The idea of self-
employment is far fetched for the majority of the people. Because of this dependency
syndrome, even asking people about what their needs are was a problem let alone asking
them to prioritize them once the needs had been identified. People would agree on doing
certain things on a particular day and come up with a different list of needs the next day.
This consumed a lot of time and project implementation was delayed. Beneficiaries were not
always available. They sometimes had no time for the project activities. For example, they
became unavailable during ploughing and in winter during the harvesting seasons.
3.    VDC LEVEL
The success of the LMCP objectives would have required the establishment of strong
local structures which are representative of the communities so that they would be
accountable to the people. The question that arises is whether the VDCs in their present form
could be seen to have these kind of qualities.
3.1 CHAIRMANSHIP OF VDCs.
The data collected for the study reveal that, in the first instance, the
Chairmanship of the VDCs in the name of Chieftaincy lacks the necessary leadership skills.
As a results the chiefs had often sought to monopolize local affairs and development



-56-
resources to the exclusion of groups of people who did not fall in their favor. This served to
divide the villages even more.
3.2 THE CALIBRE OF VDC MEMBERS.
The other issues raised by respondents concern the rest of the VDC
membership. One of the main issues raised relates the capacity the VDCs have to carry out
some of the responsibilities expected of them. The general feeling is that VDCs are too weak
in the sense that the CALIBRE of their membership is poor, lacking, in several cases, even
the basic skills of numeracy and literacy. This of course hampered their role performance,
for instance, the capacity to raise finance and revenue and to keep appropriate records. The
fact that VDCs are highly politicized weakened their position further as they ended up
serving and working only with the factions of villagers who shared similar political views
with them to the exclusion of others.
The present VDCs appear intensely insecure. First, because they were
predominantly BNP so that they felt they did not have the support of the new Government
which is BCP. Secondly, because their term had run out, the VDCs felt they were not
standing on solid ground to pursue any further development activities. We sensed a lot of
tensions between villagers and VDCs especially in places where BCP members seemed to
form the majority.
ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOMES
This section focuses on how well the objectives of the project were achieved and on the
status of the achievements made.
1.    PROJECT ACHIEVEMENTS
il    Training:
The main objective of this training was to enhance the capacity of the
development councils so that they could be able to manage and take independent decisions on
matters relating to the project. Almost all VDC members had the opportunity to participate
in the training activities organized by the LDTC. However, because of the staggered
structure of the training programs as a result of which it never was a continuous activity, the
majority of participants were not able to attend all the time. This, in a way, does explain why
its impact has not been much felt. During the interviews, it did emerge that the majority of
the VDC members still did not feel confident to be on their own. They still were desperate
for the official support and guidance of the extension officers.
ii]   Structures and equipment:
Mention and comments have already been made of the structures or buildings
put up with the support of the LMCP funds in part B of this report.



-57-
These structures include:
a]    Office buildings for government officials in both districts, and office
buildings for VDCs in Qacha's Nek.
The Researchers also noted some office furniture for the VDC office at
Ha Mosuoe in Qacha's Nek was not appropriate office furniture since a Lounge Suite was
purchased.
b]    Residential houses for government officials in both districts: In
Qacha's Nek one of these houses is not complete. The rafters are rotting due to exposure to
weather hazards. The headquarters in Maseru was not aware of this condition because the
district-based officers were not reporting on progress.
iii]   Vehicles:
The Vehicles acquired through the project prove useful in facilitating travel
for officers and chiefs as they go about the activities of the project, within the project areas.
The vehicles are also being used to help other officers in carrying out government
assignments which are not necessarily related to the project.
iv]   Sewing and Knitting Machines:
These have been bought in the Mokhotlong villages such as Motsitseng -
where they are being put to good use by the Woman as they produce and sell jerseys and
dresses to school children as uniforms. But in other villages such as Sekoka, Ha Makhabane
and Phahameng the machines are not being used. The villagers are waiting to be taught how
to use them by the SMS (Home Economist). From the interviews it did emerge that the SMS
tends to be more ready to assist "organized" Women's groups rather than work with
individual women. In one case at Sekoka, the SMS was reported to have kept the machines
at her house without the permission of the VDC. In this type of a situation people are not
benefiting from the equipment acquired.
v]    The Scotch-carts:
Again these have only been acquired in the Mokhotlong villages. Where they
are used, people are able to transport grain from the fields and take fertilizers and seeds to the
fields during the ploughing season. Some villagers hire the scotch-carts to transport sand,
stones, cement and bricks needed for building houses. The carts are also used as
"Ambulances" to transport very sick people, who can neither walk nor ride on horseback, to
get to the hospital.
As already pointed out, the carts are hired out with the purpose of raising
funds that are channeled into financing other development activities. Minimal charges are
paid. There was however, one case - Ha Makhabane where the cart is not in use because the
villagers are not willing to pay for its use. They are reported to argue that the cart is a free
gift from the donors and they are not supposed to pay anything.



-58-
vil   The Communal vegetable and fruit gardens:
These are mainly thriving in Qacha's Nek. Their success could also be
attributable to the fact that Water-tanks have also been constructed to provide water for
watering the vegetables.
vii]   Other Types of Trees:
The other types of trees planted on the hill sides are thriving in spite of the
bad weather. If they continue to be protected as they are now, the villagers stand to get some
fire-wood and the trees would somehow check on soil erosion. On curbing soil erosion, yes,
there is a potential because the trees are still small. But already grass is growing and the
dongas are beginning to be covered. But in Mokhotlong the impact might take longer to
show since the mountain sides on which the trees are planted already show bare stones. All
the top soil has been washed away.
viii] The Rams bought in Mokhotlong have helped improve the quality of the
sheep. Some villages have sold them off to get money for the VDCs to cater for other
development activities.
ix]   The Layers are also proving to be a success story at Phahameng in
Mokhotlong. People are able to get additional funds from the sales, and families car. provide
their members with more nutritious food.
2.    INSTILLING WILLINGNESS FOR COOPERATIVE WORK
One of the major objectives was to instill the willingness for co-operative work
among the members of the community. Villagers were to be encouraged to get involved in
development activities without expecting any payment. In the majority of cases this has not
succeeded. On the whole the culture of working for food or cash is still very strong. Perhaps
this has been nurtured for too long by the pre-ious development projects.
TRAINING
a]    Purpose of Training
The Lesotho Distance Teaching Center (LDTC) trainers/tutors had first
discussed the objectives and agreed on the content with the LMCP. Therefore, the training
was conducted with these objectives in mind. The project management is reported to have
been flexible enough to accommodate suggestions.
The major purpose of the training was to promote capacity building among
members of the VDCs and DDCs, so that they could be able to perform the functions
expected of them as spelt out in the project objectives.
The content of the course/s included budgeting and simple book-keeping,
record keeping, planning, management of community resources and leadership.



-59-
b]    The Trainees
All the trainees were members of the VDCs and some also served on the
DDCs. The gender composition was balanced in favor of women: while the overall age
range was 25 years - 60 years. However, the majority of male and female trainees were in the
age range 30 years - 40 years. all the trainees were unemployed and either married or
widowed. One case of a single lady was cited during the interviews. The majority of men
serving on the committees were retired mine workers, while some were retired civil servants
or teachers. It is important to note that most of these trainees were illiterate.
cj    Mode of Delivery and Relevance
i]    Although some sessions were held in a few villages, the majority had
been conducted at the Farmers Training Centers in the District Admin:,trative Centers, and
one or two in Maseru.
ii]    They were mainly residential and took no more than 5 days.
iii]   The Trainers had used a variety of adult teaching methods: which were
determined on the basis of the nature of the group concerned. The methods included face-to-
face contacts, group discussions, brain-storming question and answer method, proving,
demonstrations and other relevant participatory approaches such as case studies.
iv]   Relevance: The idea of providing training to members of the
development councils was very significant. However, because, according to the trainers'
observation, it had not originated from the people themselves, it was not received with and
given consideration with all the seriousness it deserved. Much as it was obvious that training
was vital for the success of the project activities, the level of commitment of the participants
was always in question.
The content of the courses/sessions was most relevant.
v]    Usability: On the balance, those members who attended regularly and
grasped what was taught found the skills and knowledge most useful.
d]    Problems:
1.    Sometimes the LMCP personnel had given conflicting signals to the trainees
saying that some of the issues/examples raised or cited by the trainees were just illustrative
examples, and were not necessarily intended to be followed to the letter.
2.    Personality clashes among the VDC members and training caused people to
develop some negative attitudes towards the training itself. For instance, some chiefs had
viewed the "Leadership" component of the content negatively as in the process their own
deficiencies as leaders were being exposed to members of their VDCs who would later
question their leadership capabilities.



-60-
3.    There was too long a time lapse in between one training session and the next.
As a result, people tended to forget things that they were taught, such that trainers felt like
starting from the beginning every time they met.
4.    Irregular attendance of members affected the smooth running of the program.
It was often difficult to determine for certain the impact that the training was having on the
trainees. It was also reported that some husbands would not allow their wives to attend
regularly as they had to go away from home.
5.    The fact that the majority of the trainees were illiterate created problems in
that the trainers had to devise other means of teaching which illiterates could cope with.
Alternatively, they had to first start with teaching basic literacy skills before they actually
addressed the actual content of the course such as record keeping, book-keeping etc. This
process was disadvantaged by the limited time that trainers had with tl.e participants.
6.    Difficulty in reaching other most remote villages due to the terrain.
RECOMMENDATIONS
1.    Need to built in an Aspect of "Monitoring" in the program.
2.    Need for flexibility to allow for follow-up training activities as the LMCP
facilitated on the recommendation of the LDTC.
3.    Elect people who are literate to serve in the VDCs. This makes the process
easier since the trainers do not have to start from the level of utter ignorance.
4.    For as long as chiefs automatically become chairpersons of the VDCs, it
becomes imperative that they get intensive continuous training in leadership skills with
emphasis on Communication and human relations. As the traditionally accepted local
structure, chiefs and the useful role they can p!ay in facilitating for development activities are
a potential resource to be positively exploited. But they need to be supported with basic
relevant training.
PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
As illustrated earlier in the report, a huge part of what the LMCP achieved had nothing really
to do with its original focus on land management and conservation. Reference is being made
here to achievements such as the purchase of scotch-carts, knitting and sewing machines,
rams and layers. The same could be said of the construction of a culvert in Mokhotlong and
the construction of a road (partially completed) in Qacha's Nek. Of all the achievements of
the LMCP, only the communal gardens and fruit trees appeared to be relevant to the stated
project objectives.
The question whether whatever the project has been able to attain would be sustainable or not
is a relevant one. In the assessment of authors, the bulk of the LMCP achievements stand no
chance of being sustained. Several explanations can be advanced to support our contention.



-61-
These explanations arise both from what the authors saw of the achievements and also what
the respondents themselves said about the LMCP activities.
In the first instance, from the discussions with the people in the villages, it became obvious
that the LMCP was just one of those projects which came and go. Indeed, it has now packed
up and gone. In their perception, since the LMCP finances would no longer be forthcoming,
they were no longer in a position to tell what should happen next except, perhaps, await the
launch of yet another donor-funded project. This is the interpretation the authors are able to
make of the whole situation.
The "sense of ownership" of whatever the project has left the people is very difficult to trace.
In our minds, this is one of the elements the project should have been able to instill through
the participatory approach it had adopted. The project has not been able to leave the people
with a strong sense of identification with the outcomes reached.
Talking to the people, they sounded desperate. Some expressed feelings that the financial
support provided by the project should be continued for much longer. Perhaps this could be
explained in terms of the "dependency syndrome" which seems to prevail at the village level
as discussed earlier. The people have become used to seeing donor project after project. To
them this kind of assistance has got to continue forever. They have no aspiration to become
self-sufficient and economically independent.
OUTCOMES THAT COULD BE SUSTAINABLE
In the observations of the authors, only two outcomes of the project looked promising and
could be sustainable. This is because the people involved in them were still highly motivated
and committed to continue working on their activities.
1.  EGG PRODUCTION AT PHAHAMENG IN THE MOKHOTLONG
DISTRICT:
The first one of these activities is the poultry (layers) project at Phahameng which
seems to be doing well. The layers produce approximately 300 eggs per day. These are
marketed to business people and the hospital in the town of Mokhotlong. Some are sold in
the village, however, the market is generally too limited. The major problem that confronts
the project is the one of transportation. The LMCP scotch-cart is the one used to transport
eggs from the village to town. However, since the road is not smooth and the village is also
quite some distance from town, this mode is not at all convenient and several eggs usually get
damaged on the way. This reduces the profits that could be accumulated.
A local poultry society is in charge of this project at the moment. The money used to
purchase the layers, which was part of the LMCP funding, as arranged by the villagers is
being paid back into community coffers in installments so that the village-owned layers can
be bought thus giving other villagers the opportunity to also get involved in egg production
in the future. So far the project could be reported as a success story.



-62-
2.    VEGETABLE PRODUCTION AT HA MOSUOE IN THE QACHA'S NEK
DISTRICT:
Another project which seemed to be doing well is the fruit tree and vegetable gardens
at Ha Mosuoe. The women are the ones involved and they grow a variety of vegetables.
While the fruit trees seemed to have grown, they have not as yet become matured enough to
bear any fruit. The vegetables are the ones which looked fertile except that finding a market
was reported to be a major problem since they rely mainly on selling in the village and the
neighboring schools.
During the winter of 1994, the women mentioned that they had had a very good crop
of potatoes which they were able to sell at a good profit. Another problem that is now
confronting them is that of theft. Several times they have had thieves breaking in through the
fence at night to steal vegetables. Otherwise, the women felt that thei:- project could be
sustained.
3.    WOODLOT IN ALL VILLAGES IN THE PROJECT AREA:
The woodlot appeared to be well protected and according to villagers they have never
been destroyed with fire and animals are not allowed to graze where there are plantations. If
this continues, the woodlot could be counted among the successful activities especially
because the villagers recognize that the trees could provide firewood which they desperately
need.
UNSUCCESSFUL ACTIVITIES
The rest of the activities as detailed in PART B of the report cannot be sustained. The rams
as already reported earlier in the report are being sold to individuals who can afford. Due to
the rife stock theft, there is fear that the rams may be taken and no one wants to take
responsibility should that happen. In addition, some villagers pointed out that the rams
proved costly, and because they were supposcd to be communally owned, individuals were
not prepared to take the responsibility of feeding them.
Most of the sewing and knitting machines are lying unused. Either because the necessary
training has not been undertaken or because there is no agreement on who would have access
to the machines first. The most serious cause of concern is that, with the fast rate at which
technology changes, these machines will get outdated with time so that even spare parts
would not be easily available should they get broken. The equipment will also get rusty if it
stays unused. The same applied to the scotch-carts.
Above all, now that the project has phased out, the communities are no longer getting the
guidance of the government officials. The latter's attention is now focused on current
activities in areas where they are working. This threatens even the sustainability of those
activities which in the opinion of the authors look viable.



-63-
KEY LESSONS LEARNED
There are a number of positive and negative lessons that can be drawn from the LMCP
experience. As the Government of Lesotho (GOL) moves into a system of local government
which is intended to promote the ideals of democratic rule and enhance the implementation
of those ideals, some of these lessons will become highly pertinent.
1.    INTER-MINISTERIAL COOPERATION
The lack of cooperation between the two ministries responsible for the
implementation of the LMCP appears to have been one of the most serious problems which
the project was confronted with. This problem reflects the lack of appreciation on the part of
the ministries of the obligations they have to serve the communities. What appeared crucial
to them is their interest in who is wielding power between the two of them and not their duty
to service the communities.
Government would have to take upon itself to ensure that ministries are reminded of
their responsibilities to the people. This is the fundamental principle in a democracy - the
Government is a Government by the people and for the people. Only this kind of
understanding can ensure that public servants remain committed to projects intended to uplift
the standards of living of the people of Lesotho.
Providing separate budgets to the two ministries was suggested by some of the key
informants as a solution to the issues involved in this problem. However, in our minds, this
is not the real way out. The issue is that ministries ought to know that they are organs of
government which have to work together and cooperate. No single ministry should view
itself as totally autonomous or independent of all other ministries. For decentralization and
the success of local govermuent, the cooperation of all ministries will be highly crucial as
many projects demand a variety of expertise and skills. Perhaps Government has allowed
ministries to operate independent of one another for too long and if that is the case, the
situation would have to be redressed soon. The integrated approach to development as one
DS expressed requires the cooperation of all parties concerned.
2.    STRENGTH OF THE VDCs
For the future, the LMCP experience as unfolded in this report indicates that while
providing an enabling legislation would be necessary so that VDCs can have powers to
collect and deploy funds, it would also be vital to tighten criteria for selecting members to
serve on the VDCs. This criteria should include possession of literacy and numeracy skills.
These skills are critical to the VDC activities. In their present form and shape VDCs could
not have shouldered the responsibilities assigned to them under the LMCP's objective to
promote self-government at the local level.
The evidence from this study shows that VDCs are not capable of leading
communities in areas of development. Their membership is weak, highly politicized and
lacks direction. Communities and public servants appear not to have trust in the VDCs and
are not impressed by their performance. Some chiefs have dominated the VDCs and in some



-64-
cases VDCs have been misdirected by the chiefs to render discriminatory service to the
people along political affiliation.
Evidence also shows that people, VDCs, Chiefs and public servants do not have
sufficient information not only about thc powers and functions of VDCs, but also about the
place of these structures in relation to government hence the ensuing suspicion from various
fronts and the lack of public support for the VDCs.
To change this current situation a lot of civil education campaign would have to be
conducted. This could go along side efforts to improve legislation regarding the election of
VDCs, nomination of office bearers, powers of VDCs and so on. People should be informed
of what the VDCs or their equivalent under the local government system are for, how they
are intended to operate and assist the people at the community level. Information should also
be provided on the relationship of VDCs and DDCs to already existing government structures
both at the District and national levels. This kind of information appears not to be accessible
at the moment. Opinions were expressed that while there are already talks about local
government, the people had not been informed and got educated enough to understand
exactly what local government is and what is expected of them to ensure its success.
The tenure of office for VDCs as stipulated in the present legislature which is three
years is considered inadequate. It is too short to carry through any activity that might be
planned. This would also have to be revisited. A lot of time was lost through regular change
of VDC membership. LDTC had to train afresh in several cases and lists of needs and
priorities seemed to change with changes in VDC membership.
3.    PILOTING PROJECTS
The ideas of self-government, decentralization at local level and community
participation remain very good ones. On the basis of the data collected for this study, these
ideas appear to be generally acceptable and to command the support of the people
interviewed. But it also appears that the ideas remain a challenge because the communities
are not accustomed to participating in making their own development decisions and
executing them. In the long history of the country's independence, they have never been
given a real chance to exercise such powers. On the contrary decisions were made and
implemented on their behalf.
This whole approach of community participation is also entirely new to the public
servants who have always approached communities with complete designed projects. They
are also used to "doing things unto " the communities and not "doing things with" them. They
also have to be conscientized about the full meaning of this new attitude and about the fact
that they would need to exercise patience to learn about this new approach and be able to take
the people along with them.
Because there was no experience with a pilot project, many public servants were not
aware of the complexities involved in introducing the concept of self-government as
proposed by the LMCP. Even at the central government level, it does not seem as if the
officials could provide sufficient required guidance and assistance. Generally, public



-65-
servants were inadequately prepared and poorly sensitized to working with the people under
the conditions spelt out by the LMCP so that when they could not come up with
implementation results soon enough, they began panicking. Perhaps this explains why in one
reported case a DPO took over some of the functions of the VDC and began purchasing items
on its behalf. That denied the VDC the opportunity to learn how to disburse funds.
The experience of the LMCP, shows that the process of drawing plans based on an
assessment of the people's expressed needs requires time. Piloting on a smaller scale could
have revealed this reality. The public servants learned this in the most shocking manner in
the midst of intense conflicts between the two cooperating ministries. Even these conflict of
interests could have been identified much earlier had there been some piloting so that the
appraisal mission would have provided remedial solutions from the beginning.
4.    SELECTION OF MOKHOTLONG AND QACHA'S NEK AS PROJECT
AREAS
According to the responses received, Mokhotlong and Qacha's Nek were selected as
project districts because many earlier projects had neglected them. However, these are
mountain districts and they are not easily accessible. Even though the construction of a
tarred road to Mokhotlong is almost complete, its distance from Maseru made
communication with the headquarters of the two implementing ministries quite impossible.
The road to Qacha's Nek remains largely a gravel track. In terms of distance, it is even
further from Maseru than Mokhotlong is.
While the reason for choosing these two districts remains morally sound, experience
gained through the project shows that in addition, one should consider issues of coordination
and monitoring and evaluation when selecting project sites. According to some of the key
informants for the study even the appraisal mission or the project coordinator(s) could not
appreciate the magnitude of some of the problems they were encountering in the
implementation because they were located too far away from where it was all happening.
The worst of them all is that life and weather conditions in the two districts make
them unbearable to live in to most civil servants. In future, a much more careful and
objective discussion would have to be engaged in when selecting project sites, it cannot be
treated purely as a simple matter. Supervision in the case of a project adopting a new
approach is, according to the authors, extremely important and it should be more frequent.
5.    STAFFING
The most outstanding problem experienced by the MOA and MOHA personnel in the
District was that while they were charged with the responsibility to carry out activities
connected to the LMCP they, at the same time, had to carry on with their normal day-to-day
duties. This meant that they did not have the opportunity to concentrate their efforts
on the LMCP alone. Some of them reported that they had divided loyalties and as a result
they did not have full commitment to the LMCP. This experience shows that while some
financial savings may have been made by not recruiting and employing additional staff to



-66-
look after the LMCP activities, the arrangement, to a great extent, undermined progress and
successful goal achievement.
In addition, the experience of the LMCP is marked by constant turnover of crucial
personnel, namely the Project Coordinators. In the first two years, the project functioned
under two different coordinators. The second one, believed to have been more effective, after
being appointed the LMCP Coordinator, was elevated to the level of Deputy Principal
Secretary in the MOHA and, thus, had to devote whatever time was available to the duties of
the two positions. The Lesotho Government officials who had been involved when initial
discussions about the project were held with the World Bank and who were considered to be
the architects of the whole idea of this "bottom-up approach" had left by the time the project
started. Those who remained had no clear vision of the project.
Other issues were raised concerning staffing such as the recruitment of a Senior
Accountant not suitably qualified for the job which badly affected the disbursement of
project funds during the course of implementation. In one instance cited earlier, the DPO
who had gone on to procure project items on behalf of a VDC, was said to have been unable
to account for the money spent. In future, the matter of recruitment and retention of staff
who lack qualifications or are not conscientious enough for such a delicate project would
need to be given a serious thought.
6.    TRAINING
The idea of providing training to the VDCs and the DDCs was significant and vital
for the success of the project activities. However, not taking into consideration the
CALIBRE of the trainees, meant that there was no appropriate thought given to the issue of
how long it would take to successfully provide the training. The duration of training sessions
was limited and their frequency found inadequate. Regular follow-up sessions would have
supported the initial training provided to the members of the VDCs and the DDCs. One
would have thought that some kind of assessment would have been done before initiating the
actual training sessions so that when they staited, the trainers would have had an idea of who
they were to train and what skills they already had and what skills the trainees required. This
would have saved a lot of time and also facilitated the process of organizing training sessions
and compiling materials needed.
The training specialist was never able to fulfill the duty of training the DPOs. Thus
the DPOs were left to fend for themselves throughout the project. Each one of them was left
to interpret the objectives of the project as he wished. Sometimes their interpretation of what
was to happen did not tally with those of the people.
7.    THE CHIEFTAINSHIP
The previous government policy whereby chiefs became automatic chairpersons of
VDCs was flawed. As has been pointed out earlier in the report, some of the chiefs lacked
the necessary leadership and basic managerial skills that would have helped them along in the
management of the villages and in acting as chairpersons of the VDCs.



-67-
While some people believe that it is necessary to keep chiefs as "ex-officio" members
of VDCs, in future, the government will have to revisit the idea of making policy provisions
that elevate chiefs to positions of the VDC chairmanship automatically.

METHODOLOGY
1.    DATA COLLECTION
At District level, the data for the Impact Beneficiary Study was collected over a
period of 17 days and another 10 days in Maseru. Both district project areas, Mokhotlong
and Qacha's Nek were covered. Attempt was made to cover the villages in which only
training was given to the VDCs and DDCs and those in which both training and the
implementation of project activities actually took place. The unfavourable weather
conditions and snowfall in Mokhotlong prevented the researchers fromii having access to
villages where only training had been received.
Various methods of data collection were used to collect the data.
1.1   INTERVIEWS WITH KEY INFORMANTS
The data collection began with in-depth interviews of various public officials
who played some role in the project. The majority of these officials are based in the Ministry
of Home Affairs and the Ministry of Agriculture although there are some exceptions (See
APPENDIX A). The key informants provided information regarding various aspects of the
project related to its planning and implementation. Government officials at the Central
Government (Maseru) were interviewed and also those at District level. The latter included
District Secretaries and District Development Planner (Home Affairs) and District
Agricultural officers, District Land Use Planners and the Subject Matter Specialists (Ministry
of Agriculture).
The staff of the Lesotho Distance Teaching Centre who were involved in
training the VDCs and DDCs were also interviewed. The questions put to these respondents
focus mainly on the organization of training workshops for VDCs and DDCs, and the content
matter of the workshops. However, respondents were also able to provide useful information
regarding the characteristics of members and constitution of the councils.
1.2   INTERVIEWS AND GROUP DISCUSSIONS WITH COMMUNITY
MEMBERS
At the community level, in the villages, members of the VDCs, chiefs and
ordinary villagers in the project areas were interviewed largely in groups, but in some cases
individually. Being winter and also the harvesting season in Lesotho, these strategies were
used as and when suitable. Where there were female members of the VDCs, it was possible
in most cases to get them to participate in the interview/discussions.

1.3 INSPECTION OF PROJECT ACTIVITIES
As part of the Beneficiary Impact Study, the researchers visited and inspected
activities in the project sites. There was an opportunity to view the equipment purchased
under the project. The communal gardens where vegetables and fruit trees have been planted
were also visited and inspections of project buildings (offices and houses) were made.
1.4 REVIEW OF DOCUMENTS
Several documents and records pertaining to the project have been reviewed.
This was mainly done in the attempt to seek a better understanding of the rationale and the
objectives of the project. This helped the researchers to get a clearer picture of the project
and how it was to be implemented.
2.    THE PARTICIPATORY RESEARCH APPROACH
The study made use of the participatory research approach. This called for a
democratic interaction among the constituencies taking part - the researchers on the one hand
and the government officials and community members (including VDC members and chiefs)
on the other. Throughout the fieldwork, the idea was to develop a deeper and critical
understanding of the Land Management and Conservation Project and its impact in the
beneficiary communities.
At every stage, discussions with respondents involved looking at the project
objectives, its implementation strategies, the structural and institutional frameworks that were
involved in the project activities, the successes achieved, the problems and failures and their
causes, lessons leamt at various stages and possibilities of overcoming various kind of
difficulties that were experienced, the beneficiaries' perceptions and opinions of the project as
a whole.
This approach was used with groups and individuals. The researchers and
respondents got involved in a three-pronged process that:
i]    caused them to make a collective investigation of problems and take active
participation in discussing issues pertaining to the project.
ii]   provided an opportunity to make a collective analysis that permitted a better
understanding not only of the problems experienced during the project period but also of the
underlying causes, be they structural, socio-economic, political or cultural.
iii]   developed a collective understanding of action that could be taken by various
constituencies, particularly the beneficiaries, in order to resolve the problems that confront
them both in the short-term and in the long-term.
In actual practice, the approach required collective discussion and interaction and thus
the above three elements of the whole process could not be easily separated. In its
description the process had to begin with the people's concrete experience and situation as it
related to the LMCP. It unfolded in later stages of each discussions session to include both



-72-
making a theoretical analysis and working out the kinds of action that could have promoted
desired change. The critical assessment of the success and the failure of the LMCP seemed
to deepen awareness of the concrete reality which people (beneficiaries) face. It turned out to
be an educational process for all those who were involved.
3.    DATA ANALYSIS AND PRESENTATION OF FINDINGS
The process of data collection through the participatory approach had yielded a lot of
qualitative data. The bulk of these data are descriptive and reveal the perceptions and
opinions of government officials and the communities in the project areas. In analyzing the
data, the researchers' aim has been to seek illumination, on the basis of concrete experiences,
on some of the basic issues pertaining to the LMCP. The findings are presented under the
following headings:
a]    PROJECT OBJECTIVES
A concise statement of the project's major objectives followed by a detailed
description of the peoples' (government officials and community) perceptions of these
objectives. The description assesses the clarity and realism of the objectives and the extent to
which they were regarded as important by the beneficiaries.
b]    ACHIEVEMENT OF PROJECT ACTIVITIES
Assessment of how far the project went in achieving the major objectives and
a description of what the project has left on the ground including a well reason account of the
project outcomes.
c]    IMPLEMENTATION RECORD AND MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING
THE PROJECT
An account of the factors that affected project implementation. There are
those factors that relate directly to the role of government structures and officers in the
implementation of project activities and there is a whole range of other factors arising from
the strength/weaknesses of the VDCs and those that arose at the community level.
d]    ASSESSMENTIOF OUTCOMES
Assessment not only of how well the project achieved its objectives but most
importantly of the status of the achievements made. It begins with an indication of what the
project has been able to achieve and ends with a commentary on each one of the outcomes.
e]    TRAINING
A brief comment is to be made on the purpose, type, mode of delivery and
usability of the training provided to the VDCs. a brief description is also to be made of the



-73-
quality and character of the trainees themselves. The section will also make mention of some
of the problems encountered and recommendations for the future.
f]    PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
An assessment of how far it will be possible to maintain the achievements of
the project. This takes into account the following factors: the commitment of the
beneficiaries and
the incentives that may be necessary to sustain such commitment: government
effectiveness, technical and financial viability; and the VDCs and communities' capacity to
carry on from where the project has left.
g]    KEY LESSONS LEARNED
Statement of the most significant negative and positive lessons learned from
the project which may become relevant in guiding similar projects in the future.
The researchers consider the narrative text the most important part of the presentation
because it captures much more vividly the opinions, perceptions and descriptions of what the
beneficiaries saw happening with the LMCP on the ground. Qualitative data, even where
graphic display is possible, is best presented in a narrative form.
