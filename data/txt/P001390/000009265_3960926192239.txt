MEMORANDUM AND RECO1MMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE KINGDOM OF LESOTHO
FOR A LAND MANAGEMENT AND CONSERVATION PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recomendation on a proposed
development credit to the Government of Lesotho for SDR 11.7 million
(US$16.0 million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed
credit would be on standard IDA terms with 40 year_ maturity, and would
assist in the financing of a project to strengthen village and district
land use planning and to improve resource management practices by
smallholders in Lesotho. Swedish SIDA would increase its ongoing technical
assistance, estimated to cost about US$1.9 million in support of the
project.
2.       Background.  Lesctbn is a mountainous country with rocky terrain;
only 13Z of the land is cultivable. It is primarily a pastoral country
with about 77Z of agricultural value-added generated by livestock
production. Despite the limited agricultural potential, about 842 of the
population lives in the rural areas and about 65Z of Lesotho's labor force
obtains at least some supplemental income from agriculture. This
dependence on agriculture will Increase in the coming decades as a result
of Lesotho's rapidly growing population and declining employment
opportunities in the Republic of South Africa. Over the past decade,
agriculture's contribution to GDP has continued to decline, being only 21%
of GDP in 1985/86, as against 332 a decade earlier. A major cause of the
decline is degradation of the land resource, primarily through relative
overgrazing in the fragile and densely populated foothills and in the
mountains. This overgrazing is attributable mainly to a communal graziiig
system in which land is treeted as a free resource. A Bank agricultural
Sector Review in 1985/86 concluded that it was necessary to modify the
communal grazing system by having local communities themselves restrict
access and manage the limited land resources within their respective
jurisdictions.
3.       Conditions for involving the local communities in land management
now exist. In 1986, democratically-elected village, ward and district
councils were established, linked with chiefs who chair the councils within
their respective jurisdictions. The councils are authorized to raise
revenue for their development activities, and have been mandated to prepare
and implement development plans in their jurisdictions,  with the
assistance of technical personnel from the line ministries working as a
team under the District Secretary. Thus, these plans are likely to hare
the active support of the traditional authorities and the land users.
However, since the councils and the democratic experience are very new, it
will only be over an extended period that the councils can expect to
acquire the competence to successfully carry out development programs. A
beginning has been made by the Institute of Land Use Planning (IL'JP) in
preparing one village resource management plan in each of the ten
districts. The Institute is currently being funded by SIDA. Considerable
further assistance is needed in this field, which the proposed project
would provide. SIDA has expressed its intention to continue its funding of
ILUP and to increase its technical assistance in support of the project.

4.       Rationale for IDA Involvement.  IDA'o sponsorship of this project
would enable it to support a basic and very critical institution building
activity at the grassroots, which would lay the foundation for developing
sustainable resource management programs. IDA would thus be involved in
strengthening a democratic process, by bringing together all the parties
interested in land conservation, viz, the people, the chiefs, the
government and the donors. The project would also enable the Bank Group to
continue its dialogue with GOL and donors to develop a viable land policy.
5.       Proiect Objectives.  The basic objective of the project is to
assist in arresting land degradation and maintaining the land resource,
through local initiatives. To this end, the project would seek to
strengthen government institutions to enable them to assist the councils in
development planning and in preparing and implementing land resource
management plans. Such plans would incorporate resource management
practices, in particular the determination of rights of access, especially
of livestock, by mutual consent of the parties involved. It is expected
that through the above process, the communal grazing system would be
modified, thus controlling one of the major factors contributing to land
degradation.
6.       ProJect Description.  The project is piu2t in nature and has to be
viewed in a long-term perspective. It would: (a) assist 'n the further
development of a land policy for the Kingdom, and in the implementation of
land tenure laws by providing for land registration and surveys; (b)
strengthen MICARD's ability to assist councils in administration and
development planning through technical assistance, training and logistical
support; (c) strengthen MOA's ability through its ILUP to field resource
management working groups in each district which would assist local
communities in preparing and implementing land resource management
projects; and (d) finance approved land management projects such as pasture
improvement, civil and conservation works and tree planting. The total
cost of the project is estimated at US$20.2 million with a foreign exchange
component of US$8.4 million (422). A breakdown of costs and the financing
plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of
disbursements, and the disbursement schedule, are shown in Schedule B.
Schedule C shows the key project processing events. Schedule D shows the
status of IDA credits and IFC investments in Lesotho. Map No. IBRD 14282R
and the Staff Appraisal Report No. 6960-LSO, dated March 15, 1988 are also
attached.
7.       Actions Agreed.  All major issues have been resolved with the
Government. The Government has agreed on the following actions as
conditions of credit effectiveness: (a) the establishment of an
interministerial Review Committee to ensure that the district development
and resource management policy are consistent with the national
conservation strategy; and (b) the creation and filling of the district
level positions of a Senior Land Use Planner and District Land Use Planners
in the first two project districts.
8.       At negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Borrower
regarding the following: (a) availability of key district staff at the
start of the project; (b) timely preparation and execution of training
programs by April l, 1989 for District Planning Officers, District



- 3 -
Development Councils and Chiefs; (c) preparation of selection criteria for
subprojects by September 30, 1988; and (d) by April 1, 1989, (i)
introduction of regulations to enable councils to raise development funds,
and (ii) clarification and :onfirmation to the Association of the role of
Development Councils in controlling access to land for the implementation
of resource management plans.
9.       Benefits.  Economic benefits from the proposed project would come
from (a) the reduction and arresting of soil erosion and land degradation;
and (b) improved livestock management practices. These are oxpected to
result in higher agricultural yields and production. It is not possible to
quantify these benefits, they would accrue over a long period. The project
would contribute very substantially to institution building through (i)
developing the capacity in local bodies to formulate and implement
critically important resource management plans, and (ii) strengthening
government institutions to enable them to assist local bodies. At the end
of year 6, it is expected that 47 resource management plans would have been
prepared and some of them would be under implementation. It is expected
that, based on this experience, villages and districts would be able to
generate their own development plans in future.
10.      Risks.  Possible risks includes (a) inadequate response to the
project from the villagers; (b) the failure of GOL to provide key staff
positions in a timely manner; and (c) the difficulty of changing long-
established land use patterns within the relatively short time frame of the
project. These risks would be minimized by (i) basing the project on
experience already gained in preparing resource management plans through
ILUP; ($1) continuing the ongoing sectoral dialogue on policies towards
soil erosion and land degradation, and on aid coordination; (iii)
initiating a substantial promotional effort among local communities; (iv)
providing for conservative targets of the numbers of participating
councils; and (v) appointment of key staff as condition of effectiveness.
11.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
