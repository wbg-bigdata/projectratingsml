MEMORANDUK AND RECOM?ENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
!F THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO COLOMBIA
FOR AN IFI RESTRUCTIING AND DIVESTITURE PROJECI
1.        I submit for your approval the following memorandum and
recommendation on a proposed loan to Instituto de Fomento Industrial (IFI)
with the guarantee of the Republic of Colombia for the equivalent of US$100
million. The loan would be at the Bank's standard v&riable interest rate,
with a maturity of 17 years, including 5 years of grace.
2.        Background.  Colombia has been one of the most stable economies in
the developing world, with growth averaging 4.5% over the past four decades.
During the 1980s, however, external shocks and weaknesses in the economy
resulted in deteriorated fiscal balances, inflationary pressures and sluggish
growth. To remedy this, the authorities first stabilized the economy and then
launched a medium term program to address structural problems which, left
untreated, would suppress long term growth prospects. The national
administration that took office in August 1990 markedly increased the pace of
the reform program, which is aimed essentially at more efficient use of
resou-ces through opening the economy to the competition and opportunities of
international markets. To achieve this, the Government is strengthening
macroeconomic management, reforming its trade regime, restructuring and
downsizing the public sector, liberali'Ping the industrial and agricultural
sectors and modernizing the financial sector.
3.        The Colombian financial sector is characterized by high market
lending interest rates, 8-10% in real terms, reflecting an oligopolistic
structure resulting from the predominance of conglomerates and past entry/exit
restrictions, the implicit tax of forced investments and high reserve
requirements, and subsidized interest rates on directed credit in a large
number of programs. Except for indexed housing and construction loans,
voluntary credit is concentrated on maturities of one year or less. Capital
markets are extremely thin and have actually declined in importance during the
past 35 years. As part of its reform program, the Government is carrying out
a comprehensive reshaping of the financial sector to support the supply
response to the trade, industrial and agricultural reforms. In addition to
correcting the aforementioned distortions, its strategy provides for preparing
the financial system to face foreign competition in domestic markets and
increase its participation in foreign markets by increasing its efficiency,
size and depth. To date, entry and exit to the sector have been liberalized,
forced investments curtailed and market segmentation reduced. The first two
of the banks nationalized in the early 1980s have been sold, and three more
are being readied for sale. The differential between directed credit and
market rates has been eliminated for directed credit to industry, and the
ratio of these rates increased to 97% fcr municipal lending, 94% for trade and
892 for agriculture. Further phased elimination of subsidies is programmed
under a comprehensive financial sector policy framework which has been
formally conveyed to the Bank. Finally, the Government has completed the
first phase of a program to restructure the Instituto de Fomento Industrial



-2
(IFI), the largest public development bank and holding company, and the
proposed project would support impleaentation of its second phase.
4.        IFI was created in 1940 to promote industrial development through
equity investments in basic industries. In addition, since 1963, IFI has been
authorized to function as a development bank, lending both to enterprises in
its investment portfolio and to non-affiliated firms. IFI has received funds
for its operations from various sources, the most important traditionA%lly
being (i) constant purchasing power bonds (Bonos de Valor Constante, or BVCs)
held by the Social Security Institute; (ii) earmarked import taxes; (iii)
foreign lines of credit; and (iv) certificates of deposit. As part of the
reforms under the project, funding from (i) and (ii) have been eliminated as
of end 1990, except for the auto assembly tax surcharge. On December 31,
1990, IFI's investment portfolio, valued at US$131 million, consisted of
equity holdiugs in the industrial, agroindustrial, mining, and financial
sectors. Its credit portfolio stood at US$209 million. Traditionally, IFI has
had a sluggish financial performance, generally just breaking-even. However,
IFI's financial condition is sound, reflecting its historically conservative
liability management, and is currently underleveraged (debt/equity ratio of
2.07:1).
5.        The Government's strategy for IFI is based on the following
considerations. First, IFI is being divested of its industrial holdings in
accordance with the public sector's withdrawal from productive sector
activities. As of end 1990, 15 out of 52 enterprises of IFI's portfolio had
already been divested and 8 others were in process of liquidation. The
project would support the continued divestiture program of the remaining 29
equity holdings of IFI. Second, it will take some time for the private sector
response to increase the depth and competitiveness of the financial sector
consonant with investors' needs for long term credit, venture capital and
modern financial services. During this transition period, IFI would help fill
this gap by providing financial services and instruments that are currently
underprovided, acting as a catalyst for increased private sector participation
in these services and instruments (e.g., through syndications and financial
engineering packages for large, lumpy investments,l, and promoting capital
markets development. It would, however, operate on a strictly commercial
basis. Concurrently, the groundwork for its privatization would be laid so
that its ownership would shift out of the public sector as private agents come
forward to offer like financial services. A Policy Letter outlining IFI's
role, strategy, and policies was approved and conveyed to the Bank by the
Government prior to Board presentation of the Loan.
6.        Rationale for Bank_Inolvement.  During the last two years, the
Bank has focused its policy dialogue with the Government on the medium-term
structural reform strategy to accelerate economic growth by raising the
efficiency of resource use. With the Public Sector Reform Loan (PSRL), the
Bank supports the Government's overall effort to strengthen public sector
management, promote private sector development, and improve the allocation of
public sector resources. The proposed IFI project would complement these
efforts by assisting Colombia to correct institutional and market
imperfections in the financial sector, and would help rationalize and limit
future public sector involvement in industrial finance by actively supporting



3
Development Project, it would form a package of loans designed to facilitate
the supply response to the recently carried out trade reform program. In
addition, the proposed loan has been prepared in collaboration with IFC, which
is considering the provision of a parallel loan for finarcing of private
enterprises in Colombia. Coordination in the design of both operations would
ensure the adequacy of the relative interest rates of the financing offered
under both lines of credit.
7.        The proposed sector strategy and project have been designed taking
into account the lessons learned from previous Bank operations regarding
Industrial Development and Finance in Colombia, and to reflect as well current
"best practice" within the Bank concerning divestiture operations. Among
these lessons and considerations are the following: (i) the project has been
designed under an "umbrella" financial sector policy framework which provides
for a comprehensive medium term sector strategy and reform program; (ii) the
project relies on market lending rates for beneficiary enterprises, with no
interest rate limitations, thus avoiding the ex-post subsidies generated under
previous lines caused by interest rate settings and ceilings; and (iii) the
divestiture program of IFI's holdings has been designed taking account of the
specific circumstances of IFI and the enterprises being divested, following a
two-tier approach of setting specific timing and individual targets for
divestiture of one group of companies and defining broader quantitative
targets for the other group.
8.        Project Obiectives.  The objectives of the IFI Restructuring and
Divestiture Project are: (i) to implement a divestiture and privatization
program of IFE'a existing equity holdings, including the development and
implementation of individual restructuring and divestiture plans; (ii) to
support the implementation of a new corporate strategy for IFI which will
reorient its role in industrial and financial sector development by
transforming it into a more efficient financial institution that can compete
on an equal basis in the financial markets -- in the process enhancing
competition in such markets, and filling a market gap in financial services
needed to support investments consistent with the liberalization of the
economy. Achievement of these two objectives would pave the way for the
eventual privatization of IFI itself, for which a specific plan would be drawn
up under the project. Moreover, the project would set strict financial
performance criteria (e.g. portfolio diversification, exposure limits,
operational efficiency, profitability) in order to guide IFI thro,ugh the
transition period in reaching this ultimate objective.
9.        Proiect DescriRtion:  The Project would include: (i) a
restructuring and divestiture program of IFI's equity holdings which would
help eliminate IFI's state holding company role and would allow it to become a
genuinely market-oriented financial intermediary. The program encompasses the
remaining 29 equity investments in IFI's portfolio, which would be privatized,
liquidated or transferred; (ii) a credit program to be onlent by IFI to
private productive enterprises to finance investment in fixed assets and
working capital; and (iii) technical assistance, training and management
information systems to support strategic and organizational changes in IFI,
and investment banking and other services to assist IFI in implementing its
divestiture program. Project costs and financing plan are presented in



-4-
Schedule A. In order to deal with a shortage of funds, due to the phasing out
as of exid-1990 of IFI's main earmarked funding as a result of early project
implementation in the financial restructuring of IFI, retroactive financing in
the amount of US$10 million wo,uld be provided for subloans committed after May
1, 1991.
10.       Project Imleme_%tatin.  The Bank loan would be made to IFI at the
standard vartable rate.  1I7 1-ould relend the credit component to private
productive enterprises in dollars equivalent at market rates, i.e. an
adjustable LIBOR- or PRIME- based rate plus an adequate spread. This spread
would be sufficient to cover IFI's cost of funds (IBRD rate plus hedging
costs) plus IFI's costs of administration, risks and a profit such as to yield
IFI an adequate profitability on its equity. Subloan maturities would be
between three and ten years, including one to three years of grace. IFI would
charge slightly higher interest rates for longer term loans to reflect the
additional risk of the subloan and the higher scarcity of longer term
resources. Subloans would cover up to 70% of subproject cost, with equity
financing representing at least 30% of subproject cost. Subprojects would be
required to have a financial rate of return no lower than 12X p.a. in real
terms. Given that the current trade reform program should substantially
reduce the distortions in the economy, an economic rate of return would not be
required. The project would be carried out by IFI which, with its long
history of project financing and management and the implementation of its
financial restructuring and reorganization plans, will have an adequate
organizational, staffing and financial capacity to carry it out.
11.       Agreed Actions.  The main actions agreed upon under the Project are
as follows:
(i)  IFI's maximum level of administrative costs, as a ratio to average
assets, and minimum profitability using the average of private
financiaJ corporations in Colombia as benchmarks;
(ii)  annual minimum targets for the 1991-94 divestiture program of IFI's
equity holdings;
(iii)  submission by the Government of an action plan for IFI's
divestiture of its shares in Corporacion Andina de Fomento, by
December 31, 1992, and actual divestiture by December 31, 1993;
(iv)  privatization or liquidation of one of Alealis' plants by the mid-
term review, and privatization or liquidation of the second plant
by end-1994;
(v)  development of a strategic plan for Concesion Salinas and transfer
of the concession to the Trust Fund by mid-term review;
(vi)  preparation by the Government of a strategic analysis of its
investments in Cerro Matoso and Mon6meros, and sale or transfer to
the Trust Fund of these  avestments, by the mid-term review and
December 31, 1994, respectively;



-5-
the Trust Fund of these investments, by the mid-term review and
December 31, 1994, reapectively;
(vii)  sale by IFI of the first 15.4 million shares of Propal by the mid-
term review; sale of the additional 15.4 million shares by December
31, 1994 or as soon as Propal's Shareholders Agreement would allow
to do so after that datel
(viii) IFI's obligation to maintain lending interest rates at commercial
market rates;
(ix)  IFI's maximum exposure limit, for equity and credit financing;
(x)   IFI's obligation to limit in its future equity investments its
holding period, so that the weighted average age of these
investments does not exceed three years;
(xi) the Bank, IFI and the Government would carry out a comprehensive
mid-term review of project execution after fifty percent of the
credit component of the loan is comitted, estimated to occur at
the end of 1993 or early in 1994. The review would take stock of
accomplishments and introduce corrective measures where warranted
on the basis of implementation experience gained to date. Such
review would cover inter alias (i) progress in reorgaiizing IFI,
including the organizational, staffing and information systems
developments; (ii) implementation of its new funding, lending and
investment policies and procedures; (iii) its financial condition
and financial performance; (iv) progress in carrying out IFI's
divestiture plan; and (v) a discussion of the conclusions and
recommendations of all studies financed under the project to be
completed by the review, including the definition of a
privatization strategy for IFI itself. Continued commitment of
funds for the credit component would be conditional upon completion
of the review in a manner satisfactory to the Bank; and
(xii) Effectiveness of the Loan is dependent on effectiveness of the
Industrial Restructuring and Development Project (TRDP) loan, as
the environmental review of subprojects under the credit component
is linked with the Environmental Pollution Control Program
supported by the IRDP.
12.       Benefits.  The Project would improve the financial situation and
operational efficiency of IPI and support the withdrawal of the public sectcr
from productive sector activities. By reorienting IFI's lending and
investment strategy, the project would contribute to the development of long
term credit, capital markets and other financial services, and would
facilitate the supply response to the trade and financial sector '.-eform. The
Project wovld support Private Sector Development through: (i) privatization
of public sector investments in the industrial sector; (ii) financial support
for private enterprises' investment through the provision of term credit; and
(iii) transforming a large public development bank into an efficient and



-6
competitive financial intermediery serving the private sector, and ultimately
privatizing it,
13.       Risks.  Project risks include the possibility that the Government
and IFI would fail to complete the dives..iture program and to eliminate the
special regime and subsidies under which IFI has operated. Colombia's
cGommitment to reform in the trade, financial and public enterprise sectors
during recent years, as evidenced by the strong measures taken, suggest that
these risks are not excessive.
14.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of tha Bank and recommen,' that the Executive
Directors approve ic.
