Description        The proposed Poverty Reduction Support Grant (PRSG) is the third ina series designed to assist
                   the Government o f Rwanda (GoR) to implement key policy actions outlined in its 2002 Poverty
                   Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), which focuses on (a) creating a favorable private sector
                   investment climate to promote macroeconomic stability and sustained economic growth; (b)
                   improving quality, coverage, and equity o f basic service delivery through improved expenditure
                   efficiency; and (c) supporting overall improvement of public expenditure management and
                   governance, with an emphasis on transparency and accountability to citizens' voice and
                   participation. The proposed PRSG I11 continues support to the GoR as it implements the next
                   steps in its reform program, now being undertaken in an environment o f enhanced
                   decentralization. Within this context, PRSG I11 i s expected to build on the successes with
                   decentralized service delivery under PRSC/G Iand PRSG 11, particularly in education, health,
                   water, and energy. PRSG I11would continue to help the GoR maintain a stable macroeconomic
                   framework, creating the basis for private sector-led economic growth, driven by agricultural
                   transformation, export promotion, financial sector deepening, and information communications
                   technology (this agenda expected to be a main focus o f the GoR's second PRSP, which is
                   currently under preparation). PRSG I11would also help the GoR to strengthen further the linkages
                   between strategic planning, its Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF), and budgeting,
                   with a particular focus on the service delivery sectors mentioned above. PRSG I11would continue
                   to help the GoR improve governance and transparency through further reforms to the fiduciary
                   ffamework and empowerment o f local communities. Given important linkages to the growth
                   agenda, the policy dialogue inthe transport sector continues, while at the GoR's request, dialogue
                   on social protectionwould be added.
Benefits           This programmatic operation would continue support for the implementation o f the GoR's first
                   PRSP, which was prepared in a participatory manner and which has strong country ownership.
                   The proposed PRSG I11also supports the GoR's decentralizationprogram, which was accelerated
                   in 2006 with the swift passage and implementation of a territorial reform law.            Within the
                   enhanced decentralization framework, benefits o f PRSG I11 would continue to accrue to the
                   population overall, with a particular focus on poor people inrural and urbanareas. Particularly in
                   the context of enhanced decentralization, the proposed PRSG I11 focuses on the ability o f the
                   central government to enable local government to improve delivery and increase equitable access
                   to basic services (health, education, water, energy). To this end, PRSG I11builds upon successes
                   under PRSC/G Iand PRSG 11, particularly the transfer o f capitation grants in education and
                   performance-based contracting o f high-impact health services via local health centers. The
                   objective remains to improve human development outcomes and achieve Millennium
                   Development Goals. PRSG I11preparation capitalizes on the much improved, hlly government-
                   led donor coordination, a direct result o f the budget support program inRwanda.
Risks              Though international and regional efforts to mitigate instability continue, the risk o f flare ups in
                   the eastern Congo is not negligible. The Bank supports efforts aimed at fostering peace and
                   security between Rwanda and its neighbors. Reports exist o f tensions around the Gacacaprocess
                   and limits on the freedom o f political opposition andthe media (particularly givenits role inthe
                   genocide) due to the GoR's concerns o f a return o f ethnic division. However, internally Rwanda's
                   security and political situation remains stable. Predictability o f donor financing and availability o f
                   concessional financing remain issues, though alignment o f donor disbursements with the GoR's
                   budget cycle has improved. Risks associated with weaknesses in the country's fiduciary
                   framework, particularly at decentralized levels, is a concern. The GoR is taking action to address
                   this, for example by developing easy-reference guidance on procurement andtraining accountants
                   to be deployed at the local level.

                                                 I.Introduction
1.       The third Rwanda poverty reduction support operation, a Poverty Reduction Support Grant
(PRSG 111), is designed to build upon progress under the first and second Poverty Reduction Support
CreditIGrants (PRSC/G Iand PRSG II).          The PRSG series will continue assistanceto the Government of
Rwanda (GoR) toward achievement o f the goals outlined in its July 2002 Poverty Reduction Strategy
Paper (PRSP), and progress toward achievement of MillenniumDevelopment Goals (MDGs) related to
PRSP objectives.' Following on and consistent with the PRSP, the December 2002 Rwanda Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) signaled the introduction of PRSC/G support in complement to project
support. The August 2006 Interim Strategy Note (ISN) highlights the important contribution that
PRSC/Gs are making to the Bank's program in Rwanda, indicating that this will continue to be the main
instrument for support to policy implementation for service delivery. PRSC/G I(US$50 million
grant/US$lS million credit) was approved by the Bank's Executive Directors on October 21, 2004;
PRSG I1(US$55 million grant) was approved on November 10, 2005. This program document outlines
the context, case, and areas o f policy emphasis for PRSG111(US$50 million grant).
2.       This first PRSC/G series for Rwandahas a strong focus on service delivery, assisting the GoR in
its efforts to reduce poverty by strengthening the macroeconomic situation to foster sustainable delivery
of basic services. The framework for the series addresses growth and human development through a
holistic, cross-sectoral approach, in line with the GoR's first PRSP. Each operation in the series aims to
support implementation of key policy measures and expenditure programs aimed at (a) creating a
favorable private sector investment climate that would promote macroeconomic stability and sustained
economic growth; (b) improving the quality, coverage, and equity o f basic human development services
delivery, and increasing expenditure efficiency; and (c) enhancing overall public expenditure
management and governance, with an emphasis on expanding the voice and participation o f citizens. The
GoR i s currently preparing its second PRSP, known as the Economic and Poverty Reduction Strategy
(EDPRS). The EDPRS is expected to build on the first PRSP and provide the framework for a planned
second series of PRSC/G support over 2007-2009.
3.       The PRSC/G program, which PRSG I11would continue to support, has already helped Rwanda
make significant progress toward MDGs by scaling-up basic service delivery through decentralization.
Impressive results have been achieved in the social sectors: primary school enrollment reached 92
percent in 2006 and completion rates increased to 55 percent in2005. Immunization rates, at 95 percent,
are among the highest in Sub-Saharan. Use of insecticide-treated bednets increased from 4 to 40 percent
of the population from 2004 to 2006 (and is expected to reach 60 percent in 2007). Unique in Africa,
Rwanda has also scaled-up access to health insurance, from 7 to 51 percent o f the population between
2003 and 2006, leading to increased use of health services (e.g., assisted deliveries have increased, and
under five mortality decreased25 percent from 2000 to 2005, bringingrates back to pre-genocide levels).
Infrastructure services are also making gains: through local-level and private operator schemes, an
additional 598,000 people gained access to potable water in rural areas in2005; over the past three years,
an additional one million people (14 percent o f the population) have gained access to water. In the
energy sector, the GoR was able to pass-through the cost of oil price increases in 2005, and i s now


'   Rwanda's PRSP and implementationis filly owned and driven by the GoR. Following publication of its PRSP in2002, the
    GoR workedto develop amore action-orientedPRSP policy matrix during 2003 and 2004, with further refinementin2005
    duringthe PRSPannual progressreport exercise. This was done in close collaborationwith development partners, including
    those providing budget support (the United Kingdom's Department for InternationalDevelopment (DFID), the European
    Union, the African Development Bank (AfDB), Sweden (SIDA), and the World Bank), and partners providing support
    through sector investment/programapproachesandprojects(Belgium, Germany, USAID,UNICEF, WHO, UNFPA).

aggressively pursuingthe development o f Lake Kivu gas to ease energy costs and increase supply and
access for the population inthe future.
4.      Buildingon achievements under PRSC/G Iand PRSG11, the proposed PRSG111would continue
to support the GoR as it implements the next steps in its reform program which, with the effectiveness o f
a territorial reform law in January 2006, i s being undertaken in the environment of enhanced
decentralization. Within this context, PRSG IIIi s expected to help the GoR build on the successes with
decentralized service delivery, particularly in education, health, water, and energy. PRSG 111would also
continue to help the GoR maintain a stable macroeconomic framework, creating the basis for private
sector-led economic growth, driven by agricultural transformation, export promotion, financial sector
deepening, and information communications technology (ICT), which is expected to be a main focus of
the EDPRS. PRSG I11would help the GoR to strengthen further the linkages between strategic planning,
its Medium-Term ExpenditureFramework (MTEF), and budgeting, with a particular focus on the service
delivery sectors. PRSG I11 would continue to help the GoR improve governance and transparency
through further reforms to the fiduciary framework and empowerment o f local communities. Given
important linkages to the growth agenda, the policy dialogue in the transport sector, introduced under
PRSC 11,would continue while, at the GoR's request, dialogue on social protectionwould be added.
5.       Ensuringthat Rwanda remains on a path of social and economic progress is key to sustaining
achievements since the 1994 genocide and contributing to the stability o f the Great Lakes region.
Rwandawill continue to require substantial external assistance to maintain the transition from conflict to
peace and development and its ability to continue to implement and update its PRSP. The PRSC/G series
buildson significant reforms and achievements in good governance made by Rwanda since 1994. Grant
financing is essential for Rwanda to sustain its economic and social recovery and develop its economy,
includingexpanding exports to address debt sustainability and reduce dependenceon foreign aid.

                11. RecentEconomicDevelopmentsandMacroeconomicOutlook
A.       CountryContext
6.       Rwanda i s a small, landlocked country inSub-SaharanAfrica with a population o f approximately
8.2 million and per capita GDP o f approximately US$250. Around 60 percent o f the population is
estimated to be poor, while around 85 percent o f the population lives inrural areas. Populationdensity, at
about 340 inhabitants per square kilometer, i s one of the highest in the world. In 2005, agriculture
accounted for about 43 percent of GDP, services for about 38 percent (consisting mainly o f wholesale
and resale trade in various products, transportation, and public administration) and industryfor about 19
percent (of which manufacturing accounts for 9 percent and construction 10 percent).
7.       While much remains to be done, Rwanda has made a remarkable transition from reconstruction
to development over the twelve years since the genocide. The 1994 genocide decimated Rwanda's fragile
economic base, severely impoverished the population (particularly women), and eroded the country's
ability to attract private sector investment.As a result of extensive economic and governance reform
measurestaken between 1995 and 2005, GDP growth rates averaged over 7.4 percent per annum. During
reconstruction, the GoR focused on rebuilding institutions and improving social indicators, which led to
significant improvements in education and health outcomes. While continuing to pursue this agenda, the
GoR i s now strongly focused on growth in an attempt to maintain the high growth rates o f the 1990s.
However, implementation of the GoR's growth agenda i s likely to depend on significant levels o f
external assistance for some time to come, even in light of recent agreementson debt forgiveness.
8.       The legacy o f the genocide persists in Rwanda. However, the country has made good progress
toward resettlement, reconciliation, demobilization, and reintegration of ex-combatants. To date, about
3.5 million Rwandan refugees have been repatriated and resettled (an impressive record compared to
other countries). Through the Genocide Survivors Fund, the GoR provides support ineducation, shelter,


                                                     3

health, and income-generating activities to the most vulnerable of the genocide survivors. A Unity and
Reconciliation Commission, which was established to consolidate the GoR's policy in redressing the
legacy o f divisive politics that has beenprominent inRwandafor many decades, continues to raise public
awareness through civic education initiatives called Ingando, and there has been extensive dialogue in
the country on unity, reconciliation, justice, security, and democratization. About 15,000 membersof ex-
FAR (the former government army) have been integrated into the Rwandese National Army at various
command levels. From 2004 to 2005, Rwanda accelerated the resolution o f cases under the Gacacd
courts (i.e., community-based legal hearings o f genocide accused) and in2005 Gacacajurisdictions were
expanded from one tenthof the territory to the whole country.
9.       In addition, to strengthen the voice and accountability of local communities, the GoR has been
vigorously pursuinga decentralization program. The five main objectives o f the program are to:

0   Enable and reactivate local people's participation in initiating, making, implementing, and
    monitoring decisions and plans that concern them;

0   Strengthen accountability and transparency by making local leaders directly accountable to
    communities;

0   Enhance sensitivity and responsiveness o f public administration to the local environment by placing
    planning, financing, management, and control o f service provision where services are provided;

0   Develop sustainable capacity for economic planning and management at local levels; and

0   Enhance effectiveness and efficiency inthe planning, monitoring, and delivery o f services.
The GoR's main strategy is to develop and enhance "accountability relationships" between institutional
actors (Le., citizens, policymakers, and service providers). Efficiency, effectiveness, and sustainability o f
service delivery will be a function of accountability between these three actors. The relationships of
accountability betweenthe three main actors are shown inFigure 1.

                                                                                       COMPACT /
                                                                                       MANAGEMENT




10.      Intergovernmental transfers will remain the main source of revenue for local governments. The
design of these transfers is o f crucial importance for the success o f the decentralization program. The
current systems o f intergovernmental transfers is based largely on a recurrent block grant to finance
establishment costs (e.g., including salaries) and a development grant through the Common Development
Fund (CDF) to fund capital projects.'           In addition to these flows, a significant level of international


*   Literally, "justice on the grass."
    The CDF makes available resources to realize key infrastructure projects at the local level.




                                                              4

funding contributes to local development priorities on either an on- or off-budget basis. Figure 2
illustrates the evolving systemo f transfers.
11.      The first phase o f decentralization (2000-2003) established democratic and community
development structures and initiated the process of buildingtheir capacities. Several legal, institutional,
and policy reforms were undertaken, covering roles and responsibilities o f central and decentralized
structures, financing of services, and accountability mechanisms. The second phase (2004-2008) i s meant
to consolidate and deepen decentralization by emphasizing service delivery to communities through a
well-integrated accountability network. This includes greater participation and involvement of
communities in the planning and management o f their affairs, mainstreaming "bottom-up" input into
sectoral strategies and plans, most notably District Development Plans. As part o f this second phase, a
territorial reform law came into effect in January 2006. Under the law, the number of provinces was
reduced from 13 to five (including Kigali City); the number o f districts was reduced from 106 to 30; and
the number of secteurs was reduced from 1,545 to 418 (the number of cellules, the lowest level of local
administration, remained 9,165). Local elections for district mayors and district councils were held in
February and March 2006. As part o f the GoR's civil service reform program (supported by DFID), some
central staff are beingrelocated to districts to help address capacity constraints. The thirdphase will be a
continuous process o f improving, supporting, and sustaining achievements o f the previous phases.
12.      Following the adoption o f a new Constitution and multi-party presidential and parliamentary
elections in2003, the political situation withinRwandaremains stable and, despite isolated incidences o f
corruption4, commitment to good governance remains strong. A minister in charge o f good governance
was appointed in 2004. The Office of the Ombudsman was established and elections o f mediators and
national women councilors were successfully completed. In addition, all forms o f discrimination have
been outlawed, including those relatedto identitycards inschools. Corruption i s monitored and sanctions
are applied. Accountability for decisions i s enforcedthrough a strong public service ethic that i s backed-
up by audits. As a demonstration of its continuing commitment to good governance, following
consultative meetings in late 2005, Rwanda hosted the Sixth Africa Governance Forum in May 2006 to
share experiences regarding the challenges and opportunities learned from the Africa Peer Review
Mechanismunderthe New Partnership for Africa's Development(NEPAD).
13.      Regarding governance indicators, the World Bank's 2005 Country Policy and Institutional
Assessment (CPIA) indicators for IDA-eligible borrowers were made public for the first time in June
2006. Rwanda's CPIA ratings for 2005 improved over 2004, with the overall rating increasing to 3.5
from 3.4 (out o f a possible total o f 6.0). Of the 45 Sub-Saharan African countries rated (including
Rwanda), 62 percent were rated below Rwanda and 29 percent were rated above. Rwanda's ratings for
"Cluster D," on public sector management and institutions, remained unchanged at 3.3, with a score o f
3.0 on the transparency, accountability, and corruption inthe public sector criterion (CPIA question 16).
There has been discussion around Rwanda's ranking on the Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI),
which were released by the World Bank Institute in September 2006. Caution is warranted before
drawing any conclusions from the results as the specific case of Rwanda's decline from 2004 to 2005,
especially in regard to corruption, i s very unusual, particularly due to the lack o f statistical significance.
Because the WGI estimates o f governance are based on an extremely limited number o f data sources for
Rwanda (for corruption, there were only four data sources, while the typical number i s seven for other
countries), there is a large margin o f error inthe WGI for Rwanda-in       fact, for corruption, Rwanda has a
margin of error among the highest o f all countries rated. The period 2004-2005 i s too short to identify
any trends.




     For example, the declaration of misprocurement under the Bank's Human Resources Development Project has been
     resolved,with the GoR agreeing to reimburse the Bank.


                                                           5

14.      The country still faces challenges related to improving political voice and participation. There
have been reports of limits on the freedom of expression o f political parties and the media. The GoR has
requested assistance from donors on creating more open political dialogue, and bilateral donors, such as
USAID, are actively working with the GoR in this area. For example, the US. Embassy in Kigali
organized a five-day workshop on Media Management in Kigali in October 2006, which recognized
positive steps that have been made toward freedom o f the press in Rwanda. Tensions and concerns over
the Gacaca process have resulted from the slow progress of cases, coupled with reports on improper
conduct on the part o f somejudges. In2005, jurisdictions were expanded from one tenth o f the territory
to the whole country, resulting inthe completion o f 4,000 cases.
15.      Though not without controversy and risks, Rwanda i s playing a key role in the peace process in
the Great Lakes region. The Tripartite Plus One Commission, comprised of Rwanda, the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC), and Uganda, with Burundi as an observer, has established an agreement on
the prosecution o f criminals and "negative forces" in the region. The Governments of Rwanda and the
DRC, in cooperation with the UnitedNations Mission in the DRC, have been increasingpressure on the
Forces De`mocratiquesde Liberation du Rwanda,the Rwandanrebel group ineastern Congo, to honor its
commitment to end all military activities and return to Rwanda. The GoR i s also actively pursuing
initiatives that support regional integration as a meansto reduce the political tensions inthe region.
B.       Recent Economic Developments
16.      Real GDP growth accelerated from 4 percent in 2004 to 6 percent in 2005 thanks to agricultural
production and buoyant activity in secondary and tertiary sectors, Le., manufacturing, financial services,
and communications. In 2005, agricultural production recovered while the secondary sector, mainly
supported by vigorous construction activity, remained strong despite electricity shortages and rising
energy costs that hampered industrial output. The service sector, supported by growth in finance,
transport, storage, communications, and tourism, remainedstrong. Inflationary pressure was considerably
reduced as good rain in 2005 led to abundant food supplies. As a result, as shown in Table 1, the
inflation rate, which stood at 12 percent in 2004, fell to 9 percent in 2005. To prevent inflationary
pressure in the first quarter o f 2005, the National Bank o f Rwanda (BNR) intervened to absorb the
liquidity impact o f the release o f the fiscal contingency through short-term instruments. As a result,
domestic debt as a share of GDP remained less than 5 percent at end-2005.
17.      Despite strong growth in exports in2005, the current account deficit as a share o f GDP increased
from 18 percent in 2004 to over 19 percent in 2005. Exports o f goods and non-factor services were
stronger in 2005 due to the higher price of coffee in international markets (which offset a fall in
production volume) and an increase in coltan exports. However, the level o f imports as a share o f GDP
rose from 28 percent in 2004 to 31 percent in 2005 because o f increased imports of intermediate goods,
such as construction goods, medication for donor supported health projects, and energy imports (e.g.,
generators, fuel) to remedy the electricity shortage. Significant increase in aid in 2005 translated to an
increase in net foreign assets. However, concern over the predictability o f aid caused the GoR to allow
an increase in the reserve coverage from five months in 2004 to over six months o f imports in 2005.

18.     The ratio of domestic revenue to GDP improved slightly, from 13.9 percent in 2004 to 15.1
percent in 2005. The slight improvement in domestic revenue in 2005 was largely a result o f improved
tax enforcement and collection o f tax arrears. However, total government expenditures over GDP rose
from 26.1 percent in 2004 to 28.7 percent in 2005. The increase in government spending is due to
unremunerated outlays for peacekeeping efforts in Darfur, local elections, and Gacaca trials. The
increase in spending in the second half o f 2005 was financed through accumulation o f domestic arrears.
As a result, the fiscal deficit before grants as a share of GDP, which stood at 12.2 percent in 2004,
deteriorated to 13.4 percent in 2005. Fiscal deficit including grants as a share o f GDP increased from -0.2
percent in2004 to -1.6 percent in2005.
19.     Rwanda continues to adopt measures to lay the foundation for growth and improved exports.
Over the past year, the country has continuedto undertake reforms to improve the business environment.
The 2006 Doing Business Report presented the country as a good example o f a reformer o f business
regulation in Africa, and the GoR is working to address stagnation indicated in the 2007 report. The
GoR i s moving aggressively on export promotion, elaborating an action plan based on the results o f the
Diagnostic Trade Integration Study (DTIS) and in line with the Export Promotion Strategy adopted by
Cabinet in 2004 (more details on activities under way in export promotion are discussed in Section IV
and Box 2). Moreover, the GoR has continued to strengthen service delivery in the social sectors,
particularly education and health, which is also instrumental in building the foundation to enable a
transition from a semi-subsistent, agriculture-based economy to one that i s service oriented.

20.     However, the country faces a key challenge in achieving its growth targets. Indications are that
GDP growth i s slowing to pre-1994 levels. Real GDP growth, which stood at 7 percent on average over
1995-2003, averaged 5 percent over 2004-2005. In addition, an update of growth simulations under the
PRSP indicates that GDP growth would need to be above 7 percent per annum for Rwanda to achieve
middle-income country status by 2015. To achieve growth targets that will help increase the standards of
living of the population and therefore reduce poverty, the GoR is focused on identifyingkey sources o f
growth and competitiveness. In addition to the results from the DTIS, the Bank i s supporting this effort
through analytic work for the Country Economic Memorandum (CEM), Agriculture Policy Note, and an
Investment Climate Assessment (ICA). In particular, the aim is to identify sources o f quick gains to
growth in the short-term, as well as areas for investment in the medium term, to generate long-term,
sustained growth.
21.     Preliminary results from the CEM indicate that economic growth was mainly been driven by the
primary sector, particularly staple food crops and livestock. Growth accounting analysis indicates that
over the past decade, total factor productivity (TFP) was the key source o f growth, and that human
capital was positively associated with growth. Economic reforms in the areas of trade, finance, and
exchange rate were also associated with an improvement in TFP. These results indicate that the policy
focus has been in the right direction. A continued emphasis on human development will need to be
maintained. However, to curb the fall in GDP growth, there will be a need to scale-up the focus on the
productive sectors, particularly through an increased emphasis on implementation o f measures to
improve agricultural productivity in staple food crops and livestock, which is critical for poverty
reduction. Investments ininfrastructureto reduce transaction costs, which have been identified as a major
constraint to growth and exports, will also helpto ease growth constraints inthe medium-to long-term.
C.      MacroeconomicOutlookandDebt Sustainability
22.     Poor rains in early 2006 are clouding the outlook for economic activity and food security. Dueto
the small export base, continuing energy shortages, and late rains affecting harvest, real GDP is expected
to increase modestly by 3 percent in 2006. The 2005 Crop and Food Aseassment Survey from the
Ministry of Agriculture (MINAGRI)' projected that Rwanda would have a food deficit6 of about 0.5
percent of GDP in the first half o f 2006. Inflation i s estimated to fall to 5 percent in2006 from 6 percent
in2005. Monetary policy aims at reducing inflation to 5 percent byend-2006 by limiting reserve money
growth to 13 percent, while allowing an increase inthe private sector credit. However, as Table 2 shows,
incase inflationary pressure occurs, the BNRwill tightenmonetary policy, including increasinginterest
rates.
23.     The current account deficit' is expected to widen by 2 percent of GDP compared to 2005.
Exports receipts are expected to grow by at least 6 percent, mostly reflecting an increase in the volume
and quality o f coffee. Imports are expected to increase as a result of higher demand for capital goods
stemming from the Lake Kivu methane gas project, an expected drawdown o f project accounts, and
higher diesel importsto fuel new generators leasedbyElectrogaz.
24.     On the fiscal side, the revenue to GDP ratio will remain at close to 15 percent reflecting
improvements in efficiency arising from a reduction inthe costs o f collection, as well as increases inthe
reference prices for petroleum products in 2005 and 2006, with an estimated revenue gain, will help
offset these losses. Expenditures will focus on improving the quality o f spending by channeling more
funds to PRSP priority spending and the delivery of public service. Priority spending is envisaged to
increase by 0.9 percent of GDP while non-priority spending i s expected to fall. In case food shortages

occur, funds, including resources released as a result o f the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI),

25.      Rwanda's debt situation is now more favorable than estimated at the HIPC Completion Point.
Preliminary results from the update of the Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) show that Rwanda's debt
indicators have greatly improved.'           The improvement in debt indicators reflects topping up under the
HIPC Initiative, favorable export developments, and particularly the debt reliefgranted under the MDRL9
Despitethis improvement, Rwanda's debt situation remains fragile becauseo f its narrow export base.
Thus, the GoR will continue to limit borrowing, relying instead on grant financing while implementing
its growth strategy. Under the new Low Income Country framework and to ensure that Rwanda maintains
*    The net present value (NPV) of debt-to-exports ratio is projected to amount to 58.5 percent at-2005, implying an
     improvement ofover 80 percentagepointsrelativeto projectionswhich showsNPV of 140percent.
    IMF debt relief was granted in late 2005 and became effective in January2006 under the MDRI.Rwandaalso benefitsfrom
     MDRIreliefby the Bank, which becameeffectiveJuly 2006.

a sustainable external debt position, the country will continue to require a high grant element in new
borrowing, The Bank will work closely with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in monitoring this
aspect. Overall, the macro-economic program remains on track as evidenced by the completion of the
IMF's fifth review, and the completion o f discussions for the sixth review in June 2006. The October
2006 i s ongoing and is expected to be completed by the end o fNovember 2006.
26.      In the medium-term, the GoR has formulated a private sector-led growth strategy with
agriculture and the rural economy as the leading source o f growth. The strategy aims to increase the
incomes of the vast majority o f people living in rural areas by improving agricultural productivity and
facilitating transformation from a subsistence economy to one that is oriented to production for the
market. The focus will be on adopting measures and investment to stimulate food staples (e.g., irrigation
and increased fertilizer use) as well as increased production o f non-traditional exports such as
horticultural products, pyrethrum, and hides and skins. In the medium- to long-term, growth i s expected
to be led by the private sector and, as such, the GoR i s focused on measures to improve the business
environment. The development o f the private sector requires the implementation o f structural policies for
export promotion and diversification, investment to ease production constraints inthe energy sector, and
reforms to deepen the financial sector.
27.      Regarding export promotion, specific sectoral measures will target improved production and
processing o f coffee beans, tea, and minerals. Measures will also be adopted to elaborate a strategy for
the mining sector. In the case o f export diversification, a feasibility study has been completed for the
export processing zone, and strategies are being developed for new initiatives and sub-sectors to develop
markets for hides and skins, horticulture, fruits, and handicrafts. Moreover, through the eRwanda
initiative, the GoR aims to use information communications technology (ICT) to improve the quality o f
service delivery and accountability to support growth, as well as identify opportunities where ICT can be
usedto improve dissemination o f information for small enterprises.
28.      In the energy sector, the GoR has put in place 15 megawatts (MW) of leased diesel generating
capacity which, although expensive, has substantially eased the widespread load shedding of the recent
past. In addition, the Lake Kivu methane gas project is moving ahead as scheduled. Finalization of the
gas project will allow retirement o f the diesel capacity and help to meet some o f the energy needs o f the
country at a more sustainable cost. Inthe financial sector, the BNR's supervisory powers continue to be
enhancedand an agenda for medium-term financial reform i s beingdeveloped. With regardto improving
the business environment, the focus will be on improving the road network, and removing barriers to
participation incommercial activities andtrade.
29.      In the agricultural sector, increasing agricultural productivity and raising rural incomes will be
essential to fight poverty and enhance growth. The focus here will be on implementingthe agricultural
strategy which is centered on the following four pillars: intensification and development of sustainable
production systems; professionalism o f producers; promotion o f commodity chains and agri-business
development; and institutional development.
30.      All told, priority expenditures accounted for 33 percent o f budget expenditures in 2005. As
shown in Table 3, the budget and actual expenditures for education and health has been increasing
overtime, spending increasing respectively by 11 percent and 1.5 percent between 2004 and 2005. Yet
the share of priority expenditures going to the social sectors, including education and health, declined in
2005 compared to 2004. Education, which absorbed about 53 percent o f total priority expenditures in
2004, accounted for only 38.5 percent in2005. Likewise, the allocation o f health services declined from
13.6 percent in2004 to 9 percent in2005. The increase in total priority expenditures from 2004 to 2005
was mainly due to pressing needs in the energy sector including rental power and fuel purchase on the
recurrent side. Priority capital expenditures also increased particularly for water and energy . The GoR
has also increased spending on roads, to help address hightransport costs. Unlikeeducation and health,
the share of priority expenditures to agriculture, which stood at 3 percent in2004, also rose to 4 percent

in 2005. The amount allocated to agriculture almost doubled, showing that development of agriculture
remains a highpriority for the GoR.

31.         Among the social sectors, education was given the largest allocation in 2005, Le., 12.3 % o f the
recurrent budget (including exceptional expenditures for the genocide survivors and demobilization
efforts), representing about 30 percent o f priority spending. The GoR's commitment to the formation o f
human capital i s confirmed over 2006 and 2007 as the education budget increases significantly. Within
education, 2005 expenditures for decentralized primary and secondary education were the highest, but
tertiary education still constitutes a very large proportion o f education spending as per international
experience. Health, with 4.1 percent o f overall recurrent expenditures and 9 percent of priority
expenditures, constitutes the second largest share after education. Within health services, decentralized
expenditures increase significantly overtime.                           The 2005 allocation to internal affairs (e.g.,
decentralization and national police) increased slightly, while military spending remained low.

32.       To narrow and focus the classification of priority expenditures, the GoR i s working with donor
partners on a redefinition of "priority expenditures." This exercise and the budget presentation issues are
being addressed in the context of EDPRS development. The aim is to match EDPRS objectives to
poverty reduction expenditures, which in turn would be reflected in sectoral MTEFs, and ultimately
translated into budget programs.

                                  111. Rwanda's PovertyReductionStrategy
A.        Poverty Situation and MDGs
33.       A Household Living Standards Survey (EICV 11) hasjust been completed and the data is being
compiled to feed into an update on the poverty situation in Rwanda. In the meantime, Rwanda's current
PRSP provides a good diagnosis of the causes of poverty and outlines the key objectives and actions
requiredfor reducing it. A major objective o f the PRSP is to reduce the proportion o f people inpoverty
from the current level of 60 percent to 30 percent by 2020. To achieve this, the GoR estimated in 2002
that given a consistent population growth rate of 3 percent per annum, GDP would needto grow by 6 to 7
percent annually to meet the GoR's Vision 2020 growth targets as well as other international key social
indicators'
34.       An estimate of poverty before the genocide, which used a poverty line based on the 1985
household budget survey, revealed that 50 percent o f the rural population was poor in 1990. Poverty
dramatically increased following the genocide, reaching 78 percent o f the population in 1994, including
82 percent in rural areas and 28 percent in urban areas. A 2004 Poverty Assessment estimated that long-
term growth was heavily affected by the genocide." From 1999-2001 growth averaged 6.8 percent per
annum and the proportion of poor people declined from 78 percent in 1994to 60 percent in2000. Recent
trends appear to indicate a slow down in GDP growth, which was 5 percent on average during 2001-05.
As mentioned previously, this means that an annual GDP growth rate of 12 percent would be neededto
achieve the 2020 targets (assuming poverty has not increased beyond 60 percent and the population
growth rate is still 3 percent per annum). The current annual growth rate i s therefore insufficient to meet
the target ofhalvingpovertyby2020.
35.       The 2004 Poverty Assessment showed that geographic location, household structure, education,
occupation, and access to factors o f production or modern inputs significantly determine a household's
poverty status.       Rwanda's south-western provinces o f Butare, Gikongoro, and Kibuye are poorer
compared to other provinces. Female-headed households have a higher incidence o f poverty than male-
headed households. Households working in agriculture, and especially agricultural wage laborers, are
poorer than others. Moreover, the 2000 ,household survey showed a significant change in income
inequality, with the Gini-coefficient rising to 0.46 in 2000 from 0.27 in the 1985. This increase in
inequality reflects the relative neglect o f rural areas inthe post-conflict reconstruction process as external
resources financed development and employment opportunities for urban dwellers, but primarily
humanitarian relief to rural communities. Therefore, caution is warranted to guard against urban
development becominga liability for the ruralpoor."
36.       The Poverty Assessment also noted that an additional child decreases household per capita
consumption by 20 percent, and that female-headed households have 20 percent less consumption in
urban areas and 8 percent less in rural areas, compared to male-headed households. The head o f

lo  Had the genocide not occurred, GDP would have been 30 percent higher than currentestimates, and all other factors being
    equal, povertywould be considerably lower.
    It is not clear yet whether there has been a further improvementin income poverty measures since the dramatic reductions
    that occurred soon after the genocide. ECIV I1will helpto clarify this.


                                                              13

household's level o f education has a strong impact on household members' consumption level. When the
head of household completed primary education, household consumption levels were 24 percent higher
in rural areas and 29 p,ercenthigher in urban areas compared to a household without such education.
These figures double to 54 percent and 69 percent, respectively, when the head o f household had
completed secondary education. This points to large gains in consumption from education. Estimates
tabulated from the 2001 household data indicate that widows head about 22 percent o f all households in
Rwanda and these households constitute one o f the poorest groups. The rate o f extreme poverty inthese
households is 49 percent, second only to the poverty rate in households headed by divorced women.
Households headed by elderly widows who care for their orphaned grandchildren may constitute one of
the most vulnerable sub-groups.
37.     Rwanda has had substantial success in reaching the MDGs related to gender parity in primary
education, immunization o f infants against measles, and containment o f the spread o f HIV/AIDs. The
most challenging goal i s related to reducing maternal mortality rates, which will require substantial
upgradingo f health systems. Goals relatedto primary schooling will require around US$4.5 per capita to
achieve the MDGs, and goals related to infant mortality and access to safe water will require additional
investments o f approximately US$3 per capita. Table 4 summarizes the progress made and the likelihood
of Rwandameeting MDGs.


B.      PRSPandImplementationProgress
38.     Rwanda's first PRSP, endorsed by the Bank and IMF Boards on August 12, 2002, sets out the
GoR's vision for achieving the MDGs, including reducing poverty by half by 2015. It articulates a
medium-termprogram (2002-2007) as a first step toward the GoR's "Vision 2020." The PRSP identified
the private sector as the main engine o f growth, with the transformation of agriculture and the rural
economy as the leading source of growth in the near- to medium-term. To deal with the legacies o f
genocide and structural impediments to economic transformation, the PRSP outlines five basic building
blocks for economic growth and poverty reduction: macroeconomic stability, human development, good
governance, partnership, and the prioritization of public actions; and six priority action areas: rural
development and agricultural transformation; human development; economic infrastructure; good
governance; private sector development; and institutional capacity building. The PRSP stressed the
importance o f defining sectoral strategies and associated MTEFs to guide public actions for
implementation. Development partners strongly supported Rwanda's PRSP process and have universally
commended the GoR for the consultative manner through which the PRSP was developed. Table 5 lists
all of the areas covered by Rwanda's PRSP, highlighting the selected areas o f strategic focus o f the
sequence of PRSC/Gs.

39.      PRSP Annual Progress Reports (APRs) prepared by the GoR in 2003,2004, and 2005 provide a
fair and candid review o f progress. The most recent APR and 2006 Self Assessment reviewed progress
from August 2004-July 2005. It discusses actions taken to advance toward MDGs, including the health
sector strategy developed to address maternal and child mortality, the rapid rises in gross primary
education and net primary school enrollment, and the new water and sanitation policy successfully
governing the implementation o f contract models for private operators of water systems. The APR
reports on progress in the agriculture sector and facilitation of private sector development, including the
strategies for improved agricultural productivity and export promotion, adoption o f a land law to
strengthen property rights and registration, and improvements in the business climate, particularly
contract enforcement where the time to resolve disputes was cut by more than 20 percent and attorney
fees fell by 15 percent. The APR acknowledges the need to accelerate structural reforms, particularly


                                                             16

those affecting the rural poor. The APR notes that equipment o f rural health centers i s insufficient and
the main source o f income for the rural poor, the agricultural sector, remains highly vulnerable to
climatic variability and terms o f trade shocks. The APR also emphasizes that the economy continues to
be adversely affectedby energy shortages andthat trade is impededby supply-sideconstraints.
40.       The Joint Staff Advisory Notes (JSANs) prepared by the staffs of the Bank and Fund commend
the GoR for its candid assessment ofachievements and shortfalls while highlightingthose areas that need
to be more focused and strengthened in Rwanda's second PRSP. These include (a) creation of a sound
and overarching macroeconomic framework linked to improved costing and prioritization, and which
reflects concerns over debt sustainability; (b) continued support toward an enabling environment for
private sector development, particularly implementation of productivity enhancing strategies; and (c)
continued improvement in service delivery.
41.       Cleary, the most successful area under the PRSP is service delivery. This has been underpinned
by the GoR's decentralization program, which is deconcentrating central authority and devolving
decision-making and budget implementationto district-level authorities, including responsibility for local
service delivery. As weak administrative capacity is a major challenge to decentralization and
implementation o f the GoR's reform agenda, including in the area o f service delivery, donors are
providing support for capacity building through various trust funds, pooled fbnding arrangements, and
investment projects. In particular, the Bank's Decentralization and Community Development Project i s
providing technical assistance and training to district staff to deal with new roles and responsibilities as a
result o f decentralization. As weak administrative capacity i s a major challenge to decentralization, the
PRSC/G companion Public Sector Capacity Building Project i s also supporting Rwanda's Human
Resources Institutional Development Agency (HIDA) in its efforts to identify capacity building needs
and facilitate appropriate capacity buildingactivities. HIDA i s the institution o f choice to coordinate all
capacity buildinginterventions, though its role is one o f facilitator and not implementer.
42.       A more complete evaluation of the GoR's progress under its first PRSP is being undertaken as
part o f the preparation o f the EDPRS, which i s expected to be completed in2007. The process o f EDPRS
preparation has begun, with a series o f self-evaluations o f progress under the first PRSP. Sector Working
Groups (SWGs), including all relevant stakeholders (government, development partners, and non-
governmental stakeholders), are carrying out respective evaluations o f sector performance and, based on
these, determining high-level sectoral objectives for the EDPRS. Proposed EDPRS objectives are subject
to a cross-sectoral mapping exercise, to ensure that linkages are made and overlaps avoided. Training on
the logical framework and on how to determine monitorable indicators and outputs has been completed,
with a view to establishing a clear monitoring framework for the EDPRS. A costing exercise and an
assessment o f institutional capacity will be undertaken. Local level consultations are ongoing.
43.       While service delivery will remain at its core, based on the work that has been completed so far,
the EDPRS is expected to place a much greater emphasis on the promotion of growth. This will likely
include an even more focused approach to private sector development and export promotion, and
improvements inbasic infrastructure (particularly energy and transport). Giventhe highproportion o f the
population involved in agriculture, efforts to raise agricultural productivity will also be enhanced. In
addition, capacity buildingwill be addressedas a cross-cutting issue.

C.        Linkto CAS, Other BankGroup Operations, andAnalytic Work
44.       The last full Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Rwanda was discussed by the Board in
December 2002, following the presentation o f Rwanda's first PRSP. The CAS covered the period 2002-
2005. An Interim Strategy Note (ISN), approved by the Board in August 2006, bridges the period until
the next CAS, which would follow the EDPRS and cover 2008-2010. In line with the GoR's evolving
reform program, strategic elements of the ISNinclude (a) support to service delivery through continued
strengthening of national policy development and implementation in the social sectors, with renewed

46.     The International Finance Corporation's (IFC) presence in Rwanda i s being scaled-up, with
involvement in the Lake Kivu Methane Gas Project. Estimated to cost about US$70 million, the project
involves construction o f a 35 MW power plant fueled by the methane dissolved in the deep waters o f
Lake Kivu. The GoR has signed a set o f agreements with the project developer, Dane Associates, to
create a publidprivate partnership with a State equity stake of 30 percent. IFC and Emerging Africa
Infrastructure Fund have signed a mandate letter to organize about US$50 million of debt financing
among five financiers. Rwanda is also one of six African countries selected by IFC for a special review

of the potential of its small and medium enterprise sector-a        study is being undertaken to identify
promising prospects for smaller investments by IFC. The IFC, jointly with the Bank's Private Sector
Development Department and Development Marketplace, has supported the design and implementation
of a business plan competition in Rwanda, through a collaborative effort with the private sector
federation and the Rwanda Development Bank. The first cycle o f the competition has been completed
and the design of the second cycle is being initiated. The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency's
(MIGA) effort in Rwanda has focused on complementing the Bank Group's strategy of accelerating
private sector-led growth. MIGA undertook an assessment to assist Rwanda in creating a national
investment and trade promotion capability in consultation with the Bank's departments, and
recommendations were made on the proposed Rwanda Investment Authority. Furthermore, over the
medium- to long-term, prospects for the country to attract foreign investment were reviewed.

2) Analytic Work
47.      An extensive set of analytic and advisory activities is informingthe PRSC/G program, as shown
inTable 7. This body ofwork is also providing a solid foundation for the EDPRS. Results ofthe second
household living standards survey (EICV 11) will provide a rich source of data on which both the next
PRSC/G series and the EDPRS can draw. Several pieces o f analytic work planned under the I S N will
also serve to inform the PRSC/G program going forward including, for instance, a Gender Assessment,
an Assessment o f Science and Technology Needs, and a study on Contract Arrangement for
Decentralization of Services (agriculture, education, health, water). In addition, the GoR i s carrying out
its commitment to undertake annual, sectoral public expenditure reviews (PERs). Starting with the main
sectors benefiting from PRSG support (Le., agriculture, education, health, water, and energy), the GoR
will focus on creating solid tools to undertake the PERs and progressively deepen the analysis and
expand the exercise to other sectors as local capacityto undertake PERs i s developed.

3) LessonsLearned
48.      Lessons learned from the Bank's experience in implementing projects and development policy
operations in Rwanda have shown that, in the past, operations tended to be characterized by overly
complex project design, an uncoordinated approach among various Bank interventions in differeht


                                                    21

 sectors, and insufficient attention to service delivery for the poorest. The Bank has taken these lessons
 into account inits current approach, usingthe PRSC/G program as the overall umbrella for Bank support
 and policy dialogue-in     line with the GoR's development priorities-with       project support aimed to
 complement PRSC/G objectives. Lessons from current experience continue to point to the public sector's
 acute need for human capacity development so that the GoR can implement its ambitious reform
 program. While the GoR should be commended for the successful way in which it has carried out the
 first phase of its comprehensive civil service reform program (supported by DFID), including large
 retrenchments, in the short-term it has further diminishedthe already taxed capacity o f central and local
 government ministries and agencies. To support the GoR in the second phase as it recruits, hires, and
 trains competitive candidates for new positions, the GoR and its donor partners are working together with
 HIDAto ensure that the capacity buildingneedsofthe ministries and agenciesare met.
 D.       AchievementsUnderPRSC/GIandPRSG2
 49.      The first PRSC/G series was designed to support the GoR in implementingkey policy actions
 under its first PRSP. Focus areas o f the PRSP that the PRSC/G series was meant to address include (a)
 creating a favorable private sector investment climate that would promote macroeconomic stability and
 sustained economic growth; (b) improving quality, coverage, and equity o f basic service delivery through
 improved expenditure efficiency; and (c) supporting overall improvement o f public expenditure
 management and governance, with an emphasis on transparency and accountability to citizens' voice and
 participation. In line with this agenda, the first two PRSC/Gs were focused on (a) maintaining a stable
 macroeconomic framework, creating a strong basis for private sector-led economic growth, driven by
 agricultural transformation, promotion of exports, and deepening o f the financial sector; (b)
 strengthening the results orientation of its Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) and
 associated sectoral MTEFs, particularly in education, health, water, and energy, strengthening the
Ilinkages between MTEF priorities and the budget, and supporting performance-based contracting o f
 services; and (c) strengthening o f governance and transparency, particularly through improvements to the
 fiduciary framework and empowerment o f local communities.
 50.      While final results under the PRSC/G series will be assessed at the end o f PRSG I11(end-2007),
 experience to date with the PRSC/G series indicates that support has been most successful inthe area of
 service delivery, particularly for human development services in education and health and infrastructure
 needs/services, particularly water and energy. With PRSC/G support, the GoR has ably implemented a
 contractual approach to service delivery-in       education through the transfer o f capitation grants to
 schools and in health through performance-based contracting. The PRSC/G series has also been able to
 support key infrastructure service elements-in     water through local level and private operator schemes
 and in energy through enhanced policy dialogue and complementary support from an energy project.
 Selectedachievements under PRSC/G Iand PRSGI1are summarized below and inTable 8.

 0    Education. The sector made early progress on its Education Sector Strategic Plan (ESSP) and
      related MTEF. Net primary school enrollment reached 92 percent in 2004 and 2005 (exceeding the
      PRSP target for 2008). The primary completion rate increased from 51percent in 2004 to 55 percent
      in 2005 (but fell short of the target). The Organic Education Law was adopted. Capitation grants
      were transferred successfully from the central government via districts to primary schools to cover
      the loss in fee income from the introduction of the GoR's policy of fee-free primary education
      announced at the beginning o f the PRSC/G series; the size of the capitation grant increased from
      RwF300 per student in 2004 to RwF1,OOO per student in 2005. District Education Funds to support
      particularly needy students were adopted. A Higher Education Law was passed and the National
      Council for Higher Education and the Student FinancingAgency of Rwanda were created to address
      issues intertiary education.




                                                      22

0Health. During2005, the contractual approach for community health centers, piloted in Cyangugu
  and Butare in 2004, was extended to Kigali Ngali province and Kabgayi district in 2005. Further
  investment in infrastructure and equipment at community health center and hospital levels was made
  and additional doctors and nurses were hired in 2005. Utilization o f other services increased,
  including contraceptive prevalence, assisted deliveries, and outpatient visits. Utilization o f
  insecticide treated nets increased from 4 percent in 2005 to 30 percent in2005. Utilization o f assisted
  deliveries increased to 39 percent of the population, from 29 percent in 2000. Coverage by mutuelles
  (community insurance schemes) increased from 27 percent in2004 to 41 percent in2005.
  Water. Access rate to potable water increased between 2001 and 2005 from 41 percent to 55 percent
  in rural areas and from 66 percent to 69 percent in urban areas. In 2005 an additional 598,000
  persons living in rural areas gained access to potablewater against 167,000 in2004. Functionality o f
  the rural water systems increased to 75 percent and 8 percent of the 830 piped water systems are
  privately managed. Expendituresin the water sector tripled in 2005 compared to 2004 as a result o f
  the acceleration ofphysical execution of projects inrural and urban areas.

0 Energy. In 2005, the GoR adopted a cost pass-through o f increased oil prices. Power outages were
  significantly reduced with procurement o f diesel generators (with topping up from PRSG funds) to
  supplement generation capacity, and rapid progress on the Lake Kivumethane gas development was
  made. An energy sector policy paper, including rural electrification, was adopted.

0 Private Sector/Growth. An export promotion strategy was adopted in 2004 and the Rwanda
  Investment and Export PromotionAgency (RIEPA) began to lead its implementation. Receipts from
  coffee and tea increased in 2005 and due to efforts to diversity exports, hides and skins production
  and cassiterite and coltan exports also increased in 2005. Tourism receipts and numbers o f visitors
  also increased. An Export Processing Zone (EPZ) was designated by the GoR. Implementation the
  ICT strategy began, including lying of fiber optic cable and installation o f wireless capability.
  Privatization has been undertaken (e.g., RWANATEL, RWANDEX, tea factories, banks) and
  continues. Banking sector regulation and supervision have been strengthened, a regulatory
  framework for microfinance has been created, and a School o f Finance and Banking is operational. A
  Strategic Plan for Agricultural Transformation (PSTA) i s under implementation in four priority
  program areas intensification and development o f sustainable production systems; support to
  professionalization of farmers; promotion o f commodity chains and development o f agribusiness;
  and institutional development. In 2005, a Land Law, which guarantees tenurial security and
  potentially permits the development of a land market, was published in the Official Gazette. The  ,
  land reform process i s ongoing with work to develop secondary legislation and their trial
  implementationunderway.
  Public Financial Management. The positions of Auditor General and Accountant General were
  created and appointments made in 2004. The SMARTGOV budget system was adopted. The move
  toward a Single Treasury Account has begun, with the first step o f creating zero balance drawing
  accounts; all redundant bank accounts were closed and reinforcement o f rules on opening and
  maintenance o f new accounts are enforced. A Treasury Management Committee has been
  established. Following on the Financial Accountability Review and Action Plan, a Country Financial
  Accountability Assessmentwas completed in2005.

  Transparency and AccountubiZity. A strategic planto combat corruption was under implementation.
  The media was further liberalized. A National Decentralization Steering Committee and National
  Decentralization Implementation Secretariat became operational. In 2005, the Public Procurement

Moniforing. PRSP APRs, Sector Issues Papers, and MTEFs for key sectors are produced and used
as monitoring tools. MINECOFIN reorganized its departments, and established the Strategic
Planning Unit, to better handle monitoring and evaluation. Monitoring indicators are under
development at the decentralized level, to feed into the national level monitoringand evaluation.

E.       Donor Coordination,Harmonization,andAlignment
51.      The GoR's donor partners, particularly those providing budget support (Le., AfDB, DFID, the
EU, SIDA, and the World Bank), remain committed to channelingtheir support through the framework
of the PRSP." Under this rubric, donor coordination, harmonization, and alignment have progressed
tremendously over PRSC/G I,PRSG 11, and the preparation of PRSG 111, with the Bank playing a
catalytic role. Progressively smoother coordination among donors has allowed for ever-more focused
policy discussions between the GoR and its partners. This has helped to contribute to "joint" results
under the program.
52.      Infollow-up to the RomeDeclarationon aid harmonization, PRSC Iwas the first budget support
operation prepared under the November 2003 Partnership Framework signed by the GoR and its budget
support donors at the time. Preparation o f PRSG I1built on the principles outlined in this Partnership
Framework: improving alignment with the GoR's PRSP and budget cycles, strengthening donor
coordination, decreasing overlap and duplication, and reducing transaction costs for the GoR in dealing
with donors and managing development assistance. The Budget Support Harmonization Group,
established under the Partnership Framework, has served to enhance collaboration and i s now an
institutionalized mechanism for dialoguing with the GoR and each other on planned support.
53.      The GoR has progressively taken over the lead o f donor coordination and i s now firmly in
control. For the preparation o f PRSG 111, the GoR prepared the agenda and well-developed substantive
presentations for joint reviews. The GoR organized the following reviews, in line with the calendar
agreed by the GoR and donors:

0   Joint Public Financial Management Review. The GoR and donors agreed to hold the joint public
    financial management review eachyear inMarch, inline with the IMF's review. The public financial
    management review focuses on the GoR's progress on its public financial management reform
    program-at    the core o f donors' budget support programs-and    priority actions for the coming year,
    as well as goals for the medium-term.

0   Joint Budget Execution Review. Based on previous years' experience, the GoR and budget support
    partners adjusted the timetable slightly, agreeing to hold the first joint budget execution reviews in
    April, once the budget execution report for the previous year is available. This first review o f budget
    execution i s backward-looking, focusing on progress against plans and targets for the previous year.
    The second budget review is held in September, once the GoR's draft Budget Framework Paper for
    the coming year is available. This second review discusses planned sectoral and sub-sectoral budget
    allocations and expenditures at the national and district levels, in view o f the links to the PRSP
    agendafor growth, poverty reduction, andhuman development outcomes.

0   Sector Reviews. Respective sector "cluster" groups (first established in 2002) lead sector reviews,
    aligning the timing of such reviews with the PRSP and budget cycles. Each major sector has a cluster
    around which input from relevant government agencies, donors, and other stakeholders i s organized.
    A lead government agency and lead donor coordinate the cluster's activities. The education and
    health sectors have been particularly active; the agriculture and water clusters have made tremendous
    progress over 2005 and 2006; energy, part of the infrastructure cluster, has had a more difficult time
    given its cross-cutting nature and lack o f strong cluster leadership. For 2006, the SWGs established
    for EDPRS development have taken the lead on sector reviews.
54.      The above feeds into the overarching donor coordination body in Rwanda, the Development
Partners' Coordination Group, which meets monthly and i s co-chaired by the GoR and United Nations
Resident Coordinator (a sub-group on Harmonization and Alignment in Rwanda for Projects and

'*  GermanyandCanadahaveexpressedan interestinmovingto providingbudget support inthe future.

Programs i s comprised of the GoR and non-budget support donors with a secretariat hosted by the United
Nations Development Program). Annex 6 offers more details on harmonization and alignment in
Rwanda.
55.     As with PRSC/G Iand PRSG 11,the PRSGI11policy matrix and prior actions are drawn directly
from the GoR's PRSP matrix. Duringthe review process outlined above, the Bank, inclose collaboration
with the GoR, assesseswhether the prior actions and indicative triggers under the PRSC/G (a) continue
to reflect the most important dimensions o f the program; and (b) have progressed as expected. While at
the moment only the World Bank and AfDB use a common Performance Assessment Framework (PAF),
budget support donors have agreedto try, inthe context o fthe EDPRS, to moveto a PAF usedby all.
56.     Duetojoint donor discussions withthe GoR, significant progress has beenmade on alignment of
donor disbursements with the GoR's budget cycle. As with PRSC/G Iand PRSG 11, PRSG I11
disbursements are designed to be aligned to the GoR's budget cycle. As such, PRSG 111i s expected to
disburse by end-2006 so that funds will be available to the GoR in January 2007, the beginning o f the
GoR's fiscal year. Other budget support donors, including AfDB, DFID, the EU, and SIDA, are also
aiming to frontload their disbursements, largely during the first (or early second) quarter o f Rwanda's
fiscal year. Some improvement on predictability has also been made, most notably with the signing o f a
Memorandum o f Understanding by the GoR and the United Kingdom for a three-year rolling program o f
budget support within a new, 10-year agreement on Britishbilateral developmental assistance.

                    IV. ProposedThird PovertyReductionSupportOperation
A.      Overview
57.     PRSG 111would help the GoR build on the successes with decentralized service delivery under
PRSC/G Iand PRSG 11, particularly in education, health, water, and energy. PRSG 111would continue to
help the GoR maintain a stable macroeconomic framework, creating the basis for private sector-led
economic growth, driven by agricultural transformation, export promotion, financial sector deepening,
and ICT, which is expected to be a main focus o f the EDPRS. PRSG I11would also help the GoR to
strengthen further the linkages between strategic planning, its MTEF, and budgeting, with a particular
focus on the service delivery sectors. PRSG 111would continue to help the GoR improve governance and
transparency through further reforms to the fiduciary framework and empowerment o f local
communities. Given important linkages to the growth agenda, the policy dialogue inthe transport sector,
introduced under PRSC 11, would continue while, at the GoRs request, dialogue on social protection
would be added.
58.     Key achievements under PRSC/G Iand PRSG I1were outlined above (Section 111, D and Table
8). At the end o f PRSG I11(end-2007) results under this first PRSC/G series for Rwanda will be assessed.
The overarching results framework on which the assessment will be based is shown in Table 9. The
expected outcomes and selected outcome indicators shown are linked to the specifics o f the PRSC/G
program inRwanda (which inturn is linkedto the GoRs PRSP) and the MDGs. The expected outcomes
shown are, for the most part, higher order outcomes than the output targets used in Rwanda's PRSP
matrix. Annex 5 includes more specific indicators for key sectors that will also be considered in
assessingthe results o fthe PRSC/G program.

59.      PRSG IIIprior actions are set out in Table 10 (they are the bolded items from the PRSP policy
matrix inAnnex 2) along with the PRSP aredobjective to which they relate. Reflectingthe GoR's highly
ambitious nature, there are (as with PRSC/G Iand PRSG 11) 13 prior actions, in some cases with sub-
actions embeddedtherein.
60.      Most of the prior actions were achieved as planned. However, in the case o f tea factory
privatization, although three were privatized, based on experience from previous privatizations, the GoR
has decided to re-evaluate the approach for the next round o f privatizations. Based on experience from
the Pilot Phase of privatization for Pfunda and Mulindifactories, the GoR realized that the offered price
for the factories was below their value. For example, inthe case of Pfunda, the investors will get back the
amount they paid for the factory in less than two years. As a result, the GoR has decided to reassess its
privatization strategy and at the same time to rehabilitate the factories, upgrading the machinery and
plants, before offering them for sale. Thus, it will be approximately two years before the six factories are
offered for sale. Inthis context, the prior action for private-sector-led growth has been revised to focus on
the development of the financial sector, with a focus on strengthening micro-finance institutions.

61.      Going forward, the private sector-led growth objective will focus on the development o f the
financial sector, given its importance to growth. Preliminary results from the CEM identify access to
finance and cost of finance as among the major constraints identified by firms. Although the ranking o f
constraints differed according to the size o f the firm (i.e. micro versus large manufacturing), access to
finance was consistently ranked as a major obstacle to business development. In terms o f broad-based
access to finance, micro-finance institutions have a strong role to play, and the PRSG series will
gradually scale up support to policy development inthis sector.
62.      In addition, in the case of procurement, while the Parliament technical commissionhas now
discussed and i s ready to submit to the Parliamentaryplenary session for adoption a Procurement Law, a
review by the Bank legal expert revealed that the draft Law, as it stands, is not aligned with international
best practice. The GoR i s coordinating with Parliament on this issue, and the GoR and the Bank are in
close dialogue working together to ensure that the country has a procurement law that will serve it well.
Thus, the law is beingre-examined. Inthe interim, standard biddingdocuments have been prepared and
will be adopted following the promulgation o f the Procurement Code. A roadmap has been prepared for
the implementation of the new institutions created by the Procurement Code and companion legislation
on the Rwanda Public Procurement Authority (RPPA). Training was provided, mainly to decentralized
procurement entities.
Slight revisions to the prior actions for energy and monitoring and evaluation have also been made. In
the energy sector, the GoR, working with donors, has made significant progress in over 2005-06 in
gettingthe sector budget and MTEF in order. Inthe energy sector, the GoR, working with donors, has
made significant progress in over 2005-06 in getting the sector budget and MTEF in order as well as on
tariff issues. However, due to the limitedcapacity inthe sector, this left little time to focus on energy and
gas legislation for the sector. The preparation o f sector legislation will be a focus going forward, and an
international legal firm has been recruited to assist in the drafting. In the area o f monitoring and
evaluation, the GoR has decided to adopt the Citizen Report Card as the monitoring instrument for
programs implementedunder the PRSP; thus, this has beenreflected inthe prior action.
63.      Based on the GoR's strong track record, a second PRSC/G series is expected to be launchedwith
PRSG IV.PRSG IV will support the GoR to implement its EDPRS. In line with current practice, prior
actions for PRSGIV will be drawn from the EDPRS policy matrix, and thus the specific prior actions for
PRSC IV would be discussed with the GoR once the EDPRS matrix i s finalized. However, based on
discussions with the GoR in the context o f EDPRS preparation, and given the likelihood that there will
be continuation of activities inthe areas supported by the first PRSC/G series, PRSG IV is expected to
maintainthe following areas o f focus:
    Education. The focus will likelycontinue to be on the alignment o fthe ESSP, the education MTEF,
    and budget allocations to the sector. Policy dialogue on the use o f capitation grants, and the related
    issue o f improving quality of primary education (the need to increase numbers of teachers and
    discussion o f performance incentives), will be priority
    Health. The focus will likely continue to be on support for continued success inthe implementation
    of contractual schemes for health services. Policy dialogue on the use o f the contractual approach for
    health services and community health centers will remain a priority.




                                                     29

    Water. The focus will likely continue to be on increasing private operation o f rural water supply
    systems. Policy dialogue on the decentralized approach to water services and enhanced donor
    coordination to support the sector will remainpriorities.
    Energy. The focus will likely continue to be on putting in place a strong regulatory framework for
    the sector, including one that allows for transparent tariff structuring.       Policy dialogue on the
    development of the sectoral MTEFwill also continue to be a priority.
    Private Sector/Growth. The focus will likely be two-pronged: development o f the financial sector,
    particularly the microfinance sector so that microenterprises contribute to the growth agenda; and
    agricultural productivity, which will remain the main source o f economic growth until the private
    sector develops further. Policy dialogue on the implementation o f water management in the
    Agricultural Sector and irrigation schemes will be a priority for the agriculture sector.
    Public Financial Management. The focus will likely continue to be on the macroeconomic
    framework, links between the budget and the MTEF, and production o f a budget execution report
    that i s submitted to the Auditor General and presented to Parliament. Policy dialogue on public
    financial managementat decentralized levels will be a priority.
    Transparency and Accountability. The focus will likely continue to be on financial management
    procedures and procurement. Policy dialogue on the procurement law will be a priority.
    Monitoring. The focus will likely continue to be on the use o f Citizen Report Cards, which
    promotes accountability of government to citizens and citizens' voice. Policy dialogue on building
    the GoR's capacity for monitoring and evaluation will be a priority as this was one of the weakest
    areas under the GoR's first PRSP.
B.       P R S G I11Reform Program
64.      The PRSG I11reform program continues support for (a) improving service delivery ineducation,
health, water, and energy, with dialogue inthe transport and social protection sectors; (b) private sector-
led growth and agriculture transformation; and (c) public sector underpinnings for improved service
delivery.
1) Improving Service Delivery for the Poor: Education, Health, Water, Energy, Transport
and SocialProtection
a) EducationServices
65.      Current Issues. The MTEF three-year planning horizon which has consistently figured in this
series o f PRSC/G helpedto focus sector priorities to meet the MDGs, Vision 2020, and Education Sector
Policy goals. There have been remarkable achievements in access to primary school. From the point at
which primaryeducation became fee-free, net enrollment for both genders has remained at just under 95
percent. This exceedsthe target o f 90 percent for 2008, set at the beginningo f this PRSC/G series.
66.      The challenge, however, is that Rwanda must scale up to improve quality in order to achieve
universal primary school completion by 2015. The current mechanisms, as well as the funding, for doing
so are inadequate. The Government estimates that the Education Sector Strategic Plan (ESSP) has a
financing gap of US$172 million even for the short term (2007-2009).
67.      There has been no appreciable increase in the primary school completion rate (55 percent in
2006, significantly lower than the projected 64 percent by the end o f this PRSC/G series) or in reducing
repetition (19 percent) and drop-out (14 percent) rates. Two main factors motivate drop-out: the cost of
education and failure. An estimated 35 percent of households withdraw their children due to inability to
afford the cost of uniforms, textbooks and lunch. An additional 30 percent cite failure on the primary



                                                    30

school leaving exam as the main reason for dropping out (CWIQ survey). Gender equity i s compromised
by the high failure rates. Fewer girls complete primary school and they fail the exit exam in larger
numbers.As a result, more girls are barred from secondary schools and end up inlarge numbers inlesser
quality, fee-paying private schools.
68.     Far stronger mechanisms are needed to ensure that the minimum basic inputs essential for
learning are present in schools: a teacher regularly working in every classroom, sufficient teaching and
learning materials, a budget for school operating costs and student support, and regular monitoring o f
learning outcomes. The Ministry of Education estimates that an additional 2400 teachers will be needed
in 2007-2009 to meet the projected expansion inprimary education enrolments until2012; otherwise the
pupil to teacher ratio will remain at 65 to 1 or higher. The risk i s that scaling out traditional methods o f
recruiting and training teachers will be slow and insufficient since the pre-service teacher training is too
long. Furthermore, although most primary school teachers are "qualified" according to national
standards, they are not actually equipped with the skills and competencies needed to deliver effective
teaching. Teaching and learning materials are still rarely available in schools, so rapid improvements in
the capacity of the system to purchase the materials must be realized if the planned ratio o f 1 book per
pupil in core subjects i s to be attained. Greater attention will need to be paid to how well a streamlined
curriculum and relevant textbooks are sequenced and geared to the age and learning capabilities o f the
children, with a more specific focus on learner outcomes and essential skills.
69.      To improve quality and maintain the currently high level o f enrolment inprimary school requires
both an increase in funding and tackling inefficiencies inthe allocation and use o f resources. There has
been a decline intotal public expenditure on education as a share o f total Government expenditure: from
19.3 percent in 2003 to 16.3 percent in 2006. While within this envelope the expenditures on primary
education increased, rising from 40 to 45 percent between 2003 and 2006 following agreed MTEF
parameters, spending on primary is still below the benchmark 50 percent suggestedby the Education for
All Fast Track Initiative. There has been some rebalancing of expenditures across sub-sectors. Tertiary
expenditures fell from 35 percent in 2003 to 31 per cent o f recurrent education expenditure in 2005, but
tertiary spending rose to 49 percent in 2006, and the 2007 budget foresees 46 percent. The increases
largely stem from an upwards adjustment o f salaries inhigher education.
70.      Government Strategy/Implementation Progress. The Ministry o f Education has made the shift
in focus to improving quality and is committed to bring results. This is in addition to the trend that
Government has already established to increase recurrent non-salary expenditures for primary. These
increased from 16 to 43 percent over 2003-2006 which raised nominal recurrent expenditure per student
from US$28 to US$40. The increase is mainly due to the capitation "block" grant that i s transferred to
primary schools. The grant continues to be well executed, and Government has programmed an increase
to 3800 FRW for budget year 2007 (see diagram on "Evolution o f pre-primary and primary education
spending.").
71.      In addition, the Government completed an Education Sector Long Term Strategy and Financing
Framework (LTSFF) for the next ten years (2006-2015). The LTSFF i s underpinned by the Education
Sector Strategic Plan (ESSP) and was well received by donors at the 2006 World Bank/Ih4F Annual
Meetings in Singapore. Onthe basis o fthis plan, the GoR is hopingto secure funding from the Education
for All Fast Track Initiative (EFA-FTI), from which it has requested endorsement, to fill the financing
gap to achieve universal primary education. The LTSFF calls for a 21 percent decrease in the share o f
public funding for higher education by 2010, and corresponding increases to 50 percent for basic
education and 20 percent for secondary education.

                         Box 1. Education Sector Trends and the GoR's Planto Address Them
 Issues. The net primary enrollmentrate in Rwanda reached92 percent in 2004, exceedingthe PRSP target of 90 percent for 2008,
 but remainedflat from 2004 to 2005. The primary school completionrate increasedfrom 51 percent to 55 percent, but fell short of
 the projected 64 percent for 2005. Considerable effort will be required to meet the Education Sector Long Term Strategy and
 FinancingFramework (LTSFF) target of 84 percent for 2007. The drop-out ratefell from 15 percent to 14 percent over 2004-2005;
 the target is 10 percent for 2008. These statistics underscore the urgency to implement and effectively manage the delivery and
 content of instructionthat keeps childrenin school. A more targetedstrategy for capitationand/or district educationgrantsmay also
 be needed to sharpen pro-poor measures since evidence from Citizen Report Card surveys in 2004 and 2005 shows that many
 childrenstill dropout becauseof high cost.

 With the introductionof fee-free primary education, primary pupil-classroomand pupil-teacherratios are showing anegativetrend,
 increasing from 57 percent to 63 percent, and from 66 percent to 69 percent, respectively, over 2003-2005. In 2005, recurrent
 budget execution rates for primary and secondaryschool constructionwere 122percent and 82 percent, respectively, but the actual
 number of classroomsconstructed fell short of the annual increase requiredto meet 2012 targets for implementingnine-year basic
 education. This implies a need for supplemental funds in the short term and a more robust approach to construction through
 decentralized financing and other options. The number of teachers rose in 2005, but enrollments rose faster (the primary gross
 enrollment rate increased from 129 percent to 140 percent). More alarming is that despite increases in teacher numbers, not all
 show up to work. In Citizen Report Card surveys, 42 percent of respondents reported that teachers were available only
 "sometimes." While MINEDUC recognizesthat teacher motivation is aconcern, andthat this is directly relatedto low salary levels,
 resourcesare not availableto meet teachers' needs nor recruit additionalteachers inthe largenumbers needed. Finally, expenditure
 performance needs to improve and additional funding is needed for textbook provision and curriculum development. Where
 textbooksare available inprimaryschools, the ratio is 1bookto 3 students; the ratio for secondaryschoolis 1 to 12.

 Action Plan. Over the courseof2006-2007, MINEDUC, with assistancefrom development partners, plansto updateESSPcostings
 inline with the LTSFF.Rwanda's requestfor fundingfrom the EFA-FTI hasbeenendorsedby the local donors(October 2006) and
 i s under considerationat EFA FTI internationallevel. As part of EDPRS preparation, an analysis and report on the impact and
 performance of the capitationgrant, District Education Fund, and FARG (fund to support children orphaned by the genocide) in
 regard to the poor is being undertaken. MINEDUC will work with MINECOFIN and MINALOC to explore targeted capitation
 grants based on poverty criteria. In addition, MINEDUC is conductingtracer studies to track the relation between education and
 school leavers' and graduates' employment and income earningto providean empiricalbasefor policy decisions on vocational and
 technical training, which has been identified as an area of potentially greater impact on the poor. MINEDUC has contracted
 UNESCO to assist in setting up an EducationManagement Information System (EMIS) capable of providing disaggregateddata
 relevantfor education sector analysis at MINEDUC and all provincesand districts, which will allow for improvedmonitoring and
 accountabilityfor results.

 MINEDUC is also to work with MINECOFIN, MINALOC, and other appropriate stakeholdersto identify modalitiesand agree on
 financing to implement the minimum primary school package (teachers, textbooks, classroom construction, capitation grant).
 MINEDUC and decentralized authorities are to define a matrix of roles and responsibilities of central, provincial, district, and
 school decisionmakers, including ParentTeacher Associations and Boards of Governors, to implement the minimum package.To
 manage growth to plan and carry out rehabilitation and construction of new classrooms/schools and provide teaching materials,
 MINEDUC is to take the leadinclarifying and strengtheningprocurementproceduresfor MINEDUC and decentralizedentities, in
 follow-up to directivesof the National Tender Boardand institutional procedures under the territorial reform law. Before finalizing
 the Teacher Development and Management Policy, MINEDUC is to work with MIFOTRA to re-examine teachers' working
 conditions and recommend enhancements, and recommend a financially sustainable method of recruiting additional teachers to
 meet needs.

 Inconjunctionwith the PER exercisebeingundertaken, MINEDUC is to work with MINECOFIN to reachconsensus on financial
 reporting by institutions of higher education, semi-autonomousgovernment agencies, districts, and other decentralizededucation
 entities. By November 2006, an Education Public Annual Expenditure and Performance Monitoring Report (EPMR) should be
 reportedagainst MTEF budget lines for central and decentralized education sector spending of 2005. This is to establish a process
 for publishingsubsequent EPMRson aquarterly basis.

 The Government's meetings (October 2006) with the IMF andbudget support donors onthe 2007 budgetagreedthat the allocation
 to wages of expatriate teachers in higher education will be capped at the level of the 2006 budget. The Government will also
 progressivelyincreasethe level of cost sharingintertiary education by reducingthe number of higher educationstudentsbenefiting
 from financial assistanceto 90 percent in2008 and 95 percentin2009, consistentwith the LTSFF. This will free up more domestic
 public resources for primary and basic education as advocated in the local donors' endorsement of Rwanda's application for
 external financingfrom the EFA FTI.

6) Health Services
75.     Current Issues. Following on PRSC/G Iand PRSG I1 support for implementation o f the
contractual approach for community health, health centers, and mutuelles (local insurance schemes), as
well as for district hospitals, the overall direction and pace o f progress in the health sector remains
strong. However, there are several issues to address. The first pertains to the relationship between the
performance-based contracting approach and increases in health worker wages. Although the approaches
may be complementary, performance-based contracting with health facilities is fundamentally intended
to better serve the population and achieve MDG-oriented results; there i s no direct commitment to health
worker wages, an important implication for containing the GoR's fiscal risk. It is also a priority at this
stage o f implementation of the contractual approach to strengthen the independent reporting mechanisms
and have timely feedback on results inthe districts, to make any necessary adjustments duringthe scale-
up, andto ensurethat the quality ofservices is not compromised.
76.      The very rapid increase in the budget o f King Faycal hospital in Kigali over 2005, much o f
which was not programmed in the budget, has been a key concern. The institution represents a large
burden on public expenditureswhile the quantity of service delivery is low. The position ofthis hospital
inthe tertiary delivery andtraining system, its legal statute, and its productivity are critical issues which
have been addressed in 2006. The budget of the hospital has been capped inthe 2006 revised budget law
and the planned 2007 budget.
77.     As with other sectors, the territorial reform has led to major changes in the health sector. The
new district administrations are now incharge o fhealthadministration and new responsibilities are being
given to the hospitals to provide technical supervision o f health centers. Close attention to the
consequences o f these governance changes i s important, to ensure that the Ministry o f Health
(MINISANTE)has necessaryresourcesto support implementation.Insome instances, it may make sense
to outsource activities (e.g., technical support, training).
78.      Government Strategy/ImplementationProgress. The budget execution rate in 2005 was in the
85-90 percent range. However, the overall rate o f executionmasks the fact that execution for specialized
care was about 120 percent, due to a mid-year reallocation to tertiary hospitals. The target for public
spending on health as a share o f the overall government budget is 9 percent for 2006 and 10 percent for
2007. For 2005, the share was 7.9 percent, with current programming of 8.4 percent for 2006. Thus, the
trend is in the right direction and close to the targeted level. However, this is mainly due to the
development budget (largely donor financed) while the recurrent budget for health as a share o f the total
government recurrent budget remains quite low, close to 5.5 percent.
79.      The Demographic Health Survey shows a 25 percent decrease in under-five mortality between
2000 and 2005, bringingthe rate back to pre-genocide levels. At 3 percent o f the adult population, HIV
prevalence i s stabilizing, although female and urban residents experiment a higher rate o f infection.
Surveillance data also show a decreasing trend in HIV prevalence. Good progress on vaccination rates
continues-the      overall rate increased from 89 percent in 2004 to 95 percent in 2005 for DPT3
~pecifically.'~Coverage by mutuelles increased from 27 percent in 2004 to 41 percent in 2005 and 55
percent in 2006. 2005 also saw further investment in infrastructure and equipment at community health
center and hospital levels and additional doctors and nurses were hired. Utilizationo f other services also
increased, including contraceptive prevalence, assisted deliveries, and outpatient visits. The upwardtrend
of per capita utilization rate continued, increasing from 0.4 to 0. 7 per capita per year. Utilization o f
insecticidetreated nets increased from 4 percent in2005 to close to 40 percent in 2007 and utilization o f
assisted deliveries increased to 39 percent o f the population, from 29 percent in 2000. The number o f

''  These rates are basedon routine reporting.The recentlycompletedDemographic and Health Survey (2005) gives a slightly
    lower figure, which is typicallythe case.

people living with HIV treated by Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) has also dramatically
increased.
80.      During2005, the contractual approach for health centers was extended beyond the original two
pilot sites of Cyangugu and Butare to Kigali Ngali province and Kabgayi district. In 2006, the program
has been fully transferred to the GoR's budget, which expanded the program to all health centers in the
country, transferring about US$0.50 per capita in 2006 (to be increased to US$1 per capita in 2007. A
steering committee has been established in each province to independently monitor the performance of
the health centers using Lot Quality Sampling and satisfaction surveys techniques. The results of the
independent verification directly affect the amount o f fundingreceived by the center. The impact of these
schemes on health outcomes are currently being evaluated through using a randomized controlled
prospective design.
81.      Duringscale-up of contractual approaches over 2006, transfers based on population (rather than
staffing levels) should ensure that resources are in line with the potential volume o f service delivery, in
accordance with the objectives of the contracts. Population-based allocations are to be implemented over
the next 12-18 months inthe seven districts selected for a Bank-financed impact evaluation study. Going
forward, achieving full autonomy of all health facilities and the associated civil service reform will
provide an opportunity to clarify the relationship between health workers, facilities, the government, and
issues o f compensation. Further options to move ahead on individual basedperformancethrough private
sector employment or through specific civil service rules for health workers can be considered in this
context.
82.      The community health schemes, which transfer about US$0.25 directly to municipalities to
engage, via a performance-based contract, community-based institutions, NGOs, associations o f health
promoters, private operators, and so on to deliver essential services at the household or community level,
was operationalized in several districts over 2005. In 2006, the approach is being scaled-up nationally.
The centralgovernment signedperformance contracts with the 30 municipalities inApril 2006, including
the use of Insecticide Treated Bed Nets as the key performance indicator. There is also increasing
collaboration between the health and water sectors, particularly to use the community health contracting
schemes to improve access to clean water. Figure 5 illustrates results in the health sector: utilization o f
highimpact health services such as assisted deliveries at birthhas increased faster in districts where the
performance basedcontracts were implemented. Inlight o f this finding, government o f Rwanda has been
fundingthe national expansion o fthe approach.
83.      Some provinces have already initiated the performance based approach for district hospitals. The
scaling-up of the implementation o f the contracting approach in district hospitals i s planned for 2007.
However the process needs further refinement and the level o f funds to be made available, mainly
through a common basket established by donors, remains uncertain.
84.      The national committee for the scale-up of the contracting approach is very active, and will
benefit from a district mapping o f donor support for implementation. However, it i s not certain whether
the committee will have the capacity to monitor and evaluate progress o f the scale-up. Support from the
school o f public health would help, but would require appropriate funding. Budget resources for the
contracting approach have been reviewed so that appropriate proposals are incorporated into the 2007
budget.

85.      Mutuelles, which pool funds from community members to cover a package o f basic health

tertiary care by the poor.
86.      Finally, regardingbudget needs, in line with the GoR's presentation o f Rwanda as a case study at
the HighLevel Forum for Health in Tunis inJune 2006, the GoR and its donor partners are expected to
sign a "compact" (by mid 2007) setting out mutual responsibilities to better harmonize and stabilize
donor funding with the GoR's health sector strategic plan. This harmonization will be enhanced by
properly costed plans feeding into a sustainable sector MTEF. The ideal i s for the maximum amount
possible of donor fundingto pass through the GoR's budget, while financing that remains off-budget will
at a minimumbe harmonizedwith strategic priorities.
c) Water Services
87.      Current Issues. The water sector performed extremely well in 2005-both               priority expenditures
and results increased exponentially during the year compared to previous years. Water and sanitation
expenditures tripled in 2005 compared to 2004, providing access to clean water to an additional 598,000



                                                                 36

people. Functionality of the rural water systems increased to 75 percent and 8 percent of the 830 piped
water systems are privately managed. The key issue for this sector is now to ensure the adequate level o f
financing to further scale up and reach the MDGs.
88.     In2005, 55 percent of the rural population and 69 percent ofthe urban population had access to
potable water; 85 percent o f the population had traditional household sanitation facilities, but only 8
percent of these were considered hygienic, on-site sanitation. For Rwanda to reach the water and
sanitation MDGs (i.e., provide 85 percent of the population with access to potable water and 66 percent
                                                                          with    access    to   hygienic

89.     Government Strategy/Implementation Progress. The access rate to potable water increased
between 2001 and 2005 from 41 to 55 percent in rural areas and from 66 to 69 percent inurban areas. In
2005, an additional 598,000 persons living in rural areas gained access to potable water against 167,000
in 2004. As a result of the acceleration of physical execution of projects in rural and urban areas,
investments and expenditures tripled in2005 comparedto 2004, from RwF3.8 billionto RwF12.4 billion.
90.     Domestic funding for the Ministry of Water's (MINITERE) water and sanitation agendas
represented 19.5 percent of the total 2005 budget, with 56 percent for rural water, 42 percent for urban
water, and 2 percent for water resources management. In the urban sector, Kigali's capacity production
was enhanced by 16,000 cubic meters per day with the construction of 14 new wells. As a result o f
rehabilitation and network extensions, about 56,700 additional people benefited from improved water
services inthe Kigali area while about 39,000 people benefited from improvedwater services inthe town
of Butare. Regarding sanitation, all the districts in their performance contracts signed with government
have committed to expand household sanitation coverage upto 100percent.
91.     The reform o f the management of piped rural water systems is also progressing well. The target
of 10 percent o f the 830 piped water systems to be privately managed by late 2006 was reached easily.
The Water and Sanitation Program (WSP-AF) supports a sensitization program for districts to boost this
reform. MINITERE will also provide pipes and meters to interested districts to facilitate immediate
commercial management o f the water systems by local private operators. Functionality o f the ruralwater
systems has increased from 70 to 75 percent between 2001 and 2005 due to rehabilitation and better
management o f facilities.

92.      Buildingon achievements supported by PRSC/G Iand PRSG 11, the GoRs strategy includes a
double move: from projects to a sector-wide approach and budget support, and from a centralized to a
decentralized approach, with districts fully incharge. The GoR will continue to support the strengthening
o f the technical capacity of MINITERE at the central and regional levels to support the districts to plan,
design, execute, and manage their water and sanitation projects. The GoR also plans to build on the
successful pilot experience in 2006 and significantly increase, from 2007, direct financing for district
water projectsthat increase access to reliable, affordable, and sustainable water and sanitation services in
rural areas (for which technical design and tender documents are available). Other activities include
strengthening donor coordination, elaboration o f a realistic 2007-2009 results-oriented program budget,
and establishment o f a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation system. For the urban water sector, the
GoR plans to continue to increase water production capacity, particularly in Kigali, to improve the
reliability and quality of services and to continue rehabilitation and extension o f networks in secondary
towns. For water resources management, the GoR i s adopting a program o f coordinated sector
interventions and investments focused on the integrated and sustainable development o f water resources
and protection o f the environment, along with the establishment o f a comprehensive Water Information
System.
93.      The decentralized approach for water and sanitation is definitively gaining ground. Since 2002,
RwF7 billion has been directly executed by the districts, with the support o f projects, the CDF, and
NGOs. Another step forward was achieved in 2006 with the successful implementation o f district water
supply projects directly financed from the national budget. A new water law, to improve the legislation
and regulation framework governing water resources planning and management, was drafted in 2005 and
is expected to be adopted in 2006.
94.      Sector coordination and donor harmonization significantly improved over 2005. A coordination
group was formed to oversee donor interventions, develop a comprehensive, medium-term, country-
owned program, and monitor and evaluate sector achievements. A steering committee for sector
coordination was also formally established under the leadership of MINITERE and AfDB. The first
annual sector review took place inOctober 2005, followed by a meetinginDecember 2005 to discuss the
sector monitoring and evaluation system, and a meeting inMarch 2006 to present business opportunities
to the national private sector. Weekly meetings with project managers, technical assistants, and ministry
staff are organized and chaired by the minister in charge of water to ensure better planning and close
projectlprogram coordination and monitoring. In addition, the implementation units o f the AfDB and
World Bank rural water supply and sanitation projects have partially merged and work with the same
procedures.
d) Energy Services
95.      Current Issues. The economy continues to suffer due to the high cost o f oil imports and
unreliable power supply. The GoR has attempted to mitigate the impact via relatively small grant support
to Electrogaz in the form of capacity payments for rental power, and partial payment for fuel for
Electrogaz generation. Consumers bear most o f the adjustment cost for additional power supplies, with
the December 2005 tariff increase reaching 150 percent above the level of a year earlier (the poorest
segments of society were not affected by the tariff increase since they do not have access to electricity).
In addition, in January 2006 the GoR converted the Electrogaz management contract with Lahmeyer
International to a consultant contract. This change was made inmutual recognition o f the difficulties both
sides encountered in contract implementation. Electrogaz management is now being operated by
Rwandan nationals.
96.      The overall process o f energy sector budget planning and execution has been quite ad hoc. In
2005, due to the evolution of events inthe sector and priority shiftingto Kivu methane gas development,
nearly all of the energy ministry's (MININFRA) actual expenditures were disbursements to an unplanned



                                                     38

category-government       equity in the Kibuye Stage One Power Project. Other 2005 government
expenditures on energy supplies, including the acquisition of diesel generators for Electrogaz and
payment o f capacity charges for rental diesel generators, did not appear under MININFRA's budget. The
GoR is a significant consumer o f electricity and oil products (expenditures on which are properly
recorded under individual ministries' budget lines)-roughly       US$20 million per year on electricity and
oil products (including fuel for self-generation), or about 15 percent of the total market for modem
energy (not counting consumption by parastatals). The GoR also earns significant revenues from energy
taxation-about     US$20 million from oil products taxation (i.e., import duties, VAT, other taxes) and
about US$10 million from VAT on electricity sales. However, such expenditures and revenues are not
captured by MININFRA (or any other government agency) in a consolidated way.
97.      Given the ad-hoc nature of recordingenergy expenditures and revenues across the government, it
is difficult to get a complete picture of the energy sector, and thus difficult for the GoR to plan for energy
sector needs in an integrated way. Many energy sector investments, particularly those in the electricity
supply industry, tend to be large, lumpy, and with long gestation periods, with the effect that annual
development expenditure targets cannot be easily set or complied with. It i s generally recognizedthat the
major constraint in this regard i s MININFRA's lack of capacity for strategic planning and budget
preparation. MININFRA i s beginningto addressthis issuewith a few strategic staffing additions.
98.      Government Strategy/Zmplementation Progress. Achievements in the energy sector in 2005
included the cost pass-through of increased oil prices and progress on Lake Kivu methane gas
development. Power outages have also been reduced significantly in 2006 with the procurement of diesel
generators to supplement generation capacity. The GoR plans to introduce a structured electricity tariff to
replace the current flat tariff. This i s an important step forward inboth improving equity intariff policy,
and also providing appropriate market signals for energy conservation.
99.      Significant efforts have been made in 2006 to develop a 2007-2009 MTEF to avoid repetition o f
the problems with budget execution that occurred in2005. With the departure of Lahmeyer International
from the management o f Electrogaz, the GoR i s also working on its medium- and long-term vision o f
how Electrogaz is to be managed, and how a significant expansion of investments in electricity supplies
as well as institutional and human capacity are to be realized.
e) Transport
100.     Current Issues. A land-locked country, Rwanda has limited transport alternatives to the rest o f
the world. The closest sea ports are 1,300 miles away (Mombasa, Kenya or Dar es Salaam, Tanzania).
Goods can be transported to the sea by truck through two main international roads, which are in
relatively poor condition (in particular the sections inKenya and Tanzania); a truck takes over one week,
and some times two, for this trip. Alternatively, goods can be shipped by train part o f the way from
inland container depots in neighboring Tanzania and Uganda, but transit times by train are much longer
than by road. The country has one international airport, in Kigali, whose runway was rehabilitated in
2005.
101.     Transport constraints have a very severe impact on both living conditions and international
competitiveness: it costs about US$80 per ton for goods to be transported from the United States to
Mombasa and about US$250 per ton from Mombasa to Rwanda; average prices for international goods
are three times higher in Kigali than in Nairobi. The poor state o f the rural transport network equally
inhibits internal trade, with a direct impact on the economic and social situation outside Kigali. The road
network is relatively dense by Sub-Saharan African standards, with about 9,000 miles o f national and
local roads, of which 700 miles are asphalted, but it has substantially deteriorated over the last decade
due to lack of maintenance




                                                      39

102.      Maintaining the road network far exceeds the country's financial capacity. Maintenance in
Rwanda i s particularly challenging due to heavy rain falls and difficult geophysical conditions:
maintenance costs are twice as high as the Sub-Saharan African average. Local resources available for
routine maintenance amount to about US$6 million per year, while the needsjust to keep the network in
a usable condition amount to US$24 million per year. As a result o f limited maintenance, the main
network i s gradually deteriorating, further adding to the country's isolation and high transport costs.
Since 2001, the GoR has aimed to concentrate resources on a core priority network (defined on the basis
o f its economic value and the need to maintain national cohesion). The GoR i s also planning to increase
the fuel levy o f US$0.4 cents per litre currently allocated to the financing o f road maintenance.    l4

103.      Rwanda i s also highly dependent on the transport systems o f neighboring countries. Most o f the
reductions in transport time (and costs) would be conditioned on the improvement o f the handling
process at the sea ports in neighboring Kenya and Tanzania, on increased efficiency o f the railway
systems inKenya, Tanzania, and Uganda, on improved conditions o f key international roads (especially
inKenya, and Tanzania), and on accelerated custom and other clearance processes. Unfortunately, not all
of the above measures are highpriorities for the transit countries (which are facing huge financing needs
for their own priority infrastructure). Rwanda's entry into the East African Community should help with
regional coordination inthis area.
104.      The GoR's capacity inthe sector remains relatively weak The human impact o f the genocide i s
still visible in MININFRA and other key public institutions, where staff i s young and inexperienced. For
instance, there are only four qualified engineers in the department responsible for maintenance o f the
entire road network. The GoR's inability to offer attractive salaries results in high staff turnover, with
qualified staff leaving for the private sector. Poor financial management capacity, in particular in terms
of expenditure planning, tends to limit the impact of what little investment is made inthe sector. Lack of
proper financial and technical programming tools to support policy implementation
105.      Finally, there is a disconnect between sector strategy and the macroeconomic agenda. The weak
institutional capacity is further aggravated by the lack of an overall sector strategy to align transport
needs to the limited financing capabilities o f the government. This, in turn, has made it difficult to focus
the scarce human and financial resourcesavailable. The targets o fa three-year MTEFadopted in2005 far
exceed those o f the National Investment Strategy for the same sector and do not take into account the
human and technical absorption limitations of the country. Most of the country's transport legislation
dates from the colonial era and needs to be aligned with new and emerging challenges. Priority given to
the maintenance o f city roads to the detriment o f rural roads
106.       GovernmentStrutegy/ImpfementutionProgress. The transport policy is still beingrevisedbased
on studies conducted in 2005 with financial support from donor agencies, including the World Bank, the
European Commission, PPIAF, and the Government of Japan. The strategic objectives o f the transport
sector in the 2002 PRSP have been sharpened, marking a shift from a process focus to impact
measurement. Ina 2005, a newtransport policy matrix was adopted with the following objectives:
      Improvetransport links internally and internationally;

      Reduce and keep transport costs under control;
      Improve the institutional framework and strengthen the capacity of partners involved inthe sector;
      Increase road safety;

      Achieve sustainable financing of road maintenance;

      Sustain the preservation o f roads rehabilitatedor constructed.

l4    This increase will not affect pump prices since it will be deducted from the current fuel tax


                                                                  40

Based on the above, the Bank is continuing to prepare a Transport Sector Development Project, with
sector dialogue being supportedas part of PRSG111preparation.
8SocialProtection
107.    Current Issues. InRwanda, many government and private programs currently assist in meeting
the country's socialprotection objectives. MINALOC plays a leadingandcoordinating role, though other
ministries also make important contributions. MINALOC operates programs for refugees and returnees,
often with support and help from UNHCR. Food subsidy schemes are sponsored by MINAGRI and
MINALOC, with support from the World Food Program. MINALOC administers support for people
with disabilities. An education support program previously administered by MINALOC through
provincial governments is now being operated by MINDEDUC. The FARG was established as an
organization to protect the welfare of needy survivors of the 1994 genocide. The Labor Intensive Local
Development Program (HIMO-PDL) operates the GoR's labor employment scheme in rural areas, while
other HIM0 programs operate through donor projects. MINISANTE coordinates the mutuelles (local
health insurance schemes). Moreover, subsidies to enable the participation of the poorest families have
beendeveloped, utilizingthe traditional Ubudehe process and community structures in combination with
central funding. The Demobilization Commission manages schemes to help ex-combatantsresettle into
Rwanda. Local governments also have budget lines to support destitute people, and they help provide
protection for vulnerable children, including those who lost parents or relatives to HIV/AIDs and those
who lost families inthe 1994genocide.UNICEF supports similar activities.
 108.   The GoR is committed to developing the country's wealth, or productive capital, to make
possible higher living standards for the population. As economists have long recognized, wealth comes
in various forms, including physical, human, and social capital. Many simple investments in human
capital (including health and education) have very high rates of return by preserving human lives and
increasing their productivity. Social protection investments in maintaining or increasinghuman capital
can also have high returns. For example, income support programs managed through village Ubudehe
processes that finance productive systems for widows without assets can turn paupers into producers,
while re-establishingmore acceptable living standards for their dependents. Labor-market programs that
offer labor-intensive voluntary public employment at below-market wages can create new community
assets (e.g., roads, bridges, water distribution systems, marshland rice paddies) while also re-channeling
idle energyandbroadeningthe scale and accessibility ofthe national market.
109.    The challenges that poverty and vulnerability patterns in Rwanda present have been studied
extensi~ely.'~Rwanda's GDP per capita is about US$250; half of all children under five are
malnourished; for every 100 births, there are one maternal death and 10 infant deaths; and another 10
percent of children die beforereachingage five. Agriculture accountsfor 90 percent of employment, with
agricultural employment overwhelmingly female. The four main sources ofhouseholdvulnerability relate
to agricultural risks (small plots, depleted soil, land losses from rainfall runoff, and variable rainfall);
health risks (especially HIVIAIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and other tropical diseases); family
composition factors (female-headed or child-headed households, often with orphaned or disabled
members); and lack of employment or other age-appropriate activities, especiallyfor young adults.
110.    Government Strategy/Implementation Progress. The Minister of State for Community
Development and Social Affairs is accelerating a systematic and inclusive process of social protection
policy development, linked to the EDPRS process. The Ministry intends to build on the strategy
document by preparing(a) a policy matrix, (b) an action program for the short-, medium-, and long-term
that incorporates operational priorities, and (c) an MTEF. The Ministry envisages this work occurring

within the EDPRS context. It would couple development of longer-term objectives and an
implementation plan with identification o f highly vulnerable groups to whom targeted assistance could
be made available relatively soon in ways that do not foreclose longer-term options. In the context o f
decentralization, social protection and other responsibilities, as well as human and financial resources,
have shifted to the provincial and district government level. The move to greater decentralization has
created a need to identifynew capacities requiredat each level of government.
111.     Currently, there i s no general system of cash or in-kind support to poor and vulnerable
households. In 2007, MINALOC will implement a new social assistance program designed to target the
poorest tier o f families. It builds on existing program structures that seek to strengthen community
solidarity, avoid creating a culture o f dependency, and provide extremelypoor households with a built-in
support system. The program will use the financial architecture o f the Common Development Fund
(CDF) to channel new funding for poor, vulnerable households to cellules. The program will begin as a
pilot in several districts to assess the viability, effectiveness, and programmatic potential o f CDF and
expanded Ubudehe (village meeting) mechanisms as ways to deliver assistanceto such households.
112.     Bythe end of 2006 the following measuresare expected to be implemented:

0   Define monitoring and evaluation criteria for the new social assistance program;

0   Specify and contract technical assistance to assist MINALOC to synthesize an overarching social
    protection strategy with an action plan designed for phased implementation that reflects both clear
    priorities and national resource constraints;

0   Complete a report on current social protection expenditures including cross-sectoral expenditures by
    all national ministriesand agencies.
2) PrivateSector-LedGrowthandAgriculturalTransformationfor PovertyReduction
113.     CurrentIssues. Given that the economy remains largely agrarian, the GoR's strategy for growth
includes both private sector development and agricultural transformation as key drivers. Linkedto this i s
the longer-term goal of diversifying the economy through the export promotion, increased trade,
expansion o f tourism, improvements inthe bankindfinancial sector, and introduction o f ICT.
114.     The agriculture sector made significant progress in 2005 and 2006. The Sector Strategic Plan
(PSTA) guided implementation of programs, focused on the four key program areas: (1) Intensification
and Developmentof Sustainable Production Systems; (2) Professionalisation o f Producers; (3) Promotion
of Commodity Chains and Agribusiness Development; and (4) Institutional Development. However,
challenges remain. Agricultural productivity for most food staples remains below expectations and trends
for key food security crops in 2005 are cause for concern. In addition, agricultural growth remains
heavily dependent on rainfall, and the sector continues to be susceptible to disease outbreaks. During
2006, the decentralization framework for the sector has beenelaborated and the 2007 budget allocates 11
percent as earmarked funds to districts (e.g., for animal disease control, extension services, erosion
control, rural infrastructure, water harvesting and irrigation, and food security). While roles and
responsibilities have been clarified in theory, they are not yet fully tested in practice, and public
expenditure management and implementation will need to be supported and monitored to deliver
effectively. The problem i s most acute in the area o f extension, but similar issues relate to input and
market support and veterinary services. The reduction o f staff at the central level also poses a challenge
to operational efficiency. There is a clear need for capacity building, including functional and
institutional analyses, development of systems and procedures, individual job descriptions, and focused
training. Since it is expected that in most cases actual service delivery will be entrusted to the private
sector, NGOs, and farmer cooperatives, capacity buildingneeds are not limited to the public sector. Pilots
for scaling-up have been developed in the areas of irrigation, storage, rural transport and food security.
Outcomes and impact need to be monitored and lessons learned fed into policy dialogue and resource

allocation discussions, Inthis regard, developing a clear Monitoringhfanagement Information System for
the sector-aligned     to the PSTA-is        vital. While there have been improvements in the sector with
regards to the undertaking of the Agricultural Survey, agricultural statistics in Rwanda remain weak.
Finally, the GoR is not likely to meet its commitment, as part o f the NEPAD Maputo Declaration, to the
Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program (CAADP) target of 10 percent of the national
budget going to agriculture by 2008.
115.     Regarding export promotion, in line with the development o f the export promotion strategy,
IUEPA coordinated the signing o f a Memorandum o f Understanding (MOU) by the key institutions
involved in export promotion. The MOU outlines the modalities for coordination on export promotion.
The strategy and MOU aim to diversify Rwanda's exports from the current four-coffee, tea, cassiterite,
and coltan-which        put the country in a precarious position due to the highly volatile nature of
international markets for these commodities. Measures currently being undertaken in export promotion
are summarized in Box 2. Regarding the banking and finance sector, the GoR i s focusing on micro-
financing to address the lack of long-term financing and credit guarantees from local banks, which
seriously inhibitinvestments inproductive and profitable activities.
116.     The GoR sees ICT as a means to transform Rwanda into a knowledge- and information-based
economy and i s now implementing the National Information Communications Infrastructure (NICI) 11.l6
Progress has been made in human resource development for ICT, the deployment o f ICT to facilitate
government administration and service delivery, the development o f the nation's ICT infrastructure, the
deployment o f ICT to facilitate teaching and learning in schools, the deployment and spread o f ICT
withincommunities andto help spur the private sector, andthe ICT service sector inparticular.
117.     Government Strategy/ZmpZementation Progress. During 2005 and 2006 the agriculture sector
made good progress in implementing commitments under the PSTA. Under Program 1, over 9,000
hectares(ha) o f radical terraces were protected; over 1,000Ha o f marshlands were rehabilitated; 31valley
dams were constructed or rehabilitated; over 8,500 artificial inseminations took place and over 1,400 live
birthswere recorded, with a 9 percent overall increase in livestock numbers; a line o f credit was opened
for fertiliser promotion; strategies were developed for improving fertiliser use and irrigation as well as
intensification of livestock production for poor families. Under Program 2, institutional reform and
restructuring measures included the creation of the Rwanda Agricultural Development Authority
(RADA) and the Rwanda Animal and Resources Development Authority (RARDA). The Institut des
Sciences Agronomiques du Rwanda (ISAR) was also restructured with the establishment o f a technology
transfer unit. The plans for the Rwanda Agricultural Agency for Quality Control and Certification were
rejected by Parliament and some o f the proposed functions have been devolved to RADA, RARDA, and
the Rwanda Bureau of Standards (RBS). A review of national extension and advisory support services
was undertaken and an Agricultural Guarantee Facility was established with an initial commitment of
RWFl.Ibillion. Under Program 3, cold chain development commenced; over 23 markets were
constructed or rehabilitated; 15 milk collection centers were constructed; fertiliser imports increased 90
percent in 2005; the value o f coffee exports increased and the number o f coffee washing stations
increased (to 79) in 2006; the value o f tea exports increased; hides and skins and horticulture strategies
were developed and a national horticulture boardwas established; and horticulture exports increased 343
percent in 2005. Under Program 4, institutional reforms were supported by legal and regulatory reforms
and the land law was passed; the MTEF was revised in line with the PSTA, and budget classifications
were revised; a comprehensive national Avian InfluenzaAction Plan was developed, with the Ministryo f
Agriculture (MINAGRI) and RARDA inthe lead; and the Agricultural Survey was undertaken.


l6  NICI Iwas adopted in 2001 as a series of four five-year plans. An evaluation was undertaken in 2005 and NICI I1

                                         Box 2. Export Promotion Measures
  Coffee. OCIR-Cafk, which oversees the coffee sector, has been strengthened to focus on regulationand extension
  services, facilitation of the provision of critical inputs, and support for the development of growers associations.
  Plantingof new trees, acquisitionof additional coffee washing stations and efforts to improve the use of existing
  stations to their full capacity (to allow for increasedexports of fully-washedcoffee), and promotion of Rwandan
  coffee inthe specialtymarketthrough fairs andexhibitions are under way as partof the exportpromotionstrategy.
  Tea. The tea pricing structure was revisedinJuly 2005 and the price paid to farmers is to be renegotiated every
  six months. Remaining state-owned tea plantations will be restructured by rehabilitation of the plant and
  machinery and putting inplace a team of graduates to manage the plantations and factories. Capacity building
  activities to promote tea farmers' cooperatives and extension services (including placement of agronomists inthe
  districts) are helpingto promote increaseduse of fertilizers to increase yields, while quality standards are being
  promotedto focus onproductionofhigh-qualitytea for specialtyhichemarkets.
  Mining. A mining code which defines the regulatory framework the sector for has been completed, approved by
  Cabinet, and submitted to Parliament. Discussions with South African and Australian investors interested in the
  exploitationof existing, abandonedmines are ongoing.
  Tourism The Rwanda Office of Tourism and National Parks (ORTPN) is focusing on high-end tourism and
  diversification, for example increasing the price of mountain gorilla viewing permits to US$500 in 2007 and
  recentlyestablishingthe KigaliCity Tour. Eight new hotels, distributedregionallyamongthe country's attractions,
  are expected to be completed in 2007; all are Rwandese-ownedexcept for a high-end, tented camp development
  by a BritisWSouthAfrican group. The Rwanda Tourism and Hospitality College is now being developedwith the
  help of a Geneva-based school. Establishment of a conservation school is being supported by the MacArthur
  Foundation. The RwandaTourismCollege andRwandaTour Instituteare operational.
  Export Processing Zone (EPZ). Terms of reference for the development o f an EPZ have been completed and a
  task force formed to spearhead the work of the EPZ. Development of EPZ will be in several stages, based on
  demand, over a 20 year period. Development of the frst 100 hectares (of a total possible 741 hectares) is now
  beginning.
  Hides and Skins. A strategy for the sector has been developed, including the possibility of establishing a leather
  development center. Three companiesare expectedto beginbuildinghideand skinprocessingfactories shortly.
  New Products. Export diversificationis key to the exportpromotionstrategy, andthe developmentof horticulture
  and hits, expansion of handicrafts (which has seen success and is key to poverty reduction), and possibilities in
  the ICT sector are under consideration.


118.      The GoR plans to pursue a National Extension Strategy in 2007, with Belgian Cooperation
support. A National Centre for Information and Documentation for Agriculture will be created at the
central level; extension services are proposed to be channeled through farmers associations and
cooperatives at the local level. It i s proposed that districts will be provided with financial resources to
organize requested training through specialized experts or organizations. The beneficiaries, normally
farmers' associations and cooperatives for certain commodity chains, will have to make contributions to
help pay for these services. This will complement the development o f supporting financial instruments
for decentralized service delivery inthe agricultural sector.

119.      Maintaining food security i s a chronic issue in Rwanda. Compared with 2004, in 2005 the
production o f the four major food security crops (sweet potatoes, beans, bananas, and cassava) was low
or declined. Below normal rains in November 2005 and through to January 2006, and late rains at the
start o f 2006 Season B, adversely affected crop production. While agricultural growth in2005 increased
inreal terms to 5.8 percent, it is likelythat the poor rains during2006 SeasonA and late rains for season
B will negatively affect 2006 growth. According to preliminary Season B crop assessmentfigures, over
half o f the country (18 out of 30 districts) received less than 2,100 kilocalories per capita per day




                                                            44

nutritional intake." Food assistance was required mostly in the Southern and Eastern provinces. The
implementationof the Irrigation Master Plan, irrigation pilots, and earmarked fundingto the districts will
helpto decrease the dependenceof agriculture on the vagaries of climate.
120.     In2005, coffee and tea remained the most important export crops, accountingtogether for more
than 60 percent of export receipts. Although the coffee harvest declined in 2005, as trees needed to
regenerate following last year's bumper harvest, there was a substantial rise inthe average price received
for coffee, leadingto a 19 percent price increase to US$38.2 million. The Fully Washed Coffee strategy,
which aims to increase the quality, processing, and hence price for coffee received by farmers, has
succeeded in helpingto command prices that are more than double that o f standard coffee. While the
proportion o f coffee being washed remains low (6 percent o f total produced and 4 percent o f total
exported in 2005), investments in energy and water, as well as cooperative ownership o f coffee washing
stations, will help to increase the proportion of fully washed coffee over the next few years. The average
price paid to coffee producers has risen from RwF60 per kilogram to RwF110 per kilogram over 2003-
2005. In 2005, tea production increased 21 percent and the value of tea exports increased 13 percent, to
US$26 million (this was mainly drivenby increased productionrather than value added by improvements
in quality). Hides and skins production increased in 2005 by 48 percent and the value increased by 40
percent, to US$3.18 million. Pyrethrum exports were suspended in 2005 as a result o f the energy crisis.
Cassiterite and coltan together accounted for almost 30 percent of the value o f exports, also experiencing
robust prices. In addition, export earnings o f US$23 million were generated from a combination o f
wolfram (US$2.56 million), re-exports (US$17.03 million), and other products (US$3.19 million).
121.     In 2006, the GoR plans the following actions inthe area of export promotion: engage in more
aggressive investment and trade promotion work through focused outward and inward missions; enhance
the capacity of the trade promotion department to handle the planned export promotion activities; build
trade promotion capacity through hosting o f Rwanda trade point fairs and focused participation in trade
fairs and exhibitions; conduct seminars and workshops on export promotion and marketing; complete
review of the legislative framework, to include clear components for trade and export promotion; fund
investment and export promotion activities through embassies and nodal offices; initiate appropriate
action to develop and operationalize the free trade zone; host an annual investment conference in
Rwanda; produce an annual publication and widely distribute investment and export promotion materials
(e.g., videos, brochures, newsletters); implement modern information instruments such as a website; set
up and managean investortracking system; invest inthe development o f humancapital critical to driving
the image building campaign. To address transport and energy constraints, RIEPA, working with other
agencies, will engage in discussions with other countries, notably Kenya and Tanzania, to identify ways
of improving the efficiency o f commercial transport. RIEPA will also promote and encourage
investmentsinmethane gas and other sources ofpower, andpromote the use o f solar energy.
122.     The national committee for the scale-up o f the contracting approach is very active, and will
benefit from a district mapping o f donor support for implementation. However, it is not certain whether
the committee will have the capacity to monitor and evaluate progress o f the scale-up. Support from the
school o f public health would help, but would require appropriate funding. Budget resources for the
contracting approach have been reviewed so that appropriate proposals are incorporated into the 2007
budget. Following the completion of the Financial Sector Assessment in February 2005, the financial

Sector Strategy, including an Action Plan to strengthen micro-finance intermediation, supervision, and
regulation, as well as the micro-finance policy and regulatory framework, were finalized and adopted by
Cabinet. The monitoring report of the BNRhas indicated that commercial banks are in compliance with
prudential regulations. A framework for monitoring and supervision o f all micro-finance institutions has
been established, including a live database and standardized forms and processes for micro-finance
reporting. A recent Financial Sector Assessment Program mission raised the issue o f improving banking
supervision, with the objective of achieving Bade Principles. The GoR i s also considering modalities for
establishing a Rwandan Financial Development Framework, which would cover microfinance, insurance,
the RwandaHealth Insurance Scheme (RAMA), and the CaisseSociale Rwandaise. Several microfinance
institutions were legally recognized in2005.
123.     The GoR views tourism as a key area of growth in the service sector. However, the tourism
industry continues to face several challenges (a) the need to improve Rwanda's image to attract more
international visitors; (b) lack of adequate tourism infrastructure to accommodate international visitors;
(c) weak human capacity inthe sector; and (d) a need to improve the investment climate to transform the
private sector into an engine of growth. The newly reorganized Rwanda Office o f Tourism and National
Parks (ORTPN)18 is now the lead agency in the implementation o f the tourism medium-term strategic
plan, which aims to address these constraints. The GoR's vision i s to focus on training to build the
necessary human capital to transform the tourism sector into an engine o f economic growth, and a tool
for poverty alleviation. The diversification o f tourist sites and packages lagged in 2005 due to slow
increases in investment, but tourist visits remained strong, reaching 26,998 in 2004, compared to a target
of 20,000. In 2005, visits were 24,120 compared to a target o f 25,000. In both 2004 and 2005, receipts
were exceededby at least USD4 million above targets.

124.    RegardingICT, implementation o f NICI plans have seen the emergence in recent years o f skills
training and human resource development companies inthe private sector in areas like computer training.
For example, E-ICT (an ICT training organization) has for the last two and halfyears trained close to 994
people in various computer skills. In2001, only one in 2,300 primary schools had a computer, while no
secondary schools had computers. Several "computer in school initiatives" (by the GoR, NGOs, and the
private sector) sprung up, and currently 1,138 primary schools have a laptop; about 100 o f these schools
have two computers. Close to 2,000 computers have now been deployed in secondary schools throughout
the country. MINEDUC plans to procure and deploy another 4,000 computers in 400 schools in 2006.
Regarding internet access, while only one school in the country had Internet access at the start of the
process, 40 schools in Kigali City now have access to the Internet. A number o f urban and rural schools
in other regions of the country also have Internet access. It is anticipated that as the roll-out of the
communications infrastructure expands into rural areas, Internet access will be expanded to the rural
schools. Inrelation to the training and the deployment of computer literate teachers inRwandan schools,
several initiatives have been implementedby MINEDUC and other organizations. Currently, about 1,000
teachers have been trained in computer literacy and basic computing. Those trained have been deployed
in 120primary schools. Inaddition, over 2,000 computer literateteachershave beentrained and deployed
insecondary schools throughout the country.
125.    There are several Internet Service Providers and Internet Gatewaymandwidth Service providers
in the country (e.g., RWANDATEL, Artel, Terracom, Mediapost). Several infrastructure development
and roll-out companies were also licensed duringthe time-frame o f the implementation of the NICI-2005
plan, to provide communicationbackbone network services, including data, voice (fixed and mobile), and
video services. These new entrants are involved in the provision o f fixed and mobile services with
nation-wide coverage. Terracom Communications has begun to deploy a broadband backbone fiber
network in the country, aiming to roll-out a total o f 256 kilometers to first connect Kigali, Butare, and
Gitarama, among others. Terracom's network will cover the entire country by the project completion date
of 2007. Aertel Communications has installed a 240 VSAT network covering 90 districts throughout the
country. Most of these are rural districts. Additional 160 VSAT terminals are to be deployed. At the
completion of the project, Rwandawill have the highest VSAT concentration per square kilometer inthe
world.
3) PublicSector Underpinningsfor ImprovedService Delivery
a) Public FinancialManagement
126.    Current Issues. The GoR continues to place high priority on the enhancement o f its public
financial management (PFM) system in order to address existing weakness. Challenges going forward
include (a) addressing human resource capacity in accounting and auditing to implement successfully the
new Organic Budget Law; (b) producing a set o f consolidated accounts, in line with the Constitutional
requirement; (c) continuing to strengthen the links, in the context o f decentralization, between strategic
planning, the MTEF, and the budget; and (d) integrating the recurrent and development budgets.
127.    Following the Financial Accountability Review and Action Plan (FARAP) undertaken in2003 in
close collaboration between the GoR, DFID, and the World Bank, with the subsequent Action Plan
supported by the European Union (EU), a Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) was
completed in 2005. The CFAA pulls together the information in the FARAP, work realized by the IMF
and EU, and other existing analysis on Rwanda's PFM system, synthesizing the analysis and outlining
recommendations and an action plan for PFM reforms going forward. Given the importance o f this
agenda to fiduciary due diligence, donors have established a Public Financial Management Trust Fundto
provide additional support for the GoR's PFMreform program going forward.

128.     Government Strategy/Implementation Progress. The gazetting o f the Organic Law on State
Finance and Property (commonly referred to as the Organic Budget Law) after its enactment by
Parliament i s a major step in strengthening the GoR's PFM regulatory framework. The Organic Budget
Law introduces new responsibilitiesrelatedto the management o f public finances, and implementation o f
the law's provisions will present a challenge over the mediumterm, particularly in regard to the need to
enhance government capacity in public accounting and internal audit. The preparation o f manuals to
accompany the introduction of the Organic Budget Law i s at an advanced stage. The FARAP identified
the lack ofhuman resource capacity inaccounting and auditing as a major constraint. To addressthis, the
GoR, with support from the EU, conducted needs assessments to determine the numbers o f staff
available, gaps to be filled, and curriculum for the training of accountants and auditors. The assessments
resultedin the recent recruitment o f over 200 accountants and internal auditors for deployment to each
line ministry and government agency. Through financing provided by the Bank's Public Sector Capacity
Building Project (PSCBP), the GoR has also launched a "Rwanda Expertise Scheme" to finance the
training o f accountants inthe Rwanda Public Accounting System and sponsorship o f the best among the
trainees for a professional accountancy qualification. Training o f two groups-those   based inKigali and
those based inthe districts-began    inMay and is expected to be completed by end-2006. This will help
to address public financial management capacity at decentralized levels.
129.     In addition to the passage of the Organic Budget Law, the establishment of the Office of the
Auditor General i s a key achievement over the last few years. This office has benefited from the support
o f SIDA and Norway to build its capacity and reinforce the practical skills o f its staff. As a result, the
Auditor General has been able to produce and submit reports on budget execution in certain ministries
and local government entities. The reports have been submitted to Parliament and have been widely
discussed and disseminated. There i s evidence to show that remedial action has followed some of the
issues raised in the reports. The GoR also created the post and appointed an Accountant General. This
appointment i s deemedvital to help strengthenthe GoR's capacity for public accounting, and also for the
coordination o f PFM reforms, for which the Accountant General i s responsible.
130.     The GoR's failure to date to prepare a set o f consolidated accounts and thus fulfill a key
obligation of the Constitution is one o f the major weaknesses inits public accounting system. This failure
i s due to the difficulty in establishing opening financial balances as a result o f insufficient records
maintained during the post-conflict period. The GoR has now launched an exercise through which
unreconciled items and opening balances will be determined for the year 2006. This will be followed by
the preparation of accounts for central and local government entities and is expected to lead to the
preparation of consolidated accounts for the year 2006.
131.     In support of the preparation of consolidated accounts and strengthening of its PFM system in
general, the GoR is continuing to roll out the SMARTGOV system, which includes a module for
PUBLICBOOKS. The SMARTGOV system will link all 30 district administrations and the central
system on the same server. It is envisaged that the use o fthis information system will provide a powerful
tool to the GoR inthe preparation o f consolidated accounts and will enhance the accuracy o f information
contained in the budget and execution documents. In parallel, the GoR has also launched an exercise to
prepare an inventory o f its fixed assets and establish a system and methodology to be used to manage
them.




                                                     48

132.     The GoR's introduction o f an MTEF and its adoption as a planningtool is another one of the
major advances o f the past few years. However, the lack o f sufficiently elaborated sector plans has
hampered the realization o f benefits intended with the introduction o f the MTEF. In addition, it is clear
that the budget classifications currently in use are inadequate and do not fully permit the availability o f
information that is relevant for sectoral decision making. As a result, sector plans are not sufficiently
aligned with the budget and the MTEF. The GoR plans to address these weaknesses through the revision
of the budget classification system and the preparationo f concise guidance to be used by agencies inthe
preparation of their plans. This will be accompanied by technical assistance in pilot ministries. Such
measures should strengthen the links between government policy, sectoral plans, and the budget. The
annual PERs that the GoR i s institutionalizing will also feed into the planning and budgetingprocess.
133.     The exhaustiveness o f the budget has in the past been an impediment to smooth budget
management. Factors contributing to this have included the lack, to a certain extent, of integration
between the recurrent and development budget, and the uncertainty o f donor flows, which hampers
budget predictability and strategic and cash flow planning. With respect to integration, as a first step the
GoR restructured MINECOFIN units to transfer and consolidate the responsibility for preparation of the
recurrent and development budgets. Development o f budget preparation guidelines will now add
momentum to this reform. With respect to donor flows, the GoR has established a unit in MINECOFIN
with the responsibility o f monitoring external finance inflows. The GoR has also continuedto strengthen
collaboration with donors to increase harmonization of procedures and enhance the availability o f donor
information relevant to the budget preparation process.
134.     It is worth noting that the GoR accords a highpriority to the efficient coordination of the PFM
reform program. This i s essential to ensure its regular and proper monitoring and to maximize its impact.
To this end, a well represented PFM Steering Committee now holds regular meetings, and has recently
prepared a comprehensive PFM Action Plan, which was adopted by Cabinet. In order to boost its
capacity to fulfill its functions, a PFMReform Facilitator will be appointed to head the secretariat to the
committee.
b) TransparencyandAccountability
135.     Current Issues. According to the PRSP, challenges to good governance in Rwanda include
national reconciliation; political legitimacy with popular politicalparticipation; justice and humanrights;
and transparency and accountability in public actions. The PRSP states that without an end to the
mentalityof exclusion and impunity, and an acceptanceby all social groups that development is possible
only if all work together toward common goals, good governance would be out o f the question. Thus,
while corruption is not considered a major problem in Rwanda, transparency and accountability for
action is a strategic priority. To promote transparency and accountability, the GoR has focused on
decentralization o f decision making and resources to local government units to deliver services more
efficiently and effectively and to empower people, especially poor people, to take part in decisions that
affect their lives.
136.     The GoR is promoting its approach to enhance transparency and accountability based on three
main principles:
    Putting Rwanda citizens at the center o f service provision by enabling them to decide what services
    they should have, select, monitor and discipline service providers through their power as
    users/clients, by amplifying their voice inpolicy making.




                                                     49

0    Strengthening the incentives for providers to serve poor people and to improve accountability and
     transparency through increasingly separating the provision role, to be exerted by autonomous
     agencies, andthe policy, financing, regulation, andmonitoring role, to be exerted by the government;
     and developing a contractual relationship between government and providers explicitly
     benchmarkingperformance.

0    Increasing the effectiveness o f all resources available (from government, donors, service providers,
     civil society and the population itself), through rational allocation and efficient and coordinated
     utilisation o f resources.
137.      Public procurement is also key to transparency and accountability inpublic action, particularly in
the context o f decentralization. The GoR's progress on implementation o f procurement reforms has been
slower than expected. Lack of strong leadership o f the procurement reform agenda, lack o f coordination
o f all ministries in charge of implementing reforms (MINECOFIN, MINALOC, MINIJUST), lack o f a
comprehensive action plan, and the need to address the capacity, roles, and responsibilities o f the now
decentralized procuring entities have hinderedthe process.
138.      Government Strategy/lmpZementation Progress. Government institutions were strengthened
after the adoption o f the new Constitution and the successful presidential and legislative elections in
2003, Rwanda further strengthenedgovernment institutions by formally separating the judiciary from the
executive and legislative branches, and creating the Supreme Court and Office o f the Ombudsman. The
GoR drafted a strategic plan to combat corruption and further liberalizedthe media. Decentralization, the
key priority to reform governance and improve public service delivery, was the focus in 2005. Local
elections in February and March 2006 filled out the new administrative structure o f the country in
follow-up to the territorial reform law in January 2006. The district mayors and district councils are in
place. The GoR i s now focusing on clarifying their roles and responsibilities and ensuring necessary
capacity buildingand support so that they are able to conducts their tasks accordingly.
139.      Citizen Report Cards (CRCs) and Community Score Cards (CSCs) are recent approaches that
MINALOC and MINECOFIN, with support from development partners, are adopting for improving
efficiency, policy effectiveness, accountability,        and participation in decentralized levels o f
administration. Both are designedto elicit feedback from citizens-CRCs at the micro level and CSCs at
the macro level-concerning services, and then to have these feed back into improving services. CRCs
collect quantitative feedback on user perceptions on the quality, adequacy, and efficiency o f public
services through individually-based sample surveys. CSCs are a qualitative monitoring tool usedfor local
level monitoring and performance evaluation o f services, projects, and government administrative units
by communities; information is collected through focus group discussions. The processes (especially
CSCs) are expected to improve dialogue between frontline service providers and users/ rights holders.
The CRC/CSC promotes individuals' and communities' ownership o f evaluation outcomes and broadens
citizens' understanding of policies, strategies, and implementation processes, particularly decentralized
service delivery. Box 3 presents a summary o f findingsfrom the pilot CRCs ineducationand health.

                                Box 3. CitizenReport Cards in Educationand Health

Education. Usinga sample of more than 700 people (including heads ofhouseholds, pupils, teachers, and parents) insurveys
conducted in2004 inKibungo and Ruhengeri; and in2005 inGisenyi, Cyangugu, Kibungo andKigali City, data show that up
to 92.7 percent have access to primary schools that are between0-1 km away. Respondentswere generally satisfiedwith the
quality of education offered (62%), but only 39 percent stated that pupil performance was good. 42 percent rated teachers as
only `sometimes available'. 94 percentof respondentsindicatedthat schools did not provide lunch, and 47.3 percentindicated
that fees and contributions were collected, including for expenses relatedto school construction or renovation, and for extra
tutoring. Whereas respondents indicated a relatively high incidence (91.6 percent) of PTAs, the degree to which they were
seen to be active and to have a significantrole was uneven; many parents did not participateregularly. In a single schoolterm,
the interaction between teachers and parents was between 1 to 3 times. Participation through open and sports days was
minimal, with 54.1 percent indicating that there are no such days at their school. About 66.1 percent are satisfied with how
problemsrelatedto schoolingo ftheir childrenare solved.

Girls abandon school because of beingorphanedor to seek ajob (17.8 percenteach). Boys abandonschool mainly to look for
ajob (44.4 percent).A majority of schools lack laboratories or workshops. Latrinesare availableinmany schools, but are said
not to be adequate in number, and many schools do not have separate facilities for boys and girls (75.6 per cent of all
responses).

Teachers receivematerials such as chalk and books (65.9 percent), but many indicatea lack ofprograms for ICTand technical
skills. Most funds disbursed are from the government (90.7 percent), but parents still have to pay for uniforms (usually about
RwF 5,000) and for school lunches (usually about RwF 500). School managers seem to be dissatisfied with teacher
accommodations(78.4 percent) and only partly satisfiedwith pupilbehavior.About 51.5 percent of students believeschool to
be closeto home. Howeverthey believethe provision of desks is poor (70.5 percent), there is a lack of library facilities (89.5
percent), and a lack of computers (69.5 percent). The rate of provision of piped water is about 39.3 percent. A common
problemleadingto absenteeism is poor health(42.1 percent).

Health. Health sector data were also collected from about 700 respondents, male and female users as well as providers.
Government healthservicesare moderately available with aratingof 53.3 percent comparedto availability ofprivateservices,
which are rated at 45.9 per cent. The most frequent distance to the nearest government health service is 30 minutes (28.1
percent). 70.1percent ofrespondentsbelievethe distanceto the service is convenient. A substantial number ofhouseholds(57
percent) visit health services other than a government facility. Major reasons are costs (10.1 percent), distance (9.4 percent),
andto get specialtreatment (3.7 percent). 40.6 percentofwomen do not deliver at agovernmenthealthfacility and 37 percent
deliver at home, usuallydueto cost (28.4 percent).

More than 82.5 percent of respondents believe access to medical services in government hospitals is equitable and 92.9
believe medical personnel are available. There is a fair availability of equipment (70 percent) except for dental services
(negativeresponse is 51.8 percent). 22.5 percent of householdsare partly satisfiedwith government health services generally;
75.8 percent of respondents felt there is an insufficiency of funds for running the health facility. About 75.7 of respondents
were partly satisfied with the attitudes of health facility workers toward patients. Responses show that uniforms are worn
(97.4 percent) and facilities are relatively clean (93.7). However, paymentfor services is often out of pocket(42.3 percent) or,
to a lesser extent, unofficial (11.0percent), especially for laboratorytests (95.1 percent) anddelivery(73.1 percent).

72.5 percent of respondents are completely satisfiedwith health services, but 25.1 percent indicate partial satisfaction.65.8
percent of respondentsfind staff members `helpful completely', but 26.2 percent find them only partially helpful. 96.4 percent
of respondents indicate that toilets are available in health facilities, but not necessarily separate toilets for men and women.
There are apparently active health committees in many places (91.2 percent) and 53.5 per cent show that there are at least
monthly meetings. Health facilities are generally rated well except facilities for delivery (mothercare), which rated negatively
by 56.4 percent. X-rays rated negatively by 84.6 percent and family planning services were also rated negatively by 73.7
percent. Other significantly negative ratings were for separate toilet facilities (71.8 percent), availability of staff
accommodation (84.2 percent), dental services (83.8 percent), school health services (75 percent), a fully-qualified medical
doctor (91.7 percent), and qualified midwives(69 percent).

140.     Regarding procurement, following the 2004 Country Procurement Issues Paper (CPIP), the GoR
adopted an action plan in 2004 to materialize the procurement reform agenda. While the Parliament
technical commissionhas now discussed and i s ready to submit to the Parliamentary plenary session for
adoption a Procurement Law, a review by the Bank legal expert revealed that the draft Law, as it stands,
is not aligned with international best practice. The GoR i s coordinatingwith Parliamenton this issue, and
the GoR and the Bank are in close dialogue working together to ensure that the country has a
procurement law that will serve it well. Thus, the law i s being re-examined. In the interim, standard
bidding documents have been prepared and will be adopted following the promulgation o f the
Procurement Code. A road map has beenprepared for the implementation of the new institutions created
by the Procurement Code and companion legislation on the Rwanda Public Procurement Authority
(RPPA). Training has been provided, mainly to decentralized procurement entities.
141.     The GoR has made progress inthe implementationthe action plan. To follow-up the procurement
reform implementation agenda, the Minister o f Finance has revivedthe Procurement Reform Task Force,
with the task of ensuring that every district has the basic skills, financial, and material resources to
conduct procurement operations. The National Tender Board (NTB) has prepared a template o f the
procurement plan (to be used as a management tool by the various procuring entities) to be published by
procuring entities to inform potential bidders. A code of ethics for staff handling procurement matters i s
under preparation. The selection o f consultants to prepare a capacity buildingprogram is also under way.
An international consultant has developed a roadmap to ensure that the new institutional framework is
put in place and to assist the GoR in the supervision of the preparation of the procurement capacity
program. Legal experts (international and national) who prepared the Procurement Code have been
contracted to prepare the decreesunder the Procurement Code.
e) Monitoring
142.     Current Issues. There are five core pillars of the GoR's PRSP monitoring and evaluation
(M&E) framework (a)          monitoring o f priority programs'         performance;   (b) monitoring of
povertyhousehold living conditions (outcomes and impacts o f the PRSP); (c) promotion o f participatory
M&Eat all levels; (d) the APR; and (e) aid harmonization. The information generated from these pillars
feeds into policy review and revisions. The development o f key performance indicators in each sector,
which can be monitored at central and decentralized levels and linkedto budget allocations, are critical
for the success of the M&E framework. The GoR and development partners have noted that a wealth o f
data has been collected in Rwanda and that helpingthe GoR to develop the capacity for data analysis is
an area inneed o f development.
143.     The GoR's main monitoring instruments currently include the APR, strategic plans and Sector
Issues Papers (SIPS), budget prioritization and execution reports, and district level plans and
disbursements. The GoR recognizes the need to strengthen further the links between these instruments
and the logical flow from PRSP goals to strategic plan objectives, from strategic plan objectives to
MTEFs and budget requests in SIPS, and from MTEFs and SIPs to budget prioritization, taking into
account lessons learned from studies and evaluations. Strengthening the linkages will make it easier to
meet the M&E needs o f government, donors, and other stakeholders with minimal duplication o f effort,
while recognizing distinct accountabilities to internal versus external stakeholders. Taking this into
account, the GoR i s working to put in place an integrated management information system with regular
reportingthat can be usedto meet multiple M&Eneeds.
144.     GovernmentStrutegy/ImpZementutionProgress. The GoR is making progress inputtinginplace
the necessary reporting systems to feed into its M&E framework. The new software for budget
monitoring (ie., SMARTGOVPUBLICBOOKS) will make a substantial contribution to the M&E
framework, particularly once all of the districts are linked to the system. The Education Management
Information Systemthat is beingdeveloped will likewise be a powerful tool for monitoring inthis sector.



                                                     52

District Development Plans are another key piece of the puzzle. CRCs and CSCs are also proving to be
extremely useful feedback mechanisms and will continue to provide important input into the M&E
system. Another useful input and feedback mechanism is Ubudehe data. Ubudehe is a process of
participatory planning and budgetingat the village (cellule) level." The Ubudehe process has served not
only to prioritize poverty reduction activities at the local level (e.g., access to water, livestock
development), but also to encourage a participatory assessment of poverty across Rwanda. Finally, the
EICV IVhousehold living standards survey that i s being undertaken in 2006 i s part o f the regular data
collection exercise to feed into the M&E framework; it will provide data for evaluating progress under
the PRSP and benchmarks and baselines for the EDPRS.
145.      The GoR has struggled with the development o f key performance indicators, trying to strike the
right balance between centralized and decentralized levels and the feedback mechanism andrelationship
between these levels. Inthe context o f enhanced decentralization, it is clear that the process will needto
be "bottom up" and buildon DistrictDevelopment Plans. Developing key performance indicators will be
a priority inthe context o f the EDPRS and decentralization. Inaddition, the sector self-evaluations being
undertaken during 2006 as part of EDPRS preparation will provide a comprehensive review of
achievements under its first PRSP. The evaluations will use available data and collect additional data as
necessaryto provide an assessment of progress toward PRSP goals and objectives. The exercise should
helpto clarify the types of key performance indicators needed ineach sector.

                                                  V. Implementation
A.        EnvironmentalandSocialAspects
146.      Environmental and Social Analysis. This operation is governed by Operational Policy (OP)
8.60, Development Policy Lending, and therefore is not subject to OP 4.0 1,Environmental Assessment.
However, PRSC/G Iwas governed by Operational Directive 8.60, Adjustment Lending Policy, deemed a
sector adjustment operation, subject to OP 4.01, and classified category B for purposes o f environmental
assessment. As such, extensive Environmental Assessment and Social Analysis was undertaken during
the preparation of PRSC/G Ito identifypossible positive andnegative linkages between PRSC/G support
and environmental and social impacts, including examining the Bank's safeguards definition o f social
impacts in regard to involuntary resettlement, indigenous peoples, and cultural property.20It also took
into account the widespread environmental and social analysis undertaken for other Bank operations.
While PRSC/G support is not expected to have any significant negative environmental or social impacts,
the analysis focused on the environmental and social issues facing Rwanda and the capacity o f national
and local public sector agencies' roles and responsibilities to manage them. PRSG IIII continues to draw
on the Environmental Assessment and Social Analysis undertaken for PRSC/G Ito help the GoR
establish the regulatory, administrative, and technical capacity to identify, mitigate, and monitor
environmental and social issues in a sustainable manner. PRSG I11 would continue support for the
Rwanda Environment Management Authority (REMA), which was newly established under PRSC/G I
and has become very active inenvironmentalmanagement inRwanda.



    Ubudehe has its roots in traditional collectiveworking in the fields, but has been adaptedto modernways of planning and
    budgeting.
    Note that in context of Rwanda's history, particularly in the aftermath of the 1994genocide, the term `indigenous peoples'
    i s extremely ambiguous as it implies that some ethnic groups were established in Rwanda before others. The basis of this
    assumptionwas widely usedtojustify the genocide is therefore extremely sensitive. The GoR's currentpolicy, as part ofthe
    nationalunity and reconciliationprocess, is based on equal rights for all without distinguishingbetween ethnic or regional
    affiliations in the country. The new Constitutionstates that all personsare equal before the law and shallenjoy, without any
    discrimination, equal protection of the law. In that context, the GoR has made it clear to donors that it will not accept
    fundingthat will directly or indirectly encourage Rwandansto identify themselves alongethnic lines.




                                                               53

147.      The GoR is keenly aware of the environmental issues facing the country and is signatory to
several international agreements aimed at environmental protection, including the Convention on
Biological Diversity, the UnitedNations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Kyoto Protocol,
the Conventionto Combat Desertification, the Convention on InternationalTrade inEndangered Species
of Wild Flora and Fauna, and the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands. Regarding environment, the
assessment undertaken for PRSC/G I identified Rwanda's key concerns as: land degradation,
deforestation, water contamination, loss o f biodiversity and habitats, and wetlands degradation. The GoR
is actively addressing deforestation, having adopted a policy o f reforestation several years ago. Tree
planting programs occur throughout the year, and there is also an annual national tree planting day. The
GoR has also formulated a National Wetland Conservation Program for 2002-2030 and has identified
four major complex wetlands as critical ecosystems for which integrated management i s a priority. The
GoR has designated several national parks (Parc National des Volcans, Nyungwe Forest National Park,
Akegera National Park), which form the basis for the strong ecotourism focus o f the tourist industry in
Rwanda.
148.      Any potential environmental and social impacts associated with sector specific investment
operations in complement to PRSGI11support (e.g., inwater, energy, and transport) will be addressed in
the context of ongoing and planned environmental and social analysis undertaken as part of preparation
for those operations.
149.      Hazard Risk Management (HRM)).Disaster context in Rwanda is mainly linked with natural,
man-made and mixed disasters. Many cases of disaster are particularly linked to the geographic,
historical and socio-cultural aspects of the country. If not controlled in the longer term, environmental
degradation and large scale erosion in the Kagera river basin could become a challenge to the
sustainability o f investments inwater infrastructure inRwanda. Additionally, while Rwanda i s relatively
water rich, rainfall variability and the resulting floods and droughts place severe strains on the country's
economy. It i s perceived that Rwanda's economy remains highly vulnerable to weather related shocks,
but lack of rainmay be less of an issue than lack of effective (rural) water management. The availability
of fresh water, both spatially and temporally, i s becoming an important factor constraining the ability of
the water supply, industrial and agricultural sectors to meet the diversified needs of a growing
population.
150.       Seismic risk is practically nil in building codes although Rwanda i s very much exposed. The
recent Nyiragongo volcano eruption and earthquakesthat followed have drawn the attention of Rwandan
leaders but related building codes have not followed. This point i s however reflected in the National
Policy on Disaster Management. There are also disasters resulting from epidemics, road accidents, forest
fires and social conflicts.
151.       In Lake Kivu on the border between the Republic of Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of
Congo, some 300 km3 o f dissolved carbon dioxide and 55-60 km3 of methane gas i s accumulated and
trapped at significant depth in the lake. As indicated in a report on lake stability 'lccanatural concern i s
that Lake Kivucould erupt, as occurred in Cameroon at Lake Nyos in 1986 and at Lake Monoun in 1984,
which suffocated more than 1,700 people. For Lake Kivu, the gas content is still below saturation and the
risk of eruption if not imminent. However, if nothing is done the accumulation gas will cause a
catastrophic eruption in all likelihood within the time span o f 100-200 years. The probability of these
triggering events i s low but the consequencesof major eruption are very dire as hundreds o f thousands to
millions of people living around Lake Kivu and the northern part o f lake Tanganyika could be affected ".
The proposedLake-KivuMethane Gas project addresses thisrisk.

152.     The Government itself grants importance to HRM issues with : (i)national policy on disaster
                                                                              a
risk reduction and prevention inRwanda formulated in2002 and approved by the Cabinet inJuly 2003;
and (ii)a national body on Disaster Risk Management put in place in July 2004. Rwanda has included
disaster management intheir annual budget for the first time in2004. Disaster management was allocated
$52,635 in the 2004 annual budget as running costs for the National Service for Disaster Risk
Management recently created. This budget i s included inthe Ministryo f Local Government, Community
Development and SocialAffairs budget.
153.     Gender. Traditionally, women in Rwanda focused on agricultural activities at home, while men
dominated the public sphere. However, the genocide affected a shift in attitudes toward gender roles
since women constituted approximately 70 percent of the population after the genocide. They were seen
as critical to reconciliation, unity, and the governing of the country, since women perpetrators o f the
genocide were limited. The 2003 Constitution establishes that 30 percent o f posts in decision-making
organizations be filled by women and that 30 percent o f the seats in each house o f Parliament be
occupied by women. Following the 2003 election, women account for 49 percent o f the seats in
Parliament, the highest level of female parliamentaryrepresentation inthe world. The NationalWomen's
Council, also enshrined in the Constitution and working under the leadership o f the Ministry o f Gender
and Family Promotion, was originally created in 1996 to engender change in girls' education,
reproductive health, poverty reduction, and civic and legal issues. Women identify policy and budget
priorities at the local level and voice them up through the channels o f government. The planning officer
responsible for gender i s mandated to ensure that all budget development at the central level integrates
certain "cross-cutting" issues, including gender. For example, the Women's Council lobbied for the
elimination o f primary school fees and the establishment o f particular fiscal priorities within the central
government budget. This has led to a narrowing o f the disparity in primary school enrollment across
gender, locality, and income. As described in the PRSC Iprogram document, the GoR also launched a
Gender Budget Initiative, adopted a National Gender Plan o f Action (2000-2005), and has a
Comprehensive Legal Action Plan for the elimination of gender disparities.
154.     An assessment intended to provide reasonable assurance that the BNR's control, accounting,
reporting and auditing systems are adequate to ensure the integrity of operations was carried out in early
2003. It noted encouraging efforts o f the BNR to rebuild and strengthen its safeguards and controls. It
identified some weaknesses relating to the external audit mechanism and the then newly established
internal audit department. Since then, many of these weaknesses have been addressed in a plan o f actions
most o f which were to be implemented in 2003, with additional staff hired for the internal audit
department, and external audits beingcarried out on an annual basis by an international firm o f auditors
appointed by the Board o f Directors. The GoR has made good progress in strengtheningthe management
o f its public finances, and has an action plan inplace to address weaknesses. Inthe context o f the CFAA
and during preparation o f PRSG 111, the Bank has reviewed the GoR's fiduciary arrangements. The
team's assessment i s that the fiduciary framework within which the government will manage the
proceeds of the grant i s adequate/satisfactory.
155.     A single-tranche grant of SDR 33.8 million (US$50 million equivalent) would be made available
upon effectiveness, which is expected in January 2007. The proposed grant will follow the Bank's
disbursement procedures for development policy operations. Grant proceeds will be disbursed against
satisfactory implementation of the development policy program and not tied to any specific purchases or
be subject to procurement requirements. Once the grant is approved bythe Boardand becomes effective,
the proceeds of the grant will be disbursed in compliance with the stipulated single tranche release
conditions. Once the Bank's Board approves the grant and at the request of the Recipient, IDA will
disburse the proceeds of the grant into an account designated by the Recipient that forms a part o f the
country foreign exchange reserves account at the Banque Nationale du Rwanda. The Recipient shall




                                                     55

ensure that upon the deposit of the grant into said account, an equivalent amount i s credited in the
Recipient's budgetmanagement system, ina manner acceptable to IDA. The Recipientwill report to IDA
on the amounts deposited in the foreign currency account and credited in local currency to the budget
management system. If the proceeds of grant are used for ineligible purposes (Le. to finance goods or
services on the standard negative list), as defined inthe Development Grant Agreement, IDA will require
the Recipient to promptly upon notice from IDA, refundan amount equal to the amount o f said payment
to IDA. Amounts refunded to IDA upon such request shall be cancelled. The administration o f this grant
will bethe responsibility o fthe Ministryo fFinance and Economic Planning.
B. MonitoringandEvaluation
156.     MINECOFIN is responsible for implementingthe proposed PRSG I11and for coordinating the
completion of actions. MINECOFIN's Development Planning Unit is responsible for overall monitoring
o f the GoR's poverty reduction programs and the Bank will continue to work closely with this unit and
with the GoR in general on the implementation of its M&E framework. MINECOFIN also relies on its
Budget Monitoring and Reporting Team, which is responsible for ensuring that component sector
spending plans developed with PRSG support are incorporated into the national MTEF and subsequent
budget, to work with the Bank to track progress on the implementation o f PRSG 111.Annex 5 contains a
list o f monitoring indicators for Rwanda's PRSP, which will also be the basis for monitoring and
evaluating progress on the implementation o f PRSG 111, and for the Implementation Completion Report
to be undertaken after the disbursement o f PRSG 111, to evaluate achievements under Rwanda's first
PRSC/G series.
C.       R i s k s and Risk Mitigation
157.     The Bank recognizes that the risks in Rwanda continue to be high. At the same time, the GoR
continues to demonstrate its strong dedication and commitment to pursing the goals outlined in its
poverty reduction strategy and supported by the PRSG program. The Bank remains equally committed to
continuing to work with the GoR to support its development efforts. Rwanda successful development
remains critical to its stability and to the stability of the Great Lakes region. Main risks to the GoR's
achievement o f its development goals andthe PRSG program are outlined below.
158.     Regional RisWCountry. Rwanda's history and location in the unstable central African region
poses a threat to the development process. Flare-ups relatedto turmoil inthe easternCongo remain a risk.
The international community, through the United Nations and African Union, has continued to
demonstrate its support for measures aimed at promoting regional stability. In addition, meetings o f the
Tripartite Plus One Commission continue to try to find ways to address the negative forces operating in
the region. Elections planned for mid-2006 in the DRC could potentially destabilize the region; to
mitigate this risk, UNtroops will be reinforced. Domestically, criticism o f the GoR's suppression o f the
political opposition and certain civil society groups has surfaced, and shortcomings of the Gacaca trials
has caused contention. While there i s a critical need for constructive, new political parties to emerge in
Rwanda, this will take time as the political landscape in the country i s still heavily influenced by the
1994 genocide. Currently, Rwanda's internal security and political situation remains stable.
159.     Program Risk. Risks to the program in Rwanda continue to revolve around predictability of
donor funding, ability to mobilize grant financing, and debt sustainability. The GoR's success i s likely to
remain dependent on donor financing for some time to come-there       is a significant risk that services that
are being delivered now may not be in the future if sustainable flows o f external resources are not
maintained. DFID's three-year rolling program within an overall 1O-year commitment provides a good
model for enhancing the long-term predictability of donor funding. It i s also encouraging that additional
donors, such as Germany and Canada, have expressed interest in providing budget support to the GoR.
Improvements in frontloading by donors will also help the GoR to plan and implement its budget in a
more sustainable manner. In the short-term, the Bank i s also working to help the GoR access the


                                                     56

Catalytic Fund for Africa. However, over the long-term, the GoR will continue to face difficulties in
mobilizing additional grant financing, which is critical if the GoR is to remain within prudent debt
sustainability limits.
160.    Operation Risk. Operational risks stem from concerns over fiduciary capacity, particularly at
decentralized levels. The rapid decentralization undertaken by the GoR has heightened potential
procurement and public financial management risks since only limited accompanying fiduciary measures
were included. However, the GoR has committed to accelerating its efforts to address these risks. The
GoR i s drafting an easy-reference guide for procurement, along with a technical assistance "hotline," for
procurement officers. It is also accelerating the implementation o f the Rwanda Expertise Scheme that i s
training accountants, to be deployed at decentralized levels, inthe Rwanda public accounting system, and
sponsoring o f the best among them for professionalaccountancy qualification.

3.      Icegardingimprovhig service delivezy, with f'RSC.4 support we have heen focusing on
the key sectors of education, health. water. and energy. I)ecatitralimd service delivery has heeii
line of the inain successes of I'KSCIG support, and we look forwardto ttrther achievements in
this area, particulwlj~as we continueto pursue our decentralizationprogram, fully underway with
the passagethe territorial reform law inJanuary 2006.

4       In the education sector, we huvc dewloped a strong MTEF, with M
ceilings and the 2007 Rndget conslstcnt with the sector financing strategy: we also presented the
official governnient draft budget document to all stakeholders in October 2006, so that donor
partners can veri@ the consistency of the MTEF with the sector strategy arid planned budget
dlocdtions, We continue to face d          choices in this sector. but we are committ         r fcc-
free basic education policy. `I`o t         we have increased the capitntion Fant tra          frntn
the centrd government directly t           is frum R~F1,000per student in 2005 to             00 in
2006: and plan to increase it flirther to RwF3.800 per student in 2007, The  SUCCCSSo fthis transfer
so far has been possible due to I'KSCIG rupport. We itre also pursuing funding from the
Education for All Fast Track Initiative (EFA-FTI) and presenredour plan in this regard 10 donors
in Singapon: on rhe occasion of the Worfd RankiIMF Annual Meetings, whcrc it was well
received.

S.       In the liculrh sector, we remain committed to improving the health of our popuhtioa
through berter access to and quality of health scrviccs. We have conducted ot review of the
pcrfonnance-based approach to contractual healrh services,     M hich has ttchieved succcss due to
PRSCG support. We have sought cndorseinent of the recommendations of the coniparative
review of the pcrfomiance-based schemes for health centers and haw expanded the scale-up of
rhis progrnni to all 12 provincesnow consolidatod into4 regions andthe city o f Kigali. In addition
to continued high rates of immunimtion, utilization of other health services has also increased,
including assisted deliveries. outpatient visits, and contraceptive services. t!ciliration of
insecticidetreated nets has increased to about 30 percent ofrhe p~pulatioiiin 2006. Coverage by
the cotnmunity-based health insurance: schemes, known as mirtuefies, has also increased, to about
44 percent ofthe population in2005.

6.       In the water sector, we have seen twinetidous gins. ?'cn percent of rural water supply
systems are no% managcd by local private operattirs. Access rates to potable Hater increased      ifi
rural arcas from dl pcrcont in 2001 to 55 percent in 2005. meaning thnr an additional 598,000
persons h i n g in rural areas gained access to potable water versus 167,000 in 20ct.l.. In urban
areas. access to pntahle water increased from 66 percentto 69 percent. Jhc to the nccelerationof
physical execution of water projects in rural and urhan &reds. expenditures in the water sector
tripled in 2005 compared to 2004. Donor coordination in the sector also continues to improve,
which is improving the effectiveners ofstrateg development. financing, m dprojectsinthis ami.

7.       In the enera sector, following the cost pass-throughaf iiicrcnoed oil prices in 2005, the
Cabinet hots adopted u revised electricity tariff that baiances th
consumers and cost recovery requirements. We have been able t~
outages with the purchaseof diesel gmerators (with PRSQ funds coniplvinenting funds under tfic
World Bank energy project). We are also moving rapidly on the I,ake Kivu metlime gas
deveioptlrent pruject so rhat we can serve longer-term needs and retire the mure expensive diesel
generators.

8.       Kegarding transport, the GoK requested that policy dialogue he included under PKSG 11,
atid we would like this to continue under PRSG 111. Our capacity in the sector remains weak, but
our needs great, given the linkages to our export-led                    growth agenda. The main
objectives of our transport policy include: improving trans             ntemally and internationally;
reducing and keeping transport costs under control; iniprovi            instituiional fmtnercork and
strengthening the capacity of panncrs involved in the sector: increasing road safety; achieving
sustainable financing of road maintenance; tind sustaining the preservationof roads rehabilitated
or constructed.

9.       llnder PKSG 111,           d like to iriclrrde social protection in the policy diaiogue. In
Rwanda. many governmet              vate pnigranis currently exist to help mect the country'b social
protectiott objectives. The        er of State for Cornniunity Developmen1and Social Affairs is
acceleratinga systematic           usive process of social protection policy development, uhich is
linked to the CDPRS process. The Ministry inrends to prepare an action program for the short-,
rncdium-, and long-term that incorporatesoperational priorities. 'ihe implementation of strategies
and plans would continue in           ext of the EDPRS, which i s why we believe that dialogue in
this sector is aypropriiite tci        under the PRSC'/G program, starting even now to lay the
ground work so that the secto          y to inwe once implementation ofthe PDPRS begins.

10.      Overall. Kwanda's niacroeconomic performance continucs to be on track. Kcal GDJ'
growth accelerated from 4 percent in 2004 to 6 percent in 7005 largely due to agricultural
production and increased           in manufiicturing, financial services, and cominunications. In the
area ofprivate sector fed           we see the need for microenterpi'ise development and have thus
adopted a microfinance              pian, which aims to improvc tho availability of' credit to
microentcrprises. In addition, given that agriculture will remain the main driver of economic
growth until the private sector develops further, we havc ensured that two kcy agricultural
institutions, the Rwanda Agricultural Devclopinent Authority (KAUA) and the Rwanda Aninial
ItesourcesDevelopmentAuthority (RARDA) are operational. with af least25 percentoftheir staff
coniplcmctits,

1 I.     Wc rilso continue to implement our export promotion strategy (dcvelopcd with PKSC/Ci
support), hhich is producing good results. 1113005, we saw higher receipts from a diverse set of
exports .inaddition to coffee and tea. hides and skins, and cassiterite and coltan, Tourist receipts
and numbers are also up. W e are also implementing our Strategic Plan for Agricultural
Transformation (prepared with PRSC/G support), uith a Focus on four key program areas:
Intensification and Detelopment of Sustainable Production Systems; Pro~cssiotialisationof
Producers: Promotion of Commodity Chains rind Agribusiness Development; and Institutional
Development. This is helping t           'de much berter focus for our activities in the agriculture
sector. I:inally, we continue to p        with our ICTstrateby iiswell.

12.      In the area of governance und transparenq,                  respect KI ptddic expenditure
manugernenr, we have ntadc much progress, though much still remains to be done. We have
submitted the draft 2007 hudget law to cabinet, consistent             e macroeccinomic framework,
thc 2007-2009 M'IW, including detailed, output-oriented                 for education, health. water.
and energy. and our PRSP priorities. We have submitted the 2005 budget execution report to the
Auditor Gcncral, who presentedit, with her opinion, to Ptirliaincnt. Parliainont has now adopted
rhe Organic Law of State Property and Finances. We have also adopted, finalized, and published
thc Financial Manage                  unting Policies and ProcedureManuals. In addition, we have
elaboraxed a detailed                 Imanngenientaction plan, thith donorsupport.to focusour
acthitics in this area. In        -term, this includes training of public accountantsand auditors in
strcngthenour public fin          anaprinent system. particularly at dzcenrriilirx!d levels.

  13.     In tbr:area of frcmsparencyand uccountubiiiQ, a draft Public ProcuremcnrCode has been
  discussed by Parlieincnt's Technical Commission. However, we are aware that the law still
  displays some wcakt~esues.`T'hus, we are working with Parliamentand the World Bank ti) review
  the law, which we expect to be adopted in January 2007. In the meantime. regulation%and
  Standitrd Bidding Documentshave k e n prepared and will he adopted, issued and publisficd on
  Xationnl Tender Board wcbsite follou.ing the promulgation of the Procumnient Code. The
  Governinant of Kwanda is commitxed to having a modernpublic procurementcode that will lay a
  solid foundation for improving our procurementsystm. `I'hc Ofice of thc Onibudsmen has alw
  reviewed the declarationof assets of staff handling procurement, through a sample of 15 percent
  ofthe declarationofassets.

  14.     Finally, in the arca of moniforitrg mrl uvaluurion, and to help improve voice md
  accountability. we have produced, published. and disscmiiintcdthe 2005 Anaual PRSP h g r e s s
  Ileport.   We have also carried out a conipfehensive evaluation of the progress inadc in
  implementing the first PRW. `I`he evaluation c~)versthe full period of` PKSP I implementation
  (2002-2005), and is publicly available. Following the pilotingof Citbcn Report Cards in 2005, u e
  havc decided to adopt the Citi.ten Report Card as the munitwing instrument for programs
  implemented under the PRSP. Thus. we will extend thc use of Cirizen Report Ciirds to 1311 30
  districts in 3007.

   15.    While \%erecogni/s that we face inany challenges, thc Ciovcrrtnientof Rwanda remains
  committedto poverty reduction. We thank the World Dank for its continuedsupport ns we pursue
  this objective.

Annex 6. RwandaHarmonizationandAlignment

Rwanda does not have a long history of receiving long-term development assistance. Most
assistance until 1997 was humanitarianaid. The country's major donors during the 1990s were
Germany, UK,US, TheNetherlands, Belgium, EU, The World Bank, The IMF,andThe AfDB.

The donor response to the crisis was hardly coordinated and aid delivery was delayed. Despite
the lack of coordinated political, military, or humanitarian strategy or fiamework, the donor
community allocated substantial resources for rehabilitation. Nevertheless, even during the
period immediately following the 1994 crisis considerable delays in the delivery of donor
assistance were observed. In the aftermath of the Genocide Rwanda's development partners
were neither equipped nor coordinated enough to properly respond to the country's post-crisis
needs. The usual commitment-disbursement gap remained.

The country's aid coordination weaknesses on both government's and donors' side are the
main challenge to harmonization. The GoR still lacks the required capacity to effectively
manage development assistance and lead the donor coordination process. Before the Genocide
and during the post-genocide emergency period The World Bank and UNDP coordinated
assistance through a Donor Round Table mechanism, co-chaired by the Government of Rwanda
and UNDP. In the aftermath of the genocide due to the lack of a fully staffed World Bank
country office, as well as factors such as UNDP's lesser comparative advantage in the area of
macroeconomic management, a de facto division of labor emerged between the two agencies,
with the World Bank coordinating donors for macroeconomic anddebt-related matters.

MINECOFIN and the UN Resident Coordinator co-chair monthly Development Partners
Coordination Group (DPCG) meetings. It is the largest donor coordination body. It has been
effective primarily on information sharing and general contacts with Government, and
increasingly on issues relatedto NEPAD and global issues relevant to Rwanda.

Government officials within MINECOFIN as well as in line ministries have repeatedly voiced
their dissatisfaction indealing with donors' procedures and requirementsand identified a range
of difficulties that only exhausttheir already limitedcapacity to managedevelopment assistance.

Rwanda is one of three early budget support harmonization pilots initiated by the SPA in
2002. Rwanda's harmonization process was launched, shortly after the country completed
its PRSP. The initiative resulted ina Partnership Framework on Harmonization and Alignment
between the Government and its budget support donors formalized through an M o U in
November 2003. Broadly stated the framework declares that donors agree to harmonize and
align their practices in regard to: (a) process and timing with the Government's annual Poverty
Reduction Strategy cycle; (b) criteria for evaluating macroeconomic performance; and (c)
requirementsfor public financial managementandgovernmental fiduciary arrangements.

The budget support harmonization process led to the government's requests to expand

The request was expressed in October 2003, shortly before the identification of the Bank's first
PRSC, inthe hope that the multi-sector feature and requiredunderpinnings of the PRSC would
serve as vehicle for promoting harmonization at sector and project levels. As a result the PRSC
preparation process, was not only prepared in compliance with the budget support partnership
agreement, butmobilizedresourcesto createthe momentum for broader harmonization agenda.

The Bank's PRSCl was the first budget support operation prepared after the signing of the
budget support harmonization and alignment MOU. The programmatic multi-sector feature of
the PRSC preparation process and its requiredunderpinnings provided a unique opportunity for
Government anddonors to jump-startthe broader harmonization process.

To allow closer engagement o f non-budget support donors in the PRSC preparation process,
particularly in the development o f sector strategies, but also other analytic underpinnings of
PRSP implementation, the Government and the World Bank invited all donors to participate in
the preparation of the operation.     Donors and government worked in partnership on the
development of sector strategies and MTEFs, which are expected to lead to SWAps with
harmonized features.

The PRSC generatedmomentum ledto a government-proposedmenuof actions to initiate donor
dialogue on a more comprehensive harmonization framework, and to a calendar for aligning
future donor reviews and support with the Government's PRSP andBudget cycles.

These products provided further impetus to the harmonization process translating into dialogue
and peer pressure, andnewharmonization initiatives suchas:
.   The creation of a government-donor non-budget support harmonization body -The

.   Harmonization and Alignment in Rwanda for Projects and Programs (HARPP), and its
    secretariathostedby UNDP.

    DFID and the World Bank have initiated dialogue on working towards a joint/
    coordinatedcountry assistance strategy. Thereremains aproliferationo f donors' assistance
.   strategies each of which requires design, negotiation, implementation, and evaluation
    missions which tax administrative capacity ofthe Government.

    Donors are increasingly aware of the benefits of joint analytic work. The Financial
    Accountability Review and Action Plan (FARAP) carried out jointly by the Government,
    DFID and EUwas initiatedas part of the Public Expenditure Management Review (PEMR)
    process supportedby DFID, EU, World Bank, and other donors. While a full CFAA is one o f

.   the requiredunderpinnings o f the World Bank PRSCs, the World Bank decided to rely on the
    FARAP and its action plansupplementedby other available diagnostic work.

    SharedAnalytic Work. While recognizing the benefits ofjoint analytic and diagnostic work,
    donors also recognize that relying on one donor is sometimes a more efficient for all
    interested parties, provided there is sufficient donor consultation throughout the process.
    This is the case for the 2004 CPAR, where donors instead of mobilizing resources to carry
    out ajoint CPAR, preferredto rely on the World Bank's comparative advantage inthis area,
    on donor consultations duringthe assessment process, and on sharing o f final results.

.Delegated cooperationbetweenDFID and SIDA inthe education sector, with SIDA as silent
 partner, served as good practice example, and new delegated cooperation initiatives are being
.considered among bilateral donors, e.g. The Netherlands and DFID, with The Netherlandsas
 silent partner.
 Joint reviews are now commonpractice in the education and health sectors, where donor
 coordination is strong. Joint reviews have been facilitated by the Harmonization and
.Alignment Calendar finalized and adheredto duringPRSCl preparation.

 Government and donors are makingprogress in harmonizing capacity building initiatives.
 The Government developed the Multi-Sector Capacity Building Program (MSCBP), a
 national program on capacity building in public, private and civil society sectors. The
 program outlines a common framework and identifies capacity buildingneedswith the aim of
 pooling donor resources. To further facilitate harmonization of capacity buildingassistance,
 the Government has decided to establish an autonomous body, the Human Resource and
 Institutional Development Agency (HIDA) to coordinate, harmonize, monitor and evaluate
 all capacity building efforts inthe country under the MSCBP. Separately, DFID is leading a
 review of donor-supported capacity building activities with MINECOFIN to propose a
 harmonized approach at Ministry level.         The Education Sector Donors Group has a
 Memorandum o f Understanding (April 2006) that includes pooled funding for the
 government's education sector capacity buildingplan. More broadly speaking, the M o U sets
 out the agreement between development partners and the Government of Rwanda to support
 the education sector within the ESSP framework regardless of whether financingmechanisms
 are general budget support, sector budget support or project support. The M o U commits to
 aligned and harmonized planning and policy dialogue, consultation and information sharing,
.performance monitoring and the pooled support for capacity building.

 Donors are looking into ways of reducing transaction costs associated with their
 procurement practices. For example, the World Bank financed Multi-sector HIV/AIDS
 project (MAP) and the Global Aids Fundare usingthe same project implementation unit and
 MAP now has harmonized its anti-retroviral procurement procedures with those of the
.National Tender Boardandthe GlobalFundunit.

 SWAPS with harmonizedfeatures are emerging in the education, health and agriculture
 sectors. Rwanda's educationsector SWAP is the most advanced and its donor group is led
 by DflD. The Government has voiced its preference for donors to move towards a common
 aid delivery approaches at sector level, relying to the extent possible on Government
 processes and systems, Le., gradually shifting away from fragmented project approach
 through the use of common systems for negotiating, planning, implementing,andmonitoring,
 arguing that this transition would reduce aid transaction costs for both Government and
 donors, and facilitate the transition towards budgetsupport.
