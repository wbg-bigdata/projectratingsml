INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF MALI
FOR AN INTEGRATED RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Mali for the equivalent of US$8.0
million on standard IDA terms to help finance an Integrated Rural Develop-
ment Project. The French Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation (FAC) would make
a grant of US$2.5 million in support of the project.
PART I: THE ECONOMY
Background
2.        A report on "Recent Economic Developments in Mali" (233a-MLI) was
distributed to the Executive Directors on September 27, 1973. Country data
sheets are attached as Annex I.
3.        With a per capita GDP of less than US$70, Mali is one of the poorest
countries in Africa, and one of the 25 "least developed" countries identified
by the United Nations. Agriculture, livestock and fisheries contribute 43% of
GDP and are the main-stays of the economy and the principal sources of foreign
exchange. Manufacturing accounts for only about 7 percent of GDP. Real growth
of GDP during the 1960s was about 2.8 percent a year compared with a population
growth rate of 2.1 percent. In 1968-72 GDP growth averaged 3.3 percent a year;
in 1973, however, GDP is estimated to have declined by about 2 percent because
of the severe drought which Mali suffered in the 1972/73 season. This apparently
moderate setback conceals a very serious decline in the standards of living
of the rural population and especially of the nomadic people, tens of thousands
of which have fled the pastoral zone to find refuge in the Southern part of the
country. There is likely to be a further drop in national output in 1974, as
a result of another poor rainy season, with consequences for public finances
and the balance of payments which cannot yet be predicted with accuracy.
4.        Reports on previous credits to Mali have drawn attention to t1he
legacy of difficult economic problems inherited from the regime overthrown
by the military in November 1968. Many of these problems persist, in spite
of the efforts made by the present government to correct the most serious
distortions in the economy by raising agricultural producer prices, removing
some of the restrictions on trade, stimulating the inflow of private capital,
and increasing tax revenues. To be sure, Government policy of hiring all
graduates of secondary and higher schools unable to find employment in the



private sector has been a factor exerting constant upward pressure on public
expenditure. Most state enterprises, the majority of which were created under
the previous regime, appear to be still operating at a loss. They are the
main beneficiaries of the 70% expansion of bank credit to the economy between
1968 and 1973.
5.        There are nevertheless a number of encouraging developments.    Pro-
*l-ction of cotton and groundnuts, the two principal export crops, appears to
nave been fairly well maintained in spite of recurring drought, though they
remain about 10 percent below the 1970-72 plan target. Substantial investments
are being made in programs for expanding cotton and rice output, including the
H4opti rice project financed by IDA (277-MLI). River fisheries, for which the
European Development Fund (FEE) has provided assistance, have also been making
good progress, and exports to neighboring countries are on the increase.
6.        The balance of payments improved between 1968 and 1972, despite a
continued current deficit, as a result of a sharp reduction in private capital
outflow from US$13.5 million to a mere US$1.5 million, and an increase in
external aid from US$26 million to US$33 million. Furthermore, the proportion
of grants in 1972 was close to two-thirds of total aid against one-third in
1968. Because of the drought and despite higher world prices, exports in
1973 have stagnated while imimports increased sharply (21 percent). The current
deficit in 1973 has thus reached an all time high of US$67 million. The situa-
tion in this respect is unlikely to improve much in 1974. Foreign assets at
the end of 1973 were minus MF 44 billion (US$96 million), again an absolute
record, a siLuation tenable only because of the French guarantee of the con-
vertibility of the Malian franc.
7.        Public savings have remained negative despite some improvement in
tax collection in recent years. Government current expenditures have been
rising at the rate of 9.6 percent annually. In spite of this, the overall
deficit (including extrabudgetary operations, but excluding investment expendi-
tures financed out of foreign aid) was reduced from MF 6.3 billion in 1969
to MF 3.5 billion in 1971. However it increased to MF 4 billion in 1972 and
close to MF 7 billion in 1973, as a result of stagnating revenues which is
in turn mainly attributable to the drought. The shortfall in tax receipts
in 1973 was MF 1.3 billion. The 1974 budget will be a very problematic one,
the cattle tax will not be levied altogether to help drought-striken farmers.
Also, total personnel emoluments have continued to increase, though they
account already for over 60 percent of Government current expenditure, in part
as a result of a small general salary increase with effect from January 1,
1973.
8.        Petroleum imports are only 10 percent of total imports (1972).
However, their price to Mali has roughly doubled between September 1973 and
early 1974, thus adding another unfavorable factor to a basically difficult
situatioin. Petroleum consumption could not be compressed without affecting
the produictive sectors since consumption for leisure or tourism represents
a very marginal proportion of total uses. The development of hydro-electric
potential will take several years.



-3-
Foreign Aid
9.        The greater part of public investment is financed from external
sources. During the period 1966/67-1970, Mali received an annual average
of US$30 million of external aid, including technical assistance of about
US$3.0 million. Nearly half of this aid was provided by the U.S.S.R. and
the People's Republic of China in the form of long-term concessionary loans;
close to 40 percent of the total came from France and FED in the form of
grants. In 1971 Mali received foreign aid disbursements of US$30.5 million
of which 57 percent were grants. In 1972 the level of disbursement increased
sharply to US$65 million of which 62 percent was grants.
10.       The present drought has prompted special aid to Mali from the inter-
national community. Food aid - the most essential element - amounted to over
133,000 tons (grain) in 1972/73 worth US$5 million, and close to 150,000 tons
have been pledged for 1973/74 worth US$17 million. The EEC, individual member
countries, FAO and the United States are the main donors. In addition these
same sources as well as other agencies, notably the Association with credit
443-MlI of US$2.5 million, have committed funds for rehabilitation and drought
control projects of about US$15-20 million.
11.       Mali's total external public debt outstanding at the end of 1971
was US$318 million equivalent (including US$56 million undisbursed). IDA's
share in external public debt outstanding at the beginning of 1972, excluding
the US$56 million undisbursed, was 3.6%. Total repayments of principal and
interest due in 1971 would have claimed about 12 percent of the year's foreign
exchange earnings (8 percent in 1970); however, actual debt service payments
were small (1 percent in 1971) owing to the 1970 re-scheduling of Chinese
and Russian debts on short- to medium-term arrangements. Mali has received
several stand-by credits from IMF of which US$6 million are outstanding. The
Fund recently agreed to a rescheduling of US$2.5 million of payments due in
1974 and 1975.
12.       Mali's prospects for accelerating economic progress depend primarily
on raising farm and livestock production, and on improving its infrastructure
with investments geared to the needs of the productive sectors. The five-year
plan 1974-78 makes the achievement of these goals its first priority. For
this, the plan calls for investments of NF 248 billion (US$484 million), of
which external sources are expected to contribute nearly 90 percent, or an
average of US$85 million per year. The Government is confident that new
partners -- namely oil producing countries with which Mali maintains friendly
relations -- will join forces with the "traditional" sources of aid to help
in achieving these very ambitious targets. Achievement of the GDP growth
target in the plan of 5.5 percent annually will no doubt depend on the
availability of financing means - though not in any rigid manner. Clearly,
as in the past, exogeneous factors will be important: first of all the
weather, but also the trend of import and export prices.



-4-
Mali's capacity to raise public savings in the short- and medium-run
is strictly limited by a variety of factors: the much reduced capacity of
arge sections of the nation to pay more taxes because of the drought, the
existence of sizeable arrears resulting from past budgetary deficits, the
1'Lifficulties in reforming the public enterprises, and inflation, Though the
monetary system significantly alleviates the foreign exchange constraint,
the heavily debtor position of the "operations account" with France clearly
-oints to the need for the Government to be extremely cautious in its borrow-
-.rLg policy. These reasons, added to the country's sheer poverty, strongly
suggest that external assistance should be on the most concessionary terms
nossible, and should cover a high proportion of total project costs, includ-
:~ng substantial amounts of local expenditures.
PART II: BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN MALI
14.       The proposed credit would be IDA's ninth operation in Mali, bringing
the total of IDA funds committed to US$59.0 million. Of the presently out-
standing amount (US$51.0 million), US$20.5 million had been disbursed as of
April 30, 1974.
15.       Bank Group lending during the 1960s was handicapped by the country's
poor economic performance and the lack of well-prepared and economically justi-
fied projects. However, in 1966, a US$9.1 million IDA Credit (95-MLI) was
made for improvement of the Malian section of the Bamako-Dakar (Senegal) rail-
way.  Since the end of the 1960s, project preparation has been sharply stepped
up. The Bank's 1969 economic mission and other reconnaissance and preparation
missicns as well as Government's demonstrated competence in preparing projects
itself, provided the basis for formulating a substantially expanded and di-
versified Bank Group lending program, and the initial results of these efforts
have already materialized. An IDA Credit (197-MLI) of US$7.7 million helped
finance a first highway maintenance project in 1970. Credits of $6.9 million
on the one hand for the Mopti rice project (277-MLI) and $3.6 million on the
other for a telecommunications project (321-MLI), were approved in 1972.
Further credits for a US$6.7 million second railway project (384-MLI) and a
US$9.5 million second highway project (383-MLI) as well as a US$5.0 million
first education project (420-MLI) and a US$2.5 million drought relief project
(443-MLI) were signed in 1973. Annex II contains a summary statement of IDA
credits as of April 30, 1974, as well as notes on the execution of current
projects. Experience with ongoing projects has generally been good, although
the extreme shortage of rainfall and reduced flooding of the Niger River have
seriously hindered production where the Mopti rice project is concerned.
16.       Mali has considerable potential for agricultural and livestock
development. And, in fact, most of the operations envisaged by the Bank
Group in the near future are related in some measure to the rural sector.



-5-
They include cotton and livestock projects in FY75, the former providing
cotton processing and storage facilities, the latter calling for the con-
struction of wells, cattle markets and a slaughterhouse and for improved
extension and veterinary services. An integrated rural development project
southwest of the capital as well as a follow-on to the Mopti rice project
are scheduled in FY76. In addition, a third highways project, which would
include a component for up-grading feeder roads, should be ready for Board
presentation in calendar year 1975.
PART III: THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
17.       The agricultural sector accounts for about 43 percent of the
country's GDP, and for virtually all of its foreign exchange earnings (US$54
million equivalent in 1972). Rural activities provide a livelihood for about
85 percent of the total population. About 85 percent of the 2 million hectares
under cultivation is devoted to food crops, principally millet, sorghum, and,
in the river valleys, rice. Cotton and groundnuts are the principal cash
crops.
18.       The performance of the sector has been significantly affected by
the severe drought which has so seriously affected all the Sahelian countries.
Nevertheless, while there has been a decline in food crop production for dom-
estic consumption, there has also been a rapid development of production for
export, despite the unfavorable weather conditions. For example, during the
period 1967-1971, the production of seed-cotton rose steeply from 39,000 tons
to 74,000 tons, and that of shelled groundnuts from 81,000 tons to 152,000
tons. Both these products have benefited from well-coordinated development
programs carried out by adequately organized and staffed "Operations de
Developpement", which have supplied extension assistance and modern inputs.
Together with these efforts, efficient marketing channels have been set up
and producer prices established that have provided good incentives for
farmers.
19.       By contrast, the production of foodstuffs for domestic consumption
is clearly on the decline. For example, the production of millet and
sorghum peaked in 1967, and since then has been decreasing steadily; average
production for the period 1968--1972 has been estimated at about 600,000 tons
annually. Supplies of foodstuffs handled by official marketing channels
decreased sharply in the same period, from 60,000 tons in 1967 to an average
of about 15,000 tons in the last two or three years. Rice production also
fluctuated during the same period, but showed a slightly upward trend, probably
as a consequence of substantial investments in programs such as the IDA-
financed Mopti rice project, until a shortage of rainfall reduced flooding
of the Niger and consequently hindered production.



- 6 -
2(i.      Apart from the drought, the major constraints to increasing cereal
production are most likely the prevailing marketing and pricing mechanisms.
'nhe official producer price for millet/sorghum of MF20/Kg is far too low in
relation to actual prices for cereals in unofficial trade, to prices paid
poroducers in neighboring countries, and to producer prices for export crops
In Mali itself. There is little doubt that restrictive Government marketing
controls have hindered the expansion of cereal and other food crop production.
21,       Owing, however, to the shortage in the supply of cereals and
consequent large imports during recent years, the Government seems to have
ccen concerned with the need for measures to increase domestic food produc-
tion, and has in fact now set an objective of attaining self-sufficiency
in cereals by 1978/79. To achieve this will require increasing the produc-
tion of millet, sorghum, and maize by 200,000 tons, and the output of paddy
by 100,000 tons. The Government is, therefore, planning to concentrate on
improving food crop production within the framework of existing "Operations
de Developpement", and to create new "Operations" specifically for millet
and sorghum production. Ultimately, however, the success of Government's
plan to expand food production will depend largely on its ability to provide
adequate financial incentives to producers, as well as on efficient market-
ing services (see para. 37).   The proposed project would help to meet both
these requirements, and would benefit the economic as well as the social
interests of the agricultural sector.
PART IV. THE PROJECT
22.       A report entitled "Appraisal of Integrated Rural Development Project"
(No. 340a-MLI) is being circulated separately. A Credit and Project Summary,
including a breakdown of costs, is attached in Annex III.
23,       The project would be a second phase of "Operation Arachide"' (OA),
an undertaking initiated by the Government in June 1967 to rehabilitate
the groundnut industry. The first phase of the program, which was financed
partially by the French Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation (FAC), and to which
technical assistance was supplied by the Bureau pour le Developpement de la
Production Agricole (BDPA, France), was directed to the reorganization of
marketing, since deficiencies in this area were the principal reason for
the farmers' loss of confidence in groundnuts as a cash crop and the consequent
decline of the industry in the 1960s.
24.       OA's subsequent successes with marketing were complemented in 1969
by a 25 percent increase in the producer prire for groundnuts. OA then
proceeded to promote improved farming methods and modern inputs. Additionally,
attention was given to educating farmers, particularly through functional
literacy programs. In the five years since the start of OA operations, yields
ihave increased from 500 Kg/ha in 1968 to 814 Kg/ha in 1971, and the area under
the supervision of OA has doubled.



- 7 -
25        Overall, therefore, OA's achievements have been excellent in spite of
adverse weather conditions. Its farmer support services are efficient, and
most key positions are now filled by local staff, although some expatriates
still remain as advisors. Nevertheless, OA administration needs improvement,
particularly in the areas of accounting and credit control.
26.       The second phase of "Operation Arachide," which is scheduled to
cover the period April 1973 to March 1978, is already under way with financial
assistance from FAC, and disbursement of the proposed IDA credit would cover
the four year period 1974/75 through 1977/78 and would not commence before
October 1, 1974.
27.       The objectives of the second phase of "Operation Arachide" include:
(a) intensifying OA activities in areas now served by the program
to cover not only groundnuts but all principal farming
activities, especially the productioa of basic cereals and
livestock; the name "Operation Arachide" (OA) would therefore
be changed to "Operation Arachide et Cultures Vivrieres" (OACV),
stressing the importance of foodcrop production in the
project;
(b) expanding OACV services into new areas; and
(c) expanding the supply of farm inputs and equipment, on cash
or credit, to participating farmers.
Project Description
28.       The principal components of the project include:
(a) staffing, equipping and operating OA for the expansion
of agricultural extension, credit and marketing services in
the project area; constructing and furnishing housing, office,
storage, garage and workshop facilities; and providing technical
assistance for project management.
(b) a road improvement program under which spot repairs would be
made on a network of about 1,500 Km of rural tracks;
(c) a functional literacy program;
(d) a program of agricultural research to supplement the current
national program;
(e) improving medical facilities in the project area;
(f) improving veterinary services in the project area; and
(g) establishing a project evaluation unit.



-8-
The project area is situated in the west part of Mali, covering
about 125,000 Km2 (10 percent of the country's total area and 20 percent
)f its populated area). It comprises parts of the administrative districts
of Segou, Bamako, and Kayes, and would be divided into nine sectors, each
of which would have two to five sub-sectors.
'O.       With the assistance of 308 extension agents to be employed under
ILe project, participating farmers would move through stages of improved
practices; the pace at which they do so would depend upon current cultivation
maeti.ods and their receptiveness to advice, as well as their creditworthiness
in so far as this would govern their access to improvement inputs. Regarding
the latter point, about 20% of all loans made to groundnut farmers since 1968
is overdue. Government has agreed that more legal pressure may be put on
defaulting farmers. All participants would grow millet and/or sorghum in
rotation with their groundnuts, and would receive technical advice on how to
maximize yields. A range of improved practices, tested over the past five
years by OA, would be promoted in the project zone, including early and
dense sowing, timely weeding, fungicidal seed dressing and fertilizing, as
well as the use of ox-drawn equipment.
31.       The rural track improvement program would be carried out over three
years starting in 1974. The tracks, situated in the western and cen tral sectors
of the project area, are essential for efficient crop collection, general trade,
and for extension, medical and veterinary personnel. The track program would
complement other road programs in the project area financed by IDA, FAC, and
other bilateral aid.
32.       The functional literacy program, by providing out-of-school courses
conducted in the native language, would assist individuals in increasing their
productivity by teaching them the elements of reading, writing and arithmetic.
Thus, farmers would understand better and apply more efficiently the technical
innovations recommended by extension workers. By the end of 1973, some 30,000
farmers in OACV areas were expected to have completed functional literacy
courses. However, no formal or detailed evaluation has been made of the impact
of these programs in Mali generally and with regard to OACV in particular.
Therefore, the sub-project proposed for financing would include evaluating
past and ongoing functional literacy programs carried out by "Operation
Arachide". On the basis of preliminary evaluations, the establishing, staffing
and equipping of an additional 500 functional literacy centers seem reasonable
and are provided for under the project. If, as expected, the formal evaluation
confirms this program's effectiveness, a further 200 centers would be established.
33.      The agricultural research program would encompass the following
activities: (i) applied studies on diversifying agricultural production in
the project area by the introduction of crops such as cotton, maize, cowpeas,
and fodder; (ii) continuation of work on groundnut production, with particular
regard to improved varieties, pesticides, and fertilizers; and (iii) soil
surveys.



-9 -
34.       The sub-project for impro-ement of medical facilities would consist
of a modest program to expand the activities and better the quality of exist-
ing health services in the remotest parts of the project area. The improve-
ment of these facilites would enable more efficient detection and control -~
of outbreaks of infectious diseases. The program would also provide for
training farm families in basic hygiene. The project would provide for
additional staff, dispensaries, vehicles, equipment, and medicines, and for
operating costs required for the above purposes.
35.       Existing veterinary services, which generally lack funds for equip-
ment and medicines, would also be strengthened. This is a vital element,
considering the planned development of ox-drawn cultivation methods in the
project area. In addition to improved veterinary care for work oxen, farmers
would be trained in animal husbandry. Additional staff, vehicles, equipment,
veterinary medicines, and operating costs would be provided.
36.       The eIfects of the proposed project on the population in OACV areas
and on the economy of Mali would be studied by an autonomous Evaluation Unit
which is to work in close cooperation with the Institut d'Economie Rurale,
a department in the Ministry of Production, and to be established by the end
of 1974 and financed under the project. This unit would measure, among
other things, the impact of the project on the incomes and well-being of
participating farmers, and would assess pertinent changes in economic and
social indicators.
Prices and Marketing of Cereals
37        Producer prices for cereals are fixed by Government, and were
MF 20/Kg in 1972/73. This was about half the average price paid by
unofficial dealers and half to one-third the world price; at times, in fact,
cereals unofficially traded in Mali have fetched as much as MF 90/Kg. The
high prices ruling in unofficial trade make it difficult for "Office des
Produits Agricoles du Mali" (OPAM) to exert efficiently its cereal marketing
monopoly. As a first step towards remedying this situation, it was agreed
that: (i) sorghum and millet producer prices would be increased from MF 20
per Kg to a minimum of MF 25 per Kg effective from November 1974, (Section
4.07 (a) of the Development Credit Agreement); and (ii) a study on millet
and sorghum producer prices and marketing arrangements, to be completed by
April 30, 1975, would be carried out by the Government with the assistance
of consultants and under terms of reference acceptable to IDA. This study
is intended to provide a reasonable basis for further decisions on both
producer prices and marketing arrangements which should be satisfactory to
IDA (Sections 4.07 (b) and 3.05 of the Development Credit Agreement). Clearly,
larger price increases will eventually be needed, but as pricing policy is an
integral part of Government's generai policy to seek at all times an optimum
balance between prices, revenues and salaries in the Malian economy, too sudden
an increase now could have a serious and dramatic impact on urban living costs
and add to pressures for higher wages and create additional budgetary dif-
ficulties.



- 10 -
Credit Arrangements and Supply of Inputs
-3?,.     Credit operations in OA areas have suffered in the past from the
following problems:
(i) inadequate coordination between OA and the Societe de Credit
Agricole et d'Equipement Rural (SCAER). Since its reorgani-
zation three years ago, SCAER has acted primarily as a central
supply agency for operations such as OA, which deliver inputs
to farmers, collect cash payments and credit repayments, and
hold stocks of inputs on behalf of SCAER;
(ii) overdue debts averaging 20 percent of all loans made to
groundnut farmers since 1968, compared with 2 percent
for cotton farmers in "Operation Coton" areas; and
(iii) continuing controversy between SCAER and OA over the financing
of credit for groundnut seed. Over the objections of SCAER,
OA has retained funds from repayment of other loans to finance
credit for seed.
Recently, however, improvements have occurred. First, a "reciprocal service
agreement" has been prepared and accepted in principle by OA and SCAER. In
addition, an improved system of input ordering and stock management is being
implemented. Second, Government has indicated as noted (see para. 30) that
more legal pressure may be put on defaulting farmers. A condiuion of credit
effectiveness requires that a "reciprocal service agreement," satisfactory
to IDA and defining the responsibilities and obligations of both OACV and
SCAER, be signed by the two parties (Sections 3.02 and 8.01 (a) of the Develop-
ment Credit Agreement).
39.       Third, credit for seeds would be the direct responsibility of OACV
and would be financed from a revolving fund set up for this purpose. It was
agreed that "Office de Surveillance et de Regulation des Prix" (OSRP) would
take over responsibility for all outstanding debts of OA to SCAER in respect
of seed (effectively writing off past losses incurred in seed distribution
operations), and that no later than six months from signature of the proposed
IDA credit responsibility for supplying seed, and credit for seed, would be
transferred from SCAER to OACV which is best equipped for this purpose.
(Section 3.04 of the Development Credit Agreement) The project would ln-
clude provision for strengthening OACV's existing credit organization and
staff, including the finance to upgrade training of credit staff. All project
farmers would be eligible for credit for seasonal inputs.   No credit would
be provided for draft animal purchase since most farmers possess such animals
and, as at present, applicants for medium-term credit for farm equipment
would be required to prove possession of a pair of oxen and of at least 1.5
ha of destumped land. Seeds and ox-drawn equipment are sold at subsidized
prices. Total subsidies in project costs, however, are covered by Govern-
ment contributions. Given the critical need for farmers to use improved



- 11 -
seed, and the desirability of sponsoring ox-drawn equipment, it would be
ill-advised to take any measures that would increase the cost to the farmers
of these items at this time, but it was agreed that IDA would be consulted
on any changes proposed by Government in policy regarding the prices of,
and subsidies on, production illputs.
40.       No formal interest is charged on seasonal and medium-term (two
years) credit made to OA farmers, but financial costs (equal to 8.5% of cost
delivered to farmers) and other charges including operating expenses, pro-
vision for losses and bad debts, and an adequate spread are included in SCAER
cost prices. A feature of the arrangement, however, is that as financial
charges and provision for bad debts apply equally to both cash and credit
sales, they discourage farmers from buying for cash. It was agreed that
in the future, the prices of inputs and equipment sold for cash would be
appropriately discounted to encourage cash sales. (Section 4.03(a) of the
Development Credit Agreement). Such discount should reflect savings generated
by cash purchases roughly estimated at 7-9% of cost delivered to farmers.
Cost and Financing
41.       Total project costs are estimated at US$18.9 million, including
import duties and taxes totalling US$1.3 million. Farm inputs constitute
the principal element, accounting for US$5.1 million or 27 percent of total
project costs. Facilities and equipment for OACV (16 percent of total costs)
and operating costs (11 percent) are other major elements, as are the health,
literacy and other ancillary subprojects (14 percent) and technical assistance
(11 percent). In addition, US$4.0 million, equivalent to 21 percent of project
costs, has been set aside for contingencies. The proposed IDA credit of
US$8.0 million would cover 42 percent of total project costs and 75 percent
oi-- the foreign exchange component of project costs which is estimated at
US$10.6 million. Remaining costs, estimated at US$10.9 million, would be
covered by a FAC grant of US$2.5 million, Government contributions totalling
US$4.3 million and farmers' contributions of US$4.1 million. The contribu-
tions proposed for farmers and Government appear high given the tight fi-
nancial situation of both. Hlowever, farmers contributions include repayment
made during the IDA credit disbursement period for inputs and equipment
totalling US$1.9 million equivalent; the remainder of their contribution
of US$2.2 million equivalent would be allocated for down payments, purchase
of inputs for cash, cost of cart bodies and contingencies. Government's
contribution would include about US$0.9 million equivalent that it is con-
templated SCAER would rediscount in connection with its providing farm equip-
ment on medium-term credit.   US$1.3 million equivalent of Government's
contribution would be offset by the import duty and added value taxes com
ponent of project costs; a further US$2.1 million equivalent would accrue
to Government/OACV from levies on marketed groundnuts which would serve to
meet the cost of extension services.
Project Management and Technical Assistance
42.       The project would be managed by "Operation Arachide et Cultures
Vivrieres" (OACV) presently known as "Operation Arachide" (OA). As OA's



- 12 -
terformance has been satisfactory up to the present, no signfic£nt changes
nre proposed in its organization and administration other than the change
ft name.  DA has a Board of 20 directors, including 13 Government Officials,
9 technical experts, 3 farmers' representatives and 1 representative of OA
.taff; the chairman is the Minister of Production.
43.       OACV headquarters management would remain unchanged from the present
;A situation, with the general manager reporting to the "Service de l'Agri-
uiture" of the Ministry of Production. The general manager would continue
-o be assisted by a deputy, a technical manager, and a chief accountant.   The
eputy general manager would be responsible for general and personnel adminis-
.ration and credit operations; the technical manager, assisted by a specialist
in animal powered mechanization, for all technical aspects of the program;
and the chief accountant for all project and farmers' credit accounts.
44.       Field management would be effected through nine sectors (regional
offices), each led by a chief assisted by sub-sector chiefs.   The latter
wculd instruct and control the activities of extension agents (see paras. 29
and 30). For administration, accounting and credit operations, sector and
sub-sector chiefs would be assisted by "agents sociaux economiques", bookkeepers
with specialized responsibility for marketing and credit transactions.
45.       Technical assistance and consultant services to the prcject are ex-
pected to cost US$2.5 million; it is proposed that a contract should be made
with Bureau pour le Developpement de la Production Agricole (BDPA), which has
successfully assisted the ongoing project, to supply experts required by OACV
and costing an estimated US$2 million.   Similarly, the Groupement d'Etudes et
de Recherches pour le Developpement de l'Agronomie Tropicale (GERDAT), which
is currently assisting Mali in Agricultural research, would supply the experts
required for this activity at an estimated cost of US$150,000. Internationally
recruited staff and consultants at a cost of about US$390,000 would be re-
cruited under procedures acceptable to IDA to evaluate the functional literacy
program, head the evaluation unit, provide accountancy assistance to OACV
and carry out a study on cereal producer pricing and marketing arrangements.
A total of US$3.5 million would cover Malian staff and operating expenses,
credit for blacksmiths' equipment, motorcycles and bicycles for the extension
s taff.
Procurement and Disbursement
46E.      Project vehicles and graders amounting to US$1.5 million would be
procured on the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with
IDA guidelines. Equipment and furniture valued at US$0.4 million, for which
there is a satisfactory degree of local competition, would be procured by
local competitive bidding. Construction of project offices, houses, stores
and garages costing an estimated US$1.9 million would also be tendered locally
since the size of individual contracts would be too small to attract foreign
bids. A satisfactory degree of competition between experienced local con-
tractors can be expected. Farm inputs (fertilizers and agricultural chemicals)
and implements for draft animals amounting to US$3.5 million, to be financed



- 13 -
by Government and farmers, would be procured by SCAER. SCAER's purchasing
procedures, which are based on satisfactory competitive bidding, would con-
tinue under the project. It is expected that SCAER will consult with IDA
regarding tender documents. The ruzal track improvement and main tenance
program would be carried out by force account, which is the only practical
means for timely and proper execution of this program.   Seeds required by the
project costing an estimated US$1.3 million would be locally procured and
distributed under OACV supervision. Cart bodies valued at US$319,000 would
be supplied or purchased locally by farmers.
47.       The proceeds of the IDA credit would be disbursed during the four-
year period 1974/75 - 1977/78 to cover: (a) 100 percent of the cif cost of
vehicles and graders imported for the project - US$0.8 million; (b) 18 per-
cent of the cost of seeds - US$0.2 million; (c) 80 percent of the cost of
buildings - US$1.4 million; (d) 85 percent of the salaries of technical
assistance staff and consultants for project management - US$1.7 million;
(e) 100 percent of foreign expenditures for a proposed cereal marketing study
and accountancy services - US$0.1 million; (f) 75 percent of incremental ex-
penditures for local staff - US$0.8 million; and (g) 80 percent of incre-
mental operating costs of Project - US$1.6 million. US$1.4 million of the
credit would remain unallocated to cover contingencies.
48.       Owing to the Government's extraordinarily difficult financial posi-
tion, exacerbated by the drought, it was agreed that the Association would
pre-finance an initial deposit of US$200,000 equivalent in a special account
to be creited (Section 2.02(b) of the Development Credit Agreement). Establish-
ment of this account, which would serve as a revolving fund, is a condition
of effectiveness for the proposed credit (see para. 51).
Benefits
49.       Some 107,000 farming families, involving about one million people in
all, would participate in the OACV project, compared to 52,000 farming families
and 490,000 people served by OA in 1972/73. Total incremental cash income
accruing to participating families from groundnuts and cereals, assuming all
are sold, would amount to about US$5.0 million equivalent annually; the per
capita incomes of farm families prepared to implement the technical recom-
mendations of OACV would increase two or three-fold. The economic rate of
return from investment in the project is estimated at 91 percent over a
project life of 15 years. This high return is partly attributable to the
importance of previous and ongoing investments which are sunk costs to the
project and the high degree of technical proficiency of farmers resulting
from previous extension efforts. Also instrumental are the relatively high
projected groundnut and sorghum long-term international prices. The sensi-
tivity of the return to such factors and other variables has been tested.
The return shows a relatively high sensitivity to changes in prices, but it
can withstand substantial and adverse deviations from appraisal estimates and
still remain acceptable.

C    Projects in Execution I/
Credit 95-MLI First Railway Project. US$9.1 Million Credit of September 29,
1966; Closing Date June 30, 1974
The First Railway Project, the physical program of which lagged
behlind schedule at one time by about three years, is now almost completed.
The Closing Date, set initially for June 30, 1970, was first postponed to
0ecember 31, 1971. The Association, however, agreed that savings of $480,000
under the Credit should be used for renewal of an additional 14 in of track,
and extended the Closing Date to December 31, 1972. This date was further
postponed to June 30, 1973, because of delay in delivery of equipment. Most
recently, the Closing Date has been postponed for a fourth time to June 30,
1974 to permit implementation of a tariff study with additional savings under
the Credit. Progress toward achieving the financial targets set at project
appraisal has been slow. However, the railway's formerly precarious financial
situation is now improving due to Government waivers of US$1.6 million equiv-
alent owed by the Regie and of interest and principal payments on Credit
95-MLT.  The Government has also agieed to compensate the Regie for payments to
the Senegal Railways for equipment charges.
Credit 197-MLI First Highway Project. US$7.7 Million Credit of June 17,
1970; Closing Date March 31, 1976
The First Higway Project is being carried out with the assistance
of two teams of experts from the International Labor Organization (ILO) who
are also helping to reorganize the Equipment Department of the National
Directorate of Public Works (DPW). The borrower's performance is good, and
the project is progressing satisfactorily after a slow start.
Credit 277-MLI Mopti Rice Development Project. US$6.9 Million Credit of
January 6, 1972; Closing Date May 31, 1978
The Rice Development Credit is now making satisfactory progress
after initial delays due to Government budgetary constraints and the Ministry
officials' lack of knowledge of IDA procedures. It is expected that the
project's main civil works contract should be completed one year ahead of
appraisal schedule. Nevertheless, the extreme shortage of rainfall and
reduced flooding of the Niger River have seriously hinderd production.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the executive Directors on the progress
of projects in execution, and in particular to report any problems being
encountered, and the action being taken to remedy them. They should be
read in this sense, and with the understanding that they do not purport
to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses in project
execution.

Credit 321-MLI Telecommunications Project. US$3.6 Million Credit of
June 28, 1972; Closing Date July 1, 1976
The Telecommunications Project was declared effective April 4,
1973 after some delay in the Government's meeting certain conditions. No
major problems are anticipated.
Credit 383-MLI  Second Highway Project.   US$9.5 Million Credit of May 23,
1973; Closing Date July 19, 1977
The Second Highway Credit became effective August 20, 1973. No
major problems have arisen.
Credit 384-MLI Second Railway Project. US$6.7 Million Credit of May 23,
1973; Closing Date June 30, 1978
The Second Railway Project was expected to cost a total of about
US$9.33 million, with IDA participation of US$6.7 million and FAC financing
of US$1.8 million. Execution of thet project began in mid-1973 and is
proceeding on schedule; the FAC-finamced items (locomotives and spare parts)
have already been delivered, and bids have been received for most of the
other items. However, on the basis of these bids and of current estimates,
the cost of items foreseen to be financed by the Credit amounts to about
US$9.9 million, an overrun of 48%. This overrun can be attributed to low
estimates quoted on some items at project appraisal, the general increase in
world market prices, and the fact that only single bids were received for
some items. To avoid a supplementary Credit, project changes have been
proposed which will mainly cut back much of the track renewal works and reduce
the procurement of motive power and rolling stock. The project's foreign
costs now amount to about US$8.8 million of which IDA will finance US$6.7
million, FAC US$1.8 million, and CIDA US$0.3 million. The revision of the
project is not expected to have serious consequences on railway operations.
Although it had been agreed that a tariff increase to produce an
8% increase in revenues would be implemented on January 1, 1974, this will
probably not now be done until June 1974 at the earliest due to delays in
preparing the revised tariff structure and tariffs. This could affect the
Regie's ability to meet the financial covenants specified in the Credit
documents.
Credit 420-MLI First Education Project. US$5.0 Million Credit of July 11,
1973; Closing Date December 31, 1979
The First Education Credit negotiated in May, 1973, became
effective November 15, 1973. No major problems are anticipated.

major problems are anticipated.

Procurement
Arrangements:
Project vehicles and graders amounting to US$1.5 million would be
procured on the basis of international competitive bidding. Equipment and
furniture valued at US$0.4 million and for which there is a satisfactory degree
of local competition, would be procured by locally advertized competitive
bidding procedures. Construction of project offices, houses, stores and
garages costing an estimated US$1.9 million would also be tendered locally
since the size of individual contracts would be too small to attract foreign
bids. A satisfactory degree of competition between experienced local con-
tractors can be expected. Farm inputs (fertilizers and agrocides) and
implements for draft animals amounting to US$3.5 million, to be financed by
Government and farmers, would be procured by SCAER. SCAER's purchasing
procedures which are based on satisfactory competitive bidding, would continue
under the project, subject to consultation with IDA regarding tender documents.
The rural track improvement and maintenance program would be carried out by

force account, which is the only practical means for timely and proper
execution of this program. Seeds required by the project costing an estimated
US$1.3 million would be locally procured and distributed under OACV super-
vision. Cart bodies valued at US$319,000 would be supplied or purchased
locally by farmers.
'Consultants
Technical assistance and consultant services to the project are ex-
pected to cost US$2.5 million; it is proposed that a contract should be made
with the Bureau pour le Developpement de la Production Agricole (BDPA), which
has successfully assisted the ongoing project, to supply experts required by
OACV and costing an estimated US$2 million. Similarly, the Groupement d'Etudes
et de Recherche pour le Developpement de l'Agronomie Tropicale (GERDAT),
which is currently assisting Mali in agricultural research, would supply
the experts required at an estimated cost of US$150,000. Internationally
recruited staff at a cost of about US$390,000, would be recruited under pro-
cedures acceptable to IDA to evaluate the functional literacy program, to
provide accountancy assistance to OACV, to head the evaluation unit and to
carry out a study on cereal producer prices and marketing arrangements.
Economic Rate of Return from Investment in the Projlect: 91Z over a project
