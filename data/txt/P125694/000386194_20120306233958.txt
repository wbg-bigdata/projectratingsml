                              REPUBLIC OF MAURITIUS

             PUBLIC SECTOR PERFORMANCE DEVELOPMENT POLICY LOAN

Borrower                  Republic of Mauritius

Implementing Agency       Ministry of Finance and Economic Development

Financing Data            IBRD Loan: Development Policy Loan (DPL). The proposed loan
                          amount is US$20 million.

Operation Type            Programmatic DPL (two operations). The proposed operation is the
                          first of the series.

Main Policy Areas         Social Protection, Education, Trade Competitiveness, Civil Service
                          Reform, Public Enterprise Reform.

Key Outcome Indicators       Number of people with less than a secondary school certificate
                              in the Placement for Training program under the National
                              Empowerment Foundation, reflecting an increased poverty
                              focus.
                           Number of households in the Social Register of Mauritius
                              (SRM), which will serve as the basis for an integrated database
                              for poverty targeted programs.
                           Percentage of students entering Year 1 and completing the pre-
                              vocational education cycle, reflecting increased access to quality

                              window, thus indicating greater administrative harmonization
                              and a reduced administrative burden for business.
                           Time needed to settle the Customs administrative penalty
                              amount, reflecting increased transparency and efficiency in the
                              application of Customs appeals.
                           Gradual reduction in the time needed to process the prescription
                              of Schemes of Service and in the number of Schemes of Service,
                              reflecting increased flexibility in the civil service.
                           Number of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) included in the
                              quarterly performance reports prepared by the Office of Public
                              Sector Governance (OPSG) and published on the OPSG website,
                              indicating better monitoring of SOE performance and reform.
Program Development       The development objective of the DPL programmatic series is to
Objective(s) and          support improvements in the performance of the public sector in
Contribution to Country   Mauritius by assisting the government to implement the following
Partnership Strategy      three reform pillars: (i) strengthening services to support and
(CPS)                     empower the most vulnerable; (ii) streamlining trade regulation and
                          processes; and (iii) improving human resource management in the


                                             vi
               civil service and the monitoring of SOE performance.

Risks          The implementation of the proposed reform program entails a
               number of risks:

               (a) The challenge of maintaining macroeconomic stability in the face
               of uncertain global developments. The government has the means
               and tools to cope with external economic uncertainties, though a
               firm commitment will be needed to rein in public expenditure if a
               substantial economic slowdown materializes.

               (b) Political risk that may affect the pace of the reform program at a
               time when the need for reform is most urgent, given global
               economic uncertainties. Many of these second generation reforms
               will have redistributive effects and the government may find it
               difficult to overcome some resistance from vested interests. This
               complexity is further compounded by the withdrawal of one party
               from the government coalition in July 2011, which has left the
               government with only a slim majority in Parliament. This DPL aims
               to mitigate this risk by supporting reforms that will bring returns in
               the short term while putting in place the building blocks necessary to
               expedite the broader reform program in the medium term.

               (c) Limited institutional capacity within the sector ministries to lead
               and implement the reforms. The Bank and the government have
               signed a Services Agreement for Reimbursable Technical Assistance
               (RTA) to support institutional capacity. This RTA will complement
               the Bank’s program and enable line ministries to enhance their
               institutional capacity where needed. Additionally, the DPL itself will
               build bridges between the different ministries involved in the reform
               program, thereby enhancing coordination. The Bank’s analytical
               work program will support these reform areas while also enhancing
               the institutional capacity of sector ministries. In addition, this
               analytical work program has been coordinated with other
               development partners to leverage limited resources and to focus on
               areas that are most relevant for maximizing impact.

               (d) Allegations of corruption that have been at the center in the
               national debate for the past several months. These allegations are
               under investigation by the Independent Commission Against
               Corruption (ICAC). Corruption is not only an impediment to
               investment but also triggered a political crisis in Mauritius when
               accusations reached the highest level of government. This risk is
               mitigated by the fact the government appears to be supportive of the
               ICAC and respectful of its independence.

                                     I.   INTRODUCTION


1.      Recent economic reforms in Mauritius have built on a long tradition of economic
growth and transformation. Since independence in 1968, Mauritius has achieved substantial
economic growth of around 5 percent per annum, which has underpinned its economic
transition from a predominantly agricultural economy based on sugar production to a
diversified economy structured around textile exports and tourism. However, by the mid-
2000s, with the erosion of Mauritius’ preferential trade status and rising commodity prices, it
was evident that more reforms were needed to further the country’s transition from a labor-
intensive economy to a high-value-added knowledge and services economy. As a result, in
2006 the government implemented a bold reform program structured around four pillars: (i)
strengthening fiscal consolidation and public sector efficiency; (ii) enhancing trade
competitiveness; (iii) improving the investment climate; and (iv) widening opportunities. The
reform was broadly successful in restoring competitiveness, achieving economic growth, and
creating employment in higher-value-added sectors. Moreover, the reform helped to
consolidate government expenditure and reversed the upward trend in public debt. This
provided the necessary space to adopt temporary counter-cyclical fiscal and monetary policies
to mitigate the negative impact of the global financial crisis in 2009-10 and of the Euro crisis
in 2010.

2.      However, the reform agenda remains unfinished and critical constraints to
economic development, particularly with regard to public sector performance, have
become increasingly evident. There is substantial room for improvement in the performance
of the public sector, particularly with regard to parastatals and public companies. The
performance of the public sector significantly lowers the quality of service delivery and
undermines overall economic competitiveness. Reform will be necessary to bring the sector
up to the necessary level for Mauritius to achieve its development goals.

3.      The uncertain status of the global economy and the risk that this poses for
Mauritius makes the need for reform even more urgent. Global economic uncertainties
pose an increasing threat to a small open economy such as Mauritius, primarily on two fronts
– the fiscal position and the current account deficit. Slower global economic growth could
depress domestic growth and tax revenues, yet pressure to finance government priorities is
likely to continue. The fiscal position remains stretched with public debt still high and is only
projected to decline by a modest amount in the medium term. Therefore, any counter-cyclical
fiscal policy will be difficult to implement if these external threats materialize. This highlights
the need for measures that would substantially increase public sector efficiency. Additionally,
current account deficits, although high, have so far been financed mostly by high foreign
direct investment (FDI) and inflows to the financial sector, but this could quickly reverse if
international financial markets deteriorate. The concentration of the country’s exports on only
                                                1
a few markets (Europe) and products (tourism and textiles) could lead to a further
deterioration in the current account deficit. This suggests an urgent need to accelerate reforms
to increase competitiveness and position the economy to access new markets and develop new
products.

4.      However, this second generation of public sector reforms is likely to be more
difficult and more politically sensitive to implement than the first. In 2010, the new
government adopted a five-year plan, with a commitment to continuing the basic direction of
structural reforms (increasing public investment, fostering economic competitiveness, and
making the public sector more efficient) but with an increased emphasis on social programs to
ensure that all segments of the population benefit from economic growth. This plan is
adequate as a basis for regaining competitiveness and reducing poverty in Mauritius.
However, the design and implementation of these reforms is complex. While the nature of the
previous reforms allowed the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development to coordinate
and lead the reform process, the current reform program is being led by a number of different
sector ministries whose capacity is weaker, thus making coordination more problematic.
Moreover, this second generation of reforms is likely to affect a wide range of public sector
stakeholders, some of whom are well organized and influential and who may effectively resist
reform. This complexity has been compounded by the withdrawal of one party from the
government coalition in July 2011, which has resulted in the government having only a slim
majority in Parliament. As a result of all of these factors, the pace of reform implementation
has slowed down in Mauritius, and the government seeks to prioritize those reforms that not
only have the potential to yield broadly shared economic growth but are also politically
feasible to implement.

5.       The support provided by this proposed DPL will help the government to
overcome many of the challenges that it faces. The government continues to see DPLs as a
useful vehicle for supporting policy reform in Mauritius, not only the financing itself but also
the technical assistance and policy dialogue that the Bank can provide through its DPLs. The
Bank can offer global knowledge and best practices and can ensure that discussions of the
reform agenda are evidence-based, which also provides additional support to those
championing the reform program. The approach is particularly important in the current
context where the reform process has slowed down. The DPL series focuses on achieving
politically feasible reforms in the near term while laying the necessary building blocks to
accelerate reforms in the medium term. The DPL series aims to do this by supporting the
creation of systems that will enable the government to define appropriate reform options as
well as the strengthening of the institutions that can coordinate and consolidate the reform
initiatives.

6.      The development objective of the DPL programmatic series is to support
improvements in the performance of the public sector in Mauritius by assisting the
government to implement the following three reform pillars: (i) strengthening services to
support and empower the most vulnerable; (ii) streamlining trade regulation and processes;
and (iii) improving human resource management in the civil service and the monitoring of
SOE performance.

7.      The proposed DPL is being prepared in coordination with the Bank’s Private
Sector Competitiveness (PSC) DPL. The two DPL series are designed to be mutually
reinforcing and to address complementary aspects of the government’s reform program while
ensuring that the Bank’s support remains sufficiently flexible. The PSC DPL series will focus
primarily on strengthening the policy and institutional environment for private sector
competitiveness, while this proposed DPL will focus primarily on the performance of the
public sector. If the government is going to successfully weather the possible challenges
ahead and prepare itself for the next phase of rapid and inclusive economic growth, the
reforms supported by these two operations will be instrumental to that success.

A. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND MACROECONOMIC POLICY FRAMEWORK IN MAURITIUS

8.      The negative impact of the 2008/2009 global economic crisis in Mauritius was
partially contained by a short-term fiscal stimulus package that also aimed to build the
country’s long-term competitiveness and enhance its investment climate. This package
was made possible by the government’s relatively comfortable fiscal position prior to the
onset of the crisis. This fiscal space allowed the government to adopt an expansionary
macroeconomic policy, with both fiscal and monetary components. Between 2009 and 2011,
fiscal stimulus measures cumulatively accounted for about 7.5 percent of GDP, with a focus
on large infrastructure projects and targeted programs to assist firms and workers.1 One
salient feature of these targeted programs was the close coordination between the public and
private sectors in which the government agreed to support firms as they restructured while the
private sector did its utmost to preserve employment. As a result, job numbers were
maintained during the crisis, and the unemployment rate remained stable at 7.3 percent in
2009 compared to 7.2 percent in 2008.

9.     Growth picked up in 2010 but has not yet reached 2008 levels. GDP growth
accelerated to 4.1 percent in 2010 from 3.0 percent in 2009 (Table 1). In line with the

1
  A salient initiative was the Mechanism for Transitional Support to Private Sector (MTSP, which came to be
known as the “Mauritius Approach?). In the MTSP, the government became an equity partner to guarantee the
survival of otherwise sound firms that were experiencing severe difficulties during the crisis. The Mauritius
approach started to be implemented in December 2008. The program initially targeted large companies and the
main objective was to reduce the likelihood of massive lay-offs.

    structural change in the economy, overall growth was led by strong growth in the services
    sector, particularly real estate services, hotels and restaurants, and financial intermediation,
    which together now account for 30 percent of GDP compared to 23 percent a decade ago.
    Agricultural output ‒ a small share of the economy but with a long tradition ‒ decreased by
    1.3 percent, with a decline in sugar cane production (-6.4 percent) that reflected a
    longstanding structural trend. The construction sector, boosted by demand for residential and
    commercial construction, grew by 4.3 percent, the lowest growth rate in the last five years.
    Manufacturing remained stable with declining sugar processing and no growth in the textile
    sector, but this was offset by growth in new products such as the processing of fish and other
    food (4.4 percent).

    10.     Economic growth for 2011 is now expected to have been around 4.1 percent amid
    global economic turbulence. The original economic outlook for 2011 as set out in the 2011
    government budget was quite positive and projected a return to Mauritius’ historical growth
    trajectory of 4.5 percent annual growth, driven by a strong external demand and high tourism
    revenues that compensated for an expected slowdown in the construction sector. However,
    there is some evidence that fiscal consolidation in advanced economies and increasing debt
    and financial worries in Europe may be having an impact on the Mauritian economy, as there
    was a substantial fall in FDI in the first half of 2011. In a revised projection in September
    2011, Statistics Mauritius reduced its GDP growth projection for 2011 from 4.5 to 4.1
    percent, driven mainly by a larger than expected (11.8 percent) drop in sugar cane production,
    a related decline in sugar milling and a fall in the construction sector as a result of a 0.6
    percent decline of private sector investment.

    11.     Updated IMF projections that factor the latest impact of the European economic
    downturn estimate that 2012 GDP growth in Mauritius could slowdown to 3.7 percent
    before picking up in 2013, though this hinges on highly uncertain global developments.
    This is below government projections embedded in the public budget presented in November
    2011 that projected GDP growth in 2012 close to 2011 levels of about 4 percent. Growth

prospects are sensitive to the pace of the implementation of domestic reforms as well as
external factors since Mauritius is a small open economy and exports (i.e. textile, tourism, and
ICT-BPO sectors) are very dependent of the euro zone. The government’s projections assume
that the global recovery will remain timid and that the government’s reforms will only
gradually lead to higher productivity and diversification in the private sector, returning to a
level of 4.2 percent economic growth by 2014. The Bank’s projections are in line with the
most recent figures from the government that incorporate updated IMF projections prepared
during the article IV consultations that took place in January 2012 (Table 3).

12.     Yet the Mauritian economy faces substantial risks, particularly with regard to a
slowdown in international economic growth. The main channels of transmission of
economic shocks from the global economy to Mauritius ‒ and especially from the European
economies to which Mauritius remains highly exposed ‒ are tourism (which represents 26
percent of the country’s total exports of goods and services), FDI, and commodity imports. To
model the impact on Mauritius should these shocks materialize, an alternative growth scenario
assumes slower growth in partner countries in 2012 (a 2.5 percent decline in real GDP
growth) before a gradual but slow recovery. Inflation in advanced economies is also assumed
to slow as economic activity decelerates. Under this alternative scenario, real GDP growth in
Mauritius is projected to fall by 2 percentage points to 1.7 percent in 2012, and 2.7 percent in
2013 and will only rebound by 2015 (Table 4). Export growth is projected to be significantly
lower. For example, growth of tourism receipts are likely to decline by almost 16 percent
compared to an increase of 9 percent under the baseline scenario. However, despite some
reduction in the demand for imports projected for 2012 as domestic demand falters, the
external current account deficit is projected to remain at around 8.7 percent of GDP. Under
this alternative scenario, FDI is assumed to decline as a share of GDP in 2011 and 2012,
reaching a low of 2 percent of GDP with net outflows amounting to 2 percent of GDP by
2012, while other financial flows are expected to remain broadly stable. As a consequence,
there would be a balance of payments deficit of 9.7 percent of GDP in 2012, but the
substantial amount of foreign exchange will yield enough resources to finance this, while the
flexible exchange rate regime will help to narrow the balance of payments deficit over time.

13.     The fiscal position will remain stretched, with limited space to respond to
unexpected shocks and potential vulnerabilities. The fiscal space created by the
government’s cautious fiscal policies prior to the 2008 crisis was largely used up by the
stimulus measures implemented to counter the financial and Euro zone crises, resulting in a
fiscal deficit of 3.2 percent of GDP in 2010 (Table 5). With total revenues (including grants)
being 21.8 percent of GDP in 2010, the deficit was partly contained by the low execution
rates of capital expenditures. Tax revenues are projected to increase by 9 percent in 2012 to
18.3 percent of GDP, and increasing grants2 are expected to lift total public revenues to 21.7
percent of GDP in 2012. For the period 2012-2013, the fiscal deficit is expected to remain at
around 3.8 percent of GDP. This reflects the government’s additional expenditures on efforts
to open up critical bottlenecks and boost long-term growth. These expenditures will include
ambitious investments in energy, water and sewerage, and transport infrastructure of around
3.5 percent of GDP per year over the next five years. The deficit could further widen to more
than 6 percent of GDP if there is a substantial international economic slowdown as a result of
reduced revenues and with the impact of automatic stabilizers. To respond to this risk, the
government has already created a National Resilience Fund using public savings from 2011
and previous years to finance a potential shortfall in revenues of 1.2 percentage points
compared to the 2012 budget projections. Should revenues drop further, the government
would need to accelerate efficiency increases in public expenditure and/or delay the
implementation of some aspects of the public infrastructure program.

14.     Despite lengthening debt maturity, the financing needs of the public sector
continue to be high. The gross financing requirements of the government are projected to
remain at around the same level over the next three years at around Rs. 84 billion a year
(US$2.9 billion or 25.3 percent of GDP in 2012, see Table 6). This is mostly explained by the
high amortization of domestic securities falling due, which represent around 35 percent of
total debt per year. In addition, an additional 4.4 percent of GDP (around US$540 million) is
needed to cover the deficit, of which 2 percent of GDP is being financed by issuing new

2
    Mainly from the European Union (Rs 2,600 million or around 0.84 percent of GDP).
                                                             6
domestic debt and around 2.4 percent of GDP by new external loans. These high levels of
financing needs are in line with recent trends. Most of the new gross borrowing requirements
(91 percent of the total) are expected to be financed domestically. The domestic financial
market is very liquid so it should be able to accommodate this financing with ease, but the
government remains exposed to rapid changes in market sentiment and pricing.

15.      The last Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA)3 projects a sustainable public debt
level over the medium term. The DSA notes the reduction in public debt to 52 percent of
GDP in 2008 from over 71 percent of GDP in 2003 due to the fiscal consolidation policies
introduced since 2005, but it also recognizes that it had gone up again to 57 percent in 2010 as
a result of the stimulus packages. The 2012 Public Budget projects a moderate increase in
public debt over 2011 levels to 57.4 percent of GDP in 2012 (of which 77 percent is domestic
debt), before a limited debt consolidation by 2014 takes place (55 percent of GDP).4 Under a
baseline scenario of average GDP growth of 4.5 percent and fiscal deficits in the 4 to 4.5
percent range, debt to GDP would gradually reach the 50 percent debt-to-GDP target by 2018.
However, under alternative scenarios in which there is significant growth slowdown, public
debt-to-GDP may rise to close to the 60 percent of GDP ceiling mandated under the Public
Debt Management Act.5 This would require the government to adopt a more ambitious
medium-term fiscal consolidation agenda by making efficiency gains in public expenditure or
slowing down the implementation of the investment program. In the same vein, the DSA
projects that the external debt is sustainable6 and that it may rise over the next few years to
finance the public infrastructure program before stabilizing at about 20 percent of GDP.
External debt sustainability is resilient to substantial real depreciation, but external debt
dynamics would become unsustainable over a five-year period should the current account
deficit increase by 3 percentage points of GDP compared to the baseline.

  Debt will also be slightly reduced from 54.2 percent of GDP in 2011 to 52.6 percent of GDP in 2014.
(Following the 2010 amended Public Debt Amendment Act, any debt from parastatals that get revenues from the
sale of market services is discounted.)
5
   The 2008 Public Debt Management Act (amended in 2010) imposes a ceiling on the total amount of
outstanding public sector debt. The ceiling is set at 60 percent of GDP at current market prices, with the aim of
reducing it to 50 percent of GDP by the end of 2018. Under the Act, the debt ceiling can be breached: (i) in the
case of natural disasters or other emergencies requiring exceptional expenditure; (ii) when a large investment
project in the public sector is deemed by the Cabinet to be timely and prudent; or (iii) in the case of a general
economic slowdown requiring a fiscal stimulus. However, any rise in the percentage of debt–to-GDP ratio at the
end of a fiscal year should not exceed 2 percent of the debt–to-GDP percentage of the previous fiscal year, and
MoFED must prepare a plan to restore the ceiling within three fiscal years.

16.      The balance of payments remains comfortably financed, but it is vulnerable to a
slowdown in exports and potential reversals in financial inflows. The current account
deficit increased in 2008 to 10.2 percent of GDP from 5.5 percent of GDP in 2007 as a result
of the sharp reduction in exports and was financed by a rise in FDI-related imports. Under the
baseline scenario, the deficit is expected to increase to around 10 percent of GDP in 2011
before slowly narrowing to 7.5 percent in 2013, a reduction that would be delayed under the
alternative scenario. Although this deficit is projected to be comfortably financed by
significant financial inflows (Table 7), especially by FDI, the current account remains
exposed to increasing prices for food and oil, which account for 24 percent of total imports, as
well as developments in the European markets, which still account for 65 percent of Mauritian
exports.7

17.     The exchange rate appreciated moderately in 2011, and reserves remained at
comfortable levels. Capital inflows ‒ FDI, growing government external borrowing (albeit on
a sustainable trajectory), and large net capital inflows to the banking sector ‒ accounted for
the 5.5 percent nominal appreciation of the Mauritian rupee against a weighted average of the
bilateral exchange rates of the country’s major trade partners. After taking into account the
high domestic inflation rate compared with that of Mauritius’s major trading partners, the real
effective exchange Rate (REER) appreciated by 7 percent between January and September
2011. Having said this, net international reserves at the BoM increased by about US$100
million, reaching US$2.7 billion by the end of August 2011, the equivalent of about 4.6
months of imports of goods and non-factor services and around 39 percent of short-term
foreign debt. Under the alternative scenario in 2012, reserves would serve as a buffer, and,
although they might fall by around US$900 million, they would still be at a manageable level
(US$1.5 billion or around 2.8 months of imports of goods and services).

  Although the government has launched an effort to diversify export production and increase exports to Asia
and regional markets, textile exports account for 45 percent of total goods exports, and tourism receipts account
for 27 percent of total exports (67 percent of tourists come from Europe).
                                                          8
18.     The financial sector in Mauritius successfully weathered the international
economic and financial downturn of 2008-2010, but risks remain. The good health of the
financial sector is critical because it has accounted for a significant share of GDP growth over
the past few years and is expected to play an even more prominent role through increasing
off-shore activities and more effective financial intermediation in the domestic market,
notably to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). This sector receives around one-third
of all FDI inflows, thanks in part to the country’s double taxation treaty with foreign countries
(such as India). The financial system remains solid even after the 2008-09 international
financial turmoil, with high capital adequacy ratios, few non-performing loans, and a sound
liquidity position. However, two areas may constitute a risk in the medium term. First, the
gradual concentration of lending in construction and tourism (almost 40 percent of total loans
in 2010) makes local banks vulnerable to a deterioration of prospects in those sectors. Second,
the significant increase in foreign currency deposits and loans, which now represent around
60 percent of total deposits and loans, will require continued close monitoring by the Central
Bank (Bank of Mauritius, BoM). The financial system is vulnerable to a sudden withdrawal of
foreign denominated deposits and to volatile exchange rates, even though the BoM has
remained committed to intervening in the market to smooth exchange rate volatility.

19.     Monetary policy should remain cautious to keep the inflation rate under control.
Increasing global food and energy prices have caused consumer price inflation to edge up to
4.8 percent year-on-year by the end of 2011. To mitigate second-round effects on prices and
wages and moderate the growing amount of credit available to the private sector (particularly
real estate), the BoM tightened monetary policy in February, March, and June of 2011,
increasing reserve requirements from 6 percent to 7 percent of their average deposit holdings
and lifting the repo rate up by 0.75 percent points to 5.5 percent, before lowering its key repo
rate by 10 basis points to 5.4 percent in December 2011. At the end of 2011, the BoM was
maintaining its tightening stance, but it stands ready to revisit this if global developments
warrant a change. For the medium term, monetary policy is expected to continue to aim to
keep the inflation rate stable at a level of about 4 to 5 percent per year.

20.     The country’s rising unemployment rates largely reflect an emerging structural
trend, namely, a growing skills mismatch in the labor market. Despite positive economic
growth, employment creation in 2010 did not keep up with the 2.7 percent increase in the
labor force, which was fueled by the constant increase in female participation. As a result, the
unemployment rate rose to 7.8 percent compared to 7.3 percent in 2009. Short-term
developments aside, there is evidence that structural factors are at play, with labor-intensive
industries such as sugar and tourism doing less well than those with low labor intensity such
as banking or health care. Although the unemployment rate had been decreasing thanks to
structural reforms since 2005 (when it reached a peak of 9.6 percent) the 2008 crisis halted
this trend. Since then the trend has been upward, reflecting the increasing difficulty that the
economy is facing in absorbing unskilled and semi-skilled workers as it transforms into a
more service- and knowledge-oriented economy. Since the growth has mainly been led by
high productivity and low labor-intensity sectors, the demand for skilled workers in higher
valued-added industries and/or management positions has outpaced the growth in the supply.
As a result, skills shortages and mismatches are becoming fundamental bottlenecks to
increasing competitiveness and to the emergence of a higher value-added economy.

21.    Overall, the macroeconomic framework is adequate for development policy
lending. While there is substantial external uncertainty that may affect the Mauritian
economy in 2012, the economy has already proved itself ‒ in 2008 ‒ to be highly resilient and
the government has the means to cope with these external shocks. Furthermore, this DPL
series will support the macroeconomic framework by improving the performance of the
public sector in Mauritius in three key areas: (i) strengthening services to support and
empower the most vulnerable; (ii) streamlining the regulation of, and support to, business
investment and trade; and (iii) improving human resource management in the civil service and
the monitoring of SOE performance.


     III.    THE GOVERNMENT’S PROGRAM AND PARTICIPATORY PROCESSES

22.     In 2005, a new government announced a bold package of policies and
institutional reforms. Implementation was very successful and resulted in fundamental
improvements to the macroeconomic policy framework and to the overall regulatory
environment. In response to the global financial crisis and the Euro Zone crisis in 2010, the
government passed the Economic Restructuring and Competitiveness Program (ERCP),8
representing 4 percent of GDP, with the aim of increasing competitiveness and further
diversifying the Mauritian economy. The plan focused on infrastructure spending, providing
financial relief to the firms hit hardest by the crisis, and social and job protection measures.
The economy reacted favorably to the reforms, and both growth and employment rates
recovered, which helped to consolidate public consensus around and support for the
government’s program.

23.     In 2010, a new government coalition, also led by the Labor Party, came to power
and vowed to continue the reform agenda with an increased focus on equity and
enhanced measures to support the economic recovery following the downturn caused by the
global recession. The Presidential Address that outlined the government’s program for 2010-
2015 laid out policies that would sustain economic growth but also ensure that the benefits of
that economic growth were enjoyed by the whole population. Further details of the
government’s program were contained in the budget speeches in November 2010 and
November 2011. The policy measures in these budgets covered four broad areas: (i)
rebalancing growth; (ii) enhancing productivity; (iii) consolidating social justice; and (iv)
achieving fiscal consolidation and macroeconomic resilience.

                                          A. REBALANCING GROWTH

24.    Mauritius is dependent on a narrow export market and relatively few export
products with low value added. This means that Mauritius remains particularly vulnerable
to global economic shocks. Moreover, trends over time suggest that Mauritius is not
successfully addressing these constraints, demonstrated by the fact that a number of indicators
have stagnated since the early 2000s. Specifically, Mauritius is still overly reliant on the
European market and is characterized by a limited number of export products and services
and a low level of export sophistication. The fact that Mauritian exports are geographically
concentrated remains a major source of vulnerability as has been evident during the 2010

                                                       10
Euro crisis, which motivated the government to implement the ERCP. The Euro crisis also
sparked a debate in Mauritius about how best to respond to the country’s significant export
concentration. In response, the government has laid out a number of policies seeking to
address these issues.

25.      The first policy is to diversify markets and products towards emerging markets
and position Mauritius as a strategic player between Asia and Africa. The goal is to
reduce dependence on Euro zone countries and to shift to higher-value-added economic
activities. To attain this objective, the government plans to make greater use of economic
diplomacy to break into new markets and to facilitate joint ventures and strategic alliances
with the private sector. There is scope for Mauritius to be a conduit for business from China
and India into Africa, taking advantage of its close ties to those two Asian countries and its
preferential trade access to Africa as a member of the Southern African Development
Community (SADC), the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), and
the East African Community. This potential is magnified by the fact that these regional blocks
are in the process of creating an enlarged Free Trade Agreement (FTA) by harmonizing their
trade principles. The enlarged FTA will constitute a larger market and reduce the costs of
doing business. The government is also reviewing its air access policy with the intention of
transforming the expanded airport in Mauritius into a regional hub.

26.     The second policy is to shift to higher-value-added activities. Traditional sectors
are being supported in their efforts to move up the value chain. For example, a wide array of
financial and technical support is being provided to export-oriented manufacturers to help
them to adopt new technologies. To raise the value added of the sugar cane industry (for
example, by producing refined sugar and biofuels), the government will adopt a range of
supporting measures that were detailed in the ERCP. Also, the government is making it easier
for the financial services sector to extend its operations to the domestic economy so that it can
conduct business both inside and outside Mauritius. This is expected to encourage financial
services companies to incorporate and locate their regional headquarters in Mauritius.

27.     The third policy is to rebalance the economic space between large enterprises and
SMEs. In the most recent budget speech, the government announced a series of measures to
help SMEs to access low-cost financing, industrial space, and markets. The government has
set up a special financing vehicle through the commercial banks that will allow SMEs to get
overdrafts and loans at a discounted rate. A new Equity Fund will provide guaranteed risk
cover for 35 percent of loans. The Development Bank of Mauritius (DBM), which is in charge
of providing financial support to Mauritian enterprises, will be transformed into a bank for
SMEs. As a result, it will not provide loans directly but instead will offer partial risk
guarantees and other instruments to induce commercial banks and other financial institutions
to create a financial market for SMEs.

                                 B. ENHANCING PRODUCTIVITY

28.    Economic growth in Mauritius has been based on high investment rates and
raising the productivity of its labor force. The government’s objective is to increase the
long-run growth potential of Mauritius to around 5 to 6 percent of GDP. Achieving this will
require the dismantling of the constraints to increasing the productive potential of the
economy. Labor markets in Mauritius have performed well, with job creation exceeding labor
                                               11
force growth over the past decade. The labor market has also weathered the impact of the
recent global crises. However, the ability of unskilled workers to adapt to the prospective
changes in the economy (at the low end of the labor market) and the capacity of the education
system and employers to generate and absorb high-skilled workers (at the high end) present
important challenges for Mauritius. The scarcity of technical and professional skills, the
limited relevance of existing on-site training, and the poor performance of research in priority
areas continue to be major impediments to higher growth.

29.       Given the skills mismatch that undermines much of Mauritius’ growth potential,
the government has put an emphasis on human resource development. The government is
developing a 10-year vision that will guide a structural transformation of the tertiary
education system and support the shift of the labor force towards higher-value-added sectors.
The pillars of this vision are: (i) increasing access to tertiary education; (ii) expanding the
supply of tertiary education programs by promoting public-private partnerships (PPPs); and
(iii) attracting more international students to Mauritius to increase the revenues from tertiary
education. In addition, the government plans to expand training opportunities in financial
services and in the information and communications technology (ICT) sector. To support the
implementation of this vision, the government intends to increase the amount of resources
dedicated to tertiary education by almost 50 percent over the next three years, with most of
the increase going to the construction of new universities.

30.    A substantial improvement in the business environment over the years has put
Mauritius among the top 25 economies in the World Bank’s Doing Business survey and
first among African countries between 2008 and 2011. This has helped to substantially
increase FDI from Rs 2.8 billion in 2005/06 to Rs 10.5 billion in 2010. In parallel, the
government introduced a series of measures to reduce trading costs further. Custom tariffs
were considerably reduced and eliminated, and several parallel initiatives have been set up to
review inappropriate regulations that hamper trade and competitiveness. The government has
now created a joint public-private business facilitation task force to review existing systems
and processes and simplify regulations with the objective of removing any bottlenecks faced
by businesses and investors.

31.     Fast economic growth in Mauritius has caused the demand for public
infrastructure to increase, but this demand has not been matched by adequate public
investment over time. The government has initiated a large-scale infrastructure investment
program over the next decade to alleviate road congestion and increase capacity in the port,
airport, and power sectors, to modernize local government infrastructure, and to enhance
regulatory capacity. The fact that delays often occur in the implementation of planned public
investment projects can be seen in the low levels of actual expenditure of the capital budget.
This highlights not only that financial resources are inadequate but also that there is
inadequate institutional and human capacity to implement these infrastructure projects in the
short term. Furthermore, since a significant amount of the public infrastructure will be
implemented on a public-private Partnership (PPP) basis, the government plans to adapt the
legal framework governing PPP.

32.    The government aims to improve the performance of the public sector,
particularly the civil service and parastatals. Mauritius has made progress in increasing the
performance of the public sector by better aligning spending with national priorities by
                                              12
adopting a medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) and program-based budgeting
(PBB). The government has benefitted from a strong and disciplined senior management
within the civil service, but limited capacity and rigidities within the civil service are now
emerging as a binding constraint. The government’s goal now is to have a more productive
civil service that acts quickly, efficiently, and effectively on the issues that citizens raise to
serve both internal and external clients and to improve working conditions within the public
administration sector. A civil service college will begin operating in 2012 to support this
process.

33.     The government has embarked on a program to increase efficiency within the
country’s large number of parastatals, which together receive around 3 percent of GDP in
transfers from the public budget annually. Parastatals include public utilities, infrastructure
and transport companies, and agricultural, industrial, financial, and trading companies. There
are concerns about the quality of services delivered by many of these public enterprises
(particularly public utilities and other infrastructure providers), which is negatively affecting
competitiveness. The government plans to improve service delivery and to reduce the burden
that these bodies put on public finances by rationalizing and streamlining the sector and
enhancing the monitoring of their performance. The Office of Public Sector Governance
(OPSG) has been set up under the Prime Minister’s Office to champion parastatal reform by
assisting public enterprises to increase their efficiency and improve their governance and
services.

                               C. CONSOLIDATING SOCIAL JUSTICE

34.    The government plans to pay more attention to social integration and poverty
reduction. This will involve not only increasing financing but also making existing
interventions more effective and efficient. This will also extend to increasing equity in the
education system, given the importance that education outcomes have on students’ future
earning potential, as a way to promote social mobility in Mauritius.

35.     Programs implemented by the National Empowerment Foundation (NEF) will be
streamlined and strengthened. Interventions within the NEF are currently fragmented and
poorly implemented. As the NEF is one of the government’s flagship poverty reduction
programs with a substantial budget allocation, the government has decided to restructure it
along functional lines with harmonized programming that supports: (i) child and family
development; (ii) community empowerment; (iii) training and placement; and (iv)
entrepreneurship. The government has launched the Social Register of Mauritius (SRM) as a
new integrated database that will house information on all recipients of NEF programming as
well as of Social Aid, the government’s primary social assistance program. This will enhance
coordination between the safety net and empowerment programs, with the long-term aim of
expanding the SRM to other programs and enabling the government to improve its poverty
monitoring.

36.    A major new social housing program has been launched with the objective of
improving the living standards of 40,000 poor households. Five schemes are being
introduced, with the scheme for the poorest households being administered by the NEF.
Under this scheme, eligible households will get access to housing on subsidized terms in
return for the household signing a social contract that covers their civic responsibilities,
                                               13
employability, the education of their children, and family values. The other available schemes
provide support on a sliding scale to better-off households, which include concessional access
to land, finance, and related services.

37.     The government continues to scale up active labor market programs to support
the unemployed and low-income workers (particularly women and young people) by
training, re-skilling, and encouraging them to become entrepreneurs. The government has
introduced a Sponsored Pre-job Training Initiative, whereby employer contributions to the
Human Resource Development Council (HRDC) will be available not only to train existing
employees but also to prepare youth more effectively for the job market. The government also
announced in the recent budget that it will pay the contributions of low-income workers to the
National Pension Fund and to the Transitional Unemployment Benefit to ensure that they are
eligible for both pension and unemployment protection.

38.     Finally, the government continues to reform its education system to improve the
education outcomes of the poorest. With regard to early childhood care and education,
where access is already high, the government has extended pre-primary education grants to
cover 3 year olds as well as 4 year olds. Through the NEF, it is implementing a grant to help
the poorest families to access crèches, which will cover 2,000 children. These measures will
further the government’s policy of empowering women to join the workforce. The
government is also embarking on a major reform to its pre-vocational education system. The
pre-vocational system is ineffective at providing young people who fail the Certificate of
Primary Education (CPE) with core basic skills. Retention remains a challenge, with about 20
percent of pupils dropping out before the third year and another 25 percent of those who
complete failing to transition to the Foundation year. The pre-vocational reform is intended to
be a complete overhaul of the system, changing the current program from three to four years
to increase retention and align it with the broader education system. This will allow young
people either to return to the formal secondary school system or to transition effectively into
further vocational training.

            D. ACHIEVING FISCAL CONSOLIDATION AND MACROECONOMIC RESILIENCE

39.     Persistent deficits and rising debt were a looming threat to macroeconomic
stability before the country decided to take significant moves towards fiscal
consolidation in the mid-2000s. Adherence to strict spending rules was established in 2005,9
but the counter-cyclical fiscal policies launched since 2008/09 have undermined this effort
towards fiscal consolidation. Two main institutional reforms are behind this process. The first
of these was the introduction in 2008 of performance-based budgeting (PBB), which
combined with a medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) has emphasized public sector
service delivery while maintaining fiscal discipline. The second was the introduction of a
Public Debt Management Act in 2008 that was revised10 in 2010 to ensure a sustainable fiscal


9
   To achieve fiscal consolidation and restore fiscal discipline, the 2006/07 budget adopted three fiscal rules, first,
the golden rule that only allows the government to borrow to finance investment; second, the sustainable
investment rule that requires that the net public debt to GDP ratio is on a downward track; and third, the constant
expenditure rule that requires that total expenditure remains constant after adjusting for inflation.
10
   The revised Act aims to fully reflect the actual liabilities and contingencies of the government while at the
same time giving parastatals more flexibility in making their investment decisions.
                                                         14
path. This Act set a ceiling for total outstanding public sector debt of 60 percent of GDP, with
the objective of reducing it to 50 percent of GDP by 2018.

40.     Even if Mauritius was cushioned relatively well during the recent crisis, the
looming global crisis shows that the economy continues to face a number of risks,
particularly to public revenues. The government is determined to sustain public expenditure
projections and has created a new National Resilience Fund (NRF) that replaces the Business
Growth Fund. The NRF has an initial allocation of 7.3 billion rupees (2.1 percent of GDP).
An amount equivalent to 0.9 percent of GDP has been earmarked in the budget to finance
specific activities to support SMEs and export promotion, while the rest of the NRF allocation
will be held as a contingency fund to be used to sustain public expenditure should the
economic situation deteriorate.

                E. PUBLIC BUDGET CONSULTATIVE PROCESS AND TRANSPARENCY

41.      There are various ways in which stakeholders and civil society are consulted
during the preparation of the annual public budget, which is the main instrument for
introducing economic reforms in Mauritius. Each year, the Joint Economic Council (JEC), the
largest private sector coordinating body in Mauritius, discusses private sector business
priorities with MoFED as part of the preparation of the public budget. MoFED also discusses
sector issues and proposals with industry associations. In addition, the labor unions also
discuss their priorities with MoFED. More recently, MoFED has solicited proposals from
civil society and posts some documents on the web to solicit feedback prior to the budget
being submitted to the Cabinet. The World Bank has undertaken extensive consultations with
all relevant line ministries as well as other key stakeholders. For example, it discussed the
reforms related to trade and business competitiveness with the private sector and the civil
service reform with a panel of supervising officers from a large number of line ministries.

42.     A PEFA report concluded in 2010 confirms the high transparency standards of
the Mauritian public budget. The report found that public access to key fiscal information is
adequate, with budget documents being made freely available to the public in a timely
fashion.11 Also, audited year-end financial statements are made public well within the six
month period after the completion of the audit, and contract awards are also published on the
websites of the relevant executing agencies. The report gives the classification and
comprehensiveness of the information included in the budget documentation the highest
possible ranking in the PEFA report, with the Government Finance Statistics 2001
classification system adopted in 2008. However, the reporting of extra-budgetary
expenditures needs to be improved, and to this end the government is consolidating the
various off-budget funds into one single consolidated fund.




11
  All budget documents are placed on the website immediately upon the submission of the budget to Parliament,
and published documents are also made available.
                                                     15
 IV.     THE BANK’S SUPPORT FOR THE GOVERNMENT’S REFORM PROGRAM

                        A. LINK TO THE COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY

43.     The proposed DPL series and the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) (2007-13)
are closely linked to each other and to the government’s reform program. The CPS
Progress Report was presented to the World Bank Executive Board in April 2010, which
extended the CPS to FY15 to align it with the electoral cycle in Mauritius. The CPS Progress
Report emphasized that the proposed DPL series will be the Bank’s main vehicle for
supporting the government’s broad reform program. The DPL series is also well aligned with
the Bank’s Africa Region Strategy, with each of the pillars of the DPL corresponding to the
two pillars and the foundation of that strategy.

                     B. COLLABORATION WITH THE IMF AND OTHER DONORS

44.     The government aims to coordinate development partner assistance around the
DPL policy dialogue. The previous DPL series benefitted from close collaboration between
all of the development partners operating in Mauritius, including the harmonization of prior
actions and indicators in line with the government’s priorities. The government is aiming to
reach a similar level of coordination with this new DPL series. The Bank has held regular
meetings with development partners to identify areas of mutual collaboration and to develop a
platform for unifying their policy recommendations. This collaboration will continue during
the implementation of the new DPL series.

45.     International Monetary Fund: Mauritius has no formal program with the IMF,
though relations are close because of intense collaboration on series of technical issues,
including sources of growth, labor markets, inflation, exchange rates, and monetary and fiscal
policy. More recently, the Fiscal Affairs Department of the IMF provided key support in the
area of fiscal efficiency and budget reform, with a focus on performance-based budgeting and
the MTEF. The IMF’s annual Article IV reports have given cautious but positive appraisals of
the government’s reform program and its macroeconomic management. In April 2011,
Mauritius signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the IMF that established the Africa
Regional Technical Assistance Center South (AFRITAC South), which will provide technical
assistance to countries in Southern Africa in areas such as macroeconomic policy, macro-
fiscal policy, and public financial management (PFM). The recently completed Public
Expenditure and Financial Accountability Assessment (PEFA) for Mauritius was conducted
jointly by the IMF, the World Bank, and the EU.

46.    European Union: During the period 2006-2013, the EU is supporting environmental
measures especially those related to wastewater, education, and poverty reduction for the
most vulnerable and marginalized groups. It is also supporting the restructuring of the sugar
industry into a sugar cane cluster in the context of the phasing out of sugar price guarantees
awarded under the former ACP Sugar Protocol.12 Since 2007, the EU has also been
supporting the economic reform program of Mauritius through general budget support.13 The

12
   Two sector budget supports have been completed, namely a Wastewater sector program worth €38 million and
a program for the sugar sector funded to the tune of €11 million.
13
   So far, three general budget support programs have been agreed upon: (i) Improved Competitiveness for
Equitable Development I and II (2007-2009) consisting of €119 million; (ii) Promoting Sustainable and
                                                    16
World Bank and the EU collaborated closely on a joint diagnostic and results matrix for the
World Bank’s CPS and the European Union’s 10th EDF Country Strategy Paper. Also, the
Bank uses EU performance indicators of budget support operations to reinforce DPL triggers
wherever possible. A new general budget support program worth €84 million is currently
under preparation spanning 2012 and 2013 (with disbursements expected in 2013 and 2014),
and the coordination between the EU and the Bank on their budget support operations, already
initiated in this DPL (in the areas of education and SOE reform specifically), will be further
enhanced as both operations move forwards.

47.     African Development Bank: The African Development Bank (AfDB)’s lending to
Mauritius has comprised: (i) budget support with disbursements on the order of US$193
million between 2007 and 2011 and (ii) investment projects in transport, finance, and water,
with disbursements on the order of US$89 million between 2001 and 2010. The main AfDB
program in Mauritius is the ongoing US$700 million budget support operation (of which
US$163 million has already been disbursed). This was approved in 2009 with the goal of
mitigating the impact of the global downturn on economic growth and employment. Its
focuses on trade competiveness, health, ICT, and public financial management, and its policy
content were aligned with the World Bank’s previous DPL. The AfDB has also provided
around US$3.5 million in a middle-income country technical assistance grant between 2005
and 2011 in a number of areas including ICT, PBB, and public debt management. The AfDB
and the World Bank have also closely collaborated in the production of economic and sector
work (ESW), including the Africa Competitiveness Report, the Investment Climate
Assessment (ICA), and the Country Economic Memorandum update.

48.     United Nations Development Program (UNDP): Key areas of the US$15 million
UNDP Country Program (2009-2011) are: (i) the formulation of strategic plans at the
ministry/department level, PBB and a performance management system (PMS), and the SRM;
(ii) the development of a System of National Accounts including the Social Accounting
Matrix, the Environment Economic Account, and the Tourism Satellite Account; (iii) the
promotion of social inclusion through the National Empowerment Foundation with special
attention given to the island of Rodrigues and an educational program targeting vulnerable
children and those living with HIV/AIDS; and (iv) an emphasis on environment protection,
energy and the management of natural resources, human rights, and governance.

49.     Agence Française de Developpement (AFD): The AFD’s focus is on public-private
partnerships (PPP) as well as on financing infrastructure (in the roads, water, and wastewater
sectors) to foster foreign investment. The AFD disbursed €24 million per year between 2007
and 2009 in alignment with the DPL series calendar. The AFD’s next budget support
operation will be sectoral in the form of an Environment Aid Program. The evaluation of this
program will be based on an environmental roadmap to be readjusted every year according to
what progress has been made.




Equitable Development (2009-2011) consisting of €101million (with funds to be added by end of 2011 to the
tune of an additional €65 million); and (iii) Global Climate Change for Mauritius (2010-2011) consisting of €3
million. Disbursements are expected to range from €47 to €65 million each year (2010-2012).
                                                     17
                   C. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER WORLD BANK OPERATIONS

50.     The DPL series will complement other Bank operations that support the private
sector and infrastructure development. In January 2009, the World Bank Executive Board
approved the Mauritius Economic Transition (Technical Assistance) Project (METAP),
an US$18 million project aimed at strengthening the investment climate and supporting public
enterprise reform through three components relating to business facilitation, public enterprise
reform, and utility regulation and public and private partnerships. In January 2010, a US$20
million Manufacturing and Services Development and Competitiveness Project (MSDC)
was also approved to support enterprise growth, competitiveness, and employment creation in
the manufacturing and services sectors. Recent reconfiguration of the portfolio in line with the
changing demands of a middle-income client has led to the cancellation of these two projects
at the request of the government. However, the government requested the Bank to continue its
support to these sectors with a new DPL series, the Private Sector Competitiveness DPL,
which continues the reform agenda previously being supported through these two investment
operations. The reforms supported through the proposed DPL series are complementary to the
reforms being supported under this Public Sector Performance DPL series. The two
operations have been prepared in coordination to ensure the coherence of the entire reform
program and to keep transaction costs low for both the government and the Bank.

51.     The US$50 million Mauritius Infrastructure Project was approved by the Bank’s
Executive Board in September 2009. The project’s objective is to help to improve the
country’s national infrastructure, with a particular emphasis on the transport, energy, and
water sectors. The project has two components: (i) road investments and (ii) technical
assistance and institutional development in the transport, waste water, and energy subsectors.
The technical assistance component is strategically important for Mauritius given the critical
infrastructure bottlenecks and low disbursement ratios of public investment in the country.
The government now aims to strengthen investment and infrastructure capacity-building and
is seeking further assistance from the Bank in this area.

                                     D. LESSONS LEARNED

52.     The last programmatic DPL series yielded important lessons that have informed
the preparation of this DPL series. These lessons included the need to ensure that: (i) the
DPL is aligned with the government’s priorities and leadership; (ii) there is strong
coordination with development partners; and (iii) the loan is designed to include an
appropriate degree of flexibility to allow the government to respond to emerging crises as
well as for the reform program to evolve over time.

53.    The success of a DPL in Mauritius is measured primarily by its capacity to
stimulate and support the policy agenda rather than its financing. In Mauritius, the
Bank’s budget support is viewed by the government as a catalyst for stimulating and
coordinating the government’s policy agenda. The previous DPL series was effective in
helping MoFED to bring sector ministries and agencies on board and to align other donors
around the reform effort. During the preparation of the new series, the government has
repeatedly emphasized that this is, and will remain, the main value added of World Bank
support, as it remains possible for the government to close its financing gap in both the


                                              18
domestic and external markets. The government’s continued realignment of the Bank
portfolio away from Sector Investment Loans towards DPLs further underscores this.

54.     It is crucial to ensure that Bank operations are aligned with the government’s
priorities and are implemented under the government’s leadership. The government has a
strong sense of direction with regard to its reform program and the technical expertise to
undertake upstream policy dialogue with the Bank and other development partners. The Bank
has contributed to this through its parallel preparation of economic and sector work in priority
areas. The dialogue gradually built consensus for the reforms and helped the participants to
articulate country priorities linked to clear and achievable outcomes. Leadership and political
commitment from the government complemented by strong institutional capacity in designing
and implementing the policy reform agenda have been the critical factors in the success of
previous operations.

55.     Strong coordination with development partners reinforces the government’s
program implementation. The previous DPL series succeeded in large extent due to the
harmonized policy dialogue among all development partners. This often translated into joint
prior actions, missions, and single reporting for all development partners, thus significantly
reducing the government’s transaction costs. The operations in the programmatic series were
aligned with the government’s budget cycle to reinforce national institutions and to use the
annual Budget Speech to sustain the reform process. Furthermore, the timing of the operations
was adapted to match the revised budget calendar. This joint partner approach has weakened
during the 2010 hiatus in Bank DPL support, but the proposed new DPL programmatic series
presents an opportunity to once again align the policy dialogue and the financing of all
development partners with the government’s priorities.

56.     It is critical to build into the loan enough flexibility for the government to be able
to adjust and respond to the country’s changing needs. The previous DPL series included
this flexibility in two important ways. First, the DPL series was able to adapt to immediate
changes in the external environment, particularly the 2008 crisis, through a rapid deferred
draw down option (DDO) as well as through an increase in the value of the loan of the third
operation. This helped to keep the reforms on track and provided the resources needed to
reduce any potential economic risks. Also, one additional operation was added to the series to
align it with the electoral cycle. Second, the previous DPL series took a flexible approach in
building support for and a consensus about the reform program, thus allowing the Bank to be
perceived as an honest broker of diverging views. This allowed the reform program to
develop over-time with the DPL serving to bolster the program as well as support the
development of an overall coherence and vision.

                                E. ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

57.     The preparation of this DPL series has been based on extensive analytical work
carried out by the Bank, the government, and other partners. The 2006 Aid for Trade
Report outlined the challenges that Mauritius faced in the area of trade competitiveness,
based on which the government initiated the reform program supported by the previous DPL
series. This work was complemented by two reports produced in 2009 by the Permit Review
Committee (PRC) of the Government of Mauritius and Jacobs and Associates and DCDM
Mauritius that highlighted crucial constraints to competitiveness, notably related to
                                              19
redundant licensing/permits and the duplication of information requested for trade. As a
result, a “single window? that connects all permit-issuing agencies was established, and a
thorough review of existing procedures for the issue of licenses and permits was launched.
Furthermore, the recommendations stemming from the 2010 Bank report titled Enhancing
and Sustaining Competitiveness in Mauritius: Policy Notes on Trade and Labor nurtured
a productive policy dialogue with the government around the issue of trade policy and labor
markets. Finally, the 2011 UNDP Report on Trade Mainstreaming in Mauritius identified
the successes and challenges associated with mainstreaming trade in national development
strategies.

58.     The second 2009 Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) for Mauritius has identified
a series of obstacles that firms face that hinder their competitiveness. Access to finance for
small firms and a lack of skilled labor are the top constraints. The regulatory environment
(licensing, labor regulations, and tax policy) and infrastructure issues (transportation and
electricity) also appear to limit the productivity of firms. The analysis and recommendations
of the ICA have informed the preparation of this operation, especially the competitiveness
component, which recommended harmonizing regulations and eliminating duplication
(mainly licensing and permits) and red tape.

59.     The government’s 2010 Social Protection Review and Strategy and a 2010 joint
World Bank/UNDP report on the reform of the National Empowerment Foundation
have both guided the preparation of the social protection component of this operation. This
analytical work identified capacity gaps and bottlenecks in program implementation at the
NEF and recommended steps to increase its effectiveness based on international best practice.
The proposed operation has made use of these reports to engage in policy dialogue to
improve, first, institutional arrangements at the NEF and, second, its social protection
strategies.

60.     The 2011 report Skills and Technology Absorption in Mauritius analyzed how best
to: (i) increase the skills of the workforce to enable them to use new and emerging
technologies, including how to strengthen the education system, and (ii) using human
resources efficiently, including increasing their skills by providing on-the-job training. Some
of the recommendations that are relevant for this operation include: (i) addressing weaknesses
in the primary and secondary education system, particularly in the pre-vocational system; (ii)
enhancing the capacity of tertiary education to teach innovative and technological skills; (iii)
increasing the contribution of technical and vocational Education and Training (TVET) to the
knowledge economy, and (iv) strengthening active labor market programs.

61.     The 2011 joint IMF, World Bank, and EU Public Expenditure and Financial
Accountability Assessment (PEFA) shows the progress achieved by the government since
the 2007 PEFA assessment (conducted by EU) in moving forward the public financial
management (PFM) reform agenda. The main achievement has been the strengthening of the
budget formulation and management framework by implementing performance-based
budgeting (PBB) in the past three years. This has resulted in improvements in the PEFA
indicators relating to budget credibility, comprehensiveness, and transparency and to policy-
based budgeting. The government is now focusing on increasing links between PBB and
performance management and on strengthening budget execution, particularly by adopting a
new legislative and institutional framework for procurement and debt management.

                               DEVELOPMENTPOLICY LOAN

                                       A. OPERATION DESCRIPTION

62.     The proposed DPL, in the amount of US$20 million, is the first in a series of two
annual programmatic Bank operations in support of the government’s reform program.
The DPL series is aligned with the budget cycle, which is the primary vehicle used by the
government to introduce new policy initiatives. There will be two DPLs in this series, one in
2012 and one in 2013. The DPL series takes a pragmatic approach to supporting the
government’s policy agenda over a two-year period in which realistic results can be defined
and achieved. The approach is to focus on those reforms that can be completed in the short
term while building the necessary foundations for broader reform over the medium term. The
DPL series is the principal instrument identified in the Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy
for the Bank to support the government’s reform program.

63.     The development objective of the DPL programmatic series is to support
improvements in the performance of the public sector in Mauritius by assisting the
government to implement the following three reform pillars: (i) strengthening services to
support and empower the most vulnerable; (ii) streamlining trade regulation and processes;
and (iii) improving human resource management in the civil service and the monitoring of
SOE performance. Within each of these pillars, the DPL identifies several prior actions that
will be required to create the basic institutions needed to support the reform processes. The
prior actions for the first DPL and triggers for the second DPL are presented in Table 8 and,
along with their associated indicators and expected results, in the policy matrix in Annex 1.
All prior actions are complete.

64.     The proposed DPL is being prepared in coordination with the Private Sector
Competitiveness (PSC) DPL. The two DPL series are designed to be mutually reinforcing
and to address complementary aspects of the government’s reform program. The PSC DPL
series will focus primarily on strengthening the policy and institutional environment for
private sector competitiveness, while this proposed DPL series will focus primarily on the
performance of the public sector. The combination of the reforms supported by these two
DPLs will help the government to increase its competitiveness and resilience and to prepare it
for the next phase of rapid and inclusive economic growth.

                                   proposals for corrective measures as needed.



Box 1: Good Practice Principles on Conditionality

Principle 1: Reinforce ownership. The proposed operation is rooted in the government’s reform program as laid
out in the President’s address of 2010 and subsequent Budget Speeches. The sectors selected for the DPL series
were proposed by the government, and the Bank endorses their relevance in terms of their potential impact on
growth and equity. Furthermore, the government’s commitment to these reforms is demonstrated by the quick
endorsement by the Cabinet of the proposed prior actions for the operation.

Principle 2: Agree up-front with the government and other financial partners on a coordinated accountability
framework. In line with the government’s request and the World Bank’s Africa Strategy, the DPL series seeks to
harmonize the policy dialogue and the financing provided by relevant development partners with the government’s
priorities to the extent possible. Regular meetings between all development partners have taken place during the
preparation of the DPL series to pool resources and knowledge, and Bank missions are open to participation by all
development partners. The government sees the DPL series as an important vehicle for achieving the objective of
harmonizing policy dialogue and financing. The proposed prior actions for DPL1 already reflect this desired
harmonization and have been coordinated with other partners (such as the EU).

Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country circumstances.
The proposed DPL focuses on issues of strategic importance but also on those where the government sees a
particular benefit in World Bank engagement and support, for instance, to build consensus among all stakeholders
or to overcome capacity limitations. The DPL also reflects the government’s particular interest in the Bank’s
knowledge services and incorporates a rich set of analytical work that underpins the Bank’s support for the
government’s reform agenda.

Principle 4: Choose only actions critical to achieving results as conditions for disbursement. The proposed DPL
operation has identified a small number of critical activities needed to support reforms in the three policy areas of
the government’s reform program that are supported by the operation.

Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based financial
support. The programmatic nature of the proposed DPL series will ensure regular and systemic supervision and
preparation of each phase of the DPL series in line with the country’s annual budget, which has traditionally been
the major vehicle for announcing policy reforms in Mauritius.

                                                B. POLICY AREAS

        B.1 Strengthening Services to Support and Empower the Most Vulnerable

65.     Promoting inclusion and social cohesion has traditionally been a key pillar of the
Mauritian development model. Notwithstanding this, there has been a broad perception that
recent economic reforms have not benefitted all Mauritians equally and that the poorest and
the most vulnerable have not been fully reaping the benefits of the resulting economic growth.
Evidence in support of this assessment came from the most recent Gini coefficient, which had
increased from 0.371 in 2001/02 to 0.389 in 2006/07, indicating that income inequality had
increased. The new government has renewed its efforts to ensure that economic growth is
more balanced and equitable. This proposed DPL series supports this objective by focusing
on: (i) restructuring the social protection system to make it better targeted and more cost-
effective and (ii) improving education outcomes, especially for the poorest households.

Social Protection

66.     Poverty is low but persistent in Mauritius. In 2007, the number of poor represented
only 8.5 percent of the total population, equivalent to about 106,000 people.14 Many of them
live in pockets of poverty, which are very small slum communities consisting of 20 to 40
households. There are an estimated 7,150 households living in 229 pockets of poverty in
Mauritius.

67.    The Government of Mauritius invests significant resources in an array of social
assistance programs to support the poor and help to move them out of poverty. These
include multiple cash and in-kind programs, active labor market programs, community
interventions, and social care services (Table 9).

68.     The most important government programs whose direct aim is to reduce poverty
are Social Aid and the various programs under the National Empowerment Foundation
(NEF). Expenditures on each of these programs are about 0.2 percent of GDP annually.15
Social Aid is a means-tested program providing cash and in-kind benefits to specific
categories of eligible households (including those who are chronically sick or caring for
chronically sick dependents, abandoned women and children, single mothers, and dependents
of prisoners). The NEF is a not-for-profit, government-owned company under the aegis of the
Ministry of Social Integration and Economic Empowerment (MoSIEE). It delivers programs
that provide training, entrepreneurial support, job search assistance, and an array of services
targeted to households in the 229 pockets of poverty, including support for needy students,
remedial education, vocational training, community development programs, and housing
programs. It also supervises the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Initiative. The CSR
legislation requires that all profitable firms spend 2 percent of their profits on activities that
contribute to the social and environmental development of Mauritius. The CSR generates
significant additional funding for reducing poverty and social inequality in Mauritius.

69.     The NEF was created when several separate programs were amalgamated,
including the National Empowerment Program (NEP), the Trust Fund for Social Integration
of Vulnerable Groups (TFSIVG), and the Eradication of Absolute Poverty Program (EAP). In
2010, the NEF was transferred from MoFED to the newly established MoSIEE. In 2010, the
NEF assisted approximately 3,500 participants in different labor market programs, 2,500
families with housing and other support, 18,000 students through payment of fees, tutors,
education materials, and other support, and 75 communities with various integrated housing
and infrastructure projects.

70.     The government’s Social Protection Review and Strategy (2010) pointed out that
Mauritius is not realizing the greatest possible benefits from its significant investments
in social assistance. First, Mauritius continues to spend most of its resources on untargeted
subsidies and benefits. The largest of these is the universal pension, but the government also
subsidizes the price of rice, flour, and cooking gas.16 Except for the rice subsidy, the
distributional incidence of these subsidies is regressive. Second, social assistance
programming is very fragmented, which results in considerable administrative inefficiencies.
This is particularly true in the case of programs that aim to empower the poorest as well as
those that provide cash transfers. Third, in those programs that are targeted, coverage of the
poorest is quite low. For example, the Social Aid program served 45,000 clients in 2008. This
should be equivalent to 40 percent of the estimated number of poor households in the country,
but the Household Budget Survey reported that in practice the program covered fewer than 5
percent of the poor. Only 28 percent of Social Aid payments go to the poor, while 36 percent
of benefits go to those in the wealthiest two quintiles. Finally, monitoring and evaluation of

   The government’s pension system overall is deemed to be sustainable in the medium term, based on previous
actuarial analysis. The government initiated a process of increasing the retirement age from 60 to 65 to be phased
in over a 10-year period beginning in July 2008 to further ensure this. Notwithstanding this, the government
continues to make regular assessments of the viability of its pension system and is interested in undertaking
further analytical work in this area in the future.

activities is weak, which means that the government is unable to assess the effectiveness of
programs or take corrective measures.

71.     The government’s medium-term objective is to transform its social safety net into
a more effective and efficient system that provides a coherent set of services to empower
the poor and vulnerable and to help them to rise out of poverty. Given the political costs
that might be involved in reforming untargeted subsidies and benefits, the government is
focusing first on reforming its targeted programs. In the short term, restructuring the NEF has
been given top priority. As a basis for improving the monitoring of both Social Aid and NEF
programming as well as improving coordination and increasing impact, the government is
introducing the Social Registry of Mauritius (SRM). The SRM is an integrated management
information system that provides comprehensive information on existing and potential clients
of programs while increasing coordination among the many different programs. The
government intends to use the information captured in the SRM as a basis for making changes
to the targeting of the Social Aid program.

(i)    Restructuring of the National Empowerment Foundation

72.      After bringing uncoordinated programs under the umbrella of the NEF, they still
needed to be restructured as a critical first step towards improving their performance.
Even though various programs had been brought under the umbrella of the NEF, they
continued to operate autonomously and with considerable duplication and overlap, while the
NEF itself lacked sufficient planning, administrative, and implementation capacity. As a
result, the NEF was unable to achieve its monitoring targets and in 2011 was able to disburse
less than half of its budget allocation. To respond to these challenges, the NEF Board of
Directors has now reorganized the NEF into four functional pillars within one coordinated
structure: (i) child and family development; (ii) community empowerment; (iii) placement and
training; and (iv) entrepreneurship. The NEF staff is currently being reallocated in accordance
with this new structure. This restructuring will make the NEF, a key social protection
program, more effective and efficient.

73.     The restructuring has already improved the NEF programs in a number of
important ways. For example, several key programs have been refocused to support the poor
more effectively. For example, the Training and Placement program now has specific targets
for supporting those with less than a secondary school certificate, which is one of results
indicators for this operation. Second, previously overlapping activities have been consolidated
under the new pillars. For example, the provision of different types of education allowances to
targeted households is now consolidated under the child and family development pillar. Third,
some of the activities implemented by the NEF have been transferred to other agencies. For
example, support to the pig-rearing sector that has now moved to the Ministry of Agriculture.
Finally, some activities are being discontinued, for example, support to high-end jewelry
production. The NEF re-organization also introduced the concept of case management, thus
giving poor households a primary point of contact and helping to ensure the provision of a
coordinated set of services that meets their needs. Now that the NEF is streamlined and has a
more logical operational structure, the next priority for NEF management should be the
development of a strategic plan for each of the new operational pillars that clearly identifies
how each of the NEF’s activities contributes to meeting its organizational goals.


                                              26
74.    Developing rigorous monitoring of NEF interventions will be critical for
determining whether its programs are cost-effective. The NEF does not currently have the
capacity or systems in place to gather the necessary evidence on the performance of programs
to inform policymaking. It particularly lacks a systematic and rigorous monitoring and
evaluation (M&E) system. Such systems should be based on clear performance objectives to
measure programs’ achievements and their impact on poverty. While an M & E unit has been
included in the new NEF structure, there is still no overarching framework for M&E. The
MSIEE has determined that, once the basic program components have been restructured,
developing such a framework will become a priority.

Proposed Prior Action for DPL 1: The issuance of a new organizational and staffing chart for
NEF which shall have been approved by MoSIEE, reflecting the new institutional structure of
NEF, and with separate departments for a) child and family development, b) community
empowerment, c) placement and training, and d) monitoring and evaluation.

Proposed Trigger for DPL 2: The NEF Board will approve a strategic plan for each
operational pillar as well as a monitoring and evaluation framework.

(ii)   Introduction of the Social Registry of Mauritius (SRM) and reforms to Social Aid to
       improve targeting.

75.     In order to improve the integrated monitoring of Social Aid and NEF
programming, the government has introduced the SRM. The objectives of the SRM are to
collect more comprehensive information about Social Aid and NEF clients than is currently
the case. This will yield a fuller profile of the clients of both the Ministry of Social Security
(MoSS) and the NEF, which will be particularly important for the NEF as it rolls out its
enhanced case management system. The SRM will also allow the NEF to track its clients over
time and evaluate their progress towards empowerment. Additionally, the government has
introduced the empowerment of Social Aid clients as one of its objectives, with the aim of
gradually providing some 6,000 Social Aid recipients with active labor market services
provided by the NEF. Therefore, it is important that these two programs should be highly
coordinated, and having an integrated management information system will support this
objective. Ultimately, the SRM will be expanded to cover other targeted programs in
Mauritius, resulting in a nationwide dynamic database that will be a key policy design and
planning tool as well as enabling more effective poverty monitoring. Such “single registry?
approaches have helped many countries to improve monitoring and integrate service delivery
within their social protection systems.

76.    The government has been evaluating options for improving the targeting of
Social Aid, recognizing that much of the categorical approach used so far is out-dated
and does not serve the poor effectively. The introduction of full means testing, possibly
using a proxy means test, has been extensively discussed following the government’s 2010
Social Protection Review and Strategy. However, this has not yet happened because of
concerns about the political implications of taking benefits away from better-off recipients
and the fiscal implications of expanding the program to a large additional cohort of the poor
who are currently excluded. The cost of expanding the program to reach the poor would far


                                               27
outstrip any potential savings achieved from reducing errors of inclusion.17 While the MoSS
continues to explore ways to target Social Aid more effectively, it plans to use the SRM as a
tool for analyzing further reform options, with proposals to be introduced in the 2013 Public
Budget.

Proposed Prior Action for DPL 1: Cabinet approval of a memorandum giving details of a
proposal and action plan for the establishment of SRM.

Proposed Trigger for DPL 2: The government will approve a proposal to improve coverage
of Social Aid to the poorest.

Education

77.      Education opportunities have significantly expanded over the last decades, but
Mauritius lags behind other middle-income countries in most education indicators and
outcomes. Although the goal of universal primary education in terms of access and gender
parity in enrollment has been achieved, the major challenge in the area of primary education
remains the low quality of learning achievement and the large number of students who do not
move up to the secondary education level. Recent increases in public spending on basic
education have had only limited results. Total spending on education as a percentage of GDP
increased from 3.7 percent in 2005/06 to 4.0 percent in 2010, but pass rates and retention rates
at all levels did not change significantly during this period. Mauritius now allocates a similar
share of its GDP to education as Singapore, but the countries’ achievements are far from
comparable. For example, while in Singapore 98.2 percent of a cohort passed the Primary
School Leaving Examination in 2009, only 68.1 percent of primary school pupils passed the
Certificate of Primary Education (CPE) in Mauritius. Similarly, while 92 percent of a cohort
made the transition to post-secondary education in Singapore, the gross tertiary enrollment
rate (GTER) was just 45 percent in Mauritius.18

78.     The failure rate at the Certificate of Primary Education (CPE) level has been
consistently high, and learning outcomes at the end of primary education are unequally
distributed. About 31 percent of children of primary school age failed the CPE in 2010, with
the percentage of unsuccessful boys far exceeding that of girls (37 percent compared with 26
percent).19 This high average rate of failure reflects the unequal distribution of education
outcomes, which is most evident in the low CPE pass rates in the 28 ZEP (Zone d’Education
Prioritaire) schools, which are often located in the poorest areas. Only 36.2 percent of ZEP
school students passed the CPE in 2010 compared with a national average of 68.5 percent.
Two factors are behind this disparity in results. First, students coming from poor families live
in a considerably more challenging social environment than those from better-off families.
Second, competitiveness within the educational system is driving parents to rely heavily on

17
   The Bank estimates that the cost of reforming the targeting of Social Aid to focus on the poorest would cost
Rs 530 million in the first year of reform, falling to Rs 197 million annually as better-off households are moved
off the program over time.
18
   No data are available on the cohort transition rate to post-secondary education in Mauritius so the gross
tertiary enrollment rate (GTER) was used as a proxy. However, the GTER overestimates the transition rate to
post-secondary education for a cohort as it includes over-aged students and those in continuing education, the
numbers of both of which are likely to be substantial.
19
   According to the Ministry of Education and Human Resources.
                                                       28
private tuition to expand their children’s education opportunities. In 2008, more than 85
percent of parents had paid for private tuition, often provided by public sector teachers.
Private tuition has become a substantial cost for families, and although no systematic data are
available, it is likely that the poorest families have the greatest difficulty in affording it. The
government has taken some measures to alleviate the financial burden on the poorest
households, including providing subsidies for transportation, textbooks, meals, and
examination fees. More remarkably, in 2010 it launched an Enhancement Program that aims
to replace private tutoring with supplementary classes for fourth grade students. However,
these measures have had little effect so far on the CPE pass rate in ZEP schools, which has
remained stable since 2006.

79.     Learning opportunities for those who fail the CPE are limited to a pre-vocational
stream, which has not been able to meet the learning needs of most attendees. Passing the
CPE is a prerequisite for entering general secondary education, and pupils who fail the CPE
twice must drop out of the general education stream and attend pre-vocational classes. About
7,200 pupils, about one-third of the cohort, attended pre-vocational education in 2011, down
from 9,500 in 2007.20 About 70 percent of enrollments were in private secondary schools,
which are subsidized by the state. The poor performance of pre-vocational education is
evidenced by high dropout rates, averaging 24 percent of total enrollments over the past five
years, as well as by the failure of a large number of students in the pre-vocational stream to
move on to technical and vocational education and training (TVET).21 This poor performance
can be attributed to: (i) a lack of teacher training in pedagogical skills, especially with regard
to students with learning difficulties, and (ii) limited access to learning and teaching materials
and the inadequacy of the curricula. These shortcomings have significantly hindered the
acquisition by students of basic core skills such as literacy and numeracy and have
progressively transformed pre-vocational education into a remedial-oriented set of activities.

80.     Redressing unequal education outcomes is essential to break the vicious cycle of
poverty. Based on 2006/07 data, (relative) poverty incidence is more prevalent among
households headed by people with educational attainment below the CPE (two-thirds of the
poorest households are headed by people who did not pass the CPE).22 Children belonging to
these households face significant challenges in accumulating human capital and are likely to
inherit the vulnerability that exists in their households. This is reflected in the significant
share that those without a lower secondary education represent among the unemployed (62
percent of the unemployed, with 22 percent of the unemployed not completing primary
education, see Figure 1).23 As these figures show, the completion of a lower secondary
education is an important predictor of employment outcomes.

81.     The government’s medium-term objective is to ensure access to good quality
secondary education for the most disadvantaged by improving the performance of pre-
vocational education. In response to the challenges raised by low and unequal learning
achievements, the government adopted an Education Sector Strategy (ESS) in 2010 with the
overall objective of developing a culture of achievement and excellence that will yield the
human resources necessary to transform Mauritius into a knowledge-based economy. At the
primary education level, the government recognizes that the dual purpose of the CPE – that of
certifying the completion of primary education and selecting students to enter secondary
school ‒ coupled with unequal distribution of learning outcomes is a key constraint to
accessing economic opportunities and thus also to reducing poverty and stimulating growth. It
therefore aims to gradually reform primary education and eventually to limit the purpose of
the CPE examination to providing certification to primary education graduates. In the
meantime, the government has decided to revise the structure and content of the pre-
vocational stream to ensure that it does a better job of meeting the learning needs of pupils
who fail the CPE.

82.     A comprehensive reform of the pre-vocational stream is expected to facilitate the
transition of students from school to work and to expand the access of pre-vocational
graduates to TVET. The main aspects of the reform aim to: (i) increase retention rates by
extending the pre-vocational cycle to a fourth year by integrating the Foundation year 24 into
the pre-vocational curricula; (ii) anchoring the pre-vocational stream in the National
Qualification Framework by creating a Pre-vocational Certificate recognized by the Mauritius
Qualification Authority; (iii) improving teaching methods by strengthening teacher training
and promoting activity-based learning; and (iv) minimizing dropouts by setting up a tracking
and monitoring mechanism that will facilitate early identification of students at risk and
providing them with additional support to prevent them from dropping out. By increasing
retention and enhancing the quality of pre-vocational education, the government expects
future graduates of pre-vocational education to be better equipped with basic skills to enter
the labor market or continue with further education in the TVET stream.




24
  Currently, after completing the three years of pre-vocational education, students follow the one-year National
Trade Certificate Foundation Course delivered by the Mauritius Institute of Training and Development (MITD),
which, once completed, gives them access to vocational apprenticeships and trade certificates.

                          B.2 Streamlining Trade Regulation and Processes

83.    Trade liberalization has been a key component in increasing the country’s
competitiveness. With the support of the last DPL programmatic series, the government
reduced tariffs and established a joint Public-Private Sector Standing Committee to review
regulatory measures related to import and export licenses with a view to eliminating
unwarranted barriers to trade. As a result, duties on 87 percent of tariff lines have been
eliminated, the highest tariff rate was reduced from 60 percent to 30 percent in 2008/09, the
number of bands was reduced from seven to three, and the average Most Favored Nation
(MFN) applied tariff is now 3.8 percent.

84.     The government’s objective is to continue Mauritius’ transformation into an
open, low tax, business-friendly economy by further reforming the regulatory
framework and removing administrative bottlenecks. Tariff reduction has made the
remaining inappropriate regulations that are hindering trade more evident. Multiple agencies
issue permits and clearances, and there is little coordination among them. While regulatory
measures fulfil important social roles and policy objectives, if not properly designed, they can
also increase the cost of transactions and production. The situation is particularly burdensome
in the case of imports. As of January 2009, approximately 30 percent of import declarations
had two requirements involving different line ministries and agencies and, in approximately 5
percent of cases, three or four import requirements. It takes around 12 days to deal with
import and export permits in Mauritius, while Hong Kong (SAR, China), Singapore, and
Estonia require only half as many days. Hidden import barriers, among other constraints, are
keeping the economic globalization index in Mauritius below that of its competitors.25

85.     In Mauritius as elsewhere, regulations are spreading under the pressure of
society’s demands to regulate markets and to protect humans, animals, and plants from
various health and environmental hazards. These regulatory measures fulfill an important
social role and policy objectives. However, if not properly designed, they can also raise the
cost of transactions (in particular cross-border ones) and of production by making imported
products more expensive or by generating paperwork and absorbing managerial attention. A
World Bank report on trade and labor completed in 2010 identified the following main
weaknesses in the regulatory environment: (i) the lack of a systematic approach to assessing
the costs and benefits of regulations; (ii) the duplication of requirements and a lack of
coordination across many ministries and agencies; (iii) an excessive reliance on ex-ante
inspections rather than random and targeted ex-post controls; and (iv) the lack of procedures

25
     As measured by the Konjunkturforschungsstelle (KOF) index of globalization.

for businesses to appeal against regulatory rulings. The government has announced its
willingness to address these weaknesses by adopting the following measures: (i) streamlining
existing regulations and systematically ensuring that the design of new regulations is
conducive to business; (ii) promoting administrative efficiency in trade processes by using IT;
and (iii) enhancing the effectiveness of the administrative appeals and penalties of the
Mauritius Customs.

(i)      Streamlining existing regulations and systematically ensuring that the design of new
         regulations is conducive to business.

86.     There has been little progress in systematically reviewing existing regulations
that are not business-friendly. The government is aware that these existing regulations
hamper economic diversification and, therefore, it aims to streamline business regulations and
remove unnecessary bottlenecks that are hindering business and investment. To deal with
existing regulatory barriers, it has set up a number of initiatives, including the Non-tariff
Barriers (NTB) Review Committee at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Committee at the
Mauritius Standards Bureau, the Permit Review Committee (PRC) at the Ministry of
Business, and the Doing Business Initiative led by the Board of Investment (BOI). However,
all of these efforts have been uncoordinated and often duplicative and have so far not
translated into any significant results. Furthermore, there is no mechanism for systematically
screening new regulations for their impact on trade and competitiveness.

87.     To increase transparency and to make the regulatory environment more
business-friendly, it is imperative to coordinate ongoing initiatives as well as to
accelerate the review of existing business regulations. To this end, the government has
established a joint public-private business facilitation task force to strengthen the review
process for business regulations and other business-related procedures. This coordinating
body will coordinate the current initiatives that are reviewing business licenses and permits,
non-tariff-barriers, doing business indicators, and related activities. The task force will be
composed of high-level representatives from each ministry, from development partners, from
the Board of Investment (which also acts as the Secretariat), and from the private sector. This
task force will comprise five sub-committees with clear terms of reference to avoid
duplication. These five sub-committees will cover: (i) morcellement permits, environmental
impact assessments, and land conversion permits; (ii) import and export permits and the trade
portal; (iii) tourism; (iv) building and land use permits and e-platform; and (iv) utilities. With
the Bank’s help, the government will build its capacity to conduct periodic analytical reviews
of regulations affecting business with a view to modifying regulations where necessary to
make them more business-friendly.

88.    In the short term, the government will focus on reviewing the flow of regulations
and administrative barriers affecting business and investment. However, as it works to
complete the regulatory “stock reviews? to ensure that existing regulations have been
streamlined, there is a need to implement a system to ensure that the same regulatory defects
do not appear in new regulations, making use of systematic and formal screening processes
for new regulations such as the Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA)26 tool.
26
  The TIA’s methodology relies on a sequence of analytical steps: (i) stating the problem and how regulation is
expected to address it; (ii) stating feasible policy options (approaches and instruments); and (iii) evaluating the
impact of the regulation on trade and competitiveness and balancing it against the regulation’s main objectives.

Proposed Prior Action for DPL 1: Establishment of a joint public-private Business
Facilitation Task Force, giving it a mandate to review existing systems and processes, and
streamline regulations, governing trade and investments, with a view to removing bottlenecks
and creating a business-friendly environment.

Proposed Trigger for DPL 2: The government will establish a technical secretariat to
undertake Regulatory Impact Assessments (RIA).

(ii)   Promoting administrative efficiency in trade processes by using IT

89.     The government has made great strides in improving trade administration by
making use of IT solutions. The Mauritius Network Services Limited (MNS) developed the
automated TradeNet network in 1994 to allow traders, Customs brokers, shipping agents, and
freight forwarders to submit trade documents to the government in a more cost-efficient way.
This has reduced the time needed to process declarations and has eliminating the duplication
of information requested by different agencies. Commercial banks are also linked to this
network, thus enabling businesses to pay their duties and taxes electronically. Since 2001, the
Ministry of Commerce has also been linked to the TradeNet system, which allows traders to
submit documentation to the Ministry of Commerce for online processing. In conjunction
with TradeNET, the MNS also developed an automated Customs declaration processing
system ‒ the Customs Management System (CMS) ‒ to electronically process and approve
documents submitted by traders. MoBECC is linked through the TradeNET system to the
CMS, which makes it possible to accelerate the processing and clearing of documents.
However, other ministries and agencies are not yet connected to this network.

90.    Although sector ministries publish the administrative requirements for business
operations that fall under their jurisdiction on their websites, this has not been done in a
systematic way. Each ministry has a website presenting its information, which is often not
comprehensive, is not delivered in a user-friendly way, and is not legally binding or up to
date. Moreover, the websites of sector ministries only present the trade and business
requirements that are under the purview of that particular ministry and do not mention any
authorizations that may be needed by other ministries. Scattered information and the lack of
coordination among the multiple agencies that issue permits/clearances is a key problem for
importers and increases their business costs.

91.      The government has decided to identify all measures (regulations and
legislation) related to trade and manage them in a single online trade information portal,
which will be fully transparent and accessible to importers and exporters with all
regulations listed by national tariff line. This system will facilitate exchanges of
information on regulatory policy, thus fostering public participation and stakeholder
involvement. The government has completed a full stocktaking of all relevant import
procedures and requirements to import at the tariff line, with a detailed inventory of NTMs at
the tariff line following the new UNCTAD classification of NTMs. The objective now is to
get the NTMs database validated by all relevant ministries so that it can be published online
and made legally binding, thus complementing the tariff data set that the Customs department
uses to process declarations with searchable data on all trade-related laws, regulations,
procedures, fees, penalties, and permits/licenses by Harmonized System Codes.
                                              33
92.     The next step will be the implementation of a “single window.? This will
encompass not only the provision of information but also the full integration of all trade-
related processing systems. In addition to the seamless interoperability between the two
systems offering both information and processing capabilities, the single window should also
provide information on advance rulings on tariff classification, the ability to lodge appeals
against the decisions of border management agencies, notifications of changes to rules or
procedures, how traders can comment on pending regulatory changes, and the reporting of
how the government is performing against service standards.

93.     The design of the information portal and the single window should logically be
coordinated. The government aims to ensure that the trade portal and the single window are
implemented in a careful and coordinated way and that ministries are committed to the
process at an early stage so that the move from manual to online processing is completed
without delay. This implementation strategy will include: (i) an agreed governance model; (ii)
an operating model and modalities; (iii) defined service-level agreements (MoUs) between the
participating entities; (iv) a clear statement of core functionalities; (v) clear implementation
timelines; and (vi) an agreed technology plan.

Proposed Prior Action for DPL 1: Cabinet approval of a memorandum, giving details of
proposed modalities and action plan for the establishment of a comprehensive and up-to-date
Trade Portal.

Proposed Trigger for DPL 2: The government will make the trade portal public and the
Cabinet will approve a Memorandum detailing the proposed functional model for the single
window.

(iii) Enhancing the effectiveness of the Mauritius Customs administrative appeals and
penalties.

94.    The objective of enhancing the administrative appeals and penalties system is to
increase its transparency, predictability, efficiency, and effectiveness. This will reduce the
time and costs involved in settling cases administratively while also increasing compliance.
The current appeals mechanism on Customs matters has three stages: an internal appeal
mechanism (within Customs); an independent administrative mechanism (an Assessment
Review Committee); and judicial proceedings. The Customs Act makes provision for
administrative penalties, and the Customs department makes use of a schedule of Customs
administrative penalties.

95.     The current internal appeal mechanism, also called the “objection procedures,?
is not based on any legal provisions within the Customs Act. The absence of such legal
provisions can give the impression to private operators of a lack of transparency and
predictability and undermines its impartiality. The government is continuing its efforts to
increase transparency and reduce discretion and has decided to formalize the internal appeal
mechanism in line with the revised Kyoto Convention, which promotes trade facilitation.27 To

27
   Revised Kyoto Convention General Annex Standard 10.4 is clear that “National Legislation shall provide for
the right of an initial appeal to the Customs.? Its Guidelines explain that “the appeal may be made to the
                                                     34
this effect, the government has decided that the internal appeal mechanism will be prescribed
in the Customs Act, which will contain specific provisions to ensure the independence of the
officials engaged in the review process. This legislative change will increase transparency and
predictability, thus ensuring the independence and fairness of the process. The government
has also decided that it will improve the institutional set-up of the existing internal appeal
mechanism.

96.     Customs officials appear to have a lot of discretion in how they administer
administrative penalties. The value of administrative penalties is determined by Customs on
a case-by-case basis and ultimately is agreed in each individual case with the operators
involved. Operators would prefer a prescribed schedule of administrative penalties.28 The
government has decided to prescribe the schedule of Customs administrative penalties in law.
This will not only enhance transparency and predictability and reduce the perception of
discretion in Customs but it will also pave the way for “settlement by a ruling?29 as specified
in the revised Kyoto Convention. This will expedite and decentralize the process of making
administrative penalty decisions, thus reducing the cost and time to both Customs and traders.
The prescribed schedule in the form of a supplementary tax will enable Customs to decide the
penalty by unilateral act and allow traders to bring any claims to the Assessment Review
Committee process.

Proposed Prior Action for DPL 1: Development by MoFED of a draft policy paper on the
proposed establishment within its customs department of an appropriate internal appeals
mechanism that complies with the requirements of the Kyoto Convention, giving details of the
proposed legal and institutional framework, and operating guidelines and procedures,
governing such a mechanism.

Proposed trigger for DPL2: The government will adopt a prescribed schedule of
administrative penalties to apply at Customs.

           B.3 Improving Human Resource Management in the Civil Service and
                          the Monitoring of SOE Performance

97.     The public sector plays a pivotal role in the Mauritian economy as it represents
around 25 percent of GDP and 25 percent of all investment. The central government
comprises 25 ministries and some 50 departments and is the biggest single employer in the
country with around 53,000 public servants (representing 10 percent of all employment and
4.1 percent of the total population). In addition to central government functions, there has
been a proliferation of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in recent years including parastatal
bodies and statutory corporations that are spread over almost all economic sub-sectors
including the utilities, commercial, economic, educational, welfare, social, and cultural
sectors. To date, there are some 150 SOEs and parastatals supervised by different line
ministries and departments, employing around 20,000 people or 1.6 percent of the population.

Customs Office responsible for the decision or omission or to a higher authority within the Customs
administration.?
28
   In reality, Customs may only have limited capacity to exercise discretion as the penalties imposed are
determined on the basis of a detailed set of Departmental Instructions and Guidelines. The Guidelines prescribe
the schedule of penalties but are not made available to the general public.

98.     However, despite Mauritius’ relatively high level of development, public sector
efficiency still lags behind other upper-middle-income countries. Many services continue
to be costly and of poor quality, in many instances because the public sector is not efficient in
delivering services or regulating markets. Across the economy, the poor quality of public
services drives down average productivity. Air fares are expensive because of restrained air
access, which limits tourist arrivals and international businesses. High telecommunications
charges hobble the off-shoring and ICT industries and limit essential internet access for
businesses. Electricity is more expensive than in comparable countries. Water is in short
supply. The government, with an overly bureaucratic civil service, is poorly structured for the
requirements of a post-regulatory state, and inefficient parastatals make losses as a result of
being directed by the government to pursue social objectives.

99.     The proposed DPL will focus on establishing the building blocks to increase
public sector efficiency in the medium term. The proposed DPL series will assist the
government in its efforts to introduce a culture of improved service delivery in the public
sector. Because public sector reforms will require consensus between diverse stakeholders
and may affect the current political equilibrium, this process will have to be gradual over
time. As a result, this proposed DPL series focuses on strengthening the institutions needed to
improve coordination and monitoring and increase transparency in SOEs and on reallocating
public resources to pursue the government’s main goals, particularly in the civil service.


The Civil Service

100. Substantial reforms have been carried out in public finance management in
recent years to better align spending with national priorities and improve the focus on
service delivery. The introduction of performance-based budgeting (PBB) in 2006 as well as
a number of human resource initiatives such as the Performance Management System
(PMS)30 and others31 were the start of a significant transition within the public sector from
managing based on inputs to managing for results.

101. In parallel, incremental progress has been made in improving the quality and
increasing the responsiveness of the civil service over the last two decades, in a distinctly
complex legal and institutional context. Mauritius has adopted a very successful consensus-
based approach in staffing its civil service, consistent with its broader approach of ensuring

30
   The performance management system that assesses civil servants has been reformed to increase individual
accountability. The Annual Confidential Reporting System, which dated back to 1963, failed to establish
adequate links with organizational objectives or provide transparent feedback on the performance of civil
servants. The Ministry of Civil Service and Administrative Reforms (MCSAR) has spearheaded the introduction
of a new performance management system (PMS) in the civil service to ensure that each public officer’s work is
in line with each public organization’s vision and objectives.
31
   Other specific measures that have been implemented are: (i) the adoption of a Code of Ethics for Public
Officers; (ii) the development of Customer/Citizen Charters by ministries/departments whereby they undertake
to provide quality services in line with set standards; (iii) the provision of support to ministries/departments for
adopting and operating according to ISO 9001:2008 standards; (iv) the introduction of the Improvement of
Counter Services Scheme to provide for better reception counters and waiting areas; (v) the modernization and
computerization of activities; and (vi) a focus on training and capacity building at all levels to facilitate the
implementation of reform initiatives.
                                                        36
the representativeness of its democratic institutions. This careful attention to due process is
also reflected in the machinery of public administration. The actual leadership of the civil
service rests with the Head of Civil Service in the Prime Minister's Office, while the Ministry
of Civil Service and Administrative Reforms (MCSAR) is in charge of developing proposals
for new reforms. Authority is further shared between the Head of Civil Service and the Public
Service Commission, set up under the Constitution of Mauritius in 1968, which controls
appointments and promotions and significantly influences civil service regulations by
maintaining a centralized system aiming to ensure fairness in public employment. The Public
Service Commission continues to be regarded as critical for ensuring integrity, equity, and
efficiency in the public service.32 The trade unions are also major stakeholders in this process
and are often consulted about civil service changes. To reinforce coordination among all
stakeholders and accelerate reform, the government created a technical working group to
oversee civil service reform. This working group comprises the Head of the Civil Service and
representatives of MCSAR, and MoFED.

102. However, it is becoming clear that capacity and performance limitations within
the civil service are binding constraints to increasing the efficiency of central
government. Despite the overall high quality of the civil service, rigidities in its management
and challenges in the workforce planning arrangements make it hard to change the
composition or allocation of public sector employment. This translates into a number of
important problems: high turnover rates and difficulty in retaining technical specialists;
lengthy recruitment processes; inadequate multi-year human resource and financial strategic
planning; and misalignment between the goals of agencies and individuals. These constraints
are a binding obstacle to improving service delivery in the public sector, which has to happen
if Mauritius is to achieve a high income country status. Furthermore, these issues come on top
of other critical challenges in the civil service over the medium term, particularly the
challenge of how to offer attractive and rewarding career prospects to future university
graduates at a time when opportunities in the private sector are growing.

103. The government aims to improve the management of the civil service to reinforce
the gains achieved so far in central government management. There is a need to increase
managerial flexibility within the context of the new PBB initiative. The role of the Permanent
Secretary needs to become more managerial and results-focused rather than administrative
and process-driven as at present. This will require a redefinition of the institutional roles of
Permanent Secretaries that should include a clearer separation between ministerial and civil
service functions in terms of accountability for results, an increase in financial management
authority at the ministry level, and an overall change of mindset from the traditional
“establishment? process to a modern, proactive approach driven by the goal of improving
service delivery. This will also require more predictable staffing levels and less turnover,
which in turn will require a better system of medium-term HR planning led by Permanent
Secretaries.




32
   This is in distinct contrast to the situation in many other Commonwealth countries where the role of the
service commission has been under some pressure, primarily because the perceived trade-off between central
oversight of due process and rapid processing of recruitment decisions was seen to be overly weighted towards
centralization.
                                                     37
104. A key immediate constraint is the large number of Scheme of Services that delay
the process of hiring and promoting staff and is hindering the reorganization of the Civil
Service. A Scheme of Service (SoS) is a legal document that specifies the grade, salary, mode
of appointment, qualifications, duties, and responsibilities of an employee in a Ministry or
Department. It is an integral part of the effective selection and/or promotion of the most
suitably qualified personnel within the Civil Service and is key for ensuring due process.
Although MCSAR is responsible for any changes in SoS, the SoS must be approved by the
Public Service Commission before a vacancy is advertised and filled. In contrast to other
Commonwealth countries,33 in Mauritius SoS have not been simplified or consolidated and
are specific to every job and grade. There are currently more than 2,500 of them. The
procedure for modifying them entails a complex series of consultations with various
stakeholders,34 and this generally turns out to be an onerous and time-consuming procedure.35
Also, the proliferation of SoS makes it difficult to transfer staff to different positions quickly
and efficiently in response to rapidly changing priorities. This was made evident after the Pay
Research Bureau Report in 2008 included recommendations that implied that all SoS needed
to be reviewed, triggering a lengthy and cumbersome administrative process that absorbed a
large part of the administration’s resources.36

105. The government has chosen to focus on improving human resource management
in the public sector by consolidating Schemes of Service and improving monitoring
systems. Given the complexity and sensitivity of the reform, the government is gradually
increasing managerial flexibility within the context of the new PBB initiative. There are many
potential obstacles in the reform of the civil service so the cautious path chosen by
government appears to be a reasonable strategy. First, the government aims to improve the
working conditions of the civil service by creating a Civil Service College to build the
capacity of its labor force to achieve the goals of the PBB. Second, it aims to streamline and
consolidate SoS. Finally, it aims to strengthen the promotion, and reward system for civil
servants in order to increase flexibility in staffing, promote excellence and accountability, and
reward performance to increase motivation within the civil service. MCSAR is already
working on these areas and it has issued guidelines to the ministries and departments to help
them to process SoS. MSCAR is also holding consultations concurrently with staff
associations and federations of unions in an attempt to cut the time needed to process changes
in the SoS from 51 days to 30 days, and it has put the development of some new SoS on a fast
track. Government has also undertaken a review of the performance management system
(PMS).

106. Monitoring systems need to be strengthened to improve planning and
management within the civil service. The government needs to increase its technical
capacity to plan for human resource needs over the medium and long term. Part of the current

33
   For instance, while some countries have substantially streamlined the number of Schemes of Services, others
have kept a large number of them but have substantially simplified the procedures to amend them.
34
   Among them the Pay Research Bureau, the ministry or department concerned, staff associations, federations of
unions, and the Public Service Commission.
35
   The consultation process with the unions and federations takes a minimum of 51 days.
36
   The Pay Research Bureau (PRB), which is under the aegis of the Prime Minister’s Office, is responsible for
reviewing the salaries of all civil servants as well as their conditions of service and all organizational structures
every five years. In the PRB report of 2008, all schemes of service where to be amended, so that "Duties" should
reflect the “use of ICT in the performance of duties? and the rewording of the requirement for job holders to
perform “cognate duties.?
                                                        38
constraint stems from the fact that MCSAR lacks an adequate Human Resources Monitoring
Information System (HRMIS), which not only makes it difficult to monitor overall civil
service staffing but also overwhelms those in charge of human resource management within
sector ministries with a heavy workload of manual transactions. To improve planning, it
would be highly beneficial to adopt a new integrated HRMIS linked to existing budget and
treasury systems to free up responsible officers from manual transactions and improve
monitoring of staff. MSCAR has indicated that it intends to implement such a system in 2012.

Proposed Prior Action for DPL 1: Submission to Cabinet, by MSCAR, of an information
paper giving details of plans to streamline Schemes of Service and expedite the process of
review, modification and consolidation of such Schemes of Service, based on adequate
consultations with civil service unions and other stakeholders, and reflecting the outcome of
such consultations.

Proposed Trigger for DPL 2: Pilot implementation in MCSAR of an integrated HRMIS for the
Civil Service.

State-owned Enterprises and Parastatals

107. Although for over two decades the Government of Mauritius has sought to
outsource non-core state functions to the private sector, state-owned enterprises (SOEs)
often operate in areas where they do not address any identified market failure or
provide any public goods. Key sectors dominated by government ownership include utilities,
transportation, port services, and the sugar sector.37 Several listed companies (including Air
Mauritius and the State Bank of Mauritius) are also controlled by the government.38 They
were initially set up to provide basic essential services to the general population at affordable
prices, but many of them are now operating in areas in which they do not have a comparative
advantage over potential private sector competitors. The government has made substantial
efforts to reduce the role of the public sector by introducing attrition programs in the
agricultural sector, using voluntary departure and early retirement schemes, or consolidating
public institutions (for example, closing the Development Works Corporation or centralizing
all revenue departments under the Mauritius Revenue Authority). Although these efforts
continue and the 2012 public budget will disinvest the public sector from some non-strategic
commercial joint ventures, a thorough review of the participation of the sector in many sectors
needs to be undertaken.

108. The economic and financial performance of many of these SOEs is poor, which
has significant implications for the quality of service delivery and infrastructure and for
the degree of competition in the economy. These inefficiencies manifest themselves in
several ways. For instance, some services are more expensive in Mauritius than in its
competitor countries (for example, internet access), there are technical inefficiencies (for
example, 50 percent of water is lost from the system), and coverage of some public services
remains low (for example, only 25 percent of the population are connected to public sewage
networks). One major problem is distortionary tariffs (such as water tariffs), which are often

   State-owned commercial bodies in Mauritius are referred to as state-owned enterprises, parastatal bodies, or
public enterprises. Here, the international standard term state-owned enterprises (SOEs) is used.

   No systematic inventory of state assets or detailed description of how the government currently exercises its
ownership rights over the companies or summary of performance information is available.

adopted to meet social goals rather than to cover long-term costs, raising concerns about the
capacity of the current system to afford the investment and maintenance that Mauritius
requires to ensure the long-term sustainability of its infrastructure.

109. Despite growth of 5 percent in the revenues of the 15 largest SOEs39 between
2005 and 2011, high operating budgets undermine the financial sustainability of these
organizations (see Figure 2). There are many causes of this financial distress, but a major
reason is the confusing role played by the state in the governance and management of SOEs.
There is limited focus on ownership and oversight by the government, and SOEs do not
provide enough information on their performance to enable the government to carry out this
role effectively. While many enterprises regularly produce annual reports, some do not, and
there are no penalties for non-compliance. Moreover, public enterprises generally do not have
any targets or performance indicators agreed between the respective sector ministries and
their boards and do not prepare their budgets following the PBB methodology. All of this
means that the SOES are not held fully accountable for their performance.

110. These inefficiencies are in large part supported directly by government finances
and indirectly in the form of government-guaranteed debt. SOEs and parastatals continue
to require significant grants and transfers from the government budget amounting to Rs 8
billion in December 2010 (3 percent of GDP). Overall, total debt levels of SOEs have
remained stable over the last few years at around Rs 21 billion or 7 percent of GDP in 2010,
with half of this being guaranteed by the government (Table 10).

 111. The government lacks the management tools to adequately monitor SOE
 performance in a comprehensive manner. A Public Enterprise Reform Unit was established
 in MoFED in 2008 to monitor the performance of SOEs, champion reforms in the public
 service, and provide leadership, coordination, and cohesion to the implementation and
 monitoring of reform initiatives. This unit was not able to deliver tangible results as it lacked
 any authority over parastatals. The key lessons learned from this experience were that: (i)
 such a complex and politically charged agenda needs to be closely monitored by an institution
 with the authority to hold all of the various sectors involved accountable, which in this case
 would most appropriately be the Prime Minister’s Office, and (ii) such reforms must be
 underpinned by monitorable action plans that can be used to measure progress against
 milestones and thereby hold sector ministries accountable. These lessons have informed the
 SOE reform strategy now being pursued by the government and supported by this DPL.

 112. The government, supported by this DPL series, now aims to develop an adequate
 institutional and legal framework to support and oversee specific reforms of SOEs. A
 gradual strategy will be followed to ensure adequate participation of all stakeholders, starting
 with: (i) the creation of a lead agency with an adequate mandate within the Prime Minister’s
 Office to champion public sector reforms; (ii) the adoption of an online performance
 monitoring system; and (iii) the preparation and publication of performance reports. This
 framework will hold sector ministries and SOEs accountable, will foster a dialogue among all
 stakeholders, and clearly define the efficiency gains that must be achieved by each SOE.

 113. Recognizing the implications of the fiscal risk that SOEs represent, the
 government established the Office of the Public Sector Governance (OPSG) in August
 2010 to lead, coordinate, and provide cohesion to the implementation and monitoring of
 SOE reform initiatives. Placing the OPSG under the aegis of the Prime Minister’s Office
 gives it the necessary authority and visibility to lead the reform process. The initial goals of
 the OPSG have been to improve the monitoring of selected SOEs and raise awareness of the
 importance of good corporate governance. State bodies and MoFED do not always possess all
 the necessary information on the financial and economic operations of SOEs and parastatals.
 Therefore, the OPSG has developed an online monitoring and tracking system, the Parastatal
 Information Management System (PIMS) to gather relevant, accurate, and up-to-date
                                                      41
information to benchmark their performance and monitor efficiency gains. Nonetheless, there
are indications that the readiness for and the progress of these reforms vary significantly
between sectors and enterprises. This is by no means surprising given the complexity and
difficulty of the reforms being implemented, but it also signals the need to strengthen the
mandate of the OPSG to drive the reform process and hold sector ministries fully accountable.

114. The OPSG will need to be further empowered if it is to fulfill its mission. Until
recently the OPSG lacked the formal authority to monitor SOEs and to identify those that are
underperforming. This means that it had to wait for sector ministries to approach it and makes
the systematic collection of information difficult as SOEs only do this on a voluntary basis.
International experience shows that a formal mandate can empower such an agency and
clarify the “rules of engagement? between the OPSG and MoFED and with line ministries.
Government therefore revised the mandate of OPSG to: (i) monitor the overall performance of
public enterprises; (ii) supervise the implementation of the agreed public enterprise
improvement program, especially when targets are not being met; (iii) support ministries and
parastatals in implementing performance-enhancing reforms that have been approved by the
Cabinet or by the Prime Minister; and (iv) develop the capacity to conduct in-depth
supervision of SOEs, based on monitoring reports.

Proposed Prior Action for DPL 1: Cabinet approval of a memorandum, giving details of the
revised mandate of OPSG to a) monitor the overall performance of SOEs; b) prepare
quarterly reports; c) support line ministries in the preparation and implementation of
performance improvement plans; and d) supervise the pace of SOE reforms as approved by
Cabinet, reporting back to Cabinet with proposals for corrective measures as needed.

Proposed Trigger for DPL 2: Preparation of reform plans for six non-performing SOEs
initiated by the OPSG.

115. Subsequently, the OPSG will need to support the preparation of reform plans for
underperforming SOEs to be endorsed by the Cabinet. To achieve this, the OPSG will
need to put in place the building blocks required to execute its new powers. This will require
classifying the parastatal bodies into commercial and non-commercial categories, clarifying
the objectives of these selected parastatals, and establishing key performance indicators for
each parastatal body, including measures to enhance corporate and technical governance. The
main outcomes of this process will be to give each SOE a clear business objective and the
necessary autonomy to meet this objective. Each SOE should then be held accountable
accordingly for its performance. Additionally, the institutional capacity in the OPSG, the line
ministries, and the SOEs needs to be strengthened as they move into the new mode of
operation and as improved monitoring and supervision requirements are established. Also, the
OPSG aims to carry out additional analytical work to gather evidence to better understand key
parameters and trends in the public sector such as fiscal cost, employment, investment returns,
and corporate governance. The results of these analyses will inform the design of up-coming
reforms in the public sector.

                         VI.     OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

                                A. POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACT

116. Mauritius has a low rate of poverty, whether measured in relative or absolute
terms. Relative poverty was 8.7 percent of population in 2006/07, which was equivalent to
106,000 people. Approximately 1.0 percent of the population or 12,000 people live on less
than US$1 per day. Inequality in Mauritius, as measured by the Gini coefficient, is low
(0.388) compared with other countries in Africa, reflecting the fact that Mauritius is a country
with a well-developed social welfare system that favors equality.

117. The proposed DPL series is expected to reduce poverty in the following three
ways: (i) social protection programs will become more effective at protecting the poor and
helping them to rise out of poverty; (ii) widening access to education will help the most
vulnerable to find higher-skilled, better paying jobs in the labor market; and (iii) streamlining
non-tariff barriers (NTBs) will help to create jobs as NTBs disproportionally affect SMEs
(which are major creators of employment in Mauritius) because they lack the financial means
to mitigate their cost.

118. Social protection programs will be more effective in protecting and supporting
the poor. The programs under the NEF have played a role in mitigating the transitional
impact of previous reforms. The Placement and Training Program was the most significant in
this regard, with over 6,000 workers having found jobs through this program by 2009.
However, in the sectors that benefitted from the program, 80 percent of all of the jobs created
were in the ICT sector. As part of the proposed reforms to the NEF, the government is
reviewing the focus and targeting of the Placement and Training Program to ensure that it is
effectively serving those with relatively less education, that it is a net creator of jobs, and that
it is rigorously evaluated to ensure that it provides value for money. Moreover, the
reengineering of NEF programming, particularly those programs targeted to households in the
229 pockets of poverty, will ensure that much more effective services are provided to those
vulnerable households. The adoption of the SRM will similarly lead to strengthened case
management at the household level and more integration of the services targeted to the poor.

119. This will include improvements resulting from reforms to Social Aid to increase
its focus on the poorest and most vulnerable. The government has modeled the impact of
introducing a reform program that would target resources directly to the poor using a proxy
means test to determine eligibility. The results of the model indicated that benefits currently
given to at least 20,000 people who are well above the poverty line would be redirected to
people who are genuinely poor. However, despite this improvement, given the existing
coverage of Social Aid, 55,000 out of the approximately 106,000 poor people in Mauritius
would still not receive any benefits. The government is now considering how best to reconcile
improved targeting, given the political and social implications of the redistributive impact on
existing Social Aid beneficiaries, with the financing required to expand the program to cover
all of the poor.

120. Reforms to pre-vocational education will largely benefit the poor. The DPL is also
supporting reforms in the education sector. The government plans to significantly upgrade the
pre-vocational technical education stream so that this becomes a meaningful activity that can
                                                43
either help students move forward with their formal education or acquire skills and
qualifications that will help them enter the job market. These reforms also aim to reduce the
dropout rate from pre-vocational education, which is currently high at 24 percent of those who
enroll. The pre-vocational stream currently caters to those who have failed their CPE exams,
and, given that failure rates for CPE are much higher among the poorest (see paragraph 80),
this reform will be important for improving education and labor market outcomes for this
group.

121. Simplifying barriers to trade will further expand opportunities to create jobs.
Trade regulatory and administrative costs are a bigger burden for SMEs than for large
enterprises. Therefore, streamlining NTMs and eliminating NTBs is expected to have a
positive impact on SMEs, which will in turn translate into additional employment. This effect
became evident after the reforms introduced in 2006, which created a more level playing field
between large companies and SMEs, bolstered economic competitiveness, and promoted
diversification that translated into strong job creation in the services sector. As a result, the
unemployment rate between 2005 and 2008 declined, especially for women.

122. The capacity of Statistics Mauritius (SM) to monitor poverty in Mauritius has
been strengthened in recent years. SM has developed a Poverty Map depicting the poverty
rate in each of the 145 administrative regions of the country, which is based on data from the
Household Budget Surveys (HBS) and the 2000 Housing and Population Census (HPC).
Furthermore, SM fields an annual multi-purpose survey that can be used to monitor multiple
dimensions of poverty including access to basic services, labor market participation, and
income poverty. In addition, the SM has launched a new survey, the Survey of Living
Conditions, to better measure absolute poverty. Also, with support from the UNDP, it is
updating measures of absolute poverty lines. While all of these initiatives are important, they
have yet to be directly taken into account in policymaking. The Bank currently has plans to
increase SM’s capacity to analyze poverty and the social impact of proposed policy reforms
and is currently helping to develop a Human Opportunity Index for Mauritius.

123. The SRM will further strengthen the capacity of the government to monitor
poverty. The government also plans to use the SRM to improve poverty monitoring in
programs, starting with Social Aid and programs under the NEF but over time incorporating
additional programs into this integrated database.

                                  B. ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

124. None of the reforms supported by the DPL series will have a direct effect on the
environment, natural resources, or forestry. If supported, the reforms affecting SOEs and
parastatals will be focused on increasing transparency and monitoring the management of
public companies with no direct relationship to investment in these areas. Historically, the
record of environmental management, though not perfect, has been relatively good.40
Furthermore, all development partners recognize the strategic importance of environmental
protection, and the AFD, the UNDP, and the EC are actively providing technical support in
this area.

                    C. IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING, AND EVALUATION

125. The government and the World Bank will meet twice a year to review the
progress of the DPL program and will prepare a joint report. MoFED will be responsible
for coordinating the supervision and monitoring of the reform program supported by the
proposed DPL series. MoFED will liaise with the appropriate staff in the ministries,
departments, and agencies involved. The Bank will carry out periodic monitoring and conduct
a dialogue with relevant line ministries and other stakeholders involved in the implementation
of the reforms through field missions and through staff based at the Bank’s country office.
MoFED, as the primary counterpart agency of the operation, will be responsible for furnishing
information to the Bank as required to monitor outcomes in the policy matrix (Annex 2) and
for preparing an implementation report every six months to be discussed with the World
Bank.

                                    D. FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

Public Financial Management System and Fiduciary Issues

126. Mauritius has a satisfactory financial management system. The country’s fiduciary
framework is adequate to support the proceeds of the credit. This is made evident by the fact
that all government loans and grants received in 2009 were managed using the government
system, except for loans and grants from China and India (10 percent of the total). This is
further confirmed by the conclusions of the 2010 PEFA report, which noted that the
performance of the country’s public finance management system had improved since the 2007
PEFA assessment as a result of reforms implemented by the government to strengthen PFM
systems.

127. The IMF has not undertaken a safeguard assessment on the Bank of Mauritius
(BoM). The independent external auditors issued an unqualified audit report on June, 30,
2011, and the BoM’s audited financial statements are published on the BoM website. No
qualifications from external auditors have been reported in past BoM audited financial
statements.

Funds Flow Arrangements

128. The loan disbursement will follow the World Bank’s procedures for development
policy lending. The loan will be disbursed in a single tranche upon effectiveness. The loan
proceeds from the Bank will be credited to an account that is part of the country’s official
foreign exchange reserves at the BoM. The rupee equivalent of the loan proceeds will be
reflected in the budget to finance budgeted expenditures. The government will provide a letter
to the World Bank within 30 days of receiving the loan proceeds written by the Accountant-
General confirming: (i) that the accounts used to deposit the loan proceeds are part of the
country’s official foreign exchange reserves and (ii) that the rupee equivalent of the loan
proceeds has been reflected in the budget and in the government’s accounts and on the date
reflected. The loan proceeds shall not be used to finance excluded expenditures as defined in
Section 2 of the Appendix in the loan agreement. If any portion of the loan is used to finance


                                             45
ineligible expenditures as so defined, the Bank will require the government to promptly
refund the amount upon notice.

Accounting

129. The accounting of the loan proceeds will be the responsibility of Accountant-
General at the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development. Government procedures
will be followed to administer and account for the loan proceeds and related payment. Since
the control environment is considered to be adequate, no additional fiduciary requirements
shall apply.

                                E. RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION

130. The implementation of the proposed reform program entails a number of risks:
(a) the challenge of maintaining macroeconomic stability as a result of uncertain global
developments; (b) a slowdown in the momentum of reforms, exacerbated by the withdrawal
of one of the parties from the government coalition in July 2011; (c) limited institutional
capacity within sector ministries to lead and implement the reforms; and (d) corruption. The
details of these risks and the proposed mitigation measures are provided below.

131. The first and perhaps most important risk is that macroeconomic stability may
be threatened given the current uncertain global economic climate, particularly in the
European economies to which Mauritius remains highly exposed. Global economic
uncertainties continue to present a significant threat to a small open economy such as
Mauritius, primarily on two fronts – the fiscal position and the current account deficit. Slower
global economic growth would depress domestic growth and tax revenues, yet pressure to
finance government priorities would be likely to continue. The fiscal position remains
stretched with high public debt, which is projected to decline by only a modest amount in the
medium-term baseline scenario. This would make it hard to implement counter-cyclical
policies should some of these external threats materialize. Also, current account deficits,
although high, have been adequately financed, mostly by high FDI and inflows to the
financial sector. However, this could quickly be reversed if international financial markets
deteriorate. Finally, the concentration of the country’s exports on a few markets (Europe) and
products (tourism and textiles) and its large share of imported commodities could further
deteriorate the current account deficit.

132. Having said this, the government has the means and tools to cope with external
economic uncertainties, though a firm commitment will be needed to rein in public
expenditure if a substantial slowdown materializes. On the external front, the current level
of foreign exchange reserves provides a buffer against a potential deterioration in the balance
of payments. Mauritius’ floating exchange rate also facilitates correction of external
imbalances in the medium term. The recent trends of an export reorientation toward new
markets (for example, in Asia and Africa) and new products will also help. On the fiscal front,
if the global economy slows down and the growth in public revenues eases, the fiscal deficit
could deteriorate to levels significantly above the government’s baseline projection of 3.8
percent of GDP. The government is mindful of these risks. A higher deficit (of up to 1.2
percentage points of GDP) could be financed by the recently created National Resilience
Fund. Should revenues dip further, additional adjustment would require either a slowdown in
                                              46
implementation of the proposed infrastructure reforms and/or an acceleration of efficiency
gains in the public sector, which should be manageable but will require a firm commitment
from the government. Furthermore, the relatively large percentage of debt that is maturing
highlights how vulnerable public debt is to the performance of the domestic financial sector,
even though roll-over risks are currently low given the fact that the majority of debt is
domestic and there is current excess liquidity in domestic capital markets.

133. The second risk is a political risk that may affect the pace of the reform program
at a time when the need for reform is most urgent. The pace of reform in Mauritius has
slowed in recent years and the appetite for further aggressive reform appears modest at this
time. This reflects the fact that many of these second generation reforms will have
redistributive effects, sometimes eliminating the rents, subsidies, and privileges of certain
vested interests. The government may find it difficult to overcome these vested interests,
some of which are well-organized and influential. This is particularly true since many of the
reforms may only pay dividends in the medium term while their costs will certainly be evident
in the short term. This complexity is further compounded by the withdrawal of one party from
the government coalition in July 2011, which left the government with only a slim majority in
Parliament. However, when considering the increasing global economic uncertainties and the
structural constraints to economic growth and poverty reduction that are becoming binding,
there is no time for complacency.

134. The approach taken in this DPL aims to mitigate this risk by supporting reforms
that will bring returns in the short term while putting in place the building blocks to
expedite the reform program over the medium term. The electoral cycle – the next
parliamentary election will be in 2015 – provides a window of opportunity to accelerate
reforms during the first years of this current government. This DPL series takes a pragmatic
approach by supporting reforms that have a broad consensus and will bring some immediate
benefits (for example, in trade and social protection), while laying the necessary foundation
required to accelerate other reforms in the future. The DPL series aims to do this by
supporting policy actions that will create: (i) systems (such as the SRM, the HRMIS in the
civil service, and the trade portal) that can provide the government with the tools necessary to
define appropriate reform options and (ii) institutions that can coordinate and consolidate
reform initiatives (such as the restructuring of the National Empowerment Foundation, the
revised mandate of the Office of Public Sector Governance, and the establishment of the
Business Facilitation Task Force,). Furthermore, the government’s emphasis on strengthening
the safety net, primarily by enhancing NEF programs but also potentially Social Aid, will
provide immediate support to the most vulnerable, thus reinforcing the government’s
objective to develop more balanced economic growth and building the momentum for
additional reforms. Finally, better communication will be key to building consensus around
the government’s reform program, using visits to Mauritius by high-level practitioners and
management to raise awareness and understanding of the reforms and their benefits, both
within the Cabinet and more broadly.

135. The third risk is that the sector ministries might not have sufficient institutional
capacity to implement the reforms. Compared to the previous DPL program in which
MoFED played an active role in leading and coordinating the reform, this new set of reforms
will be overseen in many cases by sector ministries. This will involve a broader set of
stakeholders, which means that building and broadening consensus around the reform agenda
                                              47
will be essential. However, the institutional capacity of sector ministries to design and
implement these sector reforms may be limited, particularly in the newly created ministries.

136. The Bank and the government have signed a Services Agreement for
Reimbursable Technical Assistance (RTA) that will help to build institutional capacity.
This RTA will complement the Bank’s program and allow line ministries to enhance their
institutional capacity where needed. Additionally, the DPL itself will be a way to build
bridges between the different ministries involved in the reform program, thereby enhancing
coordination. The Bank’s analytical work program will support these reform areas while
enhancing the institutional capacity of sector ministries. In addition, this analytical work
program has been coordinated with other development partners to leverage limited resources
and to focus on areas that are most relevant for achieving impact.

137. The fourth risk relates to corruption, which has been at the center of the national
debate for the past several months. Recent high-level allegations of corruption are under
investigation by the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC). Corruption is not
only an impediment to investment but has also triggered a political crisis in Mauritius,
precipitating the withdrawal of one party from the government coalition. The risk of
corruption is mitigated by the fact the government appears to be supportive of the ICAC and
respectful of its independence as well as the fact that the financial systems in Mauritius, as
documented in the 2010 PEFA report, appear robust, suggesting that there is relatively little
risk to the proceeds of the loan.
