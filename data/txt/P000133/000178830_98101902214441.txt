INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF BOTSWANA FOR THE
FRANCISTOWN URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit to the Republic of Botswana for the equivalent of US$3.0 million
on standard IDA terms to help finance an urban project in support of the
Government's program to develop Francistown into a regional center. About
US$1.83 million of the proposed credit would be relent (along with about
US$0.75 million of Government funds) to the Francistown Town Council and
the repayment would be on various terms depending on the item being financ-
ed (para 43).
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        Although no economic report has been produced on Botswana since 1971
(Report No. AE-18), the staff has been following economic developments and the
following is based on current information. An economic mission is scheduled
to visit Botswana in June 1974. Country data are presented in Annex I.
3.        The population of Botswana is currently estimated at 640,000, with
approximately 50,000 citizens absent, mainly as migrant laborers in South
Africa. Domestic wage employment is estimated at approximately 30,000, and
is projected to grow to 60,000 by 1978. The majority of the population re-
mains dependent for their livelihood on subsistence agriculture with household
incomes frequently supplemented by remittances from relatives in wage employment.
4.        The climate of Botswana is semi-arid, with erratic and inadequate
rainfall. In recent times the country has experienced drought seven years out
of ten, and suffered a major loss of livestock at least once a decade. Never-
theless, the country's semi-arid range lands are well suited for extensive
ranching, and cattle are the mainstay of the rural economy. Arable farming
is a hazardous occupation, although with sound crop husbandry a subsistence
yield can almost always be obtained and in good years crop production can
even be highly profitable.
5.        The country is well endowed with mineral resources, particularly
diamonds, nickel, copper, and coal, which have only recently been discovered.
A major obstacle to their exploitation is the shortage of water. There are
no perennial rivers, except in the north-west, where the Okavango spreads
out in a wide delta. Possibilities for the exploitation of the large water
potential of the Okavango are being studied through a major technical assist-
ance project funded under the United Nations Development Program. Most of
the population and livestock presently depend on underground water, which
in many instances is not being recharged from rainfall.



- 2 -
6.        Together with Lesotho, South Africa and Swaziland, Botswana belongs
to the Southern African Customs Union. Under this union, which has been in
existence from 1910, all customs, excise and sales duties collected in the
customs area are paid into a common revenue pool administered by South Africa.
In 1969, the customs union agreement between the four countries was renegotiated;
this provided the three smaller countries vith substantiallv increased revenues.
Under the customs agreement, there is also a free flow of funds and goods w4thiin
the area, which allows Botswana's industries duty free access to the large
South African market. Few industries have been started so far, but a develop-
ment corporation was created in 1970 and is growing into an effective organiza-
tion.   A few projects have been identified, and plans for their implementation
are well advanced.
7.        The country's infrastructure is poorly developed.   The main roads
have gravel or unmade surfaces, to which most villages are linked by sand
tracks. A railway runs from north to south through the populated eastern
side of the country, linking South Africa with Southern Rhodesiat, and the
nearest port is over 1,000 miles away. Power is available only in the main
urban centers and is expensive, being produced locally from small generators.
8.        Botswana's economic position has improved remarkably during the
past five years. The gross domestic product has risen from $64 million in
1967/68 to $132 million in 1971/72. Gross national product is tentatively
estimated at $109 million for 1971/72. For the 1968-72 period it is estimated
that the real rate of growth of GNP has been approximately 15 percent per
annum. The growth in the value of exports during the past four years was
nearly 50 percent per annum, rising from $19.5 million in 1969/70 to $64.5
million in 1972/73. These high rates of growth in production and exports are
largely attributable to two factors. First, there has been a rapid growth in
the value of livestock production, stimulated by a highly favorable inter-
national market for beef, with export sales rising from $10.5 million in 1966
to $30 million in 1972. Second, a large mining sector has been developed.
The De Beers diamond mine at Orapa (developed with an investment: of approxi-
mately $33 million) went into fuil production in 1972 with total. sales of
approximately $30 million per annum. The Shashe mining complex at Selebi-
Pikwe (developed with an investment of about $270 million in mining and
processing facilities and infrastructure) commenced production in 1973. The
mine will produce nickel, copper and sulphur.   The value of annual production
is likely to be over $75 million at present prices. Although mining devel-
opment is very capital intensive and is not expected to absorb the natural
increase in the labor force, a substarntial portion of the expected benefits
will accrue to the Government througlh royalties, taxes, and dividends which
the Government will be able to use for general development purposes.
9.        In recent years there has been a dramatic improvement in Botswana's
public finances. In 1967/68. the first full year of independenice, total
recurrent expenditure amounted to $18.75 million of which $8.85 million was
financed by Britain. In 1972/73, although recurrent expenditure had climbed
to $43.4 million, there was sufficient domestic revenue to generate a sur-
plus of $4.4 million. Botswana is therefore now able to devote a portion of
its domestic resources to funding the public sector investment program.



- 3 -
10.       Botswana has pursued a progressive economic and social program, with
a major effort being made to implement well-defined policies for rural develop-
ment and a more egalitarian income distribution. The Government has a well-
staffed and effective planning organization. Botswana has recently adopted a
National Development Plan (N.D.P. 1973-78), which provides a comprehensive
statement of national policy and priorities. The plan has two central aims:
(a) to create 30,000 new jobs by 1978, equivalent to a 9 percent per annum
growth in wage employment; (b) to improve the welfare of the mass of the
population who livie in the rural areas. The Plan places particular emphasis
on agricultural development and on improving rural services (e.g. roads,
education, health, water supplies). The Plan provides a comprehensive assess-
ment of resources and specifies their proposed uses.
11.       The NDP envisages a total investment of $353 million over the next
five years of which about two-thirds is expected to be contributed by the
public sector.  The Plan projects GNP (at factor cost in constant 1973
prices) to reach $239 million in 1978 (probably a conservative estimate),
representing a real rate of growth of 14 percent per annum. This high growth
rate is forecast primarily on the basis of prospective mining developments
together with related increases in public utilities, civil construction, and
services, and imp:Lies that GNP per capita will rise from $176 in 1971 to
almost $330 in 1978. The Plan estimates that $60 million will be provided
from domestic revenue for capital investment during 1973/78, and that a fur-
ther $165 million is to be sought from external resources. Approximately
half of this has already been pledged. Domestic revenue is expected to
finance about 27 percent of the total capital investment program. As the
local cost component of the program is estimated at about 40 percent, for-
eign agencies should be prepared to finance about one-third of the local
cost of projects. The main bilateral sources of assistance are expected
to be Britain and Sweden, who will finance a wide variety of projects. In
addition, Germany and USAID have agreed to provide finance for road devel-
opment and Norway for rural development.
12.       The major constraint to the implementation of the Plan is the short-
age of trained andl experienced manpower. Botswana reached independence with
very few citizens possessing any post-primary education. Ten years ago less
than 30 pupils completed five years of secondary education each year. A
remarkable expans:Lon of secondary education has taken place with total enroll-
ment rising from some 1,500 in 1966 to 5,500 in 1972. Vocational training,
however, has lagged behind and only recently has an adequate plan been pre-
pared for the training of artisans and technicians. Although a Vocational
Training Institute was established in 1973, it is still doubtful whether
sufficient job-oriented training can be undertaken through existing facilities.
13.       Despite the large borrowing for the infrastructure for the Shashe
complex, the overa:Ll public debt burden of Botswana is not great. Total dis-
bursed public debt amounted to $69 million in mid-1973, or approximately 50
percent of GDP, and is expected to rise to $120 million by 1978. Taking into
account the estimated income effects of the ambitious public sector investment
program, this wou:Ld represent 42 percent of GDP. The estimated cost of servic-
ing the public debt is 3.6 percent of domestic revenues and 2 percent of export



-4-
earnings in 1973/74 and is projected to amount to 6 percent of domestic revenues
and 2.7 percent of export earnings in 1977/78. In view of the favorable export
prospects and recent rapid rate of growth, the question of Botswana's credit-
worthiness for Bank loans will be considered in the near future.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN BOTSWANA
14.       Bank Group operations commenced in the territory that is now
Botswana before it became independent in 1966, with a road project in 1964.
To date there have been six projects, financed by five IDA credits amounting
to $13 million, and a loan of $32 million. The IDA credits have financed
two road projects, a water supply project, a livestock project, and engineering
studies on the infrastructure relating to the Shashe mining complex. The
latter credit was partially refinanced by the subsequent Bank loan for the
Shashe Infrastructure Project. As of December 31, 1972, the Bank Group's
share in Botswana's total debt (disbursed and undisbursed) was 54 percent,
while its share in Botswana's total debt service payments in 1973 was 53 percent.
However, the Bank loan was guaranteed by the mining companies concerned. A summary
statement of the Bank loan and IDA credits to Botswana, as of February 1974, is
given in Annex 2, together with notes on the execution of on-going projects.
15.       The overall performance of Botswana in the planning and execution
of development projects has been satisfactory. The completion on schedule
of the major parts of the large Shashe mining complex has been a remarkable
accomplishment, although a substantial cost over-run has been encountered.
A proposed supplementary loan of US$5.5 million to help finance the cost
over-run of the Shashe Infrastructure project is scheduled for presentation
to the Executive Directors in the near future. The progress on the Gaborone-
Lobatse road is ahead of schedule although the execution of the Gaborone-
Lobatse water supply project has been slow due to poor performance by the
civil works contractors. The credit for the livestock project became effec-
tive in April 1973, and implementation is now underway.
16.       We propose to continue our active support to the Government's
strategy for social and economic progress as spelled out in the National
Development Plan. The project presently under consideration, for Francis-
town urban development, will be a major step towards coping with the rapid
rate of urbanization. We propose to concentrate our future lending in
three areas: (a) the raising of rural income levels by improving livestock
production, which is the major occupation, (b) the linking up of population
centers by helping to develop the transportation system, and (c) the es-
tablishment of light industry to provide employment. The Government,
assisted by the Bank Group and other agencies, is preparing suitable projects
in these sectors.



-5-
PART III - THE URBAN SECTOR
17.       Botswana is undergoing rapid urbanization.   Although the country
is still predominantly rural, with roughly 90 percent of the people
living in villages,, the urban population increased threefold between
1964 and 1971. It is expected to grow at over 11 percent per annum, doubling
the country's urban population between 1971 and 1978 to about 123,000.
Currently, Botswana has only five towns, three of which have been constructed
since 1964. Francistown, the largest, with about 22,000 inhabitants, is in
northern Botswana and is projected to have a population reaching 35,000 in
the early 1980's. Other major centers are Lobatse in the south, headquarters
of the Botswana Meat Conmmission, and Gaborone, the capital, which was built
in the mid-1960's. Two townships have emerged recently near Francistown as
a result of mining development - Orapa, some 140 miles to the west and Selebi-
Pikwe, about 60 miles to the southeast.
18.       Rural poverty and expectation of higher earnings are causing many
Batswana (citizens of Botswana are called the Batswana) to move to the towns.
While rural development is given priority in the development strategy adopted
by the Government, the surge of urbanization has prompted concern for creating
additional jobs. The Government plans to do this by inducing industrial
development in regional centers, like Francistown, through the provision of
requisite infrastructure and also through the activities of the Botswana
Development Corporation. In addition the Government is acting to prevent
an expansion of the squatter settlements, that are already sprouting around
the towns, by a program for providing serviced housing plots for this growing
urban population.
19.       The Gover-nment has commissioned consultants to prepare new master
plans for Gaborone, Francistown and Lobatse. These plans encompass simple,
low cost methods of residential development that employ self-help and are
within the means of most low income groups, in order that large-scale public
subsidies and/or squjatter settlements can be avoided. The proposed develop-
ment of Francistown represents the first of these new plans to reach the
stage of implementaition. It includes squatter upgrading, serviced traditional
housing plots (mud huts) and site and service plots.   The successful applica-
tion of these low cost, self-help principles in Francistown is expected to
have considerable irapact on the development of other towns in Botswana.
The Francistown Situation
20.       The Government has given priority to the development of Francistown
as it wishes to promote this town as an important regional center. The town
is located close to mineral resources, such as diamonds, copper and coal,
and the region has good agricultural and livestock potential. Being equipped
with an airport and located on the country's single rail line, Francistown
is a natural growth point.
21.       Francistown has emerged from its origin as a town established and
managed by a mining company (Tati Concession Mining & Exploration Ltd) in



the 1890's, into four highly segregated urban districts - a high income
(approximately $10,000 per household) residential area and commercial center,
comprising some 300 mostly white families; a medium income (approximately
$2,400 per household) area, with another 300 households; a traditional settle-
ment, consisting mostly of mud huts, serving as home for nearly 4,000 low
income Batswana families; and lastly, a 120 ha industrial estate at Dumela.
some five miles from the town center. The proposed development plan would
promote the integration of the town into a single community.
22.       The employment available in Francistown is planned to increase from
the present 4,000 permanent jobs to 10,000 jobs by 1980. Per capita income in
Francistown was estimated at $229 in 1970, but this figure is strongly in-
fluenced by the high income levels of the non-Batswana population, and the
annual income of almost 90 percent of the Francistown population, representing
mostly Africans, was more of the order of $75 per capita.
23.       Accompanying the very low income levels of the great majority of
the Francistown population, housing conditions are extremely poor, with few
or no urban services available. Almost 80 percent live in rondavels of mud
and thatch. Most of the areas of such housing are completely lacking in
water, sanitation, solid waste removal and community facilities. Even the
more affluent side of the town does not have a waterborne sewerage system.
Responsibility for Planning and Construction
24.       The Government has traditionally undertaken the construction of
facilities on behalf of local authorities because of the general shortage
of manpower resources. As the Government intends to continue this practice,
a division is being created in the Ministry responsible for urban development
which, together with the town councils, will be responsible for planning and
implementing projects. The division will include a civil engineer, an
economist/planner, a low cost/self-help housing expert, and an urban develop-
ment coordinator who would be responsible to the Permanent Secretary of the
Ministry for the supervision and coordination of the project. Appointments
have now been made for all positions, except that of the civil engineer.
Until this position is filled, the division intends to maintain close liaison
with the engineering department in the Ministry of Public Works.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
25.       A report entitled "Appraisal of the Francistown Urban Development
Project" (290a-BT) is being circulated separately to the Executive Directors.
A Credit and Project Summary is provided in Annex III.
Background
26.       Proposals for planned development of Francistown go back to 1967-68.
In 1971, the Government commenced discussions with IDA and a project identifi-
cation mission visited Botswana in February 1972. Appraisal of the project



- 7 -
was completed in September 1973 and negotiations took place in Washington in
mid-February, 1974. Mr. M. Stevens, Undersecretary, Ministry of Finance and
Development Planning, led the Botswana delegation, which included Mr. F.
Steenkamp, Administrative Assistant to the President.
27.       The project forms part of Stage I, covering the period 1973-1976,
of a development program for Francistown. In order to initiate construction
while the feasibility of the rest of the program was still under study, Stage
I was divided into two phases. Phase I, covering the period 1973-74 and
which is now being implemented at an estimated cost of R703,000 ($1,054,000),
is being financed by the (British) Overseas Development Administration (ODA).
Phase II, covering the period 1974-76, is estimated to cost R2.91 million
($4.36 million) and constitutes the project for which IDA financing has been
requested.
The Project
28.       The proposed project comprises:
(a) Preparation of 800 site and services plots for housing
built of permanent materials. Purchasers would build
their own dwellings and would be eligible to receive
about $450 worth of building materials loans, adequate
for a siimple two-room house.
(b)  Preparation of 1,000 plots for traditional housing of
mud and thatch.
(c) Upgrading of existing squatter areas, affecting over
1 ,000 households.
(d) Technical assistance including construction supervision,
and funds for supplementing the salaries of two key
individuals - the Urban Development Coordinator and the
Low Cost Self-Help Housing Expert (para 24) - and for a
study of water tariffs.
(e)  Construction of communal facilities that would promote
community welfare. Included would be two ward or neighborhood
offices, a works depot, a market, two health clinics, a
school, and a block of Town Council offices.
(f) Preparat:Lon and servicing of 11 ha of industrial land,
5 ha of commercial land, and 25 plots for high-cost
housing. The latter two items would be financed from
Government funds (para 39).
(g) Primary iLnfrastructure designed to serve a population of
35,000 (forecast for the early 1980's), including:



-8-
(i) improvement of the electricity distribution system;
(ii) additions to the existing road network and pedestrian
bridges, in order that residential areas and work
places would be linked with facilities geared more
to bicycle and pedestrian traffic than to cars;
(iii) laying of branch sewers for the new industrial and
commercial areas;
(iv) sinking of boreholes, installation of borehole pumps,
booster pumps, and water mains. Preliminary tests
indicate that sufficient groundwater is available within
2 km of Francistown to meet project requirements. The
Government is financing the sinking of boreholes and the
waterpipe to connect the boreholes to    the Francistown
water grid.
Project Execution
29.       The Government, through the division in the Ministry responsible
for urban development (para 24), would be responsible for the construction
of the facilities on behalf of the Francistown Town Council (FTC). The
construction would be done by contractors under the supervision of engineering
consultants.  The Urban Development Coordinator would oversee both the Consul-
tants and the Contractors.   The FTC would operate and maintain the facilities
as well as handle those aspects of project implementation relating to self-
help housing.  The Council is already operating and maintaining in a satis-
factory manner, facilities for education, sanitation, streets and roads,
electricity and water, public health and social services.
30.       With respect to project implementation, the FTC would be responsible
for:
(a) allocating site and services plots;
(b) managing the building material loans scheme, although actual
procurement would be done by the responsible division in the
Ministry; and
(c) providing technical assistance to plot holders in self-help
housing construction.
31.       To perform the above functions, the Council is creating a special
unit called the Self-Help Housing Agency (SHHA). The Agency will be headed
by a Director and will be staffed with six building artisans, eight community
development workers, and an adequate number of administrative staff. The
Government proposes to recruit two building trainers for the Agency from
overseas volunteer agencies (the German Volunteers or the American Peace
Corps).



- 9 -
32.       The Council is also creating a Site and Services Management Board
consisting of Government representatives including the Urban Development
Coordinator, and FTC Councillors and staff including the Director of the
SHHA. The Board will approve plot allocations and transfers. It will also
propose policy guidelines for SHHA operations, which like other Town Council
policy decisions, will be subject to approval by the Ministry of Local
Govermnent.
33.       The key Council officers -- the Town Clerk, The Engineer, and the
Treasurer -- have considerable experience. The Director of the SHHA has
recently been appointed and will take up his position in March/April 1974.
In view of the importance of the Engineer, the Treasurer, and the SHHA
Director to the project, assurances have been obtained that until December 31,
1978, no change will be made in the appointment of the Town Engineer or
Treasurer, or in the appointment of the Director of the SHHA, without prior
consultation with IDA.
34.       All the site and services plots will be laid out, serviced and
allocated by the end of 1975. The self-help housing program is expected to
take up to 1978 and, therefore, the building materials loan scheme will
extend until 1978.
Project Standards
35.       The fac:Llities to be provided under the project have been designed
so that they could be progressively extended or upgraded, but the initial
standards would be kept at a level consistent with both minimum health
requirements and the available resources of the prospective users.
36.       In the low income areas, water would be supplied through standpipes
-- one for every 25 households in the squatter areas to be upgraded and in the
site and services plots, and one for every 80 households in the traditional
housing areas. Aqua privies would be used for sewerage, with periodic collec-
tion of solid waste. The only electric service to be provided is security
street lighting. Gravel access roads and earthformed internal roads would
facilitate movement in the squatter areas and for the sites and service areas,
and earth access a,nd internal roads in the traditional housing areas. The
size of both the site and services and traditional plots would be 375 m2
which accords witht the life style of most low income Batswana. Each bene-
ficiary in the low income areas would be given a Certificate of Rights,
entitling him to lifetime use of the land for residential purposes but not
to ownership.
376       The 25 high cost residential plots included in the project would be
1,400 m in size, have individual water and electricity connections, water-
borne sanitation, and be served by gravel access and internal roads. It is
proposed that leases of 99 years would be given to beneficiaries of the high-
cost plots, and leases for a fixed term period of 50 years would be given for
the industrial and commercial plots.



- 10 -
Project Costs and Financin&
38.       The total cost of the project is estimated at $4.36 million equiva-
lent, excluding land. The foreign exchange component is $2.49 million, or
about 57 percent of total costs. Of the total, $1.15 million is for low
income residential development, $830,000 for primary infrastructure,
$650,0oo for community facilities, $540,000 for techinical assistance and en-
gineering supervision, $250,000 for industrial and commercial areas and high-
cost plots, and $940,000 for contingencies (Annex III).
39.       The proposed IDA credit of $3.0 million would finance about 69
percent of the total costs of the project, including $600,000 of local
costs. The Government would provide the remaining $1.36 million equivalent,
and the land to be used for the project. Part of the Government's contribu-
tion would be used to finance the servicing of the 5 ha of conmercial land
and the 25 high-cost residential plots, since they will be used in part to
compensate the Tati Company for some land acquired by the Government from the
Company in 1972.
Cost Recovery and Pricing
40.       The Government considers it essential to provide the low income
groups with minimally serviced residential areas consistent with public
health standards. To avoid the extension of squatter areas, the charges to
the individual low income beneficiaries would be kept low but closely in
accordance with their ability to pay.
41.       To achieve this aim, the Government would pay the costs of the
schools, health clinics, technical assistance, and the land utilized in the
low income residential development. In addition, the Government would also
pay the costs of on-site development in the site and services plots and
traditional housing plots, as well as for the aqua privies in the traditional
plots. No charges would be levied on the direct beneficiaries to recover
these costs.  The Francistown 'own Council would pay for the costs of Council
and Ward Offices, markets, main roads, trunk sewers, and on-site development
in the squatter areas to be upgraded, out of general revenues. Individual
beneficiaries in the low income areas would pay charges sufficient to recover
the costs of aqua privies (except in the traditional plots), building mate-
rials (in the site and services plots), and recurrent services such as water
and electricity. Collection of charges in the low income areas would be
made at income source for beneficiaries in wage employment, and through ward
offices (with an attached revenue collector) for beneficiaries who are sel'-
employed. The charges for aqua privies and building materials would be set at
a level that would allow for a 10 percent default in collections.
42.       In the industrial, commercial, and lhigh-cost plots, the individual
beneficiaries would pay charges that are greater than the land, capital and
recurrent costs, but which are representative of market prices currently
prevailing in Botswana.



- 11 -
43.       The Government proposes to hold the F.T.C. responsible for the
recovery of about R1.72 million (US$2.58 million) of project costs (through
general revenues, utility operations, and from individual beneficiaries).
The Government will transfer this amount as loans to F.T.C. and repayment
will be on the following terms: $570,000 for utilities at 8 percent per
annum over 25 years, $750,000 for aqua privies and building material loans
at 7 percent per annum over 15 years, and US$1.26 million for on-site
infrastructure in the upgrading areas, community facilities, sewerage, and
roads at 1 percent: per annum over 25 years. These "on-lending" arrangements
are essentially irntragovernmental transfers and the charging of interest
rates is intended primarily as a means of imposing financial discipline
at the local leve]..
44.       Based orn projected revenues, it is expected that Francistown Town
Council will be able to meet project debt service and recurrent costs while
maintaining, and possibly making some improvements, to municipal services.
In addition to collections from project beneficiaries, important elements
in the town's revenues include property rates and utility surpluses. Revenues
for property rates are expected to increase substantially with a new valuation
roll to be introduced shortly. The new valuation roll will, in addition to
assessing land, include property improvements for the first time. Further
substantial revenue increases from property rates are expected in 1975 when
the property tax rate is to be increased. Combined water and electricity
operations have produced surpluses in the past. As no major utility capital
expenditures are expected in the coming years, with prudent management, the
combined surplus on utility operations is expected to continue. Assurances
have been obtained that FTC would operate its power and water operations in
accordance with sound public utility practices and would not implement any
changes in electricity and water charges without prior consultation with
IDA.
45.       The Government maintains close control over FTC's financial affairs
through its approval of annual expenditure proposals, the appointment of
auditors and regulations on borrowing and property valuation. These controls
are intended to reduce the risk of imprudent or improper financial policies
and practices at the local level.
Procurement and Disbursement
46.       Civil and electrical works valued at $3.31 million, or 76 percent
of total project costs, would be contracted by the responsible division in
the Ministry on the basis of international competitive bidding in accordance
with the Association's guidelines. Building materials, valued at about
$360,000, would be procured on the basis of competitive bids from local
dealers. This procedure would enable the delivery rate of the building
materials to be closely coordinated with the rate of construction of self-
help housing, thereby avoiding the costs and problems of pilferage.
47.       The Association would disburse 71 percent against the total project
costs for preparing and servicing industrial and low income residential land,



- 12 -
upgrading community facilities and supporting infrastructure; 71 percent of
total expenditures for building materials; and 100 percent of foreign expen-
ditures or 71 percent of local expenditures for technical assistance and
engineering supervision. It is proposed that any surplus remaining in the
IDA credit would be applied to the preparation of additional traditional
housing plots.
Justification
48.       The project would provide an immediate improvement in the social
environment and public health conditions of the town's large low income
squatter population. Moreover, it would promote the development of Francistown
along a regulated and orderly pattern into a commercial and industrial center
providing much needed employment opportunities.
49.       A growing demand for industrial and commercial space in the town
is being created as a result of regional mining development. The Government
plans to meet this demand through a low cost " site and services" approach
that is consistent with available resources. In addition to several inquiries,
four enterprises have already made firm proposals to establish in the town
and would use land to be serviced under the project. By 1980, there are
expected to be as many as 10,000 jobs in Francistown -- a substantial increase
over the present number of 4,000. During the two-year construction period,
the project would itself create direct employment of about 3,000 man-years
of unskilled jobs.
50.       The project would substantially improve the poor public health
conditions in Francistown, which are tending to deteriorate further with the
growth of population. At present, nearly 80 percent of the population is
dependent upon water that is polluted and has no sewerage facilities. The
project would be a significant step towards alleviating these conditions,
as it would provide clean water by standpipe and aqua privies for sewerage
disposal.
51.       Other benefits of the project include some income redistribution.
Through the utility tariff and property tax systems, the high inacome earners
will pay for much of the infrastructure that primarily benefits the poor.
Nonracial expansion of the town would also tend to be encouraged under the
planned pattern of development.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHIORITY
52.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between Botswana and the
International Development Association, the Recommendation of the Committee
provided for in Article V, Section 1(d) of the articles of Agreement and the
text of a draft resolution approving the proposed loan are being distributed
to the Executive Directors, separately.



- 13 -
53.       The special features described in paras 43 and 44 of this report
are reflected in Sections 4.04 and 4.05 of the Development Credit Agreement
and in Para. 9 of Schedule 4 thereto.
54.       In addition to the above features, and in view of the importance
of the role of Francistown Town Council (FTC) as described in this Report,
Section 8.01 of the draft Agreement provides that the acceptance by FTC of
the obligations set out in Schedule 4 shall be a condition of effectiveness.
55.       Except as mentioned above, the draft Agreement conforms to the
normal pattern for credits for urban development projects.
56.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit will comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
57.       In formulating this proposal, it has not been possible to take full
account of the consequences of recent increases in petroleum prices. However,
available information indicates that the proposed credit is justified.
58.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.

B. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION-/
Credit No. 233      Gaborone-Lobatse Water Supply Project:   #3.0 million
credit of February 10, 1971   ClosingDate: _March 31, 1975
The Project is expected to be completed eighteen months
late, in March 1974, primarily because of the poor
performance of civil works constructors. The closing
date has been extended to March 31, 1975. Because of
exceptional rains in 1971/72, no major water supply
problems are expected at Lobatse as a result of the
construction delays. The provisional arrangement under
which the Water Utilities Corporation's Gaborone-Lobatse
Division was staffed through agency agreements has now
been replaced by permanent staffing arrangements.
Loan No. 776        Shashe Infrastructure Project:   $32 million loan of
June 31, 1973; Closing Date: November 1, 1975
Work on the Infrastructure Project has proceeded satis-
factorily with the main aspects nearing completion. Power
and water were made available to the Mining Company (BCL)
on various dates well ahead of the agreed target date of
October 1, 1973. A net increase in the cost of the project
is proposed to be met in part by a supplemental Bank
loan scheduled to be presented to the Executive Directors
in FY74.
Credit No. 303      Second Road Project:   $2.0 million credit of April 27,
1972; Closing Date: March 31, 1976
The construct-ion of the Gaborone-Lobatse road is ahead
of schedule. The quality of the contractor's work and
the consultant's supervisory services is good.
Credit No. 325      Livestock Development Project:   $1.65 million credit of
June 30, 1972; Closing Date: June 30, 1977
The Project was declared effective on April 30, 1973 and
implementation is now getting underway. The key project
personnel have taken up their positions and are recruiting
staff, purchasing equipment, and developing a work prograr.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any problems
which are being encountered and the action being taken to remedy them.
They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that they
do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses
in project execution.

Procurement
Arrangements:          Civil and electrical works estimated at $3.31 million
would be procured on the basis of international com-
petitive tender. Building materials estimated at
$360,000 would be procured on the basis of competitive
bids from local dealers.
Justification:           The project would provide an immediate improvement
in the social environment and public health conditions
of the town's large low-income squatter population.
Moreover, it would promote the development of
Francistown along a regulated and orderly pattern
into a commercial and industrial center providing
much needed employment opportunities and, in a small
way, would promote more equitable income distribution.
