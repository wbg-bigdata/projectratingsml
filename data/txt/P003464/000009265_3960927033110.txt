MEMORANDUh AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL EANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
____   FOR A TIANJIN LIGHT INDUSTRY PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to the
People's Pepublic of China for the equivalent of $154 million is submitted for
approval. The proposed loan would have a repayment term of 20 years including
5 years of grace with interest at the standard variable rate. The Government
would make available the loan proceeds to the Tianjin Municipal Government
(TMG) which, in turn, would make available the industrial credit component of
$141.2 million to the China Investment Bank (CIB). CIB would act as a full
financial initermediary for $70.2 million allocated to textile dyeing and
finishing sub"ectors and TMG would onlend this amount to CIB with a repayment
period of 20 years including 5 years of grace, at a variable interest rate and
commitment fee equal to that under the loan. As regards the balance amount of
$71 million for the paper subsector, CIB would act as a managing agency on
behalf of TMG and would receive a fee of 0.3X. The industrial credit
component would be onlent to eligible enterprises for a maximum period of 15
years including up to 3 years of grace at a variable interest rate equal to
the Bank rate plus a minimum spread of 1X and subborrowers would carry the
foreign exchange risk. The residual loan amount of $12.8 million would be
used by TMG for the TA component, except for $50,000 that would be made
available to CIB for its staff training on terms and conditions satisfactory
to the Bank.
2.       Background.  Industry is China's largest productive sector accounting
for nearly half of its GDP. The sector employs over 83 million workers, i.e.,
172 of China's total labor force. In 1986, this sector contributed gross
output valued at Y 1,119 billion ($324 billion), almost equally shared between
light and heavy industry. Despite its rapid growth, the industrial sector is
characterized by low efficiency and productivity and a limited variety of
products which are often of inferior quality. This is mainly due to
inappropriate economic policies, outdated equipment and technology, inadequate
infrastructure and weak support institutions. The Bank is assisting the
Government to address the above problems through its economic and sector work
and lending operations. Bank's studies of state enterprise management
systems, the embryonic financial system and investment, external trade and
capital have been important vehicles for advising the Government economic
reforms. Lending operations have included direct loans for large industrial
projects including restructuring and DFC-type lending mainly for the
modernization of light industry.
3.       With the gradual decentralization of investment responsibilities
under China's ongoing economic reform process, it is becoming increasingly
important that the above-mentioned industrial issues should also be addressed
at the provincial level. The Bank is, therefore, initiating a series of
provincial operations designed to complement its nationally focused sector
work and projects. These new operations will focus inter alia at the
subsector and enterprise level and attempt to assist the provincial authori-
ties in the identification and resolution of policy and system reform issues
in conjunction with specific enterprise level restructuring. The proposed
project is the first in a series of such provincial projects. It would



- 2 -
support the restructuring of three important subsectors, textile dyeing and
finishing, paper and packaging, of light industry in Tianjin. These
industries are presently characterized by obsolete equipment, inefficient use
of raw materials, inadequate concentration on those products in which Tianjin
has a comparative advantage and suboptimal allocation of product lines between
plants.
4.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The project is consistent with the
Bank's overall strategy for assistance to the industrial sector in China and
is designed to assist the municipal government in improving the overall policy
framework and strengthening subsectoral planning; building sound support
institutions; and promoting and implementing technology upgrading and plant
restructuring. To this end, Bank staff, with the assistance of the Tianjin
government, have carried out an indepth study of the three subsectors
focussing on sectoral policies and systems; management and technical structure
of enterprises, their operational performance and trends, and plans for
restructuring; and the role and adequacy of institutional infrastructure. TMG
has prepared and formally adopted a development program and strategy for the
three subsectors based on the conclusions and recommendations of this study.
The development program and strategy outlines, inter alia, various reform
measures which will be introduced (including price and production planning
reforms, granting of direct export rights to enterprises, use of economic
criteria in investment planning, and steps designed to increase labor mobility
and improve financial intermediation in Tianjin) and investment strategies for
eachl of the three subsectors. It is expected that the Bank's study will serve
as a model for other subsectors in Tianjin for which the municipal government
will now assume direct responsibility.
5.       Project Objectives.  The main objective of the project is to assist
TMG in the implementation of above-mentioned development program and specific
strategies formulated for the above subsectors. It would, thus, aim to:
(a) expedite system reforms at the regional level leading to greater autonomy
for and accountability of enterprise management while encouraging the
municipal authorities to focus their activities on supporting and guiding
enterprises rather than direct control; (b) modernize and restructure
enterprises including increased product rationalization between plants and the
support of high priority investments; (c) improve internal enterprise
management and systems; (d) strengthen institutional infrastructure (including
research and design institutes and vocational training schools); and (e)
support the preparation of a long-term overall industrial developnment strategy
for Tianjin.
6.       Project Description.  The project would include financial assistance
in the form of an industrial credit of $141.2 million to be onlent through CIB
to enterprises for the restructuring and modernization and TA of $12.8 million
for the overall industrial restructuring program including strengthening of
the institutional infrastructure in Tianjin. On the basis of TMG's
development program and strategy and considering the subproject pipeline, it
is estimated that CIB would onlend $36.6 million to the textile dyeing and
finishing subsector, $71.0 million to the pulp and paper subsector, and $33.6
million to the packaging subsector. While the list will be subject to change
during project implementation, 15 enterprises in the 3 subsectors are
presently expected to be restructured under the financial assistance
component. These subprojects, which would be consistent with and part of the
provincial government's strategy for the restructuring of the three



subsectors, would result in significant improvements in product quality and
production efficiency and would promote increased concentration on those
product lines in which Tianjin has comparative advantage. While the
investments in the pulp and paper and packaging subsectors would also result
in production increases, the textile component concentrates on quality and
efficiency upgrading without an increase in basic production capacity. As
international textile export quotas apply to quantity only, the quality
improvements are expected to result in increased foreign exchange earnings; in
addition some beneficiary enterprises should also be able to increase export
volumes for those products in which China has not been able to meet its quotas
owing to shortfalls in quality standards.
7.       Although the project is basically for assisting the three
preidentified subsectors, CIB will be allowed the flexibility to finance
subprojects in other subsectors to be agreed between the Bank and TMG, on the
basis of studies and development strategies to be prepared by TMG. CIB will
be responsible for the appraisal and supervision of subprojects to be financed
under the proposed Bank loan. It has already received, so far, four
industrial credits from the Bank Group for a total amount of $645.4 million
equivalent and the overall experience with their utilization is satisfactory.
The Bank has also provided considerable support to CIB's institutional
development. CIB has expanded rapidly since its establishment in 1981 and now
has 31 branches. It has a total staff of 1,040, of which a large number has
received training--both inside and outside China. Foreign training of staff
is presently being carried out under the TA component of the Bank Group's
fourth loan/credit to CIB. CIB is diversifying its sources of financing. It
started borrowing from international commercial sources in 1986 and also
received a loan of $100 million from the Asian Development Bank in 1987 for
onlending to industry. CIB's quality of portfolio and financial position is
satisfactory.
8.       The TA component of the proposed Bank loan will be used for
(a) strenthening of institutional infrastructure ($11.65 million) through
import of testing equipment, pilot plants, computer hardware and software,
teaching aids, etc., and staff training; (b) development of internal
enterprise management systems ($0.50 million); (c) short-term consultant
services for light industry ($0.3 million); (d) a study to prepare a long-term
development strategy for the paper subsector ($0.3 million); and (e) staff
t:aining of CIB Tianjin branch ($0.05 million). The total cost of the project
i3 tentatively estimated at $227.6 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange
component of $155.0 million (682). Final cost estimates would depend upon the
inAividual subprojects that CIB will finance under the industrial credit
component. Retroactive financing up to a total of $8.0 million will be
allowed for expenditures incurred after December 1, 1988. It is expected
that the financing ($1.0 million) for the preparation of an overall industrial
strategy for Tiarjin will be provided from the Second Technical Cooperation
Credit (Credit No. 1664-CHA). A breakdown of tentative cost estimates and the
financing plar. is shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and
of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in China are given in Schedules 'C' and 'D' respectively. A map is
also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 7165-CH, dated
January 25, 1989, is being distributed separately.



9.       Agreed Actions.  TMG has reached understandings with the Bank on the
implementation of its development program and strategy for the project
subsectors, including economic and system reforms and strategies for subsector
restructuring. For the project TMG agreed on the following major actions:
(a) making available the industrial credit component of $141.2 million to CIB;
(b) implementation of the program for strengthening of institutional
infrastructure; (c) preparation of overall industrial development strategy for
Tianjin; (d) carrying out of both the enterprise management system and the
paper subsector studies; (e) ensuring the availability of local currency funds
for implementation of the project; (f) maintaining the light industry support
unit to assist enterprises in locating required short-term expertise; and
(g) continuation of the existing project task force and the project
implementation unit to coordinate and monitor the implementation of the
project. CIB agreed to the following major actions and conditions:
(a) eligible subprojects to be consistent with TMG's development program and
strategy for three subsectors, to meet CIB's lending criteria including a
minimum ERR and FRR of 122 and to be sponsored by enterprises with
satisfactory projected financial position; (b) subprojects to comply with
Bank's guidelines on pollution control; (c) CIB's debt/equity ratio not to
exceed 5:1; and (d) CIB to exchange views with the Bank on its interest rates.
:0.      Benefits.  The acceleration of policy and system reforms, improved
services of support institutions and restructuring of enterprises would result
in improvement of subsectoral efficiency and performance. The subprojects
would meet economic viability criteria and would contribute to improvements in
product quality, production efficiency, higher export earnings and efficient
import substitution. The project, which would be first of its kind in China,
is expected to serve as a model for the development of future projects in
Tianjin and other provinces.
11.      Risks.  There are two main project risks:  (a) unanticipated and
adverse future macro-economic developments could inhibit the implementation of
the policy and system reforms agreed with TMG; and (b) the complexity of the
project and the large number of institutions involved may result in delays in
implementation. However, given the government's strong commitment to the
reform process and the institutional arrangements agreed with TMG for project
supervision, these risks are unlikely to pose a serious threat to the success
of the project.
12.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.

Ib As credits are denominated in SDRs (since IDA Replenishment VI), undisbursed SDR credit
balances are converted to dollars at the current exchange rate between the dollar and the
SDR. In some cases, therefore, the undisbursed balance indicates a dollar amount greater
than the original principal credit amount expressed in dollars.
Notes: 1) The status of the projects listed in Part A is described in a separate report on all
Bank/IDA financial projects in execution, which is updated twice yearly and circulated
to the Executive Directors on April 30 and October 31.
2) Since the date of this Statement (September 30, 1988) two loans have been approved:
Ningbo and Shanghai Ports for $76.4 million, and Xiamen Port for $36.0 million.
