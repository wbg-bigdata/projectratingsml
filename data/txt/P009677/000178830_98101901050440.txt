SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a proposed project for the exparsion of the
Nangal unit of the Fertilizer Corporation of India (FCI), a Govf'rnment of
India (GOu) owned entity and the largest fertilizer producer ir the country.
Estimated total cost of the project is US$105.6 million equivalent including
a mAximum of about US$58 million in foreLgn exchange, which the International
Development Association has been asked ta provide. Ine proceeds of the IDA
credit would be re-lent to FCI at 8.5% and be used primarily to finance
internationally-bid equipment, engineerirg, erection and process licenses.
The remainder of the financing required, about US$48. million, would be pro-
vided by the Government as equity funds.
ii.       Located in the State of Punjab in Northern India, the existing
Nangal - -nt has an annual design capacity of 80,000 tons per year of nitrogen
in the t    of calcium azmonium nitrate (CAN) fertilizer and 14 tons per
year of i        zt heavy water.  The expansion project would add 152,000
tons per          nitrogen in the form of urea, India's most popular and
effective LeL.' izer.  This tonnage is adequate to stimulate production of
10 million tons of food grains annually based on India's current nitrogen
to food giain ratio. Furthermore, the project by replacing the high power
consuming, electrolysis section of the present, fully depreciated ammonia
plant, would permit the release of a large amount of hydroelectric power
for more economic uses in the area. Manufacture of heavy water would be
discontinued, but existing fertilizer production (CAN) and off-site facili-
ties would be retained. Thsefeedstock for the existing and additional
fertilizer production would be heavy fuel oil of which, in contrast to
naphtha, India has relatively ampYe quantities at its disposal.
iii.      The Nangal unit Fegan operations in 1961 and has been FCI's
most profitable plant because it haa been operated efficiently and because
of a low power price, of about one fourth of the present opportunity cost of
power. The plant operated consistently at close to full capacity until
power shortages arose about two years ago. These have reduced fertilizer
output by about 30%. The power shortages are likely to continue and are
an added reason for shutting dowa the existing electrolysis - ammonia plant.
Nangal has no outstanding long-term debt.
iv.       The project forms part of an ambitious expansion program of FCI,
involving several plants now under construction and others in an advanced
planning stage, that by 1980 is to increase nitrogenous and phosphatic
fertilizer production 5.4 and 9.3 times respectively over 1970 levels.
While projects have been financed on a conservative 50:50 debt to equity
ratio, FCI's earnings record has been unsat4sfactory (about 1.5% return
on capital in recent years) due mainly to operating problems in existing
plants and serious delays in plant construction. In the next two years
annual losses of about Rs. 20 million are anticipated for FCI because of
continuing production difficulties plus the expected start-up losses of
three large fertilizer plants which are more than two years behind schedule.



- ii -
During that period, the ability of FCI to service debt out of its own
resources without help from the Government will be limited but GOI recognizes
this fact and is demonstrating not only a willingness to provide the neces-
sary financing, but also attack the causes of the problem.
v.        Thereafter, FCI's financial situation should show substantial im-
provement provided it will devote a major portion of its energies to bring-
Ing new plants into operation more quickly and to increasing overall utili-
zation of existing capacity. An examination of the Corporation's further
expansion plans is needed to bring them better in line with FCI's resources -
human, technical and financial. Therefore, FCI and GOI propose to take
decisive steps to overcome FCI's :resent and anticipated difficulties and
urgently concentrate efforts directed primarily towards maximum use of exist-
ing capacity with a critical review of proposed new plants.
vi.        In executing the Nangal project, commercially proven processes
will be used and FCI will be the overal contractor; however, much of the
engineering and procurement has been made the responsibility of the ammonia
plant contractor (Uhde, F.R. of Germany) and the urea plant contractor
(Montedison, Italy). PCI has appointed a suitable project manager and his
responsibilities plus a detailed project implementation plan have been jointly
defined by FCI and the contractors. Thus there is reasonable assurance that
the project will be executed on schedule and without major technical diffi-
culties. It is expected that the project will start commercial production
in December 1975 after a construction period of about 34 months.
vii.       Based on detailed marketing studies, no problems in selling
Nangal's urea are foreseen. India will continue to face a nitrogen fertili-
zer shortage throughout the 1970's, especially in Nangal's main sales area -
Punjab, Haryana and Northern Rajasthan - where most farmers are progressive,
irrigation is extensive and nitrogen consumDtion ner unit of cropped area is
over three times the national average.  Well developed private dealer and
cooperative distribution systems exist, backed by adequate storage, trays-
portation and credit facilities. Furthermore, even if all approved urea
projects within commercial reach of the marketing aLea were completed on
schedule and operated as planned, there would still be a demand for fertil-
izer .equivalent to the production of two more large nitrogen fertilizer
plants in Northern India.
viii.      Upon project complction, the Nangal unit is expected to have a
satisfactory financial structure (debt/equity ratio of 35:65 and debt ser-
vice coverage well above two). Export urea prices have recently significantly
increased, reflecting in part rising investment costs and also operating
costs in major supolying countries. Nevertheless, a conservative urea
import price of US$65 per ton, c.i.f. India has been assumed to determine
the economic rate of return of the project. On this basis, the economic
rate of return of the project is about 15%, which is very satisfactory for
a fertilizer project. If revenues and costs of the project are considered
on an incremental basis, and thereby include the power savings from shut-
ting down part of the existing plant the economic return would be even greater



- iii -
(about 22%). The return is sensicive to changes in sales prices, project
delay3 and to a lesser degree, fluctuations in raw material prices, and
operating levels. Even if operating levels were reduced from 90% to 85% of
capacity, and the project was delayed by one year - this probably being the
single most serious risk the project faces - the economic return would still
be about 10%.
ix.       Apart from the workers required during project construction and in
the fertilizer distribution system, the use of additional labor will be small,
since existing labor from the phased-out ammonia plant will be largely used
to staff the expanded plant. There will be significant foreign exchange
benefits; the net annual foreign exchange savings are estimated at US$13
million, once the plant is operating normally at its predicted level of 90%
of capacity. The ecological effects of the proposed project have been
assessed and are considered minimal.
x.        The Bank Croup has recently been active in the fertilizer field
in India. IDA has made tno credits for expansions by the government-owned
Fertilisers and Chemicals-Travancore-Ltd., (FACT) in Cochin and the FCI
Gorakhpur Unit. These have experienced some delays but are now proceeding
satisfactorily. IFC has participated in two private sector projects:
Indian ExplDsives Ltd., in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh and Zuari Agro Chemicals
Ltd., in Coa. Indian Explosives, a competitor of Gorakhpur is already
operating and Zuari Agro is about to commence operations. rhe Bank is also
Executing Agencv for a tN P project evaluating phosphate deposits in
Rajasthan. The Bank Group, in addition, is currently considering two other
fertilizer projects: FCI Trombay near Bombay and Tata Chemicals in Gujarat
State.
xi.       Based on the agreements rea.hed during negotiations, the project
is suitable for an IDA credit of US$58 million.



I.     INTRODJCrION
1.01      The Government of India (COI) has requested financing from the
International Development Association (IDA) equivalent to USS58 million
which is the maximum estimated foreign exchange requirement to expand
facilities at the Nangal Unit of the Fertilizer Corporation of India (FCI).
The expansion would add 330,000 metric tons per year (TPY) of urea capacity,
equivalent to 152,000 TPY of nitrogen (N), to the existing calcium ammonium
nitrate (CAN) plant (80,000 TPY of N) and replace the ammonia section of the
existing plant at Nangal which is based on a power-intensive process.
1.02      Nangal, located in Punjab State, abotut 100.km north-west of
Chandigarh, is one of five FCI operating units (Map IBRD 3559 R2). The
plant, which began production in 1961 1/ has until 1971 consistently oper-
ated at high levels of available capacity and has significantly contributed
to FCI's profits and cash generation.  Nangal's profitability, however,
largely results from the low price it pays for power. Conversely, *n recent
years capacity utilization and earnings have oeen substantially affected by
power shortages, which are expected to continue.
1.03      The Nangal project was identified by an IDA mission in June/July
1969 and a feasibility study was submitted to the Bank in early 1971. After
the first appraisal mission in August/September 1971 three basic projecE
alternatives were discussed between IDA, FCI and GOI out of which the alter-
native now proposed emerged.
1.04      This appraisal report was prepared by Messrs. Donald Brown,
Manfred Ferber, Richard Pigossi and Christopher Pratt of the Industrial
Projects Department, based on missions to India in August 1971, June and
August 1972.
1.05      A glossary of technical terms used in the report is attached as
Annex 1.
II.     TIE FERTILIZER CORPORATION OF INDIA (FCI)
A.   History and Organization
2.01      FCI was incorporated in 1961 under the Companies Act of India,
representing a merger of two existing public sector companies - Sindri
Fertilizers and Chemicals Ltd. at Sindri, Bihar and Hindustan Chemicals ,and
Fertilizers Ltd. at Nangal, Punjab. These two companies began production
in 1948 and 1961, respectively. The Corporation's authorized share copital
at present is Rs 2,000 million (US$275 million) with Rs 1,375 nillion in
1/   All years refer to fiscal years ending March 31.



-2-
shares outstanding and paid in, all owned by GOI. FCI is the largest pro-
ducer of fertilizer in India with 30% of nitrogen and 10% of phosphate
capacity. Given FCI's large expansion program, its market share will grow
substantially through the 1970's. a1
2.02      The operating units (or divisions) are (1) Trombay, (2) Nangal,
(3) Gorakhpur, (4) Sindri and (5) Namrup. Another division, Planning and
Development (1 & D), is responsible for engineering, research and develop-
ment.  In addition, the Corporation has several major projects under con-
struction: (1) Durgapur, (2) Barauni, (3) Namrup Expansion, (4) Ramagundam,
(5) Talcher, (6) Sindri Rationalization, (7) Corakhpur Expansion, 2/ (8)
Haldia, and (9) Korba. Three other projects are being actively considered
by FCI, namely (1) Nangal Expansion - the sublect of this report - (2) Trombay
Expansion, and (3) Sindri Expansion. These divisions and projects are de-
scribed in Annex 2-2 including capacities and capital costs. After cempletion
of the expansion program in the late 1970's, FCI will have an installed fer-
tilizer capacity of about 2.2 million TPY of N and 0.4 million TPY of phosphate
(P?0'/ and should then be one of the largest fertilizer companies in the world.
2.03      Exlsting employment of the Corporation is approximately 19,000
people; this is high even recognizirg that this figure includes not only
operating personnel but also ancillary employment for company-operated
schools, hospitals, town.hips and trainirg programs at each factory.
B.   FCI Management
2.04      FCI is managed by a 12-member Board of Directors of which five
are senior officers of FCI, three are from Government mi;uistries, two from
government-owned corporations and two from other industries (Annex 2-3).
The present Chairman of the Board is Mr. H. N. Sethna and the Managing
Director is Dr. K. R. Chakravorty. The Board is designed to function as a
policy-making and controlling body and as a liaison and coordinating group
between FCI and the Government. The influence of GOI on operations, finance
and expansion planning is felt strongly in the Corporation's management.
2.05      The Managing Director and four Functional Directors (Production
and Marketing, Project, Finance, and Personnel) direct the Corporation's
overall policy, growth and daily operations through a "Committee of Manage-
ment." 3/ These officers, who are also on the Board, in effect are selected
by GOI although formally they are appointed bv the Board. The Functional
I/   A more detailed description of the Corporation is shown in Annex 2-1.,
'/   Partly financed by an IDA Credit of US$10 million (Credit No. 279 - IN,
dated December 22, 1971).
I/  An organization chart of the Corporation is shown in Annex 2-4.

Directors' posts are now filled by men with substaratial industrial experi-
ence in FCI. Improvement in corporate management &iince the IDA mission in
June/July 1969 is evident, but, furtheL improvement is needed. f
2.06      Each unit is managed as a separate cost center and day-to-day
p:oduction functions are controlled by the Unit General Managers. FC'.
senior management is aware of the continuing problems it faces in correct-
ing deficiencies in operation and project implementation. These have serl-
ously burdened management and financial results.  The Cor,,ration's future
will depend on the extent to which these deficiencies are overcom,e. The
large expansion program has created a need for a breat number o- experienced
staff at the higher middle management level for both the execution of pro-
jects and their operation. Filling these positions with qualified personnel
and improving iPS organization to implement new projects effectively, is one
of the biggest challenges currently facing FCI's senior management. The in-
crease in operating activity and sales volume, resulting from great expan-
sion projects expected to be completed during the forthcoming years, will
also require better management techniques, especially financial reporting
and planning and the buildup of a more efficient marketing system in certain
areas.

2.08      FCI has been profitable in all but one year since 1961 but its
earnings have been unsatisfactory. During the period 1968-72 net profits
averaged 3% of sales and represented an average of about 1.5% return on capi-
tal employed. This poor showing is caused by the operating losaes of several
units as well as the considerable construction delays in implementing new
proJects. Production (in terms of N) averaged about 70% of design capacity
over the past five years (Annex 2-7). Considering individual existing plants,
the losses at Sindri (Rs 34 million in 1972), the Corporation's oldest and by
now largely obsolete plant, have particularly affected FCI's financial re-
sults and offset the favorable development of other plants. Sindri's per-
formance cannot be expected to improve substantially in the forthcoming two
years until a modernization project, now being implemented, is completed.
Production performance of the other FC1 plants in general has improv'- over
the past years. At Nanga] performance has deteriorated d*ie to a power short-
age which is beyond FCI's control.  Trombay and Namrup, which commenced op-
erations in 1966 and 1970 respectively, have improved to about 70% capacity
utilization in the past year and Trombay's performance has further improved
during the current year.
2.09      Additional to FCI's difficulties in overcoming operational problems
in the existing plants is the likelihood of similar problems in the large-
scale plants, shortly nearing completion (Durgapur, Barauni, Namrup), each
more than two years behind schedule. Even assuming satisfactory oroduction
levels after start-up, the financial burden of lost production and capital
cost overruns due to delays are seriously affecting FCI's financial per-
formance theagh all costs -- mainly financed wi'2l funds from  OI -- are
capitalized until the projects operate commercially. The estimated produc-
tion losses in 1972 from the under-utilization of existing plants (below
90a' of designed capacity) equal about 85,000 tons of nitrogen and those of
the three large projects which are seriously delayed an additional 400,000
tons equivalent to an estimated import value of about US$65 million. To
further illustrate the costliness of Gelays and under-utilized capacity, an
assumed proiect with an estimated 15;' rate of return over its life would find
this return virtually eliminated if there was a two year delay in completion
combined with a 10% cost overrun or a zero return if the plant would continue
to operate at about 70%1 of capacity. Recently both the Government and FCI
have become increasingly aware of this problem and are taking definite steps
for overcoming it. Also IDA has specifically structured the fertilizer
projects it is helping to finance to minimize these deficiencies.
2.10      Income projections for the Corporation (Annex 2-6) show net losses
for the next two years, mainly because of expected start-up losses for new
plants.  Thereafter, FCI should have stead.ly increasing earnings but their
levels will largely depend on the operating performance of the three new
large plants (Durgapur, Barauni, Namrup) and -- though to a lesser extent --
to increased capacity utilization in the existing factories. The forecasts
are based on assumptions for capacity attainmen' (Anaex 2-8) and new project
implementation schedules, that, although reasonable, may prove optimistic
based on FCI's past record unless GOI and FCI effectively resolve FCI's
current problems and follow a sound plan of further growth which does not



-6-
overtax the Coporation's resources. Since FCI intends to increase its pro-
durtion fourfold by 1979 from its present level, the importance of FCI's
expansion program for its future financial position as well as for the fer-
tilizer production in India becomes obvious. Also in view of FCI's respon-
sibilities to optimize the use of its human, technical and capital resources,
it should concentrate its efforts even more to overcome the difficulties en-
countered in the implementation of current projects and operations and not
consider further expansion projects until these difficulties will have been
largely overcome. In preparing its fertilizer program for the Fifth Five-
Year Plan (April 1, 1974 - March 31, 1979) the Government is now systemat-
ically studying the broader issues connected with it, including the organ-
izational and management structure of the public sector. The Association
will have an opportunity to discuss the issues with the Government within
the next 'ew months.

2.12      Historical balance sheets show that FCI has been financed on a
sound basis with a present debt/equity ratio of about 40:60 (Annex 2-11).
As a rule GOI at present finances FCI's projects 50% by debt and 50% by
equity after consideration of cash surpluses of existing operations on a



-7-
corporate basis. The fi::ed assets of FCI show the large amount for projects
under construction (about Rs. 1.5 billion) as compared to a net value of the
existing plants of about Rs 1.1 billion.  Total capital costs for the projects
under construction (Annex 2-2) are estimated at about Rs 5.6 billion (US$770
million) and for the projects under consideration at Rs 2.2 billion (US$290
million).
2.13      With low profits and high debt service obligations, partly caused
by the delayed projects under construction, FCI would have difficulties as
an independent company in meeting its debt service out of its own resources
in the forthcoming year. However, since the Corporation's debt/equity ratio
is low, the debt service ratio is expected to imprnve rapidly in future years
even if FCI does not fully achieve the projected pro.its (Annex 2-12).
2.14      During negotiations, assurances were obtained that GOI will provide
the necessary funds to FCI to meet its financial obligations, particularly
to maintain a current ratio of FCI of at least 1.2:1 and not declare dividends
or prepay any of its debt to GOI or others if such payments would reduce its
current ratio below 1.5:1, as already stated in the IDA Development Credit
for FCIts Gorakhpur fertilizer plant expansion.
III.     NANGAL'S EXISTINC. OPERATIONS
A.   Production Facilities
3.01      The present Nangal Unit, which began production !n 1961, has a
design capacity of 100,000 TPY of ammonia (310 TPD) based on the electrol-
ysis of water (Annex 3-1). The ammonia is converted first to nitric acid
and then to CAN, a rather low nutrient fertilizer (25% of N as compared to
46% of N in urea) with a capacity of 80,000 TPY N. The electrolysis of
water consumes a large amount of power (149 FW) and uses no natural gas or
petroleum feedstock as do most modern ammonia plants. The plant contains
all necessary ancillary facilities such as maintenance shops, storage, power
and steam facilities, offices and township; it is located on the Sutlej River
near the Bakhra Dam in Punjab State. Transportation and distribution facil-
ities in that area are well developed.
3.02      Heavy water (14,000 kg per year design), which is used in the
atomic energy industry, is also produced from the hydrogen gas following
electrolysis. All hydrogen (about 19,000 TPY) passes through the heavy
water plant, but only a negligible fraction (2.5 TPY) is removed xnd con-
verted to heavy water.  The remaining hydrogen is processed into ammonia.
3.03      Except for the electrolysis and heavy water sections, the Nangal
factory represents conventional and commercially accepted technology (Annex
3-1) although production units are small by today's standardis. Tne Nangal
plant has always been operated and mnaintained well.  Top management, recent-
ly changed, is complemented by good middle management. No serious labor
problems have been experienced at Nangal in recent years.

-9-
3.05      From 1964-1970 Nangal operated on average at 95% of capacity
reaching 100% in 1970 and generated average net annual income of Rs 23
million (US$3.2 million), or approximately 11% return on capital and 20%
on sales. Production was down to about 70% in 1971 and 1972 due to power
shortage (para. 3.07) but profits were still satisfactory, averaging Rs
24 million per year, as compared to Rs 36 million during the three previ-
ous years. As enlarged upon below, the relatively high earnin-s are due
to the low power rates Nangal has been paying. During the 1968-1972
period Nangal accounted for about 25% of the Corporation's nutrient sales.
3.06      Although continuing power shortages would not allow plant utiliza-
tion to rise above 70% over extended periods, projected income statements
show satisfactory profits mainly because the plant will be almost fully de-
preciated in 1973. Nangal has no outstanding long-term debt; with result-
ing low capital charges, the profit and cash break-even points after 1973
will be about 44% of capacity 1/.
C.   Availability and Costs of Power
3.07      The existing Nangal plant consumes about 164 W  of power at full
capacity, 149 S. in the ammonia section alone. The original decision for
choosing this power-intensive process to produce ammonia, was based on the
ample availability of hydro-power in North India at prices which economically
and financially justified the process at the time Nangal was built (Annex 3-5
Subsequently, the supply and demand situation has changed, power demand has
increased and generating cost of new facilities has gone up substantially.
3.08      Nangal has not only been experiencing power shortages since 1971
which have severely limited production (para. 3.04), but from 1966 onward
has had to pay power prices above those stipulated in the original 25 year
contract; further increases are under discussion. At present, Nangal is
paying Rs 23/MWH (3.1 US mi'ls/KWH) 2/ based on a renegotiated contract as
at January 1971. The normal rate for large industrial coLLsumers in the
area is Rs 84/MWH.
3.09      The future power shortage for Nangal is a function of supply as well
as of cost. The cost of supplying power to Nangal is estimated to be about
Rs 40/MWH from new hydro facilities and about Rs 95/kWH from thermal plants,
the latter also being considered the economic cost of power (..nnex 3-5). If
Nangal could afford to pay the regular rate for industrial consumers (Rs 84/.MWH)
it could probably obtain its full power requirements relatively easily; but
Nangal could only pay about double its present power rate (or about Rs 40-
45/WMH), before incurring losses, even with its almost fully depreciated
plant. At present Nangal, therefore, is receiving highly subsidized~ power
in both financial and economic terms.
1/   Detailed historical balance sheets and source and application of funds
statements for Nangal are shown in Annexes 3-3 and 3-4.
2/   Quoted power prices exclude 25% excise tax levied against all consumers.



- 10 -
3.10      In view of the changed power situation, continued use of the
power-intensive process of producing ammonia in the existing Nangal plant
is neither financially nor economically viable. However, the likelihood of
GOI and FCI shutting down the plant is remote, because of the urgent need
for fertilizer and the existence of a trained labor force plus supporting in-
frastructure. Hence, closing the uneconomic part of the existing plant can
only be realized in combination with a new project that includes replacement
of the ammonia section.
IV.     FERTILIZER MARKET AND MARKETING
4.01      Past and future developments of fertilizer demand and supply in
India and especially in Nangal's marketing area as well as the major fac-
tors, including fertilizer pricing policies, that have contributed to these
developments are discussed in detail in Annex 4. The Annex also contains
an international comparison in fertilizer consumption (Annex 4-1).
A.   Past Fertilizer Growth in India
4.02      For many years, Indian fertilizer consumption has greatly exceeded
domestic supplies of nitrogen (N); phosphorus (P205); and potassium (K20).
This situation continues and deficits are met by imports as shown in the
following table:

Virtually no potassium fertilizer salts are produced in India; K20 consump-
tion is mostly in the form of imported potash and NPK compound fertilizers.
In the last 10 years, consumption of N, P205 and K20 increased sevenfold,
ninefold and eightfold respectively. For many applications tbroughout the
world preferred N:P205:K20 ratios are in the 4:2:1 category and on this basis
insufficient amounts of phosphate and potash have, in general, been used.

demand forecasts cannot readily be made on the basis of historical projec-
tions because of irregular previous patterns. Indicated figures correspond
to likely future attempts to bring P205 and K20 consumption more in line
with the previously mentioned, desirable 4:2:1 nutrient balance. Phosphate
production includes ground rock and other products of indigenous origins.
4.04      The nitrogen demand projectior. assumes nitrogen consumption will
grow at 20% compounded annually to 1974 and at 11.7% subsequently. Annex
4-2 shows how demand is expected to develop in each of the four major re-
gions in India. The production estimate was made by IDA using information
obtained from GOI; Annex 4-2 also shows individual plant contributions and
the expectation that FCI's contribution to the domestic production of N
will increase from 30Z in 1970 to 56Z in 1979. Average annual compound
growth rate is 28% to 1974 and 17.5% thereafter, based on optimistic but
attaiinable start-up schedules and operating performances of new projects.
Should these goals nit be met, production could be 10% to 20% less. While
precise forecasts canmot he made, substantial nitrogen fertilizer production
shortages are indicated tlhroughout the period 1972 to 1979. In this period,
anticipated urea production will rise from about 60% to 74% in terms of total
N reflecting its popul.rity in terms of results and lowest delivered nitrogen
cost.

C.   Fertilizer Markets in Northern India
4.05      Fertilizer consumption per unit of cropped area is much greater
in Punjab than in all India, as the following comparison for 1970 shows:
Kg per Hectare
N        P205       K20        Total
Punjab               28.4       4.1        1.2        33.7
All India             8.7       2.6        1.3        12.6
In both cases low application rates for P205 and K20 are evident compared
to the generally advisable 4:2:X balance and greater amounts of phosphorus
and potassium will be needed in the future as these elenents are gradually
removed from the soil by intensive cropping. Because CAN and urea are
the only materials under consideration for Nangal, thib report will cover
in detail only nitrogen fertilizers.
4.06      The main marketing area for the Nangal plant is Punjab, Haryana,
Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir states, plus Delhi and parts of
Rajasthan. Due to present supply limitations, about 80% of Nangal's pro-
duction (CAN) is sold in Punjab and Haryana. As reviewed in Annex 4-3,
these states represent one of the most advanced farming regions in India;
while comprising only 6% of the national area under foodgrains, they
produce 10% of the nation's corresponding crops.
4.07      The demand-supply forecast for nitrogen fertilizer for northern
India is shown in greater detail in Annex 4-2. Projections for 1972-1979
including possibly available shipments from other regions (except: the dis-
tant southern states) are:
Demand-Supply Balance for Nitrogen Fertilizer in Northern Iodia
(1,000 tons N)
Fiscal Years         1972       1975       1976       1977       1978      1979
Demand                350        570        630        690        760       840
Supply                170        170        205        280        300       320

4.08      It is unlikely that all projected apparent surpluees in the east
and west regions would ever be shipped to the north; however, even if they
were, a shortage equivalent to two additional large urea plants would still
persimt an ihowi in Antiex 4-4.  Accordingly, no problems in selling Nangal
uroa are foreseen.

D.   Nangal Marketing System
4.09      FCI has recently establislei tour mar'leting zotons [UgiOU  InJla.
Each is responsible for promotion, publicity and market research, and all are
coordinated at hcad office level under guidance from FCI's Director of Produc-
tion and Marketing in New Delhi.
1.   Transport and Storage
4, 10     Both rail and road haulage are used between the plant and main
distribution centers; good roads enable 34% of present CAN production to
be moved via truck compared to a national average of 20% for fertilizer.
Well-developed railroads also exist and the Ministry of Railways has assured
FCI and IDA that corresponding facilities ;o accommodate additional raw ma-
terials a,d products after expansion will be provided on tim.e.  Extra traffic
will only amount to three trains daily and no problems are fcreseen. Fer-
tilizer consumption in Nangal's marketing area if; fairly unifarm throughout
the year because of double cropping and crop variety. Also, distribution
and discount systems used by co-ops and private dealers have helped FCI
avoid storing large tonnages in less-active months. Ample additional fac-
tory storage (20,000 tons) will be installed, and adequate extra co-op and
dealer capacity is available.
2.   Distribution Networks
4.11      In Punjab and Haryana, fertilizers reach farmers via two distribu-
tion networks: co-ops and private dealers. Competition between these two
groups is more related to obtaining material to sell than price reduction
and is likely to remain so. FCI's policy is to make equal quanttites avail-
able to both and to limit each private dealer to 500 tons annually.
3.   Credit Facilities
4.12      Fertilizers handled "y co-ops and private cealers are sold to
various groups ranging from large commercial estates to very low-Income
cultivators. Recently, steps have been taken by GOI to provide appropri-
ate credit facilities to all levels of the agricultural community parti-
cularly low-income groups whose coaly previous recourse was the village
money lender. Now, farmers can obtain loans from two major sources:
state banks and co-op "banks" or lending agencies. Similarly, additional
credit facilities have been extended to the growing number of pr-.vate
dealers. Such available financing facilities will help to ensure tnat sales
of Nangal urea will not be re-.tricted by payment problems, especially as
much of the market lies in the well-developed States of Punjab and Haryana
where farmers are relatively prosperous and purchase a subscantial proportion
of their agricultural requirements with cash.

4.   Urea Pricing
4.13      In principle, Indian fertilizer producers have a certain freedom
to establish their own prines but in practice for various reasons this is
very limited. For example, in addition to maximum consumer prices being set
by GOI, prices need to be at leve1.E that provide worthwhile returns to dis-
tributors and dealers. Although prices and pricing policies have not been
finally established for Nangal urea, they will probably correspond to those
now prevailing for FCI, as shown below (Nangal's financial projections are
based on this assumption).

V.     THE NANGAL EXPANSION PROJECT
A.   Project Scope
5.01      The proposed project will add 330,000 TPY urea capacity (1,000
TPD) to the existing Nangal facilities and also produce additional ammonia
(300 TPD) to replace the present power-intensive ammonia plant. Replace-
ment of the existing ammonia plant is a significant part of the expansion
project since power availability and prices in North India do not justify --
financially and economically -- the continued use of this power-intensive
process (para. 3.07 and Annex 3-5).
5.02      The new ammonia unit will have a total capacity of 300,000 TPY
(900 TPD) and will utilize heavy fuel oil as a raw material. The plant
designs and proposed capacities represent efficient and commercially proven
technology including use of centrifugal compressor& in the ammonia plant 1/.
The project also includes some additional offsite facilities such as util-
ities and raw material and product storage. However, many services presently
available, such as workshops, laboratory, offices and township, will not need
to be expanded. The project will be located within the boundaries of the
present Nangal factory.
1/   A schematic flowsheet of the expansion project and existing facilities
is shown in Annex 5-1.



- 15 -
B.   Project Description
5.03      Anmonia production will be based on the partial oxidation of heavy
fuel oil. Several processing steps are required, which arr> described in Annex
5-2 and are summarized below together with the relevant process licensors.
Air Separation Plant            -    To be bi.1 internationl1ly
Partial Oxidation               -    Shell (Netherlands)
Sulfur Removal                  -    Lurgi (F.R. of Germany'
Shift Conversion                -    FCI (India) and Lurgi kF.R. o
Germany)
C2 Removal                     -    Lurgi (F.R. of Germany)
Nitrogen Wash                   -    To be bid inzernationially
Ammonia Synthesis               -    Uhde (F.R. of Germany)/Topsoe
(Denmark)
The use of Shell and Lurgi licensed processes, with which FCI has had p-ev-
ious experience, and the Shift Conversion step by FCI are oased on utilization
of FCI engineering and know-how. The ammonia contractor, Ulde (Germany) who
was chosen after international bidding, will use its own anmonia synthesis
technology in conjunction with Haldor Topsoe.
5.04      The ammonia plant will be a single train unit with the exception
of Partial Oxidation which will require three units and Air Separation which
may require two units.
5.05      The urea plant will he based on the Montedison (Italy) design and
partly represents an extension of an existing license dgreement betwee.A
Montedison and FCI for supply of urea technology. The urea design is con-
ventional; total recycle technology being based on an operating plant in
the Netherlands, and will be a single unit. A similar plant, incorporating
two 500 [I'D units, is part of FCI's Durgapur and FACT's Cochin plan.s -hich
are nearing completion.
C.   Raw Materials and Utilities
5.06      The principal raw material required is heavy fuel cii wbizh will be
purchased through Indian Oil Corporation from a refinery that is to be bui't
near Delhi, some 200 rail km from the Nangai plant and presently ?xpected to
be completed in late 1977 (some two years after the scheduled completion of
the project). However, the ammonia plant will be designed to process any
liquid hydrocarbon material. Initially, fuel oil will be supplied from an
existing refinery (also owned by Indian Oil) in barauni (Bihar) or will be
imported and will be transported to Nangal in heated cank cars.  To confirm
the understanding that sufficient feedstock and rolling stock will be avail-
able to meet the requirements of the expanded plants it was agreed to during
negotiations that FCI will enter into satisfactory arrangements wi,h Indian
Oil and the Railway Authorities.



- 16 -
5.07      The major utilities required e:e power, coal and water.  About 30
MW of power will be needed, which will be supplied by Punjab Scate Electri-
city Board (PSEB) from Bhakra at a normal industrial rate of 84 Rs/MWH.
Since Nangal will release about 149 MW of power utilized by the existing unit
(at full capacity) and because of Nangal's proximity to the power generatir.g
source (20 Km), no power supply problems are anticipated at Nangal. However,
FCI has been asked to enter into satisfactory arrangements with PSEB for its
power requirements.
5.08      Coal, required for steam generation, will be transported by rail
from existing coal mines in-Bihar and Madhya Pradesh. No supply difficulty
is anticipated and FCI has been a3ked to obtain satisfactory contracts with
the coal suppliers. Water, for both process and cooling uses will be obtaiaed
from the adjacent Sutlej River. Ample supply is available and no problem is
anticipated.
D.   Employment
5.09      About 3,800 people (including about 1,200 for township and general
services) are currently employed at Nangal and this number will not increase
substantially after expansion. Operators from phased-out units will be em-
ployed in the new plant. Provision has been made in cost calculations for
an additional 200 employees to handle increased quantities of raw materials
and products, and also to undertake any additional maintenance and yard work.
During plant construction, civil works labor needs are estimated to be about
5,000 man years, equivalent to some 2,500 workers over a two year period.
5.10      The Nangal expansion will also create incremental indirect employ-
ment in the coal, oil, bag-making and transportation industries but this is
difficult to measure. Urea distribution and sales will require incremental
labor and clerical help of about 300 extra dealers plus perhaps 1,000 part-
time distributors. In addition, it is likely that about half of these num-
bers will be required to distribute and sell via the co-op organizations.
E.   Ecology
5.11      The effect of a modern ammonia-urea plant on its environment is
minimal, and in the case of the Nangal project, no appreciable amounts of
harmful wastes will be discharged. The plant will use a high sulfur fuel
oil but the project includes desulfurization and sulfur recovery facilities.
About 6,600 TPY elemental sulfur will be recovered, as a saleable product,
which represents about 99.5% of the initial sulfur feed. No ammonia would
be discharged to the atmosphere except for accidental spills or leaks which
are an uncommon occurrence.
5.12      Liquid effluents can contain a small amount of absorbed ammonia,
and this would be neutralized before discharging to the Sutlej River, The
downstream use of the river is primarily for irrigationi, with no lakes so
there is no possibility of a build-up of nitrogen. In any case, the quan-
tity of nitrogen is so small that the quality of water is not affected.
Urea solids (as a fine dust) are a potential effluent but scrubbing equip-
ment is to be installed to recover urea which is a valuable product. The
ecological facilities included in the project are estimated to cost about
US$2 million equivalent, or about 2% of total project costs.

VI. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCiAL PLAN
A.   Capital Costs
6.01      Total investment costs for the project are estimated to be Rs 732
million (US$100 million). Total financing required for the project, including
Rs 37 million (US$5 million) for interest during construction, is Rs 769 mil-
lion (US$105.6 million), broken down as follows (detailed evaluation of coat

6.0      These estimates were prepared by FCI in cooperation with the con-
tractors based on their recent experience with similar projects; they assume
a construction period of 34 months and include reserves for physical contin-
gencies equivalent to 10% of equipment, civil works and working capital costs
and anothcr 10% for price escalation. These capital costs are considered
reasonable.

6.03       The expected foreign exchange costs of US$57 million are based. on
4% of equipment belng re arved for Irdian procurement and the expectation
that Indian suppliers will win 10% of the remaining equipment, all to be bid
internationallv (except US$2.2 million proprietary equipment). The foreign
exchange costs would in^rcr.se to U'S$58 million or drop to US$55 million were
Indian supn-iitrs tc Win raspectively 5i  or 20% of the intcrnationally procured

6.07      Existing Nangal has generated attout Ka 3't) mtIlln if vi.li :UIu ice
depreciation and earning since 1961. Cash generation during the co.istruction
period of the project (1974-1976) is estimated at about Rs 40 milliorn (after
consideration of notional taxes). According to the practice of COI-owi.ed
companies, Nangal's cash surpluses have been transferred to FCI;s head office
and, in turn, any corporate surplus from FCI has been zransferred to GO1.
Therefore, Nangal's generated cash, cannot be reused for the financirZ ' the
expansion project, and the equity of the expansion project of US$47.6 million
equivalent will be provided by GOI as new equity.
6.08      The Government would on-lend the proceeds of the IDA credit to
FCI as a loan for 15 years, from the date of etfectiveness of 6he credit,
including a 5 year period of grace and repayment ir. iO equal annual ins .all-
ments, at an interest rate of 8.5%. These terms are similar to those applied
to the recent IDA credits for the Cochin II and Gorakhpur fertilize; expan-
sion projects. The credit proceeds would be denominated in rupees, and the
exchange risk would remain with GOI.
6.09      To protect against an unexpected overrun in project costs (both
foreign exchange and local costs) GOl will provide additional funds as neces-
sary to complete the project.
D.   Allocation of the IDA Credit
6.10      Froceeds of the IDA credit woild be used as follows:
Allocation of IDA. Credit

58.)
6.11      The IDA credit will cover CIF costs of all imported equipment ('n-
cluding US$2.2 million proprietary equipment) and ex-factory irice (excluding
taxes) of locally procured equipment that is internationallv bid. It will
also include total foreign exchange costs of process licenaes and cousultants'
services and a portion of FCI's local costs for engineering and equipnent
erection. The project's foreign exchange content is about US$57 million as
discussed in para. 6.03.  Any unused portion of the crediL will be reallo-
cated by the Association to FCI's local expenditures for engineering and
equipment erection. Projected disbursement schedule for tne IDA credit is
given in Annex 6-3.

VII.     PROJECT EXECUTION
A.   Project Management and Execution
7.01      Difficulties experienced by FCI in undertaking projects within
originally established time and cost limits have been mentioned previously
(para. 2.14). The relatively small urea expansion and debottleneckin- proj-
ect at Gorakhpur (financed by IDA in 1971) has, as expected, not imposed a
strain on the Company's engineering or management resources. hiowever, the
proposed large ammonia and urea project at Nangal is of much greater magni-
tude. Accordingly, to reduce the corresponding additional workload for FCI,
GOI, FCI and IDA have agreed that the contractors chosen to supply the am-
monia and urea processes will respectively be given major responsibility for
executing substantial parts of the project. Also FCI has appointed an ex-
perienced Project Manager, with adequate responsibilities as well as quali-
fied senior engineering staff. FCI has been asked to consult with IDA be-
fore changing the Nangal general manager or the project manager.
7.02      'rhe Planning and Development Division (P & D) of FCI will act as
overall prime contractor for the project. Design, and erection supervision
of the ammonia plant will be subcontracted to Uhde and similar responsibil-
ities for the urea plant subcontracted to Montedison. Uhde was selected via
international bidding by FCI in consultation with IDA. Montedison was com-
mitted to the project before IDA involvement and undertook the design a.nd
engineering of the FCI urea plant at Durgapur. This has not yet come on
stream, because the ammonia plant is delayed; however, the urea process is
operating successfullv elsewhere.
7.03      P & D staff at Sindri will undertake as much detailed engineering
work as possible on the ammonia and urea units under the guidance of Uhde
and Montedison specialists. Simultaneously, specialized design work will be
performed in the offices of Uhde and Montedison at Dortrund, and Milan respec-
tively, assisted by selected FCI personnel. If it becomes evident that FCI's
staff at Sindri cannot meet planned deadlines, the balance of work will promptly
be moved to Dortmund or Milan. Uhde and Montedison have agreed to accept
responsibility for completing design and detailed engineering on time, in-
cluding all such work undertaken by FCI staff on the ammonia and urea units.
Offsite design and all field conetruction will be undertaken by FCI with the
assistance of proven subcontractors. Specialists from Uhde and Montedison
will supervise the erection of the ammonia and urea units and subsequent
start up, running-in and guarantee tests.
B.   Project Scheduling, Procurement and Contractor's Guarantees
7.04      In consultation with Uhde and Montedison, FCI has prepared a de-
tailed project schedule network and a project implementation plan. 1/ These
1/   A summarized implementation schedule is shown in Annex 7.

show respectively the critical timing ot all major activitius  .,nd Lhe resiukl-
sibilities for project execution and management within FCI asd berween FCI and
the contractors.  Both documents have been reviewed by IDA and founo realistic.
7.05      The starting date of the project will be January 15, 1973.  It i:;
anticipated that completion will require 34 months and comiercial production
will commence in December, 1975. Project scheduling snd cost conLrol will be
the responsibility of FCI, but Uhde and Montedison will act. in 1 consulting
role to assure completion on time and within the calculated budget. Tirae and
cost controls will be maintaince by computer-aided critical path procedures
operated separately by FCI anc the contractorb.
7.06      Equipment procurement responsibility will be shared between FCI,
tThae and Montedison. Criticai, long delivery and proprietary itens will be
tendered, evaluated and expedited from Dortmund and Milani buz purchased ,rom
FCI, Delhi.  Procurement will be aid-d by an agreement letween GOI and IDA
that all necessary import licenses w7ill be promptly issued and processed.
Assurances have been givien by GOI that any item orcered in India that is
delayed unreasonably can be procured itmnediately from other countries to
avoid possible adverse effects on project completion. As FCI is now familiar
with. IDA procedures; procurement should proceed without difficulty.
7.07      Uhde and Montedison have each agreed to furnish P & D withi complete
design and purchasing data within specified periods.  Failure -o meet chese
deadlines will subject the contractors to penalty paymnents. Also, plant
performance guarantees in terms of capacity, product quality and utility
requirements have been obtained from the contractors, partiy in conjunction
with the process licensors, furnishing key sections of the ammonla plant
(Shell, Lurgi, Haldor-Topsoe). inability to meet these performances will
subject contractors and licensors to penalties if adjustments made in tlle
field at their expense prove ineffective.
VIII.     FINANCIAL ANALYSIS OF THE PtQO.ECT
A.   Revenues and Operating Costs
8.01      Revenues and opeL-ting costs for the modified exf.sting facilicies
and proposed expansion project are shown in Annexes 8-1 and 8-2.
8.02      A comparison of revenues and costs for Nangal before and after ex-
pansion (Annex 8-1) shows that production at the unchanged existing facilities
would be more expensive than after modification even with a fully depreciated
plant and the present low power rate. Assuming the present rate for power
were to double (Annex 3-5) profits for existing Nangai would, as rLientioned
previously, almost disappear, even at an increased capacity utilization of
90%.



- 22 -
8.03      Marginal labor costs for the expansion project are low, since there
is some overstaffing in the existing plant and many of its labor-intensive
activities (e.g. repair shop, township facilities, etc.) will not need to
be expanded. The other cost items are directly related to output and were
allocated to the CAN and urea plants to show the approximate costs of pro-
ducing each product.
8.04      Raw materials necessary to supply the operations of the expansion
project are desLribed in Chapter V and their prices are shown in Annex 8-3.
Fertilizer prices in India are high compared to other countries (Annex 4-1)
but they are necessary to partly offset high duties and taxes on capital and
operating costs. Total Indian duties and taxes on imported equipment alone
amount to about 11% of Na'igal's total project tnsts (30% on imported equip-
ment). Resulting increased capital charges from these duties on a per ton
of finished product (urea) basis are estimated at about Rs 28 (US$3.8).
B.   Feedstock Costs
8.05      The main difference in raw materials and operating costs as com-
pared to international standards results from high feedstock costs; costs
for other main input materials, such as coal and bags are in line with inter-
national prices. Costs for fuel oil or naphtha as feedstock substantially
exceed costs of natural gas, which is readily available for fertilizer pro-
ducers in some countries but not in India. Naphtha, now the feedstock of
most of the modern urea plants in India, is in short supply and will partly
have to be imported in the future. Accordingly, it is now GOI policy to base
future ammonia production on alternative feedstock such as heavy-fuel oil or
coal. Nangal will have the first heavy-fuel based ammonia plant in India.
GOI has recertly adjusted heavy fuel oil prices to make lheavy fuel based
fertilizer .roduction at Nangal competitive with that based on naphtha, also
taking into account higher investment costs (about 10% of total project costs)
for heavy-fuel oil process.
C.   Financial Forecasts
8.06      Forecasted Income Statements for the Nangal Unit before and after
expansion given in Annexes 3-2 and 8-1, are summarized below: 1/
1/   1972 figures are actual and 1973-1976 figures are forecasted for exist-
ing Nangal Unit. Construction of the Expansion Project starts in 1973
but income statements of the Nangal Unit will onl. be affected from the
stArt of commercial production of the Expansion Project in December
1975.

(para. 3.04).

/3   See Annex 8-2 for the incremental effect of the expaasion and Annex 8-3
for assumptions on revenues and costs.
8.07      The Forecasted Income Statements are based on the assumption that
the existing electrolysis plant will be phased out in December 1975, whlen the
new facilities start operations. The forecasts show incremental profits from
the expansion project even in the first operating year, and at full capacity
Nangal's total profits before taxes are expected to be four times Nangal's
present profits.
8.08      Taxes are difficult to take into consideration for the Nangal unit
itself since income taxes are paid only on a corporate basis. FCI has not
paid any income taxes due to low profits as well as tax holidays and exclu-
sions related to expansion projects. Since capital expenditures resulting
in tax holidays will continue at least until 1979, the Corporation will
have substantial tax exclusions which exceed projected profits over the next
years. Thereafter taxes, have been calculated on a notional basis of 55%
on the taxable income (para. 8.10) for Nangal beginaing in 1980 (Annex 8-1).



- 24 -
8.09      Projected balance sheet and cash flow statements for Nangal are
shown in Annexes 8-4 and 8-5 and are summarized on the following page.
These statements show that the project would be soundly"financed with the
Nangal unit having a debt to equity ratio of 35:65 at the end of construc-
tion. Due to the high cash generation and the low debt/equity ratio, pro-
jected debt service coverage always exceeds 2.2. The cash break-even point
of Nangal after expansion is expected to be less than 50% of capacity, where-
as the profit break-even point declines from about 60% to 50% of capacity
during the life of the project (Annex 8-6). Nangal is an operating unit of
FCI and is thus liable to have its cash surpluses transferred to head office.
However, assurances have been obtained during negotiations that Nangal should
not be called upon by FCI to transfer funds to FCI if by so doing its c :rent
ratio would fall below 1.1:1.
D.   Financial Return
8.10      The base fiaancial rate of return for the project is 18.1% before
taxes and 14.0% after taxes. 1/ The project's financial return would be
sensitive to changes in urea price, rising to 22.72 or falling to 12.6X with
price fluctuations of plus and minus 10% (Annex 9-1). A feedstock price in-
crease of 10% would reduce the return to 16.2X and a. one year start-up delay.
together with a 15% cost overrun, would lower the return to 12.0,'.  With the
exception of project completion delays and changes in the urea price, whicth
is controlled by GOI, variations in other factors are not likely to undermine
the financial viability of the expansion project.
E.   Risk
8.11      The project design is based on commercially proven technology
which should minimize technical risks with regard to design and efficient
operation. The major difficulty of projects in India, particularly in the
public sector, is in implementation. The association of the two engineer-
ing firms, Uhde and Montedison, which have major responsibility for the
Nangal project implementation including design, procurement, erection and
start-up, should reduce the risk of a project delay.
8.12      There is no appreciable commercial risk since urea is expected to
continue being in short supply in India, especially in North India, and prices
are virtually controlled by Government policy. FCI's marketing system in
North India is well developed and no problem is anticipated in selling Nangal's
production. The Nangal project itself has a high debt service coverage, al-
though FCI may experience financial difficulties over the next few years
(para. 2.10).
1/   Taxes are considered notional since income taxes are paid only on a
corporate basis (para. 8.08). Therefore financial returns in this
chapter refer to ft.iancial returns before taxes.  Detailed return
calculations before and after income taxes of 55% are shown in
Annex 9-1.

IX.     ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF THE PROJECT
A.   Urea World Market Prices
9.01      International urea prices have behaved similarly to those of many
other man-made commodities, moving from an initial high to an unrealistic
low, and then to more rational levels as oversupply diminishes. In the early
1960's some export prices for bagged urea, CIF, India, from small plants tnen
existing exceeded US$100 per ton. By 1970, corresponding prices for urea made
in plants ten times bigger had fallen in some cases to the US$55-60 range.
Recently, however, FOB prices have begun to rise and shipping rates have
fallen. In the first half of 1972, India imported 120,000 tons from '.urope
at US$56-59 FOB (US$67-69 CIF) and 270,000 tons from the Middle East at about
US$60 FOB (US$65 CIF). These recent Cir (untied) purchases reflect unusually
low freight rates, which are expected to return to higher levels. In the
latter half of the year, some contracts with untiecd funds were let in the US$75
to US$80 per ton CIF range because of generally tight markVet conditions.
9.02      Reasons for rising urea FOB prices include:  increasing natural
gas and petroleum ammonia feedstock prices, escalating plant construction
and start-up costs, and higher bag and bagging costs, as reviewed in
Annex 9-2. No major economies of scale or technical breakthroughs are fore-
seen that would appreciably reduce these costs. Recent discussions with
brokers and international e-ganizations suggest typical world urea prices,
bagged, CIF, India are likely to be at least in the US$65 to US$70 per ton
range for several years and could go US$5 per ton higher, especiaLly for
European material. In this appraisal (and for purposes of the economic
project evaluation) a conservative figure of US$65 per ton of urea, hagged,
CIF, India has been used, bearing in mind the probability of increased im-
ports from the Middle East and their correspondingly lower shipping costs.
B.   Economic Return and Competitive Position vis-a-vis Imports
9.03      Indian fertilizer factories have to use fuel oil or naphtha, and
therefore, have higher feedstock costs than plants based on natural gas, in
the United States or the Middle East. However, on the offsetting side, the
Nangal Project will make use of existing infrastructure and the new invest-
ment will also allow the economic use of existing fertilizer production ca-
pacity which is now too costly to use economically (i.e., which is now yield-
ing a negative economic rate of return). This economic loss could be eliminated,
and the overall situation improved, merely by closing down the existing facil-
ities. The whole production of the new Nangal complex, as it will stand after
the completion of the proposed project, as well as its total production costs,
can therefore, be properly attributed to the proposed project.  Thus, in a
representative full year of production, the planned investment would allow
the production of about 210,000 tons of nitrogen per year, at an annual eco-
nomic cost of US$22 million.  Assuming a c.i.f. price of US$65 per ton for urea,
the project would generate annual gross revenues of US$37 million, and net
revenues of US$15 million. Taking into account the lag before full capacity



-27-
is achieved as well as the timing of expenditures and revenues, the economic
return of the project is 14.6% (Annex 9-1). This rate is used as the base
rate of economic return in this report.
9.04      The e)isting Nangal unit is still quite profitable financially,
because of the artificially low cost of power charged to it. It is a major
advantage of the proposed project that it allows FCI to improve the economic
efficiency of its operations without depressing its financial returns. It
could well be argued that, had it not been given this opportunity, FCI would
not have felt able to close down the existing Nangal unit, because of acute
fertilizer needs and also the resulting labor disruption. If so, tihe saving
realized by closing down the existing electrolysis ammonia unit could also
be attributed to the proposed project. This would raise the project's eco-
nomic rate of return to about 22%.
9.05      The calculation of the economic return i6 based on investment and
operating costs, valued at world market prices as far as these goods are
tradeable, and on their estimated economic costs where non-tradeable local
supplies are involved (Annex 8-3). For that purpose the identifiable transfer
payments, such as excise duty and other direct or indirect taxes, were ex-
cluded from the local costs and major components of unskilled labor contained
in investment and operating costs have been evaluated at 50Z of the nominal
wage rate.
9.06      Sensitivity Analysis of the project for the base case (para. 9.03)
was performed using different assumptions as to the economic costs and bene-
fits of the most significant and uncertain factors: urea import price, feed-
stock price and costs of investment (Annexes 9-1 and 9-3). As usual, the
return is sensitive to revenue changes, to changes in feedstock prices, and
to cost overruns and delays in completion, which have been a serious problem
in India. Under the pessimistic assumption of an import price of urea of
US$60/ton CIF India, the project would still yield a return of 11%. Under
the very adverse circumstances of a construction cost overrun of 15% combined
with one year's delay in project completion, the return would still be 8.8%.
Charts of the sensitivities to different price assumptions for urea are shown
in Annex 9-3.
C.   Foreign Exchange Aspects
9.07      Net foreign exchange savings for the project are estimated at
about US$13 million per year at 90% of capacity (Annex 9-4).
X. RECOMMENDATIONS
10.01     During credit negotiations, agreement was reached between the
Government, FCI and IDA on the following principal points:



- 28 -
(i)  COI will provide Rs 769 million in financing for the
project including US$53 million (Rs 422 million) in IDA
funds that will be relent to FCI by GOI. Terms for the
credit proceeds to FCI will be 8.5% interest per annum
to be amortized over ten years after a grace period of
five years. The balance of funds required for the proj-
ect, Rs 347 million, will be provided by GOI as equity
funds (paras. 6.05 and 6.08).
(ii) GOI will provide additional funds (for both foreign ex-
change and local currency costs) as necessary to complete
the project as part of COI's normal lending program to
FCI for capital spending (para. 6.09).
(iii) GOI Will assure a sound fip3ncial position for FCI. This
particularly includes maint'aining a current ratio for FCI
of 1.2:1 and a debt/equity ratio of at least 50:50. FCI
will not declare a dividend or pre-pay any of its debt to
GOT or othiers if such payment would reduce its current
ratio below 1.5:1 (para. 2.12).
(iv)  GOI will promptly issue import licenses as required. and
promptly shift to international procurement aniy itenms to
be procured in India whiclh would adversely affect the
project (para. 7.06).
(v)  GOI and FCI will agree to carry out the project according
to its critical path schedule (paras. 7.02 and 7.04).
(vi)  FCI has appointed a project manager who shall be fully
responsible for project execution, budget, and schedule.
FCI has submitted to IDA at the tine of negotiations a
detailed plan of project implementation delineating the
duties and responsibilities of the unit General Manager,
the Project rfanager and P & D and the ammonia and urea
contractors. Furthermore, FCI has agreed that it will
consult with IDA before changing the unit General Manager
or Project Manager (paras. 7.01 and 7.04).
(vii)  FCI has agreed not to withdraw any cash funds f:om Nangal
if by so doing the current ratio of Nangal would fall below
1.1-' (para. 8.09).
(viii) FCI will obtain satisfactory assurances and contracts with
Indian Oil, Punjab State Electricity Board, Railway Autho-
rities and coal companies on supply of fuel oil, power and
coal, respectively (paras. 5.06, 5.07 and 5.08).
10.02     Based on the assurances obtained the proiect constitutes a suitable
basis for an IDA credit of US$58 million.

FCI NLAGAL FERTILIZER PROJECT TECINICA.L TERMS
The following technical descriptions are intended as background
material for terminology used in this report and annexes.
1.  CAN       I
Calcium Ammonium Nitrate, a Nitrogen fertilizer made by mixing
anronium nitrate and limestone.  The Nangal product contains 25% N, half
in ammonium form and half in nitrate form.
2.  Urea
Known chemically as carbamide - the normal amide of carbonic
acid; this compound contains about 46% N, all in ammonium form.
3.  Electrolysis
The process of separating water into hydrogen and oxygen, by
passing direct current through a weak caustic potash solution.
L.  Partial Oxidation or P.O.
A method of producing hydrogen from hydrocarbon fuels of almost
any type by a non-catalytic flane reaction with oxygen followed by removal
of coproduct carbon monoxide.
5. Feedstock
The hydrocarbon used to nroduce hydrogen for ammonia synthesis;
in the pronosed Nangal plant, this would be a heavy, sulfur-containing
fuel oil or refinery residue having little alternative use unless purified
beforehand.
6. Plant Nutrients
Essential to plant growth are some 16 elements, 6 in large amounts
and the remainder in small or micro quantities. Carbon, hydrogen and oxygen
plus nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium comprise the first six, and others
in dimishing degrees include calcium, magnesium, sulfur, silicon, iron,
aluminum, manganese, boron, sodium, and copper. Carbon, hydrogen and oxygen
are readily available from ambient air and water. Nitrogen, phosphorus and
potassium plus other elements are drawn from the soil.
Unless suiplemented by regular additions of materials containing
these nutrients, soils are soon depleted by croppirg.  Use of organic
materials such as animal and vegetable wastes has long been effectively
undertaken, but the scale and intensity- o  modern agriculture have far
exceeded the availability of natural "fertilizers". Consequently, the
majority of the world's primary plant nutrient needs - nitrogen, phosphorus
and potassiUm - are now supplied as manufactured or "chemical" fertilizers.



To an increasing degree, secondary nutrients such as calcium, magnesium,
sulfur, and micro nutrients like boron, copper, manganese are also added
to soils along with the primary nutrients in ratios prescribed by
agronomists according to specific cron and soil needs.
7. Chemical Fertilizers
Chemical compounds suitable as fertilizers should be: high in
nutrient content to minimize delivered cost; stable to avoid hazards ancd
handling problems; readily water soluble and available to plant root
systems.  Cornercially-available materials meeting these requirements to
a large degree are:
Primary Nutrient
Nitrogen                   Phosnhorus                      Potassium
Material           N                               P 0                         K 0
Urea             h6%    Diammonium Phosphate    PK8N    Potash                 611,
Ammonium Nitrate 3I%    Triple Sunerphosphate    46Z    Pot. Sulfate           5h4p
Ammonium Sulfate 21%    Single Superphosphate    181    Langbeinite            22Z
Calcitr, Nitrate  17%
The high nutrient contentsof urea, diammonium phosphate and
potash (KCL), plus ample raw material availability and large-scale technology
enabling tens of millions of tons to be provided annually, has led to these
compounds being the most popular fertilizer materials in the world today.
Urea has accordingly been chosen as the optimum fertilizer to produce in the
proposed new Nangal plant. (Had today's technology been available a decade
ago, when the first Nangal plant was built, no doubt urea would have been
selected then, instead of calcium ammonium nitrate.)
8. Urea Synthesis
Urea is made by reacting ammonia and carbon dioxide.  i3ace both
of these materials are produced during ammonia synthesis, urea production
is usually undertaken alongside an ammonia plant. Unfortunately, the
corresDonding acid of carbon dioxide (carbonic acid) does not form stable
anmoniuw  salts as do nitric, sulfuric or phosphoric acids.  Therefore, simple
neutralization as used in making ammoniun nitrate and sulfate fertilizers
is not possible. Instead, ammonia and carbon dioxide are combined under
heat and pressure to make amionium carbamate which, although unstable, can
be dehydrated under pressure to form urea, a stable compound. Again
unfortunately, the overall reaction is completely reversible and even at
300 atmospheres pressure and 2000C. the conversion to urea in a single pass
through the reactor is under 70%. This introduces several complications:
high pressure must be used to maximise conversion; unconverted reactants
must be separated and recycled; increased corrosion under the high temperatures
and pressures used must be overcome, and urea decomposition into undcsirable
oroducts must be minimized. In recent years, several engineering and producing
companies have developed ways of surmounting these problems, and large plants
capable of oroducing a thousand tons ner day, or more, of urea to rigid
chemical and nhysical soecifications are now onerating successfully for long
periods throughout the world.

FCI: iNA2GAL FMTIL1ZiZ F.PRJECT
FCI: DESCRIPTIO'! OF THE CC:APOYLTIU2:
A. .Existing Ooerating Divisons of FCI
FCI is the largest fertilizer compaxy in India (414,000 TPI' of
N capacity) at present with five operating units, plus the Plarnning and
Development Divison, which are described below, These oDerating uni-s,
along with rCI's expansion projects are suwmarized in Annex 2-2.  Historival
nerfornance for the operating divisons is given in Annex 2-3 which shows
the production capacity and actual production of the units. Capacity
utilization has averageu about 70s for nitrogen and about 55t for phosphaue
over the past 3 years. An analysis of the data indicates that Gorakhpur
and Nangal have had relatively little difficulty (except Nangal's po,er
nroblems in 1971-72) and have consistently operated at high effician'zy.
iindri and Namrutp have continuing operating problems and operate considerably
below desirable levels of capacity utilization. Trombay has shlown small
orofits only in the recent two years and the c:rrent fiscal year has demonStrated
a great Improvement in performance.
)verall performance of FCI has been relatively poor.  As indicated
above, the divisional perfornance has varied widely for comnlex reasons and
these are discussed below:
1. Trombay (iiaharashtra)
The Trombay Unit produces urea, niUrophosphate and methanol.
Initial uroduction was begun in 1965. The nlant was financed with funds
rom J..,. AID and GOI and the major plant units are ammonia (Chemico), urea
(Chemico), nitric acid (C & I Girdler) and nitroDhosphate (C & I (Zrcler)
with design contractors listed in parenthesis.  The olants had high
construction costs and significant technical difficulties have occurred.
"'Ci's onerations of the nLants have been at a relatively low outnut level
reflecting both technical and management problems. At the Dresent time FCi
is involved in arbitration proceedings against the contractors; claims and
counterclaims amount up to US +28 million. The plants onerated for rmany years
at about 60i4 canacity or less and have unusually high maintenance co ,ts. Tne
financial nlan for Trombay's original facilities was much higher :Ln debt than
normal for SCI - 70% - and the high debt services - partly due to the Runee
devaluation In 1967 - has also contributed to the poor profit perfo.r.ance of
Trombay.
FCI has taken some steDs to imDrove the performance of this
divison.  The Tennessee Valley Authority (USA) sent a mission in 1967 and
the lank in 1969.  Both missions made recorinendations which have partially
been considered by FCI management.  An exransion nroject at Tronba-   s been
nronosed to IDA that includes modernization of the existing facilitits. he
ex'ansion orogran consists of a NPK fertilizer olaat based on imrnorted
armronia of about 75,000 TPY MN and 75, 000 PoO   Trombay Profitability has
improved substantially and profits for FY 1973 should be about 's.5O million.
This project is scheduled for appraisal by IDA in early 1973.



2.  Gorakhpur ('Jttar Pradesh)
This divison, which produces urea only, began production in
early 1968. Gorakhpur, financed with Japanese credit plus iunds from G0,
was built by Toyo Engineering Corporation of Japan at a total oroject cost
of about $'45 million. This cost is considered excessive with much of the
high cost due to certain over-sized equipment and excessive snare equip-
ment.
The plant operates very well and can easily exceed 1C0' of
design capacity on a daily basis. The limiting factor has been power supDly
and as power reliability improves in Uttar?radesh the performance of this
divison should steadily increase.  The Gorakhpur divi3on is, along with
Nangal, one of the best operating divisons of FCI, and its urofit should
increase as its Dower problems are overcome.
The rlant units at Gorakhpur are ammonia and urea with naphtha
as a feedstock. The ammonia planit is designed in two streams each with a
capacit.y of 175 TPD NHH3. rhe plant uses electrically-driven reciprocating
compressors and has a relatively high operating cost as a result. Vperating
costs are also high because of the high cost of feedstocX and the rprocessing
steps required by the use of cracked naphtha.
In December 1971 IDA approved a US :10 million credit for an
expansion project, which will increase Gorakhpur's capacity from 180,000 TPY
to 314,000 rPY urea. The exparnsion project should be conmissioned in 1975.
3. Nangal (Punjab)
The Aangal Divison produces heavy wacer and ualciuii-arimonium
nitrate (25'< i4) fertil'zer (CAN).  initial production began in 1961 with a
rated capacity of 80,000 TPY nitrogen (see annex 3-1 for further details).
14. rJamruD (Assam)
The Namrup factory produces urea and armonii  sulfate.  The Dlant
started comnercial production in January 1969 and has never achieved rated
capacity.    The factory was designed by Chemico and contains small process
units for ammonia, urea and ammoniuri sulfate production.  Ammonium sulfate
sales are low due to competition from Hindustan Steel which produces by-
product ammonium sulfate at a lower price than :amrup. As a result, 1iamruip's
financial performance has been unsatisfactory.
A detailed evaluation of Namrup was not made but it is doubtful
if the existing facilities can ever be profitable without major revisions.
The plant is being expanded (330,000 TPY urea) with the new units expected
on-stream it late 1973 (see below).  However, the total market for fertilizer
in Assam is low so most of the increased production must be shipped into
Bihar and further aw;y.
5. Sindri (Bihar)
The Sindri divison produces ammonium sulfate, urea, and ciouble
salt (ammonium sulfate - ammonium nitrate) nlus industrial chemicals.  Most
of ths existing Droduction facilities are old, inefficient units with high



ANNEX 2-1
Page 3
maintenance costs and the divison has excessively high employment of about
8,000 people. The plant operates at about 70% capacity with major causes
being power and equipment failures.  The ammonium sulfate plant is also
a major cause of losses due to high cost of gyosum feedstock.  Sindri's
financial performance has deteriorated substantially in the past years
and it is contributing mach to FCI's poor financial results.
A rationalization program is underway including adding production
facilities for phosphoric acid and triple superphosphate (TSP), improving
ammonium sulfate production and possibly shutting some of the older
facilities.
6. Planning and Development Divison (Bihar)
The P & D Divison is the engineering and research and development
arm of FCI. It is located adjacent to the Sindri Unit in Bihar. Total staff
of P & D is about 2,000 with about 700 engineers and designers working
directly on engineering projects, planning and technical service functions
for the existing units.
In addition to engineering duties, the divison develops and
manufactures catalyst for use in ammonia plants and has extensive pilot
plant and research and development facilities. The catalyst manufacturing
program is technically sound and some catalyst has been sold and used in
plants in India.  0ver the next few years as catalyst consumption grows in
the country, catalyst production should become profitable.
P & D has several license agreements with international process
engineering firms; the most notable being:
Montedison  -  Italy        -  ammonia and urea
Lurgi       -  Germany      -  Rectisol C02 removal
Shell       -  lNetherlands -  fuel oil gasification
Koopers     -  Germany      -  coal gasification
Nissan      -  Japan        -  phosphoric acid
Licensing arrangements for other Drocess technology are obtained when needed
for other projects.  P & D has also develoDed its own process know-how for
such technology as ammonium sulfate, ammonia synthesis gas purification and
others. In all of the present aimaonia-urea works in progress P & D is
responsible for engineering, design, project schedule and procurement based
on process design packages from the various licensors. where supplier's
credits are involved, the foreign process collaborator handles most
procurement from outside india.
Project implementation in FCI is not clearly defined and the
result has been that a number of new projects have been delayed in completion
as long as two or three years. There is no one project manager with overall
responsibility; instead, the functions are divided between the genera'l
manager of a particular unit and P & D.  Supervision of work at the site is
the responsibility of the General Manager of that unit. Although P & D
is responsible for project schedule, its completion time can be greatly
affected by the General Manager's staff. Budget control is another critical



ANNEX 2-1
Page 4
area of split responsibility with P & D responsible for design and procure-
ment and the divison management responsible for construction costs. P & D
appoints a proiect coordinator to sunervise its activities and maintains
liaison with the unit management. MaJor decisions on design and procure-
ment are made by a committee consisting of the top level management of P & D
so the nroject coordinator does not have full resnonsibility for nroject
management.  The general engineering capabilities of P & D are quite good.
Tynical design !Irawings and specifications were reviewed for the several
projects now in the design stage and they appeared to be thorough and
professionally done.
The overall responsibil'ty of P & D in executing the several
ammonia-urea orojects is greater than heretofore generally recognized by
IDA. The resDonsibilities of the Process licensors appear to be the initial
nrocess iackage, a limited anount of checldng, and supply of constructVion
and conmissioning advisors.  The guarantees offered are process guarantees
and are not liksly to be enforceablo to any significant degree. FCI as a
whole has total responsibility for project management, project schedule and
budget.
It is in these areas where P & D (FCI) is most lacking. Prolect
coordinators and newly appointed General YSanagers are not always experienced
in the comolex task or designing, assembling and erecting the vast quantity
of equioment, materials and manoower required for these projects which have
capital investients of $80-l)O million-;.  Many delays are outside P & D
controls due to such factors as license restrictions, supplier's credits
li-mtations and domestic difficulties such as transport and fabrication.
the presence of such nroblemns, however, requires much more attention to a
proJect's critical nath schedule, more advanced nlanning, and leaves less
roor, for error than in more highly  industrialized nations.
B. FCU's Ecoansion Progran
CT will be one of the world's largest fertilizer producers after
its expansion orogram is comoleted in 1979 (projected carnacity 2,200,000
tons of  ).  :C1 has nine major projects under imolementation at present.
The capacities, costs and exDected on-stream dates are given in Annex 2-2.
Al1 these oro4ects are being executed by FCI's P & D Divison with the
assistance of various other process and engineering firms.
Durgapur, sjamrup (exoansion) and Barauni are substantially
dunlicate Dlants based on nrocess designs obtained from Montecatini Edison
(Italy), aad include process units for armonia and urea. These projects
are being financed with ltalian credits and funds from GOI. The Sindri
Rationalization Project is a triple superphosphate (TSP) unit which includes
facilities for sulfuric and phosphoric acid as well as TSP.  Much of the
engineering procurement is domestic, including a subcontract with FACT. G01
is providing all funds including foreign exchange from Belgiumn and Bulgarian
credits.
1/  Furthermore, the exDansion program of FCI has severdrytaxed management
canabilities especially in the area of middle management.



ANNEX 2-1
Page 5
Talcher, Ramagundum, tialdia and Korba are large aMmonia-urea projects
with ammonia being produced by coal gasification. Montedison is the
major engineering collaborator with acditional assistance from Koppers
(Germany), Lurgi (Germany), and Technoexport (Czechoslovakia). Coal
gasification is relatively unDroved technology and the projects are ambitious
undertakings by GOI and FCI. GOI is also providing the project funds
including Italian and Czech credits. The projects are in the early design
stage and because of anticipated design problems, are not expected to be
completed before 1976.
All of the above nrojects are being financed about half by equity
and half debt and fixed assets of ooerating units represent approximately
5M  of the total fixed assets of the corooration.  All expenses including
interest during construction are being capitalized, so the company's profit
performance will not be affected by these projects uaitil oroduction starts or
unless the urojects are delayed. Three orojects under construction, Durgapur,
:'amrun and 7arauni, have exnerienced excessive delays. Durgapur is two
years late in conmissioning with Drocurernent and project management being
mtajor causes.  w'ork on the I'A financed C-orakhpur Expansion Project has just
started. Agreements on nrocurement between G01 and IDA should prevent any
annreciable delay on this nroject.
In addition, FCI has several projects under active consideration
which are also given in Annex 2-2. These projects are in various development
stages and it is difficult to predict their ultimate disposition.  The dates
given are FCI's estimates. * hese data indicate the growing influence of
FCI and the public sector on the fertilizer industry in India. If FCI
maintains its caDital expansion program on schedule then in 1979 the company
will have %9f of india's nitrogen capacity and 30% of phosphate CPmacity
compared to 30" and 10% respectively for the current capacity.
C. FCI Doard of Directors and Management
The membershin of the Board is given in Annex 2-3.  Of the total
of 12 members, five are from :CI, three from government ministries, two
from other public sector enterorises and two are from private business.
The influence of GOI, rarticularly the Ministries of Finance and Petroleum
& Chemicals is seen very strongly in the comDany'e management and operation.

1/  Net Profit figures shown in published statements are before expensos relating to past periods, and also do not take
into account write-off of development expenses.  Since these expenditures occur aInnua lY , the published profit figures
consistently overstate actual profit, and the adjusted figures are considered to more accurately represent profits (losses)
of FCI.  For the 8 year period, 1964-72, published profits are overstatej  by 45%.

C. Production Techniques
Hydrogen for amonia synthesis is produced by electrolysis of
water. This method is seldom used today, primarily because of high power
consumption and most ammonia plants obtain hydrogen from hydrocarbcn fuels.
The Nangal design requires about 12.5 MWH/ton of ammonia, compared to
1.8 MWH/ton for the Gorakhpur design, and 0.2 MWR/ton for a typical modern
process design as will be used in the Nangal Expansion Project.
-1.  Electrolysis.  Electric nower for the e'ectrolysis of water
at 66 KV is stepped down with five 35 MVA transformers to 11 K7 and then fed
to 21 banks of rectifiers through rectifier-transformers to obtain direct
current. The rectifiers normally onerate at 685 volts DC and 10,000 amps.
Electrolysis is carried out in 63 filter press type de Nora electrolysers,
each consisting of 108 cells. The electrolyte contains 26 to 29% potassium
hydroxide. The electrolysers are arranged in a 3 stage cascade utilizing
the condensate from the 3arlier stage as feed to the subsequent stage. The
cascade provides the enriched hydrogen for processing in the heavy water
plant. The electrolysis plant produces 26,500 NM3 per hour H2 and consumes
lJ9 MW of power.

hydrogen (at-omic weight to two rather than one). The isotope is present in
all hydrogen components including water but with a concentration of about 0.0h%.
This unit wlll be phased out of production when the expansion project is
operating at capacity.

AVAILABILITY AND CCST OF POWER
a. Power Situation
E'ngal receives its power directly from the Bhakra h-droelectric
plant (about 20 km away) operated by thn  Bhakra Ma'rgement Poard (7:B).
Currently Nangal pays Ps 22.74C W (3.0 US miis,WH):V for a design power
consumption of 164 hW, based on a renegotiated contract with BYE dated
from January 1971; this contract also contairs provisions for compensation
to Nargal of Rs 90 per XWF4 for any shortfall in supply below 98 1MJ (60%).
The contract guarantees Nangal 75% of design power (120 Y-W), but in
practice, GOI has allowed cuts below this rniniinum level for extended
periods in the past two years. In view of the fertilizer shortage, GOI
recently asked the power authorities to release more power to langal
(up to 75%) at a slightly increased price (Rs 26.O0:WNI). The origiral
Eangal-Bhakra power contract was negotiated in the rid-1950's, before
the fertilizer plant was built, for a tern of 25 years.  It was intended
that Yangal would provide the base loeid for the Bhakra hydroelectric
power (and irrigation) piroject. This decision was reasonable at that
time, and it contributed to the financial success of the Rhakra project.
In the 195G's and early 1C6G's power demand in the Punjab .3tate was low
and there was no adequate grid system to trans3nt Bh4kra power to other
regions. However, this surplus power situatior no longer exists and
the power now used by I.angal, in the long run, could be used elsewhere
in the Punjab or transritted to other power-short regions of India via
the rapidly expandinga regional grid network.
B.  Power Costs and Prices in Trorthern lrdia
GCI recent,, has adopted a pricing policy for power based on a
10% return on capital.  BMB estimates its present charges to Nlangal
(Rs 22.7A1-i) are about 1C0  below those required to yield the clesired
return. On the other hand, the quoted rate for power to the Nangal
expansion project is about Rs 8hMAW.  The new power contract would be
with the Punjab State Electricity Board (FSEB), which bases its rates to
the new Nanga). nroject on its normn] level of charges to large industrial
consumers and its average charges for power from its different sources
(Hydro- and thermo-plants). All I'argal power will come from Rhakra Dam,
and the explanations for the great difference in rates charged to Yangal
are (i) the concessional rate normally grarnted to electrochemical industries
and (ii) the fact that BEM rates are based mainly on production costs for
its own facilities, whereas PSEPB's prices are dictated mainly by market
forces, with consideration given to the price it Ymst pay for power
supplied from different generating facilities, each with its omrn cost
structure.
1/ Quoted power prices exclude 25% excise tax levied against all consumers.

EMB presently is building new hydroelectric facilities upstream
from the Bhakra Dam as part of the Beas-Sutle4 Lizk Project. This project
will. improve water flow (and power generation) at iihakra Reservo-ir.  These
tacilities are rnzitipurpose (powier, irriration, flood control) arid it is
difficult to allocate costs on any reasonable basis.  GOI's approximate esti:mate
of power production costs for the Tew hydroelectric plant is about Rs hO/AMI,
including 1OD profit.  This rate is about 658 above B?-'s rate present.ly
charged to Nangal, and is well below &, 's marginal costs of productionl.
C.  Opportunity Costs of Power in Northern India
The hydroelfctric plants presently urder construc"tion or
consideration cannot, by thermselves, meet the rapid increases expected in
1,orthern India's power demard.  As a result, marginal increases In derlarnd
can be satisfied only bv miore expensive thermalT planlts.  It Lierefore- i;
thermal, not hydroelectric, productior that would be saved wy any redutt.ion
in power requirements of iangal.  GOI estimates indicate that the full cosl.
of production for a representative therrymal plant presentl,> utdler corstrur+io(
near Delhi is about 102 RsA/K4  (13.6 U8 mils/KI- ).  This prcvides a bet.2.er
basis for estimating the marginal cost of nower ir. the regi(r served by
the Yorthern Tndia power grid.  It does riot, however, take r.-riet. forc-"
into consideration.
Public Utilities Department estinrates that ary novwcr release-A

). Forecasted Power Situation for Nangal
The future power situation for !Tanga] is not so maueh 'i Puncrtion
of supply as of costs.  If Nangal could afford to pay the regul.r rate for
industrial consumers (Rs 8L/AWH) it could probably obtain its full. power
requirements relatively easily; but Nangal could only pay about double
its present rate (or about Rs 40-16 45 i), before starting to make losses,
ever. with its almost fully depreciated plant.  This indlicates that !!Ingal
needs highly subsidized power for its operations in  both financial and(
economic terms; therefore the continued use of its power intensive process
for producing anmonia is neither financially nor economically viable.
The proposed expansion project based on heavy fuel oi] feedstock includes
the replacement of the anmonia sections of the existing plant, thereby
releasing about l49 M91.

Past and Present Situation in India
A. General
Fertilizer production is a major part of India's program to
become self-sufficient in Agriculture. Currently about half of the required
nitrogen fertilizer is imported but steps have been taken by GOI to increase
domestic production. Nitrogen is now produced in India primarily as anmonia
and urea based on naphtha from imported petroleum feedstocks. Current plans
propose increasing reliance on fuel oil and indigenous coal as raw mkaterials
for awmonia feedstocks.  Several plants have been sanctioned based on imported
ammonia but few such additional projects are expec.,ed. A major problem has
been long delays in getting plants built and operating at or near capacity
and this has created large production deficits.
, .itrogen supply and demand for recent years are shown below based
on data from the Fertilizer Association of India, GOI and IDA.

this is very low. Fertilizer use in Punjab State is substantially
higher than the average for the country. I.evertheless, this table
indicates clearly the room for growth in Indian fertilizer application.
C. Product Pattern for India
The product pattern of nitrogenous fertilizers in India has
undergone a significant change over the years. Initially, a substantial
part of production was low-analysis fertilizer containing only a single
nutrient.
The following table shows end-product capacity of important
nitrogen fertilizers at different periodss

Arwioniuxn sulphate was formerly a substantia'l part of production
and reacLed 95% in 1956. However, its use is declining and this can be
expected to continue. Urea (which is now the most popular nitrogen fer-
tilizer and accounted for only W of total nitrogen capacity in 1961) grew
to 59% in 1972, and its use will likely increase in the future.
There has also been appreciable expansion of rulti-nutrient
fertilizer capacity in recent years.  Until 1961 only about 2% of total
nitrogen capacity was in the form. of complex fertilizers. This rose to
about 13;' in 1966 and continues to be about the same, rising from 66,000
tons of - ir 1966 to 237,000 tons in 1972.
D. Consumption of Other Primary Nutrients
The following table shows consumption of the three primary plant
nutrients from 1953 - 1972:

1972       1,850       570    303      6.1  : 1.9  : 1
The above statistics show consumption of nitrogen fertilizer
increased 7-fold; that of phosphate fertilizer 9-fold, and potassium
fertilizer 8-fold during the last 10 years.
While consumption of phosphate and potassium fertilizers
grew substantially, these started from lodwer bases compared to nitro-
gen, and actual tonnage increases were much less. Optimum nutrient
ratios are functions of specific soils, crops and other conditions.
For India, advisable minimum phosphate and potash figures are generally
reflected in a h:2:1 balance. On this basis, the above table shows a
past and future need for much more P205 and K20.

1969                  780                         91                     165

It is seen there were appreciable increases in imports of all
three nutrients from the year 1966. Maximum imports occurred in 1968 when
about a million tons of nitrogen fertilizers, 370 thousand tons of P205
and 280 thousand tons of K20 were imported. Although imports of nitrogen
fertilizers started declining from 1969, import levels during 1972 were
still fairly high, when 820,000 tons of N and 241,000 tons of P205 were
imported. Regarding phosphatic fertilizers, imports have been somewhat
erratic over the years. There was a considerable increase in 1968 and
1972 when substantial quantities of D.A.P./complex fertilizers were
imported.
Produce-wise data of nitrogen fertilizer imports show the dominance
of urea. The following table gives the imports of major nitrogenous fer-
tilizers in the year 1972:

A high proportion of urea in the production patternT as discussed
earlUer, and in the imports shown in the above table indicates excel]ent
prospects for thi.s fertilizer.
F. Urea Pricing
The Goverrment Fertilizer Pool sets a ceiling price for urea
sold in India. This price represents the wholesale onrice to dealers at
railhead and allows the dealer Rs8O/ton to cover his costs of distribution.
The Pool sells all imported fertilizer so at present plays a large role
in rkarketing. Although there is no official duty on imported fertilizel'
the pool prices are substantially higher than worl.l market.

The pool price cannot be exceeded by anyone legall;, andl there
is little incentive to sell underneath the price in most cases, due to
shortage o- supply and high operating costs for urea produc_ion in Indi?.
In theory, Indian fertilizer manufacturers have freedom to
establish their own prices but for variow. reasons are unable fully to
do so. For example, in addition to maximium consumer prices being set
by GOI, prices need to he at levels that provide worthwhile returns to
distributors and dealers.  Although prices and pricing policies have not
been finally established for E:angal urea, they will probabhl  correspondi
to those now prevailing for sales by the Pool, e.g.,

Comparative World Urea Pri- es
Precise cornarisons of world ure3 prices are difficult to
make because of fluctuating seasonal derands, subsidies, discounts,
contract terts, etc. Eevertheless figures taken from the "Fertilizer
4ssociition of Indiia Statistics, 197C-l971I  show at the current price
of !s 959 per ton of bagged urea, Indian farmers are paying hi.her
actual p-:ices thar, their couiter parts in nrnv oti.er countries.  .-easons
include import taxes on raw materials, sales t;Lxes and a gerieral high-
pricin- policy adorted by GOI.

The nitrogen projections based on 10% annual increases agree
closely with the totals shown in the Regional Demand table in this Annex,
and which were derived by the Bank separately.
The attached Bank forecasts of Indian nitrogen fertilizer con-
sumption and production are summarized below and show a continued deficit
throughout the 1972 to 1979 period, which wil'l have to be met by imports:

B. Conclusion
Historical data on production, consumption anu imrorts of fer-
tilizers i.ndicate large previous shortages. Estimates of future
demand and supply point to continued production deficits in the fores'-abl-
future, although on a smaller scale. This is true for both nitrogen and
phosphates, even if all the plants currently under construction an,l those
under consideration are completed according to schedule and produce at
near-capacity levels. This deficit plus continued problems in purchasing
imported material will make it difficult to continue tha tempo of the "green
revolution" and ensure an adequacy of food in future years unless the pro-
duction of fertilizers is still further increased. Therefore, the pronoseu
Nangal expansion project should be assured of a total off-take for many
years, and is also well justified economically.

State of Agriculture in the Nangal Marketing Zone
A. ueneral
Agriculturally, the area constituting the mrrketing zone of
Nangal, e.g. the States of Punjab and Haryana* a'.u the district of
Ganganagar in Rajasthan is one of th- most advanced regions in the coun-
try. It is often called the bread-basket of India, as it contributes
substantially to the nation's supplies of food. With about 6% of the
total area under foodgrains in all-Indi., the zone accounts for about
1O0  of the country's total foodgrains production.  In wheat, which is
the most imnportant cereal crop after rice and is the staple food in about
half the entire country, the region accounts for about one-fifth of the
area and about one-third of the total production. In gram, the most
imrortant of the pulse crops (and the principal source of protein to a
considerable proportion of the population) tne zone accounts for about
one-fourth to one-third of the country's total corresponding croD area
and production.  The region is also an important source of some major
cormercial crops like cotton, oilseeds and sugarcane and for the dairy
iniustry.  The agricultural significance of the region lis, however,
not onlj in trrs of size but also because cf the lead it has given to
tV' country in recent time:   It has plpyvid a pioneering role in the
adopticn of modern agricultu.-al t-chniqu.s and can be regarded justi4iably
.s the craole of the '3reen :xvolution'.
1. Land 11so Pattern
The zone covers some 11.5 million heetares and constitutes about
3.54 of India's geographic ar-a.  lowever, considering only about 140a of
India's geographic area is under cLltivation, it has a much better land-
use pattern; the nroportion of net area sown to total geogrx)hic ares
being over 70%. The following table gives broad details of land utilization
in the zone:

D. Irrigation:
Deficiency in rainfall is largely met by well-developed irriga-
tion. The zone represents one of the most irrigated regions in the country,
which largely accounts for the high intensity of land utilization and product-
ivity. The irrigated area in the zone fonns about 47% of the net area sovn,
compared to about 20  for the  entire country.        In the Punjab region, this
proportion is as high as 596.  The table below gives details and comparativt

Wheat is by far the most importanw crop of the region, and in PunJab,
accounts for about 30% of the total area cropped.  In H&.yana the
proportion is about 22%. As mentioned earlier, the region accounts for about
one-fifth of the total area sown to wheat in the country and about one-third of
Indian  production.  The proportions are almost the same for gram, although
this accounts for only about 7% of the cropped area in Punjab and 14% in
Elaryana. About 75% of the total cropped area of the region is devoted to
foodgrains. The region's share ln the production of cotton is also substantial.

A significant shift in the cropping pattern of the regio0n nas been
evident  in recent years, with high-value crops replacing coarse grains, partL_
as a result of irrigation development and partly due AD increasing commerciali-
sation of agriculture.
The greater incentive to use purchased inputs like fertilizers,
with corresoonding better returns on farm investment, has also hastened this
process.  The tanTh below oives some sivnificant trends.

There has been a substantial growth in the area under wheat especially
dur ng the last few years.  Since wheat and gram are substitute crops, the
increase in the wheat area was undoubtedly secured partly at the expense ol
gram. Similarly, bajra, maize, cotton and sugarcane are substitutable among
themselves, and part of the decrease in area under bajra, appears to be because
of its substitution by other c.ops. However, other factors such as increase
in area under cultivation and improved crop rotation have partly helped to
cushion the effect of this trend.

Increase in yield rates during recent years largely reflect a progres-
sive improvement  In  cultivation   methods used in the region, such as irriga-
tion and cropping intensity, fertilizer consumption, use of high yielding seeds,
farm mechanization etc. Since irrigation alone makes a substantial difference
in yield rates, the proportion of gross irrigated area to total cropped area
was increased from about 59% in 1965 in Punjab to 72% in 1969, and from 36%
to 46% in Haryana.
The proportion of double-cropped area to net sown area has also been
rising at a rate higher than the average for India. Use of high-yielding
varieties of seeds, which provided tne primary impulse for growth in farm pro-
ductivity in recent years, has spread fairly rapidly, and tne area unaer nign-
yielding varieties in 1969-70 formed about 19% of the total area under such
varieties in the country. The table below pives the area under high-yielding
varieties:

For wheat and bajra a large proportion of the irrigated area is
already devoted to high-yielding varieties. For rice, however, the proportion
is relatively small, mainly because of strong consumer preferences, &rd the higher
returns from traditional varieties experienced so far. (In the evolution of fertilizer
responsive, disease-resistant, high-yielding varieties,wheat has given better
results than rice to date.

The region as a whole also leads in the consumption of chemical
fertilizers.  Punjab with a consumption of 28.4 Ig. of nitrogpen per hectare
of cropped area in 1970    ranked the highest among all the major States'
The consumption in Haryana, with 10.2 kg per ha of cropped area, was also sub-
stantially above the all-India average of 8.7 kg./ha. The consumption of NIPK
in Punjab ia about 33.7 kg. and in Haryana about 11.7 kg/ha compared to the
all-India average of 12.6 kg per hectare. The consumption of nitrogen in Gang-
anagar district per unit of cropped area is estimated to be 10.9 kg/ha, and the
total consumption of NPK together about 12.8 kg/hectare.
From the data presented above, it wili be seen tnat tne marketing
zone for Nangal at present constitutes agriculturally one of the rest advanced
regions in the country. There are many factors in the present situation ',hat
indicate a further rapid growth in the next few years. The average Eize of f ain
holdings in the zone is much higher than in the country as a whole, and as a
result, farm mechanization is progressing at a rate much faster than in tie
rest of India. The region has a comparatively nore enterprising and alert
peasantry, a considerable section of whom have ceased to looi. ;pon agric_lLure
as a 'way of life' out regard it as a business.  The region nlas c_mparative`y

G. Ccmparative Plant Nutrient Consumption in India, by State
Within India, there are wide variations in fertilizer consumption
rates from region to region. The per-hectare consumption of nitrogen in
Punjab, for instance, is about 28.4 Kg. compared to only 1.87 Kg. in Madhya
Pradesh and 1.23 Kg. in Assam. These differences indicate the largte scope
for increasing consumption in the country, even after making allowance for
dif.erences in climate, soil, etc. The table below shows the average con-
sumption rates in some of the major States and illustrates the predominant
position of Punjab.

The Nangal Marketing System and Environment
A. C-eneral
The Nangal factory of FCI is located in 1:aya !:angt1 town.ship
close to the Bhakra-Uangal irrigation and power complex in the State of
Punjab. It is the only large-scale nitrogenous fertilizer plant at
present in the north-western part of India; the two closest units being
situated in Kanpur and Kota, about 734 and 886 kilonetres away respec-
tively, in the States of Uttar Pradesh and RaJasthan. Chandigarh, which
is at present the capital of both the adjoining States of Punrab and
Haryana, lJes about 100 km south of Nangal.  It is an important distribu-
tion center for fertilizer and other connodities, a busiiess and social
focal point and a:so the headquarters of the regional Apex <o-op
organization.
Northern Rajasthan and in particular the Ganganagar district
of the Rajasthan State, which is contiguous to Punjab, are also included
in the marketing zone of the Nangal Unit. Both from geographic proximity
and availability of comnmnication facilities, Ganganagar district can be more
easily reached from Nangal than fron any other produiction center. The
distance by rail from Nangal to Ganganagar, is only about h20 kns compared
to 765 kms from Kota, which is situated on the south-eastern border of
Rajasthan. Ganganagar, the major distribution center irn the district is
better connected by rail and road with Punjab and therefore is easily
accessible from 14angal. The district is extensively irrigated from canals
heading from Punjab.  Because of the similarity of soil, climatic and
agronomic conditions, cropoing patterns of the district resermbles closely
those in the neighboring districts of Punjab. In contrast with the other
neighboring districts of Rajasthan, Ganganagar has a higher fertilizer
demand, accounting for over 30% of the total fertilizer consumption of
the state.
For thesB reasons, the states of Punjab and Hiaryana and the
district of Ganganagar in Rajasthan constitute the primary marketing
zone for the Nangal fertilizer Unit.  The Administrative districts
covered in this zone are:
F-n iab                  Iaryana             Rajasthan
1. Gurdasput             1. Hissar           1.  Ganganagar

Even now, this zone forms the primnary marketing area for the
existing unit at flangal. It may be seen from the data below that about
90% of present output from the Nangal Unit is sold in these districts.

However, present production at Nangal meets only part of the
existing demand for ritrogen in the regiorn. To supply as much of this
neei as Fossible, ?CT brings in some material from its other iuits in
'ttar Pradesh and Bihar and frwi imports distributed by the Government
o' India under the central fertilizer pool.
B. Fertilizer Supply and Demand in Narigal's Eiarketing Area
As indicated, Nangal's area of mLarketinlg operation is now
largely confined to the states of Punjab and Haryana in the Niorthern
Zone of the country. Small quantities are also supplied to other states
ir the zone, namely Rajasthan, U.P., Hiiachal Pradesh, Jarmu & Kashmir,
and tUnion Territoriesof  Delhi.  This limit is because of inadequate
availability of material in relation to derrand. W,4hen the proposea
expansior pro,ect goes into production, availability of fe.tilizers will
be considerably increased. Thus, it is worthwhile examining the produc-
tion and consumption of fertilizers in che !Corthern Zone, to determine
more precisely the sales situa.tion after the expansion project is or
stream.
i'roduction
At present, two major plants in the Northern Zone produce
nitrogenous fertilizers. Their location and. capacity units are:

It can be seen the role of the pool and nanuxfact'irers outside
the zone, althoucgh now substantial is more of a complerentary nature.
Supplies from these sources are meant to briaoe the gap between locai
availability and demand to the extent rossit1e.
C. Changes in the t'ertilizer Gonsumption Pattern
in tIrjab and haryana a si-ft has taken place from the
consumption of low-nutrient fertilizers to high--rdlysis straii,rlt. and
complex materials.  Although C'AN produced bv  C'G1 'Vangal continues to be
used, significant irncreases in arelar- cotn'i.ea fertAilizers have occurret
in the last five years.
The follo ing table gives consumption of im.portant nitrogenous
fertilizers in Y.lunab, Haryana, Pajasthan ad U. P. durino- 1V'67 and 1971:

It can be seen that urea became a major nitrogen source in
1971 when its share rose to the 52-62% range ir. the above states compared
to only a 7-17% range in 1967. Amr.oniur sulfate has now become a minor
fertilizer. CAN, however, still continues to be popular in Punjab, Haryana
and Rajasthan. Comolex fertilizers have also gradually gained acceptance.
D. Future Demand and Supply
Consumption
In addition to IBRD projections, two sets of consumption estimates
for nitrogenous fertilizers are available. One is based on Planning
Constission targets and the other was developed for the Zonal Conference in
April, 1971, for 1972 and 197h. These aret

The Zonal Conference estimates are believed to be conservative.
For the years beyond 197h, individual estimates have been made by the abova
sources for the northern states. For comparison, an ind4vidual estimate by
IBRD and used in this report is 520,000 tons N for 197h-  However, even
conservative estimates of consurption for 1974 exceed total esti-mated pro-
duction capacity of 170,000 tons NJ. As none of the additional projects are
likely to be completed by 1974, the corresponding shortfall is likely to be
350,000 tons r.  This gap will have to be met by supplies from other Indian
sources and the Pool. The subsequent demand-supply pattern is outlined in
the Regional Forecast Tables given in Annex 4 -2, and is reviewed in further
detail ir. the following section.

IFFCO
Another plant while although not located in either Purijab or in
iaryaria but should le taken into consideration, is the Indian Farmfters
Fertilizer Cooperative Project (IFFCO', which is currently under con-
struction at Kandla. This is a joint venture of the various cooperatives
in the country. According to its Articles of Association, merber co-
operatives can exercise their right to claim the production for sa'le in
their areas, in proportion to the shares they hold in the company. The
Apex-level cooperatives of Punjab and Haryana together own a hC% of the
total capital and accordingly, Ir-FCO could sell up to hO% of its total
production in these two states depending on market conditions.
IFFCO is designed to produce both urea and complex fertilizers
of various grades. It will have an installed capacity of 396,000 tons of
urea, equivalent to 182,000 tons of !. and complex fertilizers of various
grades equivalent to 48,000 tons of X.  IFFCO is expected to commence Dro-
duction in 1976. Its production, therefore, is estimated from the year
1976 to 1979 and ohould be:

Tlra aisortation
Hoth rail and road transt:orta:.iOn are used to haul Langal CAN
fertilizer from the plant to distribut:-n c"n'ers. A good road system
enables 3L$ of present prouaction (or ahonvwt o''J tons annually) to be
movted in this way, coTmpared to a n-"iWrl r'." :' o'  j to  .O for fer-

Storage
Fertilizer consumption in Nangal's marketing area is fairly
uniforn throughout the year because of double cropping and the side
variety sown. In addition, distribution and discount systems used by
co-ops and private dealers have, to date, helped to eliJinate the needl
for FCI to store large amounte of material in less-active months.
Canacity equivalent to 20 daya' production of bagged urea (20,000 tons)
will be provided at the factory. Additional field storage requirod at
full output is expected to range between 1,/00 tons in April to 20,000
tons in June. According to FCI, this wlll be provided by the Cooperatives.
Distribution and Sales
In tle principal marketirg areas (Pun4ab and Haryana) and to
a large extent in other states, fertilizers reach farmeIs through two
distribution networks, namely, the co-ops and private deialers. Co-ops
have a four-tier system comprising Apex Federations, district level
societies, retail or wholesale marketing societies tnd village level
co-ops. Sales _ztivities start by Apex officcs giving (dispatch instruc-
tions to manufacturers, indicating destinations, rail-head quantities
and schedules.  FCI then supplies material to the railhead or wholesale
marketing societies accordingly (whenever available).  The wholesale
society, in 'urn, distributes the fertilizer to village-level co-ops.
H. Credit
Fertilizers are purchased by various agricult-..'al groups in
India rr.ging from large comaercial estates to veryr low-income cultivators.
The former usually uo not need credit assistance, but many small farmers
and ten.nt-rultiva-ors rely on this mear.s of financing on a crop-by-crop
basis. In recent years, detenr2ined attempts have been made by GOI to
provide suitable credit facilities to all levels of the agricultural
conwunity, especially the low-income groups whose only previous recourse
was the village money-lender.
Farmers can now obtain loans from two major sources: State
banks and co-op "banks" or lending agencies. The co-ops, at Apex level
can, in turn, obtain loans from the State banks or from the Centr 1
Reserve Bank in India.  Typical interest terns are:
Reserve Bank to co-cps    4
State Banks to co-ops      9
Co-ops to farmers          9.5
State Banks to farmers   10
Guidance on forthcoming loan needs is given to the State and
co-op banks by the 1-inistry of Agriculturo.  Loans to farmers are usually
made on a 6 or 12 month basis and are increasingly granted according to a
farmer's ability to produce, rather than his securable assets. To assist
very poor cultivators in backward areas GOI has recently established the



ANTNEX l-h
Page 10
Small Farmers Development Agency and the Marginal Farmers Development
Agency.  These are intended to provide 100:0, fnar;cinc to about 1 rmillion
people or. a l," arnrual interest basis; 25$, of these funds will come from
Agency sources and the remainder nfom co-ops.
Iowever, overall credit requixenents in India are large and
still growing. Considerable increases in credit availability will have
to be provided by GO! ir the fii+ure.  The Finistr4es of Agriculture anid
Finance are aware of thie need and are planning to make more loans avail-
.able on iealistic term.s, especially to low-income farmers.
Farmers, in general, nave earned a good borrowing reputation.
Prompt repayment has been made in ovep- 75s of all cases and rescheduling
or re-financing is preferred Fy the banks to foreclosure.  Insurance
against default is also available to banks from the Cr0I liational Credit
Guarantee Corporation, which provides 7   coverqge up to .ls 5,000 per
farmer for a srl See.
The gro,wth of numerous prIvate fertilizer dealers has led to
additional credit and coverage needs.  These individuals now can obtain
loans covering 75% of their stock an.' s9.ate banks cat secure 75  risk
coverage for a small charge.
In view of these credit faieilities (and correspondi-g risk
coverage) available to all levels of at rcult-are, it is bel-eved that
sales of urea fror the new TNangal ,L;nt. will not te restricted by payment
problems, especially as a large part if the markec lies in tle well-developed
states of Pmunjab and Haryana where f-niers are relatively prvsperous and a
sabstantial nroportion of agricultnr!irtn.uts are purchased with cash.
I.  IMarketing and rield Acti.Vities
Yarket Research and Sales Promotion
FCI has, to date, recently established three marketing zo?es -
eastern, northern, and south western.  Each zone is headed by a Marketing
Manager and is divided and sub-divided into regions (or States) and areas
respectively.  The ITangal regional orfice is presently located at IJangal
but will move to Chandigarh to handle increased sales after the urea plant
is built. (Moreover, h>e Apex headquarters, as well as the Governments of
Puniab and Haryana are in Chandigarh .) Area headouarters will remain in
New Delhi and will suipervrise new district offices as they are established,
depending on new sales potential'r.
Promotion, publicity and market research are coordinated at
regional office level under guidance from the Chief Agricultural Scientist
in Niew Delhi, who also gives sirilar assistance to other FCI regional
marketing offices throughout the country. This helps to ensure collabora-
tion and uniformity. At Nangal, a market research manager is in charge of
sales and transportation forecasting and planning. Major promotional
activities are soil testing and agronomic advisory services headed by a
deputy chief agronomist who plans and executes numerous field programs,
with the assistance of a staff or soil chemists and demonstrators.



ANNEX h-4
Farmers' education in fertilizer use is being undertaken
mainly through the distribution of appropriate literature, personal
contacts by the field staff (especially those in charge of demonstra-
tions), audio-visual aids, etc. One mobile film unit is already busily
employed. It is proposed to increase these facilities in the future.
Besides, attempts are being made to understand the farmers' problems
and gain their confidence through periodic organization of group dis-
cussions, exhibitions and farm fairs. These events will be considerably
increased in nunber during the next few years. A monthly newsletter
is now directly mailed to farmers, dealers and the field staff, and
circulation will be increased. It is FCI 's objective to develop an
integrated agricultural advisory service as part of the fertilizer
promotion plan, largely through private dealer development.
Field Activities Undertaken in the Two Years 1971 and 1972
These include:
Fertilizer Trials              50
Fertilizer Demonstrations    517
Fert'lizer Festivals           17
F4eld Days                    177
Exhibitions                    10
Film Showv                     27
Soil Analyses                1300
(plus thousands of analyses performed by others)
Discussions with FCI Nangal marketing and sales staff at all
revels, as well as with several company dealers displayed an eagerness
and ability to sell "their own" urea in place of Limited supplies from
elsewhere. This should not be difficult in a region where farmers
generally regard agriculture as a business and know the economic benefits
of regular fertilizer application.

1/  For purposes of the econoadc analysis crude oil prices have been aasumed for Heavy Fuel 011. This can be
considered as a conservative estimate, since Heavy Fuel Oil is a residual refinery product.
2/ The coal used for generating ateam is of a high sulfur and ash content and is not inteznationally traded;
therefore for the purpoae of this analysis it ts ooneidered as non-tradable. Furthemore it is reasonable
to asaume that the increased demand of coal by the project is extremely, smal compared to total available
supply and will leave relative pricest unchanged. Thus the appropriate accounting price for coal to
obtained by evaluating the inputa required to produce the additional anoumts of coal at the soceal costs.
For this purpoee financial coats have been asended as followst Rs.l2 of Rs.35/ton is the estimated unskilled
labor content, which is priced at 50% of notdnal vages; Rs.5/ton transfer pqyent have been excluded In the
econowie price, For trwnsportation oosta the scale 45 of railway tarifr has been used because this tariff
is closer to average ooats than lower ooal rate.
/ thekilled labor content in Jute precessing (75%) is priced at 50% of nawinml wages and RJ.3 transfer payment
have been excluded.

UP,A WORLD PRICES
General
India imports large amounts of urea annually for distribution
via tl-h" Central Fertilizer Pool. Wlhile quantities in recent years have
diminished (1 million tons in 1969 compared to 776,000 tons in 197l! the
impact of world availability and price trends needs to be exarined in
view of their effects on donestic production policies and prices.
In the last fifteen years, world urea demand grew from about
300,000 TPY to some 18 million TPY today. Urea is now the predominant
form of nitrogen fertilizer, displacing traditional materials such as
ammonium sulfate and ammonium nitrate.  Looking ahead, no large-scale
substitute nitrogen fertilizer in term of efficacy and delivered
nutrient cost to farmers can be foreseen at the present time, except for
anhydrous or acueous ammonia. (To date, use of these materials is limited
to e-'zntries having appropriate, highly-developed distribution and applica-
tion syrstans for "direct application" and liquid fertilizer use and thus
not likely to be employed in India in the near future).
Price Trends
World urea prices have typically followed those for other man-
made commodities, i.e. moving fron an initial high to an unrealistic low
(due to plant overbuilding and technical developments permitting the con-
struction of huge installations) ardl then to in intermediate, more rational
price level. Whereas in the early 1960's export prices for bagged material
from the small plants then in vogue exceeded $100 per ton CIF India, by
1970 corresponding prices had fallen to the $55-$60 ton range for urea
made in plants ten times larger, especially those based on low-cost
natural gas feedstock.
Ilore recently, however, FOB prices began to rise. In 1970
and 1971 some 200,000 tons of bagged urea were inported from 3urope by
India at about $55 per ton FOB or $75 CIF. In addition, 53,000 tons were
supplied by Iran, I;uwait and South Kcrea at about `51 per FOB or $55 CIF
and 75,000 tons from Japan at $61 and '68 per ton respectively. In the
first half of 1972, about 120,000 tons of urea were imported by India from
-urope at `56 to $59 FOB or $67 to $69 CIF.  Also some 270,000 tons were
shipped from Iran, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia at about $60 FOB or $65 CIF.
(These CIF prices reflect very low prevailing freight rates which are
expected to return to higher levels and gradually escalate). Further urea
price trends were discussed, during June 1972, with several brokers, and
Nitrex (Zurich) as well as British aulphur Corporation and International
Superohosphate Manufacturers Association in London, and their views support
the foregoing reasons for an upward movement in world urea prices.  Most
current bids are about 10% higher than last year; a recent tender from
Bangladesh, for example, brought bids ranging from South Korean bagged
material at $63.5 per ton to European urea at $75.6 per ton, both c.i.f.
basis. Some recent offers for 1973 shinments to India range between $70
to $77 per ton c.i.f.  The above organizations were confident that typical



ANNEX 9-2
Page 2
world urea prices, bagged, c.i.f. India are likely to be at least in the
$65 to $70 range for several years, and could go $5 per ton higher.  No
earious concern was expressed about the possible depressant effects on
Indian imported urea prices due to large plants under construction or
planned in Columbia and Venezuela. These plants are understood to be
behind schedule and furthermore, likely major markets will be the gas-short
ULS. and some countries in Latin America, as well as Western Eurove. For the
economic evaluation of the Nlangal expansion project, an estimate of US $65
per ton of urea, bagged, c.i.f. India, has been used, compared to the above-
mentioned forecasts of at least $65-$70 on the same basis.
Trends towards higher FOB prices are likely to continue for the
following reasons;
Rising Feedstock Prices
Feedstock prices are higher and countries in North Africa, the
Middle East and South America have begun to realize the value of their
natural gas resources; accordingly they have greatly reduced wastage frorti
flaring. Also, they are having second thoughts about nroducing low-cost
ammonia and other products based on gas-field eosts of 5 to 10 cents per
million Btu. Sales of liquified natural gas (LNG) to the U.S. and Europe
at FOB prices of 30 to 40 cents per million Btu are more profitable and
the volume of LNG exports is expected to increase greatly, especially to
Xhe U.S.
In addition, 11orth America and -Lurope now realize their supplies
of' gas reserves are not inexhaustable. Cooseauentlyr goviernm-ents ar!d gas-
producing companies are controlling outputs to an increasing degree. This
is resulting in appreciable price escalation; in U.S.A., for example, some
natural gas contracts originally let at about $0.20 per nillion Btu are
being renewed at double this figure, or more. Armonia-urea plants based
on naphthia and fuel oil are also faced with rising .eedstock prices.  This
is due not only to increasing crude Prices, but also to growring feedstock
demands from synthetic natural gas i;C) plants and other petrochemical
processes.
Higher Bagging Costs
Similarly bagging ard handling costs are increasing.  Discussions
with fertilizer producers in many countries reveal escalating bagging and
handling costs, even though these operations are highly mechanized. In
fact, mechanization, although reducing total bagging and handling costs, can
make these operations more sensitive to wage increases for direct labor
and maintenance, as well as rising capital needs. Furthermore, stricter
bagging specifications in terms of better containers, moisture-proofing,
sealing, etc., have also increased bagging expenses. Whereas a few years
ago, '5 to $6 per ton was a typical bagging cost, most fertilizer producers
in industrialized caontries indicate $8 to $10 per ton to be a more
realistic bagging-cost range.



ANNEX 9-2
Page 3
Escalating Capital, Start-up and Operating Costs
Plant construction, start-up and operating costs have increased
sharply in recent years. Few large aimonia and urea plants bullt in the
last decade throughout the world have achieved planned construction and
start-up schedules and costs, even in highly-developed countries. A 6 to 12
month delay can reduce a calculated return on investment by 2-4%, and
purchasing substitute product in the meantime is an additional excess
cost. Hence, long construction timn-lags in the field, plus a subsequent
inability to achieve rated production rapidly, have virtually eliminated
the opportunity for some ammonia/urea plants to make acceptable rates of
return on existing sales contracts. Accordingly, realistic sale3 agree-
ments reflect (or should) the probability of initial excess costs occurring
due to plant construction and start-up delays, and resuaiting higher costs
(or smaller profits).
Similarly, many large ammonia/urea and other petrochemical
plants have had difficulty in maintaining rated capacity, often because
of mechanical problems rather than fundamental design errors.  In efforts
to minimize installed costs, little margin has been left for equipment
that is not quite up to specification, and modification or replacement
can be expensive in terms of extra capital cost and lost production.
Built-in insurance against such problems is therefore prudent
even though initial plant cost is likely to be greater, and realistic
sales contracts must recognize the corresponding additional financial
return necessary. Another additional cost burden that has to be recovered
in most operating and planned projects is the capital and operating expense
of pollution control, which can add about 10% to fixed :Lnvestment and
several percent to operating cost, depending on circumstances. No new
technology offering substantial cost reduction, or significant economies
of scale obtainable by building much larger single-train plants are
foreseen at the present time.
