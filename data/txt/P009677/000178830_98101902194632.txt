INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMNDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA
FOR A FERTILIZER PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit to India in an amount equivalent to US$58 million on standard IDA
terms to help finance the Nangal Fertilizer Expansion Project.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The most recent economic report, "Economic Situation and Prospects
of India" (SA-32a, dated May 10, 1972), was distributed to the Executive
Directors on June 2, 1972. This report estimated that, for the Indian Fiscal
Year ending on March 31, 1972, the economy grew at significantly less than 4
percent. For the current year, growth is expected to be even lower, and in-
deed there is the prospect that there may not be any growth at all. The prin-
cipal factor in the decline this year has been the serious failure of the
monsoon. In comparing the rate of economic growth achieved over the past two
years with the average of 5 percent per annum experienced during the preceding
two years, account should be taken of the fact that the Indian econonv under-
went two years of bad weather in a period of sharply falling foreign aid and
provided substantial economic aasistance to Bangladesh.
3.        Until the beginning of 1972, performance in the industrial sector
had been especially disappointing, with a downward trend from a growth rate
of 7.1 percent in 1969 to 4.5 percent in 1971. However, the figure for 1971
obscures some improvement which began to take place during the last quarter
and which was sustained during the first quarter of 1972. Over these six
months industrial production increased by 7.2 percent compared with the same
period the year before. But this improvement now has to be qualified,
firstly because much of it was confined to the textile industry which re-
covered from the effects of a severe shortage of raw cotton, and secondly
because recent data indicate that no further increase in industrial output
occurred during the latter part of 1972. The factors which have brought
about this situation include lack of demand for certain capital goods, shor-
tage of imported raw materials, labor unrest, power shortages, as well as
managerial difficulties, especially in the steel industry. Cumbersome admiin-
istrative procedures in applying industrial policy have also aggravated the
situation. These factors have been present in varying degrees almost con-
tinuously over the past decade with the result that India's industrial poten-
tial has yet to be fully realized. What marks the last three years is the
severity of the deceleration in industrial activity notwithstanding the
modest reprieve gained in the early part of 1972. The Government of India
(GOI) recognizes that fresh initiatives must be taken through industrial
policy measures and the Association has recently held discussions in India
on a possible role for IDA and the Bank in aiding the Government. It is too
early to state any conclusions beyond noting that the GOI is reviewing its
approach to industry as a whole and to steel and fertilizer in particular.

4.        Agricultural production registered an increase of over 5 per-
cent in each of the first two years of the Fourth Plan, with foodgrain
production reaching 108 million tons in 1970/71. In 1971/72 foodgrain
production was affected by ra-ther indifferent weather, with the result
that only an estimated 106 mi:Llion tons were produced. This year weather
conditions have been disastrous with a complete failure of the monsoon in
both the west and east sides of the country, an unusual occurrence. Mean-
ingful estimates have still to be made but clearly production of summer
foodgrains will be substantially below last year's level. The current
winter crop has also been adversely affected by lack of rain, with the re-
sult that India is likely to endure very serious shortages of food over
large parts of the country. The Government had hoped that large foodgrain
stocks built up between 1968 and 1970 would be adequate to meet require-
ments in bad years. But the combined effect of supplying foodgrain to
Bangladesh and the severity of the drought this year has led to foodgrain
stocks being reduced by about half, to 3-4 million tons at the end of 1972.
These stocks are now being depleted at a rate of one million tons a month.
The Government has decided to import about two million tons of foodgrains
and more may be required if the winter crop does not recover from the ini-
tial lack of rain. Other crops have also been affected. Jute and, to a
lesser extent, cotton production are expected to be lower, while the short-
age of oil seeds may be quite severe with the resulting need for higher im-
ports.
5.        In the present situation, the generally favorable trend in
agricultural production over the past several years should not be over-
looked. Even if this yearl"s f'oodgrain crop should be between 95 and 100
million tons, it would still be significantly above that obtained in the
last serious drought year, 1965/66, when production reached only 72 million
tons. This would indicate that the considerable investments in irrigation
facilities, fertilizer, and other agricultural inputs have had the effect of
reducing the impact of droughts. If yields this year remain high on irri-
gated land in spite of adverse weather conditions, and reports of good crops
in the Pumjab and Haryana are favorable indications, this will confirm the
success of the new technology and highlight the need to broaden its use
within India.
6.        The wholesale price index increased at a rate of 7.5 percent be-
tween April 1972 and August 1972. An important factor has been the rapid
increase of food prices, which went up by 13 percent over this period re-
flecting expected foodgrain shortages. In an effort to control inflation,
the Government has limited the overdraft facilities available to State
governments, previously a source of deficit spending, and is considering
measures to control more effectively the level of foodgrain prices, but
such steps are likely to be offset by the relief programs necessitated by
the drought.
7.        India's net reserve position at the end of August was US$1,180
million or the equivalent of 38 percent of annual imports, plus debt ser-
vice payments. Reserves have fallen by nearly US$100 million since March
1972.  Further pressure on the country's declining reserves from foodgrain



-3-
imports is inevitable. On the export side, recent estimates indicate a
10 percent increase in exports between April and August this year, as
compared with the corresponding period last year. But overall, the rate
of growth of exports has been slow in the recent past while uncertainty
surrounds future levels of net aid. In the circumstances, India should
clearly continue to receive substantial aid from IDA.
8.        A draft document setting out the approach to the Fifth Plan for
the period 1974/75 to 1978/79 has already been approved by the Planning
Commission and is now under review by the cabinet.  Economic self-reliance
and the elimination of poverty are held to be the major tasks of the Fifth
Plan. In the light of the experience of the Fourth Plan, considerable
effort will be required to achieve the 5.5 percent annual growth which is
the target for the Fifth Plan period.
9.        A country data sheet is attached as Annex I.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN INDIA
10.       Since 1949 the Bank has made 40 loans and 46 development credits
to India totalling US$1,110 million and US$1,956 million (both net of can-
cellation), respectively. Of these amounts, US$554 million has been re-
paid and US$772 million is still undisbursed. Annex II contains a summary
statement of disbursements as of December 31, 1972, and notes on the status
of currently active loans and credits.
11.       Since 1957 IFC has made 13 commitments in India totalling US$42.3
million of which US$4.3 million has been repaid, US$7.0 million sold and
US$6.0 million cancelled.  Of the balance of US$25.0 mil1ion, US$16.9
million represents loans and US$8.1 million equity. A summary statement
of IFC operations as of December 31, 1972, is also included in Annex II
(page 2).
12.       The emphasis of Bank Group assistance to India in recent years
has been on agriculture and agriculture-related projects. This reflects
the importance of agriculture, which contributes about 50 percent of India's
GNP, and the corresponding investment priorities of the Government. In
addition to the Agricultural Universities project, which was signed on
November 10, and the present proposal, projects in agricultural credit, in
agro-industries, and in agricultural markets are expected to be ready for
consideration by the Executive Directors this fiscal year.
13.       While the emphasis of Bank Group assistance will be on agricul-
ture, lending to industry will also be a prominent feature of the program
for this fiscal year. Assistance to the industrial sector will concentrate
on the support of development finance institutions through a credit for
the Industrial Development Bank of India, which was approved on January 9,
and a proposed tenth loan to the Industrial Credit and Investment Corpora-
tion of India. Industry will further benefit from an eighth Industrial
Imports credit which will be submitted later. Assistance to infrastructure



- 4 -
will be proposed through further projects for power transmission, tele-
communications and urban development. India's large cities, particularly
Bombay and Calcutta, require major investment in public services to keep
up with the growth of their populations; accordingly, a Bombay water sup-
ply and sewerage project and an urban development project in Calcutta are
also included in this year's program.
PART III - THE FERTILIZER SECTOR AN) THE PFOJECT
14.      Increased fertilizer production is an essential part of India's
program to increase agricultural production. The output of foodgrains,
particularly the high-yielding varieties of wheat and rice, is a function
of the overall fertilizer application rate, which in India is very low.
15.       Since 1964, nitrogen production and consumption have increased
at average annual rates of about 20 percent and 22 percent, respectively,
but production still lags far behind consumption. In 1971/72 some 820,000
tons of nitrogen, almost half of total consuoption, was imported, at a
total estimated foreign exchange cost of at least $120 million.
16.       Projections of demand and supply through the end of the decade
show a continuing deficit, even assuming optimistic start-up schedules
for new projects and high capacity utilization for all plants. The pro-
jections used by IDA assume that nitrogen consumption will grow about 20
percent compounded annually to 1974 and about 12 percent thereafter, leading
to total consu.mption of some 14.6 million tons by 1979 (compared with 1.9
million tons for 1972). During the same period, supply is projected to
increase to about 3.9 million tons from a current level of about 1.0 million
tons.
17.       The projected deficit is particularly large in northern India,
where the project will be located. Fertilizer consumption per unit of
cropped acre in the Punjab is over three times as great as for India as
a whole. According to current; estimates, a shortage equivalent to the
production of at least two additional large plants will persist in northern
TLnia rit the end of the decade, even with the proposed Nangal urea project
in full operation.
18.       The Bank Group has recently been active in the fertilizer field
in India. IDA has made two Credits, for expansions by the Fertilisers
and Chemicals (Travancore) Ltcl. (FACT) in Cochin and by the Gorakhpur Unit
of the Fertilizer Corporation of India (FCI). These have experienced some
initial delays but project implementation is now proceeding at a satisfac-
tory rate. IFC has participated in two private sector fertilizer projects:
Indian Explosives Ltd., in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh, and Zuari-Agro-Chemicals
Ltd., in Goa. Indian Explosives is already operating, and Zuari Agro is
about to commence operations. In addition, the Bank Group is now considering
twc other fertilizer projects  FCI Trombay, near Bombay, and Tata Chemicals,



-5-
in Gujarat State.
19.       The proposed credit would help finance the modification and ex-
pansion of FCI's Nangal Unit. Located in the State of Punjab in northern
India, the existing Nangal plant has an annual design capacity of 80,000
tons per year of nitrogen in the form of calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN)
fertilizer and 14 tons per year of heavy water as by-product. The expan-
sion project would provide capacity for producing an additional 152,000
tons per year of nitrogen in the form of urea, now the most popular fer-
tilizer in India and in most other countries. It would also replace the power-
intensive electrolysis section of the existing, fully depreciated ammonia
plant, thus permitting release of a large amount of hydroelectric power for
more economic uses in the area; the manufacture of heavy water would be
discontinued but other existing production (CAN) and off-site facilities
would be retained. The feedstock for the new (as well as the existing)
fertilizer production facilities would be heavy fuel oil, of which in pre-
sent circumstances India has relatively large quantities, but crude oil
could be used as an alternative, if desired.
20.       The Nangal Unit began operations in 1961 and has been FCIfs most
profitable plant, not only because it has been operated efficiently but
also because of the low price it pays for power, a price only about one-
fourth of the opportunity cost of power. The plant operated consistently
at close to full capacity until power shortages arose about two years ago.
These have reduced fertilizer output at Nangal by about 30 percent. The
power shortages are likely to continue and are an added reason for shutting
down the existing electrolysis plant.
21.       The plant designs and proposed capacities for the project reflect
efficient and commercially proven technology. FCI will act as overall prime
contractor for the project, with major parts of the design, procurement and
erection supervision of the ammonia plant and the urea plant subcontracted to
Fr. Uhde (Federal Republic of Germany) and to Montedison (Italy), respectively
It is expected that the project will start commercial production after a con-
struction period of 34 mt.      Uhde and Montedison-will have major responaibilities
for execution of the project, in order to help ensure its completion within the
proposed budget and time schedule. A Project Manager has been appointed, and
his responsibilities -- together with a detailed project implementation plan --
have been defined and are acceptable to the Association.
22.       The cost of the project is estimated at about US$106 million
equivalent, including interest during construction, with a maximum foreign
exchange component of about US$58 million.  The cost of equipment is es-
timated at US$44.5 million equivalent, the remainder being the cost of en-
gineering, design, project management, freight and handling, civil works,
duties and taxes, and contingencies. The proposed credit would be dis-
bursed primarily against expenditures for equipment subject to international
competitive bidding (US$42.2 million), with Indian suppliers receiving a 15
percent preference. (The prevailing import duty on equipment is now 30 per-
cent.) It is expected that Indian bidders will win about 10 percent of such
contracts. Another US$2.5 million would be disbursed for proprietary items



- 6 -
required for standardization, and US$7.5 million toward the costs of en-
gineering, design, erection and cormmissioning.  A small amount of non-
critical equipment (about 4 percent of the total) would be reserved for
domestic suppliers and financed out of GOI funds.
23.       The proceeds of the proposed credit (US$58 million) would be
passed on by GOI to ECI as long-term debt, at 8.5 percent interest for
15 years, including 5 years of grace. GOI would provide the remaining
US$48 million equivalent as equity, and would also provide any overrun
financing required, at least half as equity.  Thus, about 55 percent of
the financing for the project would be provided to FCI in the form of debt
and 45 percent in equity. This is slightly higher than the usual propor-
tion of debt for financing new FCI projects; but the Nangal plant has no
outstanding long-term debt, and the debt:equity ratio of the plant after
expansion will not exceed 35:65, a satisfactory level which will allow
Nangal always to have a debt service coverage of better than 2.2:1. The
financial return on the project would be about 18 percent before taxes and
14 percent after taxes.
24.       The project's retw-ns are satisfactory.  Using a conservative
urea import price of US$65 per ton, c.i.f. India, the economic rate of
return of the project is about 15 percent. This is quite good for a fer-
tilizer plant in India, since Indian producers do not have access to natural
gas, a relatively low-cost and convenient feedstock. If revenues and costs
of the project were considered on an incremental basis, thereby including
in the economic analysis of the project the shutting down of the electro-
lysis section of the existing plant and the release of hydroelectric power
for more econornic uses, the economic return would becone about 22 percent.
25.       FCI is the largest fertilizer producer in India; at present it
accounts for 30 percent of Indiats nitrogen and 10 percent of phosphate
capacity. The project forms part of an ambitious expansion program in-
volving nine plants now under construction and three in an advanced planning
stage. This program will, by 1980, increase nitrogenous and phosphatic fer-
tilizer production 5.4 and 9.3 times respectively over 1970 levels. While
projects have been financed on a conservative 1 to 1 debt to equity ratio,
FI's earnings record has been unsatisfactory (about 1.5 percent return on
capital in recent years), due mainly to operating problems in existing
plants and serious delays in plant construction.  In the next two years
annual losses of about Rs 20 million are expected because of continuing pro-
duction difficulties and the expected start-up losses of three large fer-
tilizer plants which are more than two years behind schedule. During that
period, EI may need Government assistance to service its debt. Thereafter
FCI's financial situation should show substantial improvement, provided it
gives priority to bringing new plants into operation more quickly and to
increasing overall utilization of existing capacity.
26.       The Government and FCI agree that priority should be given to
achieving maximum use of existing capacity and commissioning projects under
construction. Careful examination of FCI's further expansion plans



-7-
is needed to bring them better into line with FCl's resources: managerial,
technical and financial. The method of carrying out the Nangal expansion
project and also the subsequent expansion at Trombay are examples showing
how further investments can be taken up reasonably, notwithstanding these
constraints. The Government is presently preparing the fertilizer invest-
ment program for the Fifth Five Year Plan (1974/75 - 1978/79).  In addition
to feasibility studies of specific project proposals, studies to determine
organizational constraints are being undertaken by the Planning Commission.
The Bank has recently been asked to review the investment program and to
comment on it. This review will present an opportunity to discuss the
specific steps which FCI and the Government are proposing to overcome FCI's
present difficulties. Furtihermore, this review is expected to lead to the
identification of future fertilizer projects suitable for Bank Group assis-
tance.
27.       Annex III provides a Project and Credit Summary.
PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
28.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between India and the
International Development Association, the draft Project Agreement between
FCI and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee provided for
in Article V, Section 1(d) of the Articles of Agreement and the Text of the
Resolution approving the proposed Development Credit are being distributed
to the Executive Directors separately. The draft agreements generally con-
form to the pattern of the earlier agreements for the Cochin and Gorakhpur
fertilizer projects in India.
29.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit will comply with the
Articlesof Agreement of the Association.
PART V - RECOMMENDATIONS
30.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.

C.  PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Ln No. 307     Indian Iron and Steel Company; US$19.5 million loan of
December 22, 1961; Closing date: December 31, 1973
This loan was made in 1961 and the original closing date was
January 31, 1967. The implementation of the project has been affected by
technical and managerial difficulties connected with the opening of new
collieries to supply IISCO's stee:L plant. The Bank, together with technical
consultants, has been providing constant supervision and progress is being
made in resolving the technical issues. On the managerial side, the
Government of India announced on July 20, 1972, that it was taking over
the management of IISCO for two years.   The Government has assured us that
this action will not interfere with IISCO's obligation to the Bank. On
November 30, 1972, US$2 million remained undisbursed of which about US$1.25
million has been earmarked for equipment on order and technical services,
while US$0.75 million may be cancelled by the closing date of December 1973.
A review mission recently examined IISCO's rehabilitation program and its
financing requirements.
Ln No. 414     Sixth Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India
Project; US$48.3 million loan of May 28, 1965; Closing
date: June 30, 1973
Ln No. 515     Seventh Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of
India Project; US$25.0 million loan of September 10, 1967;
Closing date: December 31, 1973
Ln No. 683     Eighth Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of
India Project; US$40.0 million loan of June 3, 1970;
Closing date: September 30, 1974
Ln No. 789     Ninth Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India
Project; US$60.0 million loan of October 21, 1971; Closing
date: December 31, 1976
These loans have supported industrialization in India through a
well-established development finance company. There have been delays in
disbursements on the two earliest loans 414-IN and 515-IN as a result of
the business slowdown in the years following 1967. The original closing
date of June 30, 1970, for 414-IN has been extended three times to June 30,
1973 and that for 515-IN twice, from December 31, 1971 to December 31, 1973.
ICICI has taken steps to overcome delays in disbursements and has been
utilizing the funds provided in the two most recent loans, 683-IN and 789-IN,
at a rate faster than anticipated.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any pro-
blems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding
that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths
and weaknesses in project execution.

Cr No. 89      Beas Equipment; US$23.0 million credit of June 29, 1966:
Closing date:  December _31, 1973
The purpose of this credit is to provide part of the foreign
exchange cost of imported equipment and services required to develop hydro-
electric power from the Beas River, to extend irrigation in the Punjab and
Rajasthan and for associated construction works. The project, which has
been subject to some delays, is part of a larger scheme for the integrated
development of the eastern rivers of the lndus Basin. The balance of the
credit outstanding is to be spent on items scheduled for delivery over the
next 12-18 months. As a result, the original closing date of December 31,
1972, has been postponed to December 31, 1973.
Ln No. 614     Tarai Seeds; IJS$13.0 million loan of June 18, 1969;
Closing date: December 31, 1974
This loan to the Tarai Development Corporation is to assist in
the development of seeds of high yielding varieties of crops. Bids for
equipment of one of the two seed-processing plants have been rejected because
these bids are considered to be unresponsive; the matter is under review.
In addition, a major difficuLty arose because of a lack of response to tenders
for land-levelling. As a result of these various delays, a mission visited
the project to review the siituation and has now proposed certain changes
which should ensure the execution of the project.
Ln No. 615     Telecommunical:ions III; US$27.5 million loan of June 18,
1969; Closing date: June 30, 1973
The project, which was financed 50 percent by a Bank loan and
50 percent by an IDA credit( 153-IN) was designed to assist in financing
the telecommunications expansion program for the first three years of the
Fourth Plan period (1969-1972). Credit 153-IN was disbursed fully three
months prior to the closing date, but the closing date for Loan 615-IN has
had to be postponed from December 31, 1972, to June 30, 1973. Although
disbursements have taken place broadly in line with the original schedule,
there have been delays in meeting project targets of about nine months for
local exchange installations and up to two years for long distance network,
resulting from difficulties experienced by local factories and delivery
delays of some key items. In recent months the situation has improved,
especially at the local factories.
Cr No. 176     Kadana Irrigation; US$35.0 million credit of February 9,
1970; Closing date: September 30, 1976
This project will finance in part the construction of Kadana
Dam on the Mahi River, the expansion of the irrigated area below the dam,
and the resettlement of inhabitants in the reservoir area in the States of
Gujarat and Rajasthan.   The project also includes canalization, land levelling,
the construction of field channels, drainage works and roads, and a program
to support agricultural development. The project is likely to be completed
about two years behind schedule. A major problem has been the failure of
the prime contractor on the dam itself; the Government was forced to



ANNEX II
Page 5
discharge his contractor in October 1971 and to undertake the work by
departmental force account. Since that time the Public Works Department has
been making satisfactory progress. Drainage works in the right bank area
are likely to be more extensive and more costly than expected and may not
be completed until 1978. The outlook for other components of the project
remains satisfactory. As the delays in implementation have occurred at the
start of the project, and also before major investments have been made,
both investment costs and benefits will be deferred. Thus the effect of
these delays upon the economic rate of return is not likely to be
significant.
Cr No. 191     Gujarat Agricultural Credit Project; US$35.0 million credit
of June 3, 1970; Closing date: June 30, 1974
Cr No. 203     Punjab Agricultural Credit Project; US$27.5 million credit
of June 24, 1970; Closing date: December 31, 1973
Cr No. 226     Andhra Pradesh Agricultural Credit Project; US$24.2 million
credit of January 8, 1971; Closing date: June 30, 1974
Cr No. 249     Haryana Agricultural Credit Project; US$25.0 million credit
of June 11, 1971; Closing date: March 31, 1975
Cr No. 250     Tamil Nadu Agricultural Credit Project; US$35.0 million
credit of June 11, 1971; Closing date: December 31, 1974
Cr No. 278     Mysore Agricultural Credit Project; US$40.0 million credit
of January 7, 1972; Closing date: October 31, 1975
Cr No. 293     Maharashtra Agricultural Credit Project; US$30.0 million
credit of March 29, 1972; Closing date: -December 31, 1975
Of these seven agricultural credit projects, which total US$216.9
million, the Maharashtra project is not yet effective and Mysore project
has only recently been declared effective (September 25, 1972). With the
exception of the Punjab project, which has only a mechanization component,
all are similar in structure, being designed to provide long- and medium-
term credit to farmers through credit institutions and the commercial
banks for such on-farm investments as tractors, minor irrigation and land-
levelling. Such projects are characteristically slow disbursing since they
are complex and involve very large numbers of small loans to individuals,
each of which has to be appraised and processed. Nevertheless, implementation
and disbursement have been much slower than was originally anticipated. By
November 30, 1972, only US$3.3 million out of US$35 million had been
disbursed under the first of the series to be approved -- the Gujarat
project, which became effective in September 1970 and which has a closing
date of June 30, 1974. No disbursements have been made in the Punjab
project and only relatively small amounts have been disbursed in the other
three projects which have been current for more than one year. The
closing date for the Punjab agricultural credit project has been extended
by one year to December 31, 1973. In all US$7.4 had been disbursed by
November 30, 1972.



ANNEX II
Page 6
There are a number of factors which have contributed to the
situation, the most important of which, quantitatively, are the problems
which have been encountered in the procurement of tractors (which account
for almost 30 percent of the credits). Two events, the imposition by the
Government of India of a 30 percent import duty and the realignment of
the rates of exchange of intiernational currencies, were mainly responsible
for delays, although difficulties were also experienced in finalizing tender
documents. Only in the case of Gujarat credit did an order for the first
tranche of tractors predate these events, and in that case disbursements
are being made. The effect of the duty was to increase prices of imported
tractors so considerably that doubts were raised as to whether effective
demand for such models remained. These doubts have still to be put to
the test. The exchange realignment was instrumental in distorting bid
prices to the extent that, al: the last mDment, the Goverment decided to
withdraw the Punjab tender and to re-advertise. Only recently have fresh
bids been received and it is hoped that prices will shortly be advertised
to farmers in the case of the Punjab credit. Tender invitations in the
case of the other credits are delayed pending the results obtained in the
Punjab case.
It is still uncertain whether the full number of tractors involved
in these credits (some 21,000)) will, in fact, be required. If they are
not, consideration will have to be given to restructuring the projects by
the re-allocation of proceeds to other components or to cancellation. The
situation should become clearer in the next few months. If a requirement
for net imports remains and if effective demand has been restored, disburse-
ment should be fairly rapid.
The long delays experienced in disbursing against the minor
irrigation components of these credits have stemmed from the need to
establish in the States, Groundwater Directorates capable of providing
the technical advice and appraisal required if an economic utilization of
groundwater is to be obtained and if investments are not to lead to
overinvestment or underutilization of scarce resources. The establishment
and staffing of these organizations has been a prolonged process but there
are now indications that lending for minor irrigation is proceeding
satisfactorily and further delays in disbursement are not anticipated.
In several credits, the delays caused by such time-consuming
institutional reform have been exacerbated by resistance to the more
stringent lending terms imposed by the credits which have caused farmers
to seek finance from sources other than those to be refinanced by IDA.
This particular problem now seems to have been overcome as interest rates
in the sector and other lending conditions stabilize around the norms
established by these projects.
A mission has recently visited India to assess in detail the
difficulties and constraints being encountered with project implementation
and disbursements and will shortly be making recommendations for changes
considered necessary to accelerate performance.

Cr No. 230     Agro-Aviation; US$6.0 million credit of January 28, 1971
Closing date: December 31, 1974
The project was designed to improve facilities for aerial spraying
of pesticides, as part of India's plant protection program. So far no
disbursements have taken place because the Government is considering the
procurement arrangements for the importation of aircraft. The matter is
now before a Cabinet Sub-Committee and the Association is awaiting the
Government's decision.
Cr No. 241     Telecommunications IV; US$78.0 million credit of May 3,
1971; Closing date: December 31, 1974
This project is a continuation of Telecommunications III and
has been designed to support the telecommunications expansion program over
the last two years of the Fourth Plan (1969-74). Procurement action for
delivery of imported goods in 1973/74 has been largely completed. Produc-
tion problems in local factories delayed initial disbursement by about
6-9 months. However, production has now picked up and as of November 30,
1972, US$2.1 million had been disbursed under the credit. Full disbursement
is expected by the closing date of December 1974.
Cr No. 242     Power Transmission II; US$75.0 million credit of May 3
1971; Closing date: September 30, 1975
This project, a continuation of the project financed by Loan
416-IN, is designed to assist in financing the purchase of equipment and
materials required to develop a power transmission program in nine States
under the Fourth Five-Year Plan. Initial delays occurred because of problems
associated with preparing bid document suitable for international bidding
and the analysis of the very large number of bids involved, but contract
award recommendations have now been received for major equipment so that
more rapid disbursement can now be expected. Disbursements should be
completed by the closing date of September 30, 1975.
Cr No. 264     Cochin Fertilizer; US$20.0 million credit of July 30, 1971
Closing date: June 30, 1975
This project is intended to help finance the expansion of
fertilizer manufacturing facilities at Cochin. After initial delays, the
project is now proceeding about six months behind schedule. However,
response to tenders has been disappointing and procurement difficulties
and labor problems could lead to additional delays.
Cr No. 267     Wheat Storage; US$5.0 million credit of August 23, 1971
Closing date: September 30, 1975
This credit, which will provide storage facilities in India's
wheat belt, was declared effective on November 14, 1972.
