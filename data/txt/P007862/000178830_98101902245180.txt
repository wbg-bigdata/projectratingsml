INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF PARAGUAY
FOR A PREINVESTMENT STUDIES PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
Development Credit to the Republic of Paraguay for the equivalent of US$4.0
million on standard IDA terms to help finance the proposed Preinvestment
Studies Project. The proceeds of the credit allocated to finance preinvest-
ment studies would be made available to the Central Bank on the same terms
and conditions; the Central Bank would onlend the proceeds to public sector
agencies for seven years, including 2 years of grace, at 6% per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The latest economic report on Paraguay (299a-PA) was distributed to
the Executive Directors on May 10, 1974. It was designed to assess current
developments and provide a medium-term perspective of the Paraguayan economy.
An updating report is being prepared and is scheduled for distribution to the
Executive Directors in November 1975. Country Data sheets are provided in
Annex I.
3.        Despite the heavy dependence on agriculture (about one-third of GDP
and 90% of export earnings in 1974) and the intrinsic difficulties in achiev-
ing high production levels in this sector, the incipient stage of industrial
development, the handicap stemming from Paraguay's landlocked position and the
disadvantages inherent in the country's remoteness from the major world mar-
kets, the Paraguayan economy achieved an overall real growth rate of 4.6% per
annum in the 1962-72 decade. Moreover, this growth was achieved in an environ-
ment of monetary stability and balance-of-payments equilibrium. (During the
1962-72 period the average inflation rate was only 3.1% and the dollar value
of the guarani was maintained at the level fixed in 1954).
4.        Growth of output accelerated appreciably during 1971-74, when GDP
grew at an average rate of 7.2% per annum. The rise in aggregate supply came
principally from an expansion in agricultural production, which grew at 9% per
annum both in 1973 and 1974. The performance of agriculture is particularly
impressive because it was achieved against a background of 2.9% average annual
growth rate in the 1962-72 period, which barely kept pace with population
growth. On the demand side, the rise in external demand was the single most
important factor in accelerating growth. Exports of goods, which in 1967-69
represented some 13% of GDP, increased at the turn of the decade and reached
14.4% of GDP in 1972-74.
5.        While the strengthening of external demand was a phenomenon beyond
Paraguay's control, the supply response was the result of a consistent effort
on the part of the Government to improve the country's transport infrastructure
and implement a comprehensive set of programs designed to increase and diver-
sify exports, particularly in agriculture.



-2-
6.        After several years of faltering performance, public finances im-
proved markedly in 1973 and 1974. The current account surplus rose from 1.5%
of GDP in 1972 to 3.5% of GDP in 1974. In the face of mounting inflationary
pressures, the Central Government restrained the growth of budgetary expendi-
tures and used part of the current account surplus to amortize debt with the
monetary authorities.   As a result of this action and of sound monetary manage-
ment, internal inflation, which reached 22% annually after the international
oil price hike of late 1973, slowed down to 2% from February 1974 to February
1975.
7.        In 1974 the strong export effort proved insufficient to compensate
for the fast rising import prices. Moreover, the restriction by the EEC of
beef imports prevented beef exports from reaching previous levels. As a
result, the balance of payments registered a deficit on current account of
US$37.6 million, which was, however, more than offset by sharply increased
capital inflows. The latter contributed to an increase of US$38.0 million
in the net foreign exchange reserves of the banking system, which at the
end of 1974 stood at the record level of US$77 miillion.
8.        Paraguayan economic prospects appear to be favorable over the medium-
and long-term. Extensive areas of unused land suitable for agriculture, live-
stock and forestry provide opportunities for large-scale colonization and
expanded production. Technological improvements, now under way, are expected
to increase substantially the productivity of land already under cultivation.
The country's vast hydropower resources, which will be exploited in associa-
tion with Brazil and Argentina, will provide a plentiful source of cheap
energy and foreign exchange earnings. Additional transportation facilities
will permit the opening of new agricultural land, while enhancing further
Paraguay's competitive position in world markets. Finally, the sustained
development of industries based on agriculture and forestry will increase the
value-added content of Paraguayan exports.
9.        A strategy designed to foster economic growth on the basis of inten-
sive exploitation of the country's comparative advantage is likely to succeed
in accelerating income growth and in spreading the benefits of growth. The
results to date prove the soundness of this approach; real per capita income
(US$350 in 1973) 1/ increased by 28% during 1967-74. Paraguay does not have
a high level of unemployment (according to the 1972 Census, only 3.5% of the
labor force is unemployed), although underemployment appears to be high (the
International Labor Organization estimates that underemployment is 26% of the
labor force).  While emigration to Argentina has provided an employment out-
let for the increasing labor force (the growth of which is estimated at 2.8%
per annum), the large increase in area planted accomplished during the last
five years has triggered a high demand for labor and has raised rural wages
considerably. It would seem, therefore, that a continuation of the already
1/   World Bank's Atlas Methodology.



-3-
heightened agricultural activity, together with growing infrastructure invest-
ments, is the shortest and safest way to improve incomes and employment in
Paraguay. The Government's economic development program is being designed
along this path.
10.       The Government proposes to increase the level of public investment
in agriculture and transportation in order to sustain the 8% rate of GDP growth
achieved in 1974. Since 1960, 300 publicly sponsored land settlements com-
prising nearly 900,000 ha have been established and have benefited one of
every four agricultural workers in the country. The recent increase in agri-
cultural production has come mainly from medium and small farmers. The
Government, therefore, is giving high priority to programs designed to assist
these farmers in increasing productivity and output. In the case of small
farmers, the emphasis will be on the consolidation of existing colonization
schemes and on the establishment of new ones (only 20% of Paraguay's arable
land is at present under cultivation). To reap the full benefits of
the country's agricultural potential, the Government is also giving high
priority to transport infrastructure in order to facilitate the flow of goods
to markets and export outlets. Through foreign private investment and credit
programs the Government hopes to accelerate the process of agroindustrializa-
tion.
11.       Consistent with the higher public investment objective, the Govern-
ment is already working, with the assistance of OAS and AID, on improving the
country's tax structure and on making tax revenues more elastic to increases
in income to help assure the availability of increased domestic resources to
finance the public investment effort.
12.       As of December 31, 1974, Paraguay's outstanding and disbursed exter-
nal public debt repayable in foreign currency was US$150 million, equivalent
to 11% of GNP. This percentage indicates a low level of indebtedness by world
standards. While during the last five years, external public debt grew at an
average rate of 10% per annum, it is projected that in 1975 it will grow at
a much faster pace (about 20%) due to several large loans in the pipeline.
This also reflects the fact that the pace of external borrowing is accelerating
because of the increased availability of counterpart funds to finance public
investment. The debt service ratio was 10% in 1973, 8.1% in 1974, and is
expected to climb to 13.6% in 1975 and then stabilize at 9-8% of exports
of goods and nonfactor services, provided that the additional capital is
contracted on terms comparable with those of the recent past.
13.       Despite Paraguay's impressive export performance in 1972-74 and the
promising prospects for 1976-80, the country will continue to need additional
inflows of external assistance in order to attain its growth and employment
objectives. Since Paraguay in the past has obtained the bulk of its capital
needs on concessionary terms and since, as a result, its present debt service
ratio is low by international standards, the country's creditworthiness is
not expected to be impaired by additional borrowing likely to materialize
in the near future.



PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN PARAGUAY
14.       Paraguay has received US$83.8 million (net of cancellations) in Bank
loans and IDA credits. Of this amount, US$46.3 million has been in the form
of eight IBRD loans, while six credits totalling US$37.5 million have been
made from IDA resources. As of July 31, 1975, the Bank held US$40.3 million,
including US$24.0 million undisbursed, and IDA US$37.2 million, including
US$16.0 million undisbursed. The amount held by the Bank Group at the end of
1974 was equivalent to 27% of Paraguay's external debt, with roughly a blend
of 40% IDA and 60% IBRD. The service on this debt amounted to 12.3% of total
debt service in 1974, representing less than 1% of exports of goods and
nonfactor services. On a sectoral basis, Bank Group assistance to Paraguay
has been 55% for agriculture, 39% for transportation, and 6% for education.
Execution of Bank Group-financed projects has, on the whole, been satisfactory.
However, disbursements on the US$6 million loan for the Second Highway Mainte-
nance Project were delayed because the Government made insufficient budgetary
provisions for highway maintenance. The problem was resolved when the Govern-
ment appropriated sufficient funds for this purpose in the 1974 Budget.
15.       In 1974, IFC financed a wood processing project.   Its participation,
a US$5.4 million operation with FINAP S.A., consisted of a US$4.0 million loan,
and equity participation of tlS$1.0 million, and a contingent loan for the
financing of cost overruns of US$0.4 million. Annex II contains a summary
of Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC investments as of July 31, 1975, and notes
on the execution of ongoing projects.
16.       Bank Group lending to Paraguay in FY75 consisted of loans for live-
stock and for highway construction and a credit for rural development totalling
US$35.5 million. The EY76 program includes the proposed preinvestment studies
project under consideration today. In addition, work is underway on rural
development, highway maintenance and construction, agroindustry, education,
domestic airports and power projects for possible consideration by the Executive
Directors during the next two years.
17.       In lending to Paraguay, the Bank Group tries to assist the Govern-
ment in achieving four major objectives. These objectives are interdependent
and complementary; hence, it is not possible to rank them in order of priority
or importance. One objective is to spread the benefits of growth more widely
than before and, more particularly, to attack directly the problem of rural
poverty. A second objective is to help Paraguay expand output, including
exports, by supporting projects that directly or' indirectly make large contri-
butions'to production and employment. A third objective is to support programs
that will bring about improvements in the management of the economy and,
particularly, that will help to strengthen publi.c institutions and financial
intermediaries. A fourth objective is to transfer sufficient external re-
sources to complement Paraguay's domestic savings and provide the necessary
funds for maintaining an adequate level of economic and social investments
in a framework of sound domestic finances and a viable balance of payments.
Despite its relative poverty but in view of its improved overall prospects,
we are planning to phase out IDA operations in Paraguay in the near future.



-5-
18.       While the last objective primarily influences the magnitude of the
Bank Group's program in Paraguay, the other three jointly determine its com-
position. Naturally, many operations serve more than one of the ends listed
and may, moreover, support more specific Government objectives. Thus the
preinvestment studies project is not only designed to help strengthen project
preparation in the public sector but also to support the Government's efforts
to maximize the benefits from public investments and to promote better resource
allocation. It is expected that the preinvestment studies project will help
to increase the number of projects suitable for external financing and conse-
quently result in the larger external capital inflows which are deemed neces-
sary to achieve the higher economic growth target. Bank Group assistance for
rural development and education is designed to help ease the rural poverty
problem and to improve the educational standards of the lowest 40% of the
income distribution scale. Bank Group lending for agroindustry is aimed at
increasing the value added of agricultural products destined for export and
at expanding marketing outlets for small farmers. Lastly, loans in the
transport and power sectors are designed explicitly both to transfer resources
to Paraguay and to help improve institutional structures and policies of these
sectors, which play a vital role in supporting the production activities of
the agricultural and industrial sectors.
PART III - THE PUBLIC SECTOR
Structure and Investment Decision
19.       Paraguay's public sector consists of:   (a) the Central Government;
(b) the decentralized agencies; (c) the local governments or municipalities;
and (d) the public enterprises. In 1974, they accounted for 16% of GDP and
17% of gross domestic investment. The Central Government is responsible for
about one-third of the public sector's investment and the public enterprises
for most of the rest. The sectoral allocation of Central Government's
investment during 1965-74 was as follows; infrastructure 67%, social sector
21%, and productive sector 10%. Investments in infrastructure were largely in
road construction and improvement, which were carried out by the Ministry of
Public Works and Communications, and those in the productive and social sectors
were in colonization, health and primary and secondary education. With respect
to the public enterprises, the main investments were made by Administracion
Nacional de Electricidad (power generation and distribution) 63%, Corporacion
de Obras Sanitarias (water and sewage) 14%, and Administracion Nacional de
Telecomunicaciones (telecommunications) 12%.
20.       The Technical Secretariat for Planning (TSP), which reports directly
to the President of the Republic, is responsible for preparing five-year eco-
nomic development plans. These plans define the country's overall development
strategy, and economic growth rate and employment objectives. The plans
also establish minimum investment targets and list the specific projects to
be carried out. In most instances, the so-called project list represents
only ideas about possible projects; it is only at the time of preparing the



annual budget that, based on the stage of readiness of each of the projects,
the investment program for the next twelve months is firmed up and the
required budgetary appropriations recommended to Congress for approval. In
this process, those ministries and/or agencies which in one way or another
are more capable of preparing projects are normally favored and receive the
lion's share of resources regardless of their priority ranking. The ongoing
projects, of course, receive the highest priority in the appropriation of
budgetary resources for investment.
Performance
21.       Despite the increased role assigned to the public sector in the
1971-75 Economic and Social Development Plan public investment as a percentage
of gross domestic investment declined from 23% in 1969 to 17% in 1974. The
Central Government's budgetary stringency during 1970-72 and the contractionary
fiscal policy it pursued thereafter contributed to this situation. As stated,
public finances have improved markedly during the last two years and the
ongoing programs of the Government, designed to increase fiscal revenues,
give confidence that the public sector will be able to finance a much larger
level of investment in the future.
22.       In addition to the foregoing, two problems have affected the execu-
tion of the public investment program: (a) poor coordination at the planning-
budgeting level and (b) an insufficient number cf well prepared projects.
Regarding the first, there is little communication and dialogue among the
different ministries and TSP. Notwithstanding that the Organic Budget Law
provides that the budget must be an instrument for the implementation of the
Plan, TSP is not actively involved in the preparation of the budget nor does
it have a meaningful voice in its content. Consequently, budgetary appropri-
ations are made for some projects which are not given high priority in the
Plan but are ready for implementation. This contributes to resource mis-
allocation and to spreading too thin the Government's funds for investment.
As far as the second problem is concerned, Paraguay's social and economic
development has become more complex and the project preparation mechanism,
which was successful in the past, i.e., limited project preparation by ex-
ternal lenders or by a small number of foreign experts residing in the country,
is no longer adequate to meet the country's objective of accelerated economic
growth and increased employment. The public sector has improved considerably
its administrative capabilities and it is equipped to handle successfully a
much larger investment program. To increase the number of projects, the
Government with the assistance of the IDB has established within TSP a National
Projects Office (NPO). While NPO has made a successful start, it lacks
financial and manpower resources to play a more meaningful role in project
preparation. The Government has also adopted the practice of awarding con-
tracts for project design, construction and financing in single packages.
This practice, however, has very often resulted in high investment and operat-
ing costs, and in projects that do not meet sound technical, economic and
financial criteria.



- 7 -
23.       To improve the implementation of the portion of the public invest-
ment program that is externally financed, assurances were obtained during
negotiations that, within one year from the date of the Credit Agreement,
the Government would take necessary action to establish and maintain NPO
as the executive office of the Committee of External Financing (established
by Decree No. 3797 of March 25, 1969) which is responsible for the coordina-
tion of external financial assistance (Section 4.02 of Development Credit
Agreement). With respect to the implementation of the overall public invest-
ment program, the Government has informed us that, as provided in the Organic
Budget Law, starting in 1976 it will give the Technical Secretariat of Planning
a more active role in the preparation of the National Budget.
Technical Assistance
24.       Of the funds made available to the Government by international
organizations and bilateral donors for technical assistance more than half
has been for general sector studies, one third for institution building and
the rest for preinvestment studies. This assistance has contributed greatly
to improving the general knowledge about the country but it has been insuffi-
cient to increase the number of well-prepared high priority projects in the
public sector.
25.       The Interamerican Development Bank (IDB), the Agency for Inter-
national Development (AID) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)
have programs of technical assistance in Paraguay. IDB recently approved a
US$0.9 million grant to study the possibility of Paraguay supplying labor and
construction materials for the construction of Itaipu (a 12,600 MW hydro-
electric project to be built with Brazil). AID has a US$2 million technical
assistance program in agriculture (farm management, marketing, services and
inputs) designed to help small farmers. UNDP has an ongoing US$7.5 million
program for the period 1972-76, which is fully committed. UNDP's program
consists of 33 technical assistance projects in the field of agriculture
(15%), industry and commerce (14%), natural resources (18%), transport (11%),
communications (14%), education (18%) and others (10%). The Bank was execut-
ing agency for the UNDP integrated transport study concluded in 1972 and is
acting as executing agency for the UNDP financed technical assistance attached
to the Small Farmer Credit and Rural Development Project (Credit 509-PA).
26.       Information prepared by UNDP suggests that during 1974 the level of
external technical assistance to Paraguay was US$8.3 million and in the last
four years this assistance has been growing at an average rate of about 10%
per annum. Nevertheless, assistance for project preparation and planning
available from external agencies, including UNDP and IDB, has not been suf-
ficient to meet all the needs. UNDP has acknowledged that this shortfall is
likely to become even greater in the future and, therefore, it welcomes Bank
Group financing for preinvestment studies. UNDP has also agreed to finance
the cost of stationing a team of advisors in Paraguay to assist NPO to imple-
ment the proposed project.



-8-
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background
27.       The proposed project would be the first Bank Group operation in
Paraguay solely for preinvestment studies. Bank Group assistance for project
preparation has been provided in the past through "piggy-back" financing
of feasibility studies in IBRD loans and IDA credits. In 1961, IDA made a
US$6 million credit (Credit 12-PA) for the reconstruction and paving of the
Paraguari-Encarnacion road which included financing for the preparation by
consultants of a highway maintenance master plan. Later on this work resulted
in the IBRD making in 1970 a US$6 million loan for highway maintenance (Loan
652-PA). In 1966, the IBRD made a US$2.1 million loan (Loan 443-PA) to
finance the reconstruction and paving of the Coronel Oviedo-Villarrica Road,
which included funds for preparation of feasibility and final design studies
for some of the roads identified in the UNDP-financed "Triangulo Region"
Study. The recently approved Fourth Highway Project (Loan 1059-PA/US$14.5
million) included two of these roads. Under the Fourth Highway Project
consultants would be retained to prepare an advanced highway maintenance
program, the foreign exchange cost of which would be financed under a forth-
coming IBRD loan.
28.       The proposed project was identified by an economic mission that
visited Paraguay in September 1973. This was followed by a preparation mis-
sion in October 1974 and an appraisal mission in April 1975. Negotiations
were held in Asuncion from July 3, to 7, 1975. The main features of the
project are summarized in Annex III.
Project Description and Cost Estimates
29.       The proposed project would support a three year program of assistance
to public sector institutions to finance the cost of hiring consultants to
prepare and review specific project studies. The studies to be carried out
would be in transportation, agriculture, tourism, education and other sectors.
The total cost of the project is estimated at ¢ 774.9 million (US$6.15 million),
the foreign exchange cost at e 554.4 million (US$4.40 million) or 72% of the
total project cost, and the local cost at ¢ 220.5 million (US$1.75 million)
or 28% of the total project cost. A 15% price contingency is included in the
cost estimates.

30.       The project was designed on the basis of a tentative list of studies
(Annex IV) which was prepared in cooperation with the Government taking into
account, inter alia, the following criteria: (a) the studies undertaken would
be of high priority and would have a high probability of resulting in investments
during the next five years; (b) the number of studies initiated per year would
be consistent with NPO's manpower resources to process and supervise effective-
ly the study work; (c) during the first three years of operations, the Pre-
investment Fund would concentrate its operations in a limited number of sectors;
(d) at least 60% of the studies would be initiated during the first two years
of the program; and (e) the studies would need to be related to investment
activities of the public sector, especially of ministries and decentralized
agencies lacking resources in project preparation. On this basis, twelve
studies were selected, of which seven have a high probability of being initiated
during the first two years. At the request of the Government, the studies
included in the list could be changed. In any case, all studies would be
subject to approval by IDA. (Section 2.02 (a) of Development Credit Agree-
ment).

Studies in Transportation
31.       The proposed project would provide financing for the services of
consultants to carry out five feasibility and final design studies in trans-
portation. Despite Paraguay's impressive efforts during the last fifteen vears
to improve transport facilities, the lack of reliable transportation in
several parts of the country is still a constraint to development. Paraguay
has 6,500 km of roads, of which only 850 km are paved, and one all-weather
airport. Several high priority roads need to be improved if the country is to
take full advantage of its agricultural potential. The improvement of four
roads and domestic airports, all of which were given high priority in the
UNDP-financed and Bank-executed transport survey, would be studied. The
projects are expected to have a high rate of internal return, in addition to
a very large regional developmental impact. The total cost of the studies is
estimated at ¢397 million (US$3.15 million). The studies would be the
following:

Studies in Agriculture
32.       The proposed project would finance four studies in the agricultural
sector. Agriculture, including livestock and forestry, is the backbone of
the Paraguayan economy. It accounts for one-third of GDP and 90% of exports,
and provides for about 60% of employment. The Goverment is aware that to
accelerate economic growth, it must raise significantly agricultural produc-
tion. The scope for achieving this goal is great as there is in the country
ample available unused land, with good soils. The Government has prepared
an agricultural development plan which is aimed at increasing production by
combining complementary programs of land settlement, road construction and
improvement, and increased labor productivity. To support the Government in
this effort, the proposed project would finance four high priority studies
in the agricultural sector: a forestry and agricultural development study
in a virgin area that would become accessible by the construction of a road;
a colonization study; a rural development study for an area adjacent to a



road being improved under the Fourth Highway Project (Loan 1059-PA); and
a mechanization and on-farm investment study. The total cost of the studies
has been estimated at ¢145 million (US$1.15 million). The studies would
be the following:
Study                                                      Type
1. Agricultural Development and Forestry exploitation
of the area of influence of the Port President
Stroessner-Pirapo Highway.                                     Feasibility
2.  Colonization of Ybyraborana                                    Feasibility
3. Rural Development--consolidation of colonies in
the area of Capitan Meza /a                                    Feasibility
4. Farm Mechanization and on-farm Investment (Credit
Project)                                                       Feasibility
/a   Capitan Meza will be connected to the main highway system through the
Encarnacion-Hohenau-Pirapo Road being constructed under the Fourth
Highway Project (Ln. 1059-PA/US$14.5 million).
Studies in Tourism
33.       The proposed project would finance two studies in tourism.    In-
creased tourism could help Paraguay diversify and increase its foreign
exchange earning, while helping to raise employment. During the sixties,
Paraguay's tourism sector grew at an impressive rate; the number of visitors
increased by nearly 25% per annum, most of them coming from Argentina and
Brazil. Lately, however, tourism has somewhat receded and, as a result,
the Government is revising its plans in the sector. With the assistance of
the Organization of American States (OAS), the Government is working on a
plan to make use of the tourism potential of the proposed Itaipu and
Yacireta-Apipe dams--two of the largest hydroelectric projects in the world
to be built with Brazil and Argentina on the Parana River. As part, of this
plan, the Government proposes also to improve existing tourist attractions,
such as the old Jesuit Missions at Encarnacion and the areas immediately
adjacent to Iguazu Falls and Lake Ypacarai. In line with this, the proposed
project would finance the preparation of two master tourism plans including
feasibility and final design. The total cost of the studies is estimated at
037.8 million (US$300,000). The studies would be the following:
Study                                         Type
1.   Lake Ypacarai Project                    Feasibility and Design
2.   Encarnacion Master Plan                  Feasibility and Design
(First Stage)

Studies in Education
34.       Paraguay's educational system is characterized by high drop-out
and grade repetition rates and by a curriculum which emphasizes humanities,
although recently there have been some advances made in technical and
vocational education. Nearly 90% of the children at school age enroll in
primary schools but of these only 25% graduate and 15% enroll in secondary
schools. It is estimated that only 6% of those enrolled at the primary
level complete secondary education. The Government, with the assistance
of the Bank Group which financed an education project in 1972, and other
international agencies, has launched a program to help improve the quality
of education, raise the number of children attending schools, increase
the retention rate, particularly in the rural areas, and improve the re-
levancy of the education/training system to meet the skill requirements of
the growing economy. In support of this program, the proposed project would
finance the cost of preparing studies for a vocational and rural education
project. The total cost of the study is estimated at ¢31.5 million
(US$250,000).
Planning, Organization and Review of Project Studies
35.       In addition the proposed project would provide assistance in the
planning, organization and review of the specific studies. One element of
this assistance with an estimated cost of 018.9 million (US$150,000), would
provide consultants on short-term assignments to the National Projects
Office (NPO); they would have special expertise in subjects related to
individual studies. The second, to be financed by the UNDP and for which
the Bank would act as the executing agency, with an estimated cost, including
contingencies, of 042.8 million (US$400,000), would be for a team of advisors
(a generalist specialized in management of pre-investment work, and a highway
engineer and an agricultural economist, both familiar with project pre-
paration) for a period of three years to assist NPO in implementing the
project (Section 3.04 (b) of the Development Credit Agreement). The duties
and functions of the advisors would be to aid the National Projects Office
in: (a) identifying and preparing study proposals; (b) appraising study
proposals; (c) selecting and retaining consultants; (d) preparing terms of
reference for studies; (e) supervising the execution of studies; (f) reviewing
and assessing drafts of final study reports; and (g) training local personnel
in preinvestment work.
Financing of Project Costs
36.       The ¢774.9 million (US$6.15 million) estimated project cost would be
financed as follows: 0220.5 million (US$1.75 million) or 28% of the project
cost by the Central Bank, 050.4 million (US$400,000) or 7% of the project
cost by UNDP, and 0504 million (US$4.0 million) or 65% of the project cost
by the proposed IDA credit. The Republic of Paraguay would be the borrower
and would make available that part of the proceeds of the IDA credit allocated
to finance specific preinvestment studies to the Central Bank under the same

terms and conditions. The Government will enter into a Subsidiary Agreement
with the Central Bank acceptable to IDA (Section 3.01 (b) of the Development
Credit Agreement).

Administration of the Project
37.       To carry out the project the Central Bank would open a special ac-
count (the Preinvestment Fund (PF)). The Central Bank would administer PF
through a Management Committee composed of a representative each from the
Central Bank, who would act as Chairman, the Ministry of Finance and the
Technical Secretariat for Planning. Loans would be made out of PF to agencies
and enterprises to finance specific stuidies on the basis of recommendations by
the National Projects Office (NPO), which would be responsible for supervising
the execution of individual project studies. The Central Bank would handle
all financial transactions.
Resources of the Preinvestment Fund
38.       The following resources would be available to PF:    (a) the proceeds
of the proposed IDA credit, (b) the funds made available by the Central Bank
from its own resources, (c) any funds made available in the future by the
Government and other external sources, and (d) loan repayments and interest
from PF's lending operations in connection with the Project.



- 14 -
39.       Cash projections made for the project show that during the first
three years of operation, the Central Bank would have annual disbursements
out of PF averaging US$1.8 million. In 1979, after the studies financed
under the IDA credit would have been completed, disbursements would decrease
to about US$1.5 million per annum. Annex V summarizes PF's cash flow and
balance sheet projections for the period 1976-87.
Operating Procedures of the Preinvestment Fund (PF)
40.       The loans made by the Central Bank (CB) out of PF's resources to
public sector entities would finance 100% of the cost of studies and would
be for seven years, including two years of grace, at an interest rate of 6%
per annum, which is CB's re-discount rate for the. public sector, and a commit-
ment fee of 1% per annum on undisbursed balances after loan signing. There
would also be a penalty charge of 2% per month on overdue service payments.
Assurances to this effect were obtained from the Government (Section 2.03
of the Project Agreement).
41.       An operating manual, acceptable to IDA, would regulate the adminis-
tration of PF's resources and would describe, inter alia, the following: (a)
studies eligible for financing; (b) sources and uses of funds; (c) administra-
tion of the Preinvestment Fund; (d) duties and responsibilities of the Central
Bank; (e) duties and responsibilities of the Executive Secretary (National
Projects Office); (f) methods of loan processing, loan approval and super-
vision, and terms and conditions of loans; and (g) procedures for selection
and contracting of consultants (Annex VI). The issuance of the operating
manual is a condition of effectiveness of the proposed credit (Section 6.01
(e) of Development Credit Agreement).
The National Projects Office (NPO)
42.       NPO would provide technical support to the Management Committee
for loan appraisal, processing, and supervision. For this service it would
receive up to 1.5% per annum of the outstanding amount of loans made out
PF's resources at the end of each year. NPO was established by Decree No.
13,299, on June 30, 1970, under the Technical Secretariat for Planning. It
is headed by a Director appointed by the President of the Republic and has
a staff of thirteen professionals (four economists, two agricultural engineers,
three architects, one forestry expert, two industiral engineers, and one
mathematician). The personnel are competent but lack practical experience
in project preparation and contracting consultants. NPO has acted as executing
agency for some studies financed by the IDB and has received technical assist-
ance from FONADE, the Colombian Preinvestment Fund.
43.       Until recently, NPO undertook project preparation itself without
the support of consultants; this restricted its level of output. Under the
proposed project, NPO would be restructured to concentrate its efforts on
the identification of high priority projects and on the planning, evaluation
and supervision of studies to be conducted by consultants and the various



- 15 -
agencies. In line with this, NPO would be reorganized into two departments:
(a) a technical department which would be responsible for loan identification,
processing and supervision; and (b) a financial-administrative department
which would be responsible for budgeting and programming, as well as financial
and overall administration. To facilitate the transition to the new organi-
zation, it has been agreed that NPO would limit its activities until 1979 to
13 studies per year (Section 4.01 (b) of the Development Credit Agreement).
The Central Bank (CB)
44.       CB would be responsible for handling all financial transactions
in connection with the carrying out of the preinvestment studies included in
the project. In this capacity, CB would make loan disbursements and collect
repayments as well as submit disbursement applications to IDA. For this
service and for assuming the foreign exchange risk, CB would charge 1.5% per
annum of the outstanding amount of loans made out PF's resources at the
end of each year. PF would be audited by independent auditors acceptable
to IDA. The audited accounts would be submitted to IDA within four months
of the close of each financial year.
Procurement and Disbursements
45.       The Central Bank would submit all proposed subloans to IDA for
approval. The submissions would include, among other things, the subject
of study, the estimated cost and the terms of reference for the study, the
draft contract between CB and the borrower, the consultants selected on
the basis of a short list of candidates and the rationale 'for their selection,
and the draft contract between the borrower and the consultants. IDA would
also receive progress and completion reports of the different studies. For
each study proposal NPO would draw up a short list of consultants (normally
an international representation of three to five firms) with capability in
the particular field. Contracts would be awarded to consultants from member
countries of IDA and Switzerland in accordance with the provisions contained
in PF's Operating Manual (Annex VI) and consistent with guidelines on "The
Uses of Consultants by the World Bank and its Borrowers" issued in April 1974
(Section 3.07 of the Development Credit Agreement and Section 2.08 of the
Project Agreement).
46.       The proposed IDA credit for the equivalent of US$4.0 million would
be disbursed over a five year period against appropriate documentation for 70%
of the cost of each study and the service of specialized consultants, a percent-
age that is estimated to be the average foreign exchange cost of the project.
The percentage to be financed has been arrived at on the assumption that the
studies in transportation would be carried out by foreign firms and the re-
maining studies on a 50-50 foreign/Paraguayan basis. NPO would identify
possible subcontracts in large studies, whenever possible, to facilitate the
participation of local consultants. Retroactive financing will be provided
up to US$100,000.00 for expenditures after April 1, 1975, to cover initial
contractual services under the project. Any undisbursed funds remaining after



- 16 -
project completion would be cancelled unless their use for additional loans
could be justified. The Schedule of Disbursements is given in Annex VII.
Economic Benefits and Justification
47.       The strengthening of the National Projects Office would help increase
the number of well prepared high priority projects in the public sector. This,
in turn, would encourage better resource allocation, improved budgeting, and
effective coordination of external financial assistance. All of these combined
would contribute to maximize the benefits derived from the public investment
effort. Although it would appear that these benefits would be substantial,
it is not possible to quantify them in a sufficiently precise manner to
compute a rate of economic return. For purposes of illustration, however,
as shown in Annex XIII, an attempt was made to determine under what minimum
conditions the project would be justified. The analysis showed that the
project would yield an internal rate of return of 12% if it were to lead to
investments totalling US$143 million over a seven-year period (about 50% of
the maximum potential investment), and if cost savines specifically attribut-
able to the project were to reach at least 4.2% oE the investment generated.
Experience in Paraguay has shown that cost savings to be attained as a result
of better project preparation can far exceed this minimum level.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
48.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Paraguay and IDA, the draft Project Agreement between IDA and the Central
Bank of Paraguay the report of the Committee provided for in Article III,
Section (4) (iii) of the Articles of Agreement, and the text of a resolution
approving the proposed Credit are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately.
49.       In addition to the specific features of the Development Credit
Agreement and of the Project Agreement which are referred to in Part IV
above, the following additional conditions of effectiveness have been
included:
(i) that the Preinvestment Fund has been established (Section 6.01
(c));
(ii) that the Management Committee has been appointed (Section
6.01 (d));
(iii) that the operating Manual has been issued (Section 6.01 (e)); and
(iv) that NPO has been reorganized (Section 6.01 (f)).

50.       I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
51.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed Credit.

The German contractor, Hochtief, claims that it is entitled to US,l.l
million more than the US$9.6 million it has received for its work under
the contract. Supported by the project consultants, I4OPC rejected the claim.
For some time Hochtief tried to resolve its claim through direct negotiations
with the Paraguayan Government.  In June 1972, Hochtief altered its approach and
attempted to settle its claim by invoking the arbitration clause of the contract.
The Government, however, has refused to appoint its representative on the arbi-
tration panel as called for in the arbitration clause, and Hlochtief has asked
for Bank assistance in bringing the Paraguayans to arbitration.  We have advised
the Govermnent of the Bank's interest in having the parties to Bank-financcd con-
tracts adhere to the disputes provisions of such contracts and have advised Hochtief
that,.under the circumstances, its most appropriate course of action would be.to
pursue and exhaust the judicial remedies which are still open to it under Paraguayan
law.

Loan 652    Second Road Msaintenance 'Project, US$6.0 million,
January 9, 1970.
3.     The project comprises provision of maintenance and shop ecyuipment,
improvement of the maintenance organization and its operations, and training
of personnel.  I.mportant progress has been made, with the assistance of con-
sultants, in strengthening the road organization and in improving the physical
maintenance of roads, as a resullt of the project; approximately 90' of the
provision for equipment has been disbursed.  In 1971 and 1972 procurement was
delayed pending the provision of adequate local fulds to operate the extra
equipment. These funds are now available and will enable the remainder of the
equipment to be procured in 1975. In this event, the project should be completed
by mid-1975, with disbursements extending to the end of the vear, approximately
two yrears behind schedule.

h.     After a seven-month delay due to a recess in both houses and an ensu.in-
back;log of pending legislation, the Credit Agreement was ratified by the Congress
on September 114, 1973, and the Association declared it effective on October 30, 1'973.
Key staff of the project implementation unit have been appointed and, at this stage,
no special problems are envisaged for the proper carrying oult of the project;.  Sicre
the Government met CIAP's 1973 fiscal targets, the seconid tranche of the Credit,
which was conditioned on the Government's meeting T;hese targets, has been roleased.
Project implementation is proceeding in a satisfactory manner.

6.     The loan became effective on March 11, 1975.. The project is in early stages
of execution and no disbursements have been made so far. Vialidad has invited con-
tractors for prequalification following the normal Bank procedures. Seven consulting
firms have submitted documents to Vialidad showing interest in undertaking the super-
vision of construction and technical assistance for maintenance. The Office of
Coordination and Integral Planning for transport has been activated and started
operations in November of 1974.

PARAGUAY
PREINVESTMENT STUDIES PROJECT
Brief Description of the Proposed Studies
TRANSPORTATION
Coronel Oviedo-Yby Yau Road
1.        The Coronel Oviedo-Yby Yau Road connects with the Concepcion-P.J.
Caballero (Route V) and the Asuncion-Puerto Presidente Stroessner (Route II)
Road. It runs 292 km south-north almost halfway between the Paraguay and
Parana Rivers and provides marketing outlets to Paraguay's north-east fertile
region.  Through the Asuncion-Puerto Presidente Stroessner Road, it connects
with the Brazilian port of Paranagua in the east, and with Asuncion in the
west. Through the Concepcion-P.J. Caballero Road, it connects with two
important Paraguayan northern cities and, in Brazil, with the road to Brasilia
and Sao Paulo. At present, it has an earth surface with a few gravel surface
sections near Coronel Oviedo. Its maintenance is costly due to heavy traffic
on some sections.  During heavy rains some of the more heavily traveled sections
are closed to traffic.
2.        The average traffic on the road has doubled in the last three years,
reaching about 170 vehicles per day with some sections having an average
traffic of 600 vehicles per day. Further growth in traffic is projected as
economic activity in the road's area of influence will increase at a fast pace
due to the implementation of several development programs (colonization, sugar
and hardwood production). Development, however, will be impeded if reliable
communications are not provided.
3.        A feasibility study to improve and pave the road, including the
construction of three bridges, was carried out in 1967. It showed that with
the existing traffic, paving part of the road was already justified, i.e.,
the Coronel Oviedo-Tacuara segment. The proposed study would cover both the
updating of the feasibility study and the preparation of the final design of
the highest priority sections. The Ministry of Public Works and Communications
would be responsible for the execution of the study. The cost of the study is
estimated at US$1,000,000 and the investment generated at US$37,000,000.   The
study would take approximately one year and would begin by the end of 1975.
Concepcion-Yby Yau-P.J. Caballero Road
4.        The Concepcion-Yby Yau Road runs 21' km in a west-northeast direction
crossing Paraguay's north-east and connects the two main cities of Concepcion,
on the Paraguay River, and P.J. Caballero, on the Alto Parana River. Through
P.J. Caballero it connects with the Brazilian road to Sao Paulo and Brasilia.
In the last few years the road has registered an important increase in traffic,
especially to Yby Yau-P .J. Caballero segment (102 km). Road maintenance costs



ANNEX IV
Page 2 of 7
are high and the road is closed to traffic about one fourth of the year
due to heavy rains.
5.        A feasibility study of the road, financed by IDB, was carried out
in 1968/69. Because of the increased traffic and costs, it would be necessary
to update the feasibility study and to prepare the final design of the Yby Yau-P.J.
Caballero section. The Ministry of Public Works and Communications would be
responsible for the execution of the study. The cost of the study, including
detailed engineering, is estimated at US$350,000 and the investment generated
at Us$15,000,000. The study would take some nine months to complete and would
begin by the end of 1975.
Rosario-Tacuaras Road
6.        The Rosario-Tacuaras Road (Route X), a 92 km earth and gravel road,
rnms east-west from Rosario to Tacuaras. It serves a rich agricultural and
forestry area between the Paraguay River and the Coronel Oviedo-Yby Yau Road.
The road's traffic is relatively dense and will increase as a result of the
paving of the Coronel Oviedo-Mbutuy-San Estanislao section. Maintenance costs
are high and the road is closed to traffic for long periods during the rainy
season. Several plants processing wood products are also being built in the
area. The paving and general improvement of the road is scheduled for 1979,
and the feasibility and detailed engineering studies are programmed to begin
in 1977. The Ministry of Public Works and Communications would be responsible
for the execution of the study. The study is estimated at US$300,000 and the
investment generated at US$12,000,000.
Pirapo-Pto. Presidente Stroessner Road
7.        The Pirapo-Pto. Presidente Stroessner Road, a penetration road,
would extend some 160 km south-north from Pirapo to Route VIT, leading to
Pto. Presidente Stroessner. It would complete the third segment of the Plan
Triangulo, a network of primary roads in southeastern Paraguay (an area encom-
passing about 80% of the country's population) linking Asuncion, Encarnacion
and Pto. Presidente Stroessner.
8.        The opening of the road will make possible the development of almost
one million hectares of forestry land of great agricultural potential.
9.        The road would link Encarnacion with Pto. Presidente Stroessner, and
would provide transport infrastructure to the large hydroelectric projects of
Yacyreta-Apipe Itaipu and Corpus when they are being built.
10.       The study of the road would be complemented by a forestry exploitation
and agricultural development study of the area, which is included as one of the
studies in agriculture that would be financed under the proposed credit (para-
graph 13 of this Annex). The Ministry of Public Works and Communications would



ANNEX IV
Page 3 of 7
be responsible for the execution of the road study. The cost of the
feasibility study and detailed engineering is estimated at US$1,100,000
and the investment generated at US$30,000,000. The study, which would consist
of two phases, would take approximately 18 months to complete and would begin by
end-1975.
Domestic Airports
11.       Paraguay has a rudimentary domestic air system which is inadequate
to cope with the demand for air transport, growing at more than 15% per annum.
Aircraft operation efficiency is below potential as weather softened air
strips and the lack of airfield lighting and communications equipment cause
delays and diversions in scheduled flights. At; the request of the Government,
the Bank reviewed requirements in domestic aviation and recommended the
improvement of several domestic airports (Concepcion, Encarnacion, Filadelfia
and Pilar). In line with this, the studies that would be carried consist of:
(a) Upgrading the airports of Concepcion, Encarnacion, Pilar and
Filadelfia, including paving and lighting of runways;
(b) Installing instruments and equipment for flight control and
communication; and
(c) Preparing final design and specifications.
12.       The Ministry of Defense would be responsible for the execution of
the studies. The cost of the feasibility study, including detailed engineering
is estimated at US$400,000 and the investment generated at US$9,000,000. The
study would take twelve months to complete and would begin in mid-1975.
AGRICULTURE
Forestry Exploitation and Agricultural Development of the Corridor
along the Pirapo-Pto. Presidente Stroessner Road
13.       The proposed Pirapo-Pto. Presidente Stroessner Road would open a vast
region of roughly one million hectares of land considered among the best in
Paraguay, in the Departments of Itapua, Caazapa and Alto Parana, for forestry
and agricultural production.
14.       The Government's policy has been to encourage spontaneous development
of virgin lands but this approach so far has resulted in an irrational exploit-
ation of the country's forest resources. To prevent this from happening in the
area o{ Pirapo-Pto. Presidente Stroessner, the Government proposes to undertake
a comprehensive feasibility study which would recommend a rational program of
exploitation. The study would also formulate an agricultural development pro-
gram, which would include proposals for colonization schemes, land clearing
requirements, sound land tenure structure, a program for feeder road construction,
and technical assistance and credit requiremen-ts. The Ministry of Agriculture
would carry out the study. The cost of the study is estimated at US$550,000 and
the investments generated a-t US$450. million. The study would take two years
to complete and would begin at end-1975.



ANNEX IV
Page -4 of 7
Rural Development of Capitan Meza
15.       In 1974, a mission of the OAS studied employment generating projects
in Paraguay and recommended the intensive development of nine colonies north
of Capitan Meza, Department of Itapua, covering 40,000 ha and benefiting 1,200
families.  Capitan Me-. is located between the cities of Encarnacion and Pto.
Presidente Stroessn¢r, an area that will receive substantial benefits from the
construction of the Itaipu and Yacireta-Apipe hydroelectric projects. In line
with the recommendations of the OAS, the Government proposes to design a project
to assist the colonies to increase agricultural production and income. The
project would provide credit, technical assistance and community services.
About 40% of the project's arable land would be devoted to livestock production,
40% to fruits and crop production, and 20% to forestry. The feasibility study
would outline a marketing and production program, and would identify the require-
ments with respect to on-farm investments, processing and storage facilities,
feeder roads, community and health centers, credit and technical assistance.
t6.       The Ministry of Agriculture would be responsible for the execution
of the study. The study would be completed in approximately one year and would
begin in mid-1976. The cost of the feasibility study is estimated at US$150,000
and the investment generated at US$9,000,000.
Ybyraborana Colonization Program
17.       During the last 20 years, the Government's colonization programs have
benefited more than 40,000 families. A major weakness of the programs, however,
has been the lack of basic back-up infrastructure, inputs and services to help
encourage increased production. This, and the mandatory two-year military
service, have resulted in large urban migration among the rural youth. Service-
men, upon completion of military service,are given by the Government a plot in
public lands. However, few of them make use of this opportunity as they know
that the settlements lack the aforementioned. To correct this situation, the
Government has prepared a pilot program to establish a minimum of five colonies
per year at Ybyraborana, Department of Canendiyu, on public land. As part of
the program, the Ministry of Defense would allow servicemen after the first
year of military service, to be sent on special duty to the colonies in which
they would eventually settle. Once there, and as part of the second year of
military service, they would work on infrastructure projects (feeder roads,
bridges, fences, silos and depots) and receive intensive training on farming
methods, cooperativism and marketing. During the duration of this phase,
farming would be exclusively communal. Upon separation, they would bring their
families and settle in the land assigned; a portion of the plot would still be
reserved for collective farming.
18.       The study would design a low cost and highly productive colonization
program, taking into account socialogical factors encompassed in programs
involving young people. If successful, this type of colonization would spread
to other parts of the country. The elements of the study would be the following:



.AINEX IV
Page 5 of 7
(a)  Resettlement program - land tenure, farmers organization,
community services, and project organization and administration.
(b)  Infrastructure - provision of feeder roads, social services and
marketing facilities.
(c)  Production and marketing - mechanization requirements, on-farm
investment, crop selection, and credit and technical assistance
requirements.
19.       The Agriculture and Defense Ministers would be responsible for the
study. The study's estimated cost is US$250,000 and would be completed 12
months after initiation (end 1975).   The investments generated are estimated
at US$18,000,000.
Mechanization and Dn-farm Investment
20.       While there is considerable unemployiment and underemployment in the
urban sector, agriculture as a whole has been cuffering from labor shortages.
Prosperity (real rural incomes are estimated to have increased by about 70%
in the last three years), better land distribut;ion and steadily growing public
investment have raised significantly the demancd for labor. With the further
increase projected in economic activity, rural labor shortages are expected to
become pronounced. Consistent with this, a program to increase production and
productivity through farm mechanization, particularly in export crops, would
appear to be justified.  The study would analyze this possibility and would
include, among other things, the following:
(a) establish the need and extent of investments required;
(b) identify a suitable financial intermediary and lending procedures;
(c) assess the financial and economic viability of investments; and
(d) determine the possible sources of finance.
21.       The Ministry of Agriculture would be responsible for the execution of
the study. The cost of the study is estimated at US$200,000 and would take
approximately nine months to complete, beginning by mid-1976. The generated
investment would be about US$28,000,000.

TOURISM
Lake Ypacarai Tourism Project
22.       Lake Ypacarai is 45 Ian away from Asuncion.  It is Asuncion's main
tourist attraction, although it lacks the infrastructure and services needed
to attract more visitors. The Government considers that with appropriate
improvements on the existing infrastructure and services, it would be possible
to increase the flow of tourists to the Asuncion tourist circuit, which
includes Lake Ypacarai. This, in turn, would contribute to raising the
average expenditure per visitor.
23.       The main objective of the study would be to explore the feasibility
of transforming Lake Ypacarai into a modern tourist center. The following
would be the subject of study:
(a) A road link between San Bernardino and Aregua, around the lake's
shore.
(b) Rehabilitation and improvement of the beaches.
(c) Improvement of the hotels and restaurants.
(d)  Converting the Salado River, which connects the lake to
the Paraguay River, to recreational boat navigation.
24.       The Ministry of Public Works and Communications would be responsible
for the execution of the study. The cost of the study is estimated at
US$100,000 and would take approximately six months to complete, beginning by
mid-1976. The investment generated is expected to reach some US$3,000,000.
Encarnaci6n Tourism Master Plan
25.       Encarnaci6n lies on the southeastern tip of Paraguay bordering the
northeast of Argentina which is connected by ferry. Its main tourist attractions
are: the XVIII century Jesuit ruins, the Alto Parana River and the site of
the proposed Yacireta-Apipe hydroelectric project. With the support of the
IDB, the Government is carrying out a study to determine the/feasibility of
restoring the Jesuit ruins. The Yacireta-Apipe project, to be constructed on
the Parana River some 80 km west of Encarnacion, will become a major tourist
attraction. The dam will create a big artificial lake suitable for recreational
activities. The proposed Master Plan would take into account the foregoing and
would identify specific investment requirements (infrastructure, hotels, rest-
aurants and other tourism related activities) to make full use of this potential.
The study would be divided in two phases; the first would consist of the evalu-
ation of alternatives and definition of investment priorities and the second of
engineering studies for the first stage of the program. The main items of
study would be the following:
(a) Feeder roads to connect the main highways with fishing resorts
along the Parana River.



ANNEX IV
Page 7 of 7
(b) Hotels and restaurants.
(c) Marketing outlets for Paraguayan handicrafts.
(d) Detailed engineering for the first stage of the project.
26.       The Ministry of Public Works and Communications would be responsible
for the execution of the study. The cost of the study is estimated at US$200,000
and it would take 19 months to complete. The study is expected to begin in
mid-1976; the investments generated during a period of six years are projected
to reach US$22,000,000.
EDUCATION
Vocational and Rural Education
27.       The Government's Development Plan gives high priority to education.
Until recently, the quality of education was poor and the facilities below
standard when compared with other countries at similar stages of development.
The curriculum was highly academic, with limited emphasis on technical and
vocational education. With the support of IDA and AID the Government has
embarked upon programs to correct this situation and it is paying increased
attention to rural education.
28.       A fezsibJLity study, including design and cost estimates, would be
undertaken to formulate education projects. The projects would consist of a
comprehensive program for the improvement of the education and training for
the rural population, the possible expansion of the multilateral secondary
schools system, as a follow.-up of the first education project, and the expan-
sion and improvement of a nonformal training scheme at present being carried
out by Servicio Nacional de Promocion Profesional - SNPP. With respect to
rural education and training, the study would include the development of a
national school mapping operation to estimate the needs for additional facil-
ities and for improvement of the administrative and institutional framework
for the establishment of rural community learning centers. With regard to
expansion of the multilateral secondary schools,the study would estimate the
needs for new facilities to implement a diversified job-oriented curriculum.
Finally, with respect to a nonformal training scheme, the study,based on
manpower analysis, would identify training needs and type and location of
SNPP's vocational training centers. All those studies would present a detailed
analysis of costs (capital and operational) and engineering design.
P9.       The Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Justice and Labor's
Vocational Training Service (SNPP) would be responsible for the studies. The
estimated cost is about US$250,000 that would include school mapping and other
field expenses of about US$100,000 and professional fees for preliminary and
final designs of project institutions of about US$150,000. The investments
generated over a six-year period are projected to reach US$18,000,000.

CHAPTER VIII
THE BASES AND PROCEDURES FOR SELECTING CONSULTANTS
Article 51: Consultants for the study of projects shall be selected by the
borrowers who shall take full responsibility for their selection. Nevertheless,
the Management Committee shall approve the selection made by an applicant
and shall reserve the right to veto such selection. Similarly, the Management
Committee may request the cancellation of a consultancy contract whenever,
in its opinion, studies are not being performed in accordance with the
agreement between the borrower and the Central Bank or the contract between
the borrower and the consultants.
Article 52: The bases for selecting consultants for studies are as follows:
(a) The experience of the consultants, as an organization, in
studies similar to those under consideration;
(b)  The ability of the consultants, at the time of their
selection, to devote their efforts to the job;
(c)  The experience in studies similar to that under consideration
of the technicians who will work on the study or studies
concerned.
Sole proviso: If, at the time of selection, a consultant submits a letter
of intent from experts willing to work on the study in question, the
availability of such experts shall be taken into consideration when evaluating
the capacity of the particular consultant to execute the work.
Article 53: In addition to the bases for the selection of consultants indicated
in the preceding article, the following factors shall also be taken into con-
sideration:
(a) Equitable distribution of the work between consultants
with equal qualifications and experience;



ANNEX VI
Page 14
(b) The NPO's experience with each consultant, taking into
account NPO's assessment of its practical experience,
professional qualifications, and good record of sound
works completed;
(c) Where foreign consultants are involved in the execution
of studies funded out of Fund resources, said consultants
shall be required to operate, whenever possible, in
association, in a consortium or in a corporation with
Paraguayan consultants, with the maximum possible
participation by Paraguayan specialists in each case;
(d) Any other specific conditions contained in agreements
signed with international agencies furnishing part of the
resources to be used in the study under consideration.
Article 54: Consultants shall be selected for execution of a study by
competition between at least three firms. The final selection shall be the
exclusive responsibility of the applicant. The procedure shall be as follows:
(a) NPO shall supply the applicant with a list of consultancy firms
eligible for the study;
(b) The applicant shall supply NPO with a list of three consultants
which it considers suitable to perform the study, which
consultants may or may not be included in the preceding list;
(c) NPO shall evaluate the list submitted by the applicant and
submit it to the Management Committee for approval. In
addition, NPO shall comply with the requirements for this
particular stage, set by any international agency supplying
part of the resources to be used to finance the study;
(d) NPO shall advise the applicant of the list approved;
(e) Together with the qualification form for technical projects,
prepared beforehand by NPO and which shall include an outline
of the terms of reference, the applicant must send written
notification to each of the three consultants selected that
a private bid competition has been opened for the study under
consideration and that, to be considered, they must fill out
the qualification form and forward it to the applicant
with two copies for NPO. When filling out the form, each
firm must specify the details of the work it proposes to
perform;



ANNEX VI
Page 15
(f) The applicant shall receive the Qualification Forms from
the three consultants and shall evaluate them, deciding on
their order of eligibility. If requested by the applicant,
NPO staff shall advise on the system of evaluation to be
used;
(g) Based on the data contained in the Qualification Forms,
NPO shall review this order of eligibility and, if acceptable,
shall approve it. If it is unacceptable, NPO shall discuss
the matter with the applicant, and try to reach an agreement.
If this proves impossible a new selection list shall be
prepared and the procedures established in (b), (c), (e), (f)
and (g) of this Article shall be repeated until an agreement
is reached on the order of eligibility.
Article 55: The consultant placed first in order of eligibility, in accord-
ance with (g) of the preceding Article, shall be considered the consultant
selected. Negotiations to reach agreement on definitive terms of reference,
the cost of services and the terms of the consultancy contract shall then
begin with the consultant selected. Negotiations with the consultant selected
shall continue until complete agreement is reached between NPO, the applicant
and the consultant, or until, in the view of any of the parties, it is
established that no satisfactory agreement is possible, in which case the
same process will begin with the other consultancy firms, in the order
of their eligibility and, if necessary, the procedures laid down in Article
54 of these Regulations will be repeated.

PARAGUAY
PREINVESTMENT STUDIES PROJECT
ECONOMIC EVALUATION
1.        The economic analysis of the project requires the use of parameters
that because of their nature cannot be estimated without a certain margin of
error. Under these circumstances, the purpose of the analysis is to provide
an indication of the minimum level of benefits that would be required to
justify the project.
2.        To measure the economic viability of the project, it is necessary
to define the concepts of costs and benefits at the preinvestment stage. Costs
are defined as the equivalent of the-cost of preparing a package of studies
that are needed to generate a level of investment. Benefits are defined as the
quantifiable savings in investment costs attributable to the preparation of
sound feasibility and engineering studies. Depending on the level of cost savings,
the benefits can, therefore, be measured as a proportion of the level of investment
generated. Based on this definition, and under specific assumptions regarding the
level of investment generated, it is possible to estimate the level of cost savings
needed to reach an internal rate of return of 12%.
3.        Recent case studies in Paraguay show that cost savings in public invest-
ments can be as high as 15% of the realized investment, when the projects have been
implemented on the basis of independent feasibility and design studies.   The practice
of the Government, however, has been to a large extent to award contracts for project
design, construction and financing in single packages, which has contributed to unduly
increasing investment and operating costs. To measure the minimum level of cost
savings needed to attain an IRR of 12%, the following assumptions were made:
(a)  A potential seven-year investment program of US$286 million
(in constant 1975 dollars) would result if all the preinvest-
ment studies would lead to specific investments (Table 1).
(b) The total cost of preparing the studies, including technical
assistance, would be about US$5.1 million (in constant 1975
dollars) spread over a three-year period (Table 2).
(c) The implementation of the project would not increase the
operating costs of the National Projects Office and the
Central Bank.
4.        Assuming an opportunity cost of capital of 12%, the proposed preinvestment
project would be iustified if investments totalling US$143 mill]ion are realized
(50% of the potential investment), and if the cost savings are at least 4.2<Z of the
realized investment. If the realized investment were to exceed US$143 million, the
greater would be the benefits accruing from the project. The table below summarizes
the level of cost savings required to reach an IRR of 12%.

4.2%
5.        Under the Paraguayan context, it may be possible to attain cost
savings above 8.4% of realized investment. On that basis the project would
be economically justified if the realized investment generated by the project
would exceed 25% of the potential investment.
