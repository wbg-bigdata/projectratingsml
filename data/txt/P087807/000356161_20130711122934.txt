F. Results Framework Analysis

1.     Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The project development objective (PDO) was “to strengthen the Government’s ability to
undertake mining sector reform by (i) building MEC capacity for closing uneconomic
mining enterprises through support for closing complex mines and ancillary enterprises in
an environmentally sustainable manner; and (ii) providing support to the National
Agency for Development and Implementation of Reconstruction Programs for the Mining
Regions (AZM), local communities and other agencies for community-based planning
and socio-economic regeneration of the mining regions.? The PDO in the Loan
Agreement is slightly different in that the second part reads, “(ii) providing support to
AZM, RSDF, mining communities and local public authorities for socio-economic
regeneration of the mining regions?.

2.      Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving
authority) The revised PDO after the first restructuring was “to strengthen the
government's ability to undertake mining sector reform by (i) building MEC’s capacity
for closing uneconomic mining enterprises through support for closing complex mines
and ancillary facilities in an environmentally sustainable manner; and (ii) providing
support to mining communities and local public authorities for socio-economic
regeneration of the mining regions through central entities.?

                     Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.     Under communism in Romania a policy of self-sufficiency led to the development
of an extensive mining sector that proved uneconomic in the transition to a free market
economy. The mining sector was a huge drain on the economy and, when production
stopped, it left behind a legacy of enormous environmental and social problems. The
Mine Closure 2 , Environmental and Socio-Economic Regeneration (MCESER) Project
was designed to mitigate the fiscal drain and remediate the environmental and social
problems. As such it included two, self-standing, albeit interrelated, components handled
by separate project management units (PMUs)3.

2.      The Mine Closure and Environmental Regeneration component was highly
successful in closing 23 mines and mining enterprises, in the process introducing best
practice in mine closure techniques to Romania, notably including a highly participatory
approach of consulting and working with the communities near the mine sites. This
capacity building is expected to endure given the number of people trained and the series
of mine closure manuals prepared under the project. The Socio-Economic Regeneration
(SER) component, initially a complex mixture of some 10 distinct activities intended to
promote socio-economic development and job creation, proved more difficult to
implement, due to the complexity of both its design and the political economy of the
agency (AZM4) in which it was embedded. Nonetheless, the World Bank’s task team
worked diligently with its Romanian counterparts to modify, adjust, and improve the
component structure and content and in the end significant successes were achieved. In
particular it built local level capacity for development planning that is complementary to
the funding mechanisms introduced by the European Union. The project also contributed
to reducing subsidies to the mining sector by more than originally anticipated, although
this result cannot be solely attributed to the project. These successes were achieved
despite chronic problems of Government underfunding of the project, but did require
nearly two and a half years of extension of the project closing date.


2
  Mine closure does not refer to stopping production at a mine. Rather it refers to, as noted in Wikipedia,
“the period of time when the ore-extracting activities of a mine have ceased, and final decommissioning
and mine reclamation are being completed.?

3
    A third component provided institutional support to the two PMUs.

4
  AZM is the generic abbreviation used in both the Project Appraisal Document and Loan Agreement to
designate the agency responsible for implementation of the Socioeconomic Regeneration component of the
MCESER project, which at the time of Loan approval was named the National Agency for Development of
the Mining Regions (NAD). In March 2009, NAD was reorganized as the Romanian Agency for
Sustainable Development of the Industrial Areas (RASDIA), which took over all the NAD’s
responsibilities. To avoid potential confusion, this document will continue to use the acronym AZM. The
Romanian Social Development Fund (RSDF) was responsible for the implementation of one activity under
the Socio-Economic Regeneration component.

1.1 Context at Appraisal

3.     Country and Sector Background: The Romanian Revolution of 1989 overthrew
the communist regime of Nicolae Ceausescu and launched the transition to a market
economy. While the subsequent decade saw negative growth and increased poverty,
sound macroeconomic policies led to robust growth after 2000 and in January, 2007
Romania joined the European Union (EU).

4.        In many ways, Romania illustrates the classical issues faced by former communist
countries, where the mining sector was an essential part of the self-reliance energy policy.
At the start of transition in 1990, Romania had 464 mines for coal and other minerals. At
the beginning of 2004, production was concluded in 344 of the mines, out of which 82
were completely closed, 171 were waiting for the physical closure to commence and the
remaining 71 were under care and maintenance. The operating mines (i.e., around 120
mines) were highly dependent on budget subsidies and debt write-offs, generating an
estimated quasi-fiscal deficit equal to 0.5% of GDP (i.e., around US$ 300 million in
2004). Between 1999 and 2004, the direct budget subsidies had doubled in nominal terms
(i.e., from US$ 99 million in 1999 to US$188 million in 2004).

5.      Project Background: Through an initial Mine Closure and Social Mitigation
Project (MCSMP – 2000-2006), the World Bank assisted the Government of Romania
(GOR) with technical guidance and operational support for the implementation of a
policy framework for mining sector reform. This was particularly relevant in the case of
Romania, where changes in the mining industry led to major social issues that aggravated
the problems related with the transition to a market economy. In this context, a Poverty
and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA) study of the mining sector was conducted in 2005 in
order to help the GOR implement its mining strategy and to inform the design of the
MCESER.

6.      Rationale for Bank Assistance: The MCESER Project aimed at scaling up the
mine closure and job creation activities of the MCSMP and introducing new activities for
socio-economic regeneration of the mining regions. The Bank was in a unique position to
bring to bear its extensive technical capacity and experience on mining sector reform
both in Romania itself and in other Europe and Central Asia (ECA) countries such as
Poland, Russia and Ukraine, including mine closure, environmental and social issues.
This combination of expertise was not readily available among other lenders. The project
also supported: (i) the International Monetary Fund (IMF) position on reducing mining
sector subsidies, which was a priority fiscal reform; and (ii) the mining sector reform
conditionality included in Romania’s Second Programmatic Adjustment Loan (PAL II).

7.     The MCESER project took into account the findings of the Extractive Industries
Review (EIR - 2003), which examined the Bank’s oil, gas and mining-related activities,
in particular major concerns raised by the EIR relating to: (i) mitigating the
environmental and social impacts of mining, (ii) identifying and addressing poverty-



                                             2
related impacts of mining, and (iii) keeping communities well informed about mining
activities.

8.      The project contributed to the Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) FY02
to FY04 and the subsequent Country Partnership Strategies (CPS) between FY05 and
FY13 objectives of reforming the economy, maintaining budget discipline, enhancing the
effectiveness of public spending via closure of selected uneconomic mines at which
production had already or was scheduled to be stopped, significant reduction of subsidies'
pressure on the budget, and savings in unemployment benefits via job creation. Further,
the development and implementation of the social development schemes, the small grants
scheme directed to disadvantaged groups, and the local capacity building provided by the
project supported the objectives of promoting social inclusion and addressing the needs
of vulnerable communities. The Bank Group’s assistance also supported a broad set of
structural and sectorial reforms to accelerate growth and pave the way for Romania’s
eventual accession to the European Union.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
(as approved)

9.      The development objective of the project was “to strengthen the Government’s
ability to undertake mining sector reform by (i) building MEC capacity for closing
uneconomic mining enterprises through support for closing complex mines and ancillary
enterprises in an environmentally sustainable manner; and (ii) providing support to the
National Agency for Development and Implementation of Reconstruction Programs for
the Mining Regions (AZM), local communities and other agencies for community-based
planning and socio-economic regeneration of the mining regions.? The PDO in the Loan
Agreement was slightly different in that the second part read, “(ii) providing support to
AZM, RSDF, mining communities and local public authorities for socio-economic
regeneration of the mining regions?. In other words, it added support for the Romanian
Social Development Fund (RSDF) and removed the reference to community-based
planning. This difference is essentially inconsequential.

Key indicators were:
    Subsidy monitoring system shows decline in level of subsidies to meet EU target
       dates;
    Hard budget constraints on mining companies to prevent accumulation of
       additional arrears for state and municipal taxes, and electricity tariffs;5
    Number of mines and mining enterprises closed in an environmentally sound
       manner;



5
  While these first two indicators appeared on p. 4 of the Project Appraisal Document they were not
repeated in the results framework. However, the results framework as revised at restructuring included an
indicator labeled “subsidies?, targeting a decline in subsidies. The hard budget constraints apparently were
never tracked.


                                                     3
       Area of land rehabilitated and transferred by the mining companies to other
        parties;
       Number of jobs created/supported by the project;
       Number of beneficiaries from employment and training incentives scheme
        (ETIS);
       Number of additional loans, and amount disbursed by micro-credit program;
       Repayment rate of micro-credit loans;
       Number and value of sub-projects implemented under SDSMC;
       Number of beneficiaries from SDSMC sub-projects;
       Number of community groups in mining settlements mobilized through Small
        Grants Scheme (SGS) implementation; and
       Number of beneficiaries/recipients that are able to access resources from other
        programs for local development activities.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and Reasons/Justification

10.     Following the midterm review in 2008, the PDO was revised as follows: “to
strengthen the government’s ability to undertake mining sector reform by: (i) building
MEC’s capacity for closing uneconomic mining enterprises through support for closing
complex mines and ancillary facilities in an environmentally sustainable manner; and
(ii) providing support to mining communities and local public authorities for socio-
economic regeneration of the mining regions through central entities.? This change was
made to focus the attention of the Socio-Economic Regeneration (SER) component on
capacity building and other support to beneficiary communities and local governments
for local development planning in a manner that was consistent with a broader regional
development approach and the metric of EU programs. At the time AZM was
experiencing significant internal difficulties that could have impeded the achievement of
that part of the PDO referring to AZM.

11.     The revised key performance indicators for the SER component were: (i)
percentage of LPAs from operating area which have issued strategic development plans
in a participatory manner in total LPAs in the operating area; (ii) percentage of
communities in the operating area that are funding the priorities identified in the strategic
plans (by accessing national, EU, etc. programs); (iii) average percentage increase in own
revenues of the local budgets in the operating area (baseline - the first year in which the
mining companies stopped contributing to local budgets as a result of mine
closure/shrinking activities); (iv) total number of jobs financed under SER (employees
under Employment and Training Incentive Scheme (ETIS), Workspace Centers (WSCs),
and Social Development Scheme for Mining Communities (SDSCM) income generation
activities3), and; (v) percentage of localities reached by SER measures in total localities
of the AZM operating area.6


6
  As noted below, the micro-credits scheme subcomponent was dropped at this time and hence is not
reflected in the revised indicators.

                                                   4
1.4 Main Beneficiaries

12.     The main beneficiaries of the project were the inhabitants of the mining regions,
taxpayers, general public and the GOR. The main beneficiaries of the mine closure7 sub-
component of the project were the taxpayers and GOR. Taxpayers would benefit from the
reduction in the tax burden needed to finance the inefficient operation of the mines, and
GOR would benefit from the technical assistance received from the Bank. The
environmental regeneration sub-component would also have a positive impact for the
mining communities, as well as general public, by eliminating negative externalities due
to the mining industry. Finally, the SER component of the project was designed to benefit
the mining communities at large. Some sub-components (i.e., ETIS and WCS) were
aimed at decreasing unemployment in mining regions, while the Small Grant Scheme
(SGS) and others were designed to target specific vulnerable groups within mining
communities (i.e., women, youth, children, and the elderly) and the MI component was
designed to provide public good benefits to local municipalities.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

The project consisted of three components as follows:

Component 1: Mine Closure and Environmental Regeneration (US$ 72.0 million)

13.     This component was designed to support the closure and environmental
rehabilitation of mines and/or mine processing facilities, as well as to help start the
implementation of the recommendations of a Sector Environmental Assessment carried
out in 2002. Mine Closure, the first sub-component, included the physical operations
required by the closure of the sites chosen by the GOR and the Bank and the technical
assistance needed to bring GOR closure procedures in line with good international
practice.

14.    Environmental Regeneration, the second sub-component, was designed to
improve environmental performance in the mining sector by preparing: (a) a handbook
for implementation of an environmental management system in the mining sector; (b) a
handbook for environmental procedures in the mining sector; (c) guidelines for integrated
monitoring of environmental impacts generated by mining activities; and (d) an
environmental monitoring pilot project at two sites.

Component 2: Socio-Economic Regeneration (SER) (US$ 68.4 million)

15. This component aimed to scale up the job creation activities piloted by the
MCSMP and to add sub-components to improve local conditions for economic growth


7
  Mine closure does not refer to stopping production at a mine. Rather it refers to, as noted in Wikipedia,
“the period of time when the ore-extracting activities of a mine have ceased, and final decommissioning
and mine reclamation are being completed.?

                                                      5
and social regeneration. The main objectives of the SER component were to: (a) scale up
the job creation measures implemented under the MCSMP; (b) support local
development activities through community capacity building and financing of economic
infrastructure and social services; and (c) strengthen the Borrower’s capacity to
implement the SER component.

16.     Measures to support job creation activities in mining regions were intended to
reduce the unemployment lag between mining regions and the rest of Romania. Initially,
the following three job creation activities were included: an Employment and Training
Incentive Scheme (ETIS), a Micro-Credit Scheme (MCS), and Workspace Centers
(WCS). ETIS was designed to help unemployed people from the mining regions find a
place in the labor market by stimulating the creation of new jobs and providing suitable
training for those jobs. The Workspace Centers were designed to support business
incubation by providing physical locations and consultancy services to start-up
companies in mining regions. The Micro-Credit Scheme, originally intended to scale up
an MCSMP program run by two NGOS, was dropped from the project following the
Mid-Term review, due to changes in the regulatory environment and expanding access to
credit that rendered it no longer relevant.

17.    Following a “bottom-up? approach, the support to local development activities
aimed to enhance stakeholder involvement in community-based development processes.
These activities included: (a) Social Development Schemes for the Mining Communities
(SDSMC), (b) Municipal Infrastructure (MI), (c) a Small Grants Scheme (SGS), and
(d) Community Capacity Building (CCB).

18.      SDSMC was designed to support local development in mining regions through
community capacity building and financing investments in community infrastructure,
income generating activities, and community-based social services. The Municipal
Infrastructure sub-component was designed to help improve public services in mining
regions by supporting community involvement in the process of identification and
selection of small infrastructure projects as well as assuring the sustainability of the
rehabilitated infrastructure. SGS was designed to improve the welfare of disadvantaged
groups (i.e., women, youth, and elderly) in the mining regions and induce social capital
growth in mining regions. And CCB was designed to encourage social dialog and to
facilitate the community involvement in the process of socio-economic regeneration in
the mining regions.

19.     Finally, a third cluster of activities was designed to strengthen the institutional
capacity of AZM, PMU-SER, and RSDF to implement the project. It included three
activities: (a) social impact monitoring and evaluation, to facilitate impact evaluation of
the project; (b) public information, to design and implement a public information
strategy; and (c) institutional development and training, to provide capacity building for
AZM, PMU-SER, and RSDF.

Component 3: Institutional Support (US$ 5.8 million)

20.     This third component included institutional support for the PMUs handling
components 1 and 2, including such incremental operating costs as salaries, supplies,
travel costs, and workshops.

Project Restructuring

21.   First restructuring: A Level I restructuring of the project was carried out in
September, 2008 to revise the PDO to better reflect the focus of the project on the socio-
economic regeneration of the mining communities, at local level, and not the
implementing agencies.

22.     At the same time a number of design changes were made in order to match the
new objectives and operating environment, in particular the arena of EU policies and
programs. First, the micro-credit scheme was dropped since it was no longer relevant due
to changes in the economic climate in Romania, including greater availability of credit in
the local market. Furthermore, the legislation regulating micro-finance institutions
(MFIs) in Romania was changed and, in this context, a targeted approach to micro-credit
was not found attractive by MFIs. For these reasons, the funds earmarked for this sub-
component were re-allocated to other SER activities. Second, the Key Performance
Indicators (KPI) and Monitoring Framework were revised in order to better reflect the
context at the time (in particular alignment with EU policies and programs; this is
particular relevant with respect to PDO indicators 3 and 4) and to focus on outcomes as
opposed to outputs (the actual changes in KPI and monitoring Framework are presented
in Section F of the Datasheet). Third, the disbursement schedule was simplified in order
to counteract the complexity of the Loan Agreement (LA) which, coupled with the
Romanian requirements that all changes to the LA be subject to lengthy approval process,
were deemed to introduce delays in the implementation of the project. As a consequence,
the disbursement categories were consolidated into just three categories.

23.     Second, Third, and Fourth Restructurings: The project was restructured three
more times primarily to extend the closing date, first by 18 months, then by an additional
six months and finally by 5 more months. Thus the project closed on October 31, 2012
rather than the originally planned date of May 31, 2010. These extensions were justified
in terms of the time needed to finish works at several mine closure sites as well as some
municipal infrastructure projects. These delays were caused by the chronic shortages of
Government counterpart funding.




                                            7
24.    The third restructuring also included cancellation of US$ 31,089,780 from the
Loan proceeds. This was possible because of the substantial savings achieved by
following the Bank’s procurement requirements relative to the estimates (which had been
based on the usual costs in Romania). While the Ministry had suggested using these
savings to do additional works, the November, 2011 mission concluded that such works
could not be reliably concluded without additional extensions of the closing date and,
consequently, the Borrower agreed to request cancelation of these funds. The Loan
amount was thereby revised from US$120 million to US$ 88.91 million effective
November 28, 2011.


                Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Design and Quality at Entry

25.      The project's overall quality at entry received a “Highly Satisfactory? rating from
the Quality Assurance Group (QAG). Several dimensions, namely technical, financial
and economic aspects; poverty, gender and social development; as well as policy and
institutional aspects, were rated Highly Satisfactory, while all others were rated
Satisfactory, except for Environmental aspects, which were rated Moderately Satisfactory.

26.     The design of the project was sound, albeit complex. Selection of mines for
closure was based on the complexity, rather than size of the mine, and sought to
undertake closure with best environmental mitigation practices. The selection was
justified in order to fully capitalize on the Bank’s technical expertise and experience with
mining sector reforms both in Romania and in other ECA countries. Sector
Environmental Assessment (SEA) was used to develop the Environmental Management
Plans for mines selected for closure. Additionally, an assessment of the land acquisition
law and procedures was prepared and used in the development of the Resettlement Policy
Framework. The PSIA further served the project to better target the beneficiaries.

27.     However, the desire to cover all possible dimensions of environmental, social, and
economic regeneration led to a very complex design of the SER component, with its 10
different subcomponents. This made the project expensive to supervise and taxed the
capacity of AZM, an organization plagued by bureaucratic politics and low staff morale.
In retrospect, a more simple structure and/or a more experienced implementing agency
(such as the Romanian Social Development Fund) would have facilitated project
implementation.

28.    At the design stage, the project could not have anticipated the changes that were
to be made in the legal, policy and institutional frameworks of Romania, and which
eventually triggered the restructuring of the project. Examples include the GOR decision
to harmonize the salary scales of PMUs with those of public servants and to transition
from special accounts to central budgeting (for details, see Section 2.2). There were also

                                             8
other factors that the project design could not anticipate that emerged during
implementation (see Section 2.2). Nor did it anticipate the changes brought through the
process of accession to the European Union.

Lessons of earlier operations taken into account

29.     A number of valuable lessons were drawn from the Bank’s previous experiences
with mine sector reforms in Romania, Poland, Russia, and Ukraine as well as from the
2005 PSIA. These included: (i) creation of jobs cannot be achieved simply through active
labor market measures, but support to individual job-seekers needs to be complemented
by support for investments in local development for community mobilization, economic
infrastructure, and social services; (ii) targeted labor redeployment programs limited to
former miners are less effective than broad-based programs aimed at all job-seekers in
mining communities; (iii) the local economy benefits in the short term during the mine
closure period through local employment and procurement of goods; however socio-
economic regeneration is a long term process that takes 10-15 years of sustained effort,
and; (iv) mine closure designs need to allow for at least 2 to 3 planting seasons for re-
vegetation of affected areas.

Risk Assessment

30.   The overall risk of the project was rated as Moderate in the Project Appraisal
Document (PAD). The PAD identified several potential risks and appropriate mitigation
measures were clearly spelt out.

31.    Adequacy of Participatory Process. Project preparation involved broad-based
consultations with the mining community representatives, workers, companies, mayors
and government officials (notably from the Ministry of Economy and Commerce and
CONVERSMIN 8 ). The participatory approach was instrumental in the success of the
community level projects as communities positively recognized their inputs into design
and monitored the projects in terms of ensuring that due process was being followed and
standards maintained.

32.     Adequacy of Government Commitment. The GOR was committed to the
project and actively engaged in the design and preparation process. This commitment was
demonstrated by (a) adopting the Mining Sector Strategy 2004 – 2010; (b) engaging with
the trade unions to garner their support for implementing the strategy; and (c) making the
MCESER project a pillar of the GOR mining strategy. Section (2.2) will elaborate and
nuance some of the above government commitment actions as they affected the




8
 Preservation and Mine Closure Enterprise (Societatea Comerciala de Conservare si
Inchidere a Minelor), the state enterprise responsible for overseeing the closure of state
owned mines.


                                             9
implementation of the project. However, as discussed below, Government funding was
frequently inadequate during project implementation.

2.2 Implementation

33.     The MCESER project was focused on the physical closure of unprofitable or
inactive mines, environmental remediation of these sites and socioeconomic regeneration
of the mining regions. During the 2008 Mid-Term Review (MTR), it was agreed that a
short-term action plan was needed in order to address a number of pressing issues that
were delaying implementation. These issues included (a) immediate resources allocation
to allow previous commitments to be met; amending the Loan Agreement to consolidate
disbursements categories; (b) revising the PDO; (c) dropping the microcredits scheme,
and; (d) recruiting the PMU-SER director. Specifically, the following factors affected
project implementation:

      (i) Disbursements were low and inconsistent during most of the project period.
      There were delays in ratification of the loan agreement, signing of the Subsidiary
      Loan Agreement, and preparation and approval of a series of Operational Manuals.
      These cumulatively delayed the timeline.

      (ii) Furthermore, the Ministry of Public Finance was unable to provide funds
      consistently to ensure smooth project operations. Beginning January 1, 2009, due
      to the consolidation of debt management by the Ministry, the GOR had to pre-
      finance 100% of the project expenditures. The combination of weaknesses in
      public finance management (notably the weakness in implementation of the
      Medium Term Expenditure Framework), weak commitment to the project and the
      difficulties associated with the global financial crisis, particularly the fiscal crisis,
      created significant problems. The decision of the GOR to move from a system of
      payment through special accounts to one working through a system of budget
      advances slowed down disbursements by making disbursement requests to the
      World Bank both more lumpy and more susceptible to cash flow constraints. The
      PMUs no longer had direct access to the loan proceeds. As a consequence, the
      PMUs could only disburse amounts provided through the regular state budget
      approval process (i.e., conducted annually and amended through mid-year
      rectifications), which were never sufficient. For example, until CY12 (well past the
      original project closing date and the first 18 month extension), the project never
      received more than 25% of the projected budget required for timely
      implementation. This became a huge constraint once the PMUs were locked into
      contracts for which they did not have adequate budget disbursements and were
      forced to spend a significant amount of time trying to restructure implementation
      schedules to accommodate budgetary constraints. Given that these changes
      occurred during the implementation of the project and applied to the Bank’s entire
      portfolio, this could not have been anticipated during project preparation (as
      mentioned in Section 2.1).




                                             10
(iii) The delays evident in the first quarter of 2012 resulting from the extended
time for authorization of the Government Decision approving the November, 2011
restructuring created further disbursement complexes. The Government Decision
on the extension was published in the Official Gazette on August 12, 2012, two
months before project closing. At the time of preparing the request for project
budgeting in 2012, the PIU assumed a timeframe scenario of an 18 month
extension and the budget request to MoPF included one additional round of
SDSMC subprojects and 140 SGS micro-projects. The MoPF included in the
project budget for 2012 the entire amount requested by the PIU. The combination
of loss of implementation time awaiting Government approval of the (shorter)
extension and the curtailment of one of the Municipal Infrastructure projects
(Zlatna) resulted in an unused balance of US$4,904,883.71 at the end of the grace
period (Feb 28, 2013), an amount cancelled as of March 25, 2013 with the closing
of the loan account. The final loan disbursed amount was US$84,005.336.29 and
the final total cancelled amount was US$35,994,663.71.

(iv) The Emergency Governmental Decision #114/2009, which introduced a rule to
align PMU staff salaries to civil servants’ salaries, provoked many personnel to
leave the PMUs. This meant that PMU salaries suddenly decreased up to 70% on
January 1, 2010. In response, many of the staff members with specialized
knowledge of Bank procedures, including financial experts, either left for other
employment or took medical or other leave. In 2010, the situation at the PMU-SER
was critical, as the finance manager and the accounting specialist took medical and
paternity leave, respectively.

(v) The Mine Closure component had a slow start due to bureaucratic delays and
an initial steep learning curve associated with the closure of complex mines (such
as environmental permits, construction licensees, etc.). It further required
improvements in technical closure plans that reflected technical advisors’
recommendations and changes in the environmental regulations following EU
accession (e.g., implementation of new technologies to handle environmental
issues in line with Best Available Techniques (BATs)). The closure of the
Calimani mine, for instance, had to be dropped due to delays in design and a
revised cost analysis that made the closure impossible to complete within the given
time frame.

(vi) The initial delay in the appointment of the PMU-SER Director impacted the
implementation of the SER component. At the time, the Acting Director was the
PMU’s procurement specialist. Both positions were full time jobs and it was a
challenge to do justice to both, as each had considerable roles and responsibilities.
Moreover, the Acting Director position was not perceived to have the same
authority as that of a Full time Director, adding to the management challenge.

(vii) After Romania became a member of the EU, the Government tended to favor
projects financed under the interest-free EU structural funds rather than those
financed by borrowed funds. The Bank funds were additionally unable to match

                                     11
       the size of the EU funds. The narrow perception that privileged volume over other
       qualities of Bank financed operations might help explain the delays in the
       MCESER Project payments.

       (viii) The implementation of the MI subcomponent was delayed by some 12 to 18
       months due to the requirement of approval by the Cabinet of all externally
       financed sub-projects, irrespective of size. 9 . In addition, new bureaucratic
       requirements, such as the introduction of mandatory feasibility studies for all
       externally financed projects irrespective of size, affected the MI subcomponent.

       (ix) In late 2007, there was a complaint made to the Inspection Panel by a
       carpentry company adjacent to the Vermesti mine closure site, alleging that project
       activities had resulted in flooding of private property. The Bank team and the PMU
       responded promptly to investigate the problem and discovered that the flooding
       was not due to project activities but rather to the failure of preexisting drainage
       channels incapable of discharging high volumes of water without flooding. They
       further agreed with the community on remedial actions, even though the mine
       closure works had not contributed to the flooding, including replacing the existing
       channels with a much larger cemented canal. Given the agreement between the
       PMU and the community, when the Inspection Panel visited in January, 2008 they
       agreed with the community to take no further action for six months. When the
       Panel checked back on the situation at the end of the six months, the community
       advised the Inspection panel to close the case, to which it agreed. The construction
       of the canal brought delays to the original schedule, due to the time it took to
       coordinate with the National Railroad as the replacement canal had to go under the
       railroad to reach the river.

       (x) During project implementation, Romania was affected by the global financial
       crisis. This resulted in a severe contraction of the economy. One consequence was
       a decline in construction prices. This contributed to reducing the cost of mine
       closure operations relative to the original estimates.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

34.     M&E design. The initial approach to data management was to have the regional
AZM offices update information in a central database. However, networking connectivity
issues as well as financial constraints, made such centralized data processing unfeasible.
After the 2008 Mid-Term Review, a decision was taken to develop customized M&E
systems for each of the subcomponents, using the approach already developed for ETIS




9
  The Ministry of Public Finance was reluctant to do away with this requirement, despite successful
precedents (e.g., the Rural Development Project) and duplication with the consolidation of debt
management by the Ministry.


                                                    12
as a model. CONVERSMIN and the regional AZM offices had developed adequate
methods for collecting these data.

35.     PDO Indicators. The quality of selected indicators applied to track and measure
project performance is mixed. Several indicators in retrospect should have been dropped
at project restructuring. For example, the PDO indicator measuring the hectare acreage of
rehabilitated land transferred by mining companies to other parties was not a relevant
indicator, subsequent to a decision to focus on quality substance of complex mine closure
rather than the quantity of reclaimed land transferred as a result. Likewise, the PDO
indicator on subsidies relates to a larger political economy issue, changes within which
can not be solely attributed to the project. This indicator should also have been dropped
when the project was restructured.

36.     M&E implementation. CONVERSMIN and the regional AZM offices regularly
collected data according to indicators developed during project preparation. For example,
the data collected by the PMU-SER covered: (i) number of tenants in the WSC, (ii)
number of jobs financed under ETIS, (iii) number of projects financed under ETIS (1
year after the completion of the scheme), (iv) number of projects financed under MI, (v)
total number of assisted localities under CCC program, (vi) number of SDSMC sub-
projects implemented, (vii) number of SGS micro-projects implemented, and (viii)
number of persons trained and assisted under the WSCMES program and others. This
data formed the bases of quarterly reports that were created to reflect the progress of each
of the project sub-components. The initial plans to build systematic impact evaluation
into the project were frustrated by disagreements between the Bank’s task team and the
PMU-SER, a lengthy delay in doing the baseline survey (2007), and insufficient budget
allocations resulting in very small sample sizes per sub-component.

37.     M&E utilization. Data collected by PMUs and project quarterly reports were
evaluated and used for decision-making and to track progress. For example, under the
mine closure component, data was collected in order to report progress on the area of
rehabilitated land transferred by mining companies to other parties. Under the socio-
economic regeneration component, data was used to evaluate the degree of success of the
different sub-component measures.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Safeguard: Three safeguard policies were triggered: Environmental Assessment
(OP/BP/GP 4.01), Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12), and Dam Safety (OP/BP
4.37).

38.     Social Safeguards: Regular reviews of Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12) in
the course of supervision found that all civil works at sites were in compliance with
OP/BP 4.12. There were no instances of involuntary resettlement or land acquisition
since construction took place on unencumbered public lands and did not in any way
require land acquisition.



                                            13
39.      Environmental Safeguards: The project was assigned an environmental
Category B (Partial Assessment) based on the issues associated with the physical closure
of the mines. The project did not pose any major environmental risk beyond what is
normally expected in the case of mine closure projects. Supervision of environmental
safeguards was undertaken during the implementation of the project and no compliance
issues emerged. The task team included an environmental specialist from the US
Environmental Protection Agency with extensive experience in mine closure, including
the safety of tailings dams. Standards and procedures were established for the monitoring
of air and meteorological parameters, water (including surface, underground, seepage,
drainage and drinking water), acid rock drainage (from waste dumps and tailings dams),
soil, stability, and subsidence issues. Measures were put in place to prevent or to contain
any possible environmental harmful impacts of the mine closure activities. For example,
water contamination at Baia de Aries was identified as a serious issue. As a consequence,
water sampling and testing were performed constantly and arrangements were made for a
water treatment plant as part of the closure. Moreover, the contractor at Baia de Aries,
under the guidance of the supervising engineer and the PMU, took significant health and
safety precautions with hazardous materials including isolation of such materials and
washing of vehicle tires upon exiting contaminated areas.

40.    Fiduciary Compliance: The project complied with fiduciary covenants during
implementation. Internal control arrangements were in place and an adequate financial
management system and records were maintained. The Bank’s regular supervision post-
reviews and financial management reviews confirmed that, despite the delays
experienced due to lack of counterpart funding and loss of key staff including the PMU-
SER Director, the two PMUs were in compliance with the Bank’s Procurement and
Consultant Guidelines in conducting procurement processes.

41.     The Romanian Court of Accounts (RCA) has opened a case against the MCESER
Mine Closure PMU on allegations of the misuse of administrative procedures in the
matter of how the procurement rules were observed during the implementation of the
MCESER project. The proceedings of the RCA versus the Mine Closure PMU have gone
through the various legal and judicial layers and are currently being arbitrated at the High
Court of Cassation. A Bank procurement review noted that procurement appeared to be
fully in line with the relevant Bank Guidelines. The issue was referred to INT who did
not establish any specific information on fraud and corruption in the audit report
submitted by the CoA of Romania. Should the ongoing court case bring to light specific
information of significant fiduciary or integrity concerns, the Bank may decide to revisit
the matter.10

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase




10
   As this allegation is the subject of an ongoing court case and has been referred to the Bank’s Institutional
Integrity Vice-Presidency (INT), the wording of this paragraph was provided by INT.


                                                      14
42.     CONVERSMIN, the state mine closure enterprise, is responsible for monitoring
activities during the post-closure period, including the maintenance of works. Post-
closure monitoring plans have been established based on annually updated technical
designs and provide evidence of likely sustainable outcomes from mine closure
interventions introduced through the project, although the short period transpiring since
project closing makes conjecture on sustainability outcomes premature.

43.    Following these technical designs, the General Directorate for Mineral Resources
determines the amount and nature of monitoring activities as well as the required funds
for each monitored closed mine. The quality of site stewardship and water quality
monitoring, especially for those sites closed early in the life of the project, provide
evidence of enhanced capacity and sustainable impact. CONVERSMIN has benefited
from the transfer of knowledge and experience of the PMUs’ staff trained under
MCESER project. Good working practices were developed during the MCESER project
and have been adopted and implemented by CONVERSMIN. These are documented in:
the Mine Closure Manual, the Manual for Implementing the Environment Procedures in
Mining Sector, the Manual for Closure of Uranium Mines, the Manual for Closure of Salt
Mines, the Mine Closure Public Facilitator’s Guide, and the Manual for Post-Closure
Monitoring. Additionally, training courses were organized for all the three key actors in
the mine closure process – designers, engineers, and constructors, following which more
than 65 persons have received training certificates.

44.    Pertaining to the socio-economic component of the project, AZM no longer exists.
However, the recent (2013) reorganization of the Ministry of Economy includes a
Division for Sustainable Development of the Industrial Areas, with four regional offices,
which has absorbed some of the former PMU-SER staff members and has taken on
responsibility for the former AZM functions. This Division is thus expected to continue
and amplify the intervention measures developed under the socio-economic regeneration
component of the project. An internal analysis undertaken by the Romanian counterparts
revealed that the community driven approach developed under the Bank loan
complements well the EU funding schemes, which are typically of larger scale and do not
cover integrated small scale interventions at the local level.

                                      Assessment of Outcomes

3.1      Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

45.     The revised PDO11 remains clear, relevant, and important to Romania’s economic
and social development given that the mining sector in Romania needed to be
restructured in order to eliminate the unprofitable mining enterprises, reduce the burden
on taxpayers, and to comply with EU regulations (a process that continues in the wake of


11
  And also the initial PDO, although to a lesser degree given its weaker focus on local level capacity
building.


                                                    15
the project). The project directly contributed to the Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy
development objectives of revitalization of the economy in rural areas and
macroeconomic stabilization. The Bank Group’s assistance also supported a broad set of
structural and sectoral reforms that helped pave the way for Romania’s integration to the
European Union. With respect to implementation, pro-active management of the project,
including restructuring of PDO and results framework, contributed to maintaining the
relevance of the project objectives and design in a fast changing environment.

3.2        Achievement of Project Development Objectives

 I.        Mine Closure and Environmental Rehabilitation

46.     The question to be asked here is whether MEC’s capacity for closing uneconomic
mining enterprises was enhanced through support for closing complex mines and
ancillary facilities in an environmentally sustainable manner. This part of the PDO had
two key performance indicators. The first of these, “knowledge and procedures on mine
closure in line with international best practices are transferred and implemented?, has
been fully achieved through the development of the manuals and training discussed in
section 2.5 above as well as by the strengthening of the legal framework for management
and implementation of mine closure (i.e., 98 legal codicils specific to mining activities
and mine closures, 3 laws, 2 emergency Government ordinances, and 2 Government
ordinances). The second, “area of rehabilitated land that is transferred by mining
companies to other parties?, was not achieved. However, this is because the PMU and
the Bank’s task team made a conscious decision to focus on quality of mine closure
practice rather than quantity as measured by area of land reclaimed. 12 The project
undertook the closure of mines from which significant lessons could be learned and, in so
doing, completed 23 closures rather than the 20 anticipated during project preparation.
These closures were accomplished not only in an environmentally sustainable way, but
also through extensive community consultation at and around the closure sites, in a way
that promotes social sustainability. There was no difference in the PDO for this
component either between the PAD and the Loan Agreement or before and after
restructuring. The achievements under this component could well be considered highly
satisfactory, however, given that they required multiple closure extensions to be achieved,
are rated satisfactory.

II.        Socio-Economic Regeneration
  
47.     The question to be addressed here is whether the project (a) provided support to
AZM (and RSDF in the version in the Loan Agreement), local communities and other
agencies for community-based planning and socioeconomic regeneration of the mining
regions (before restructuring) or (b) provided support to mining communities and local
public authorities for socio-economic regeneration of the mining regions through central
entities (after restructuring). There are three key performance indicators for this part of



12
     This indicator should have been dropped in retrospect when the project was restructured.

                                                      16
the PDO, all added at restructuring13. The first, the percentage of local public authorities
from the operating area that have issued strategic development plans in a participatory
manner, was exceeded by more than 55 percent. The second, the percentage of assisted
communities in the operating area that are funding the priorities identified in the strategic
plans by accessing other programs, was slightly overachieved (3.5%). The third, the
average increase in own revenues of the local budgets in the operating area, was
overachieved by 640 percent. All but two of the eleven post-restructuring intermediate
outcome indicators, which focus on the results of the specific SER subcomponents,
exceeded their targets. 14 The project used a battery of complementary measures to
intervene in the targeted mining communities, including: subsidizing the labor supply
(ETIS); subsidizing the cost of operating businesses and increasing the demand for labor
(WSC); financing both municipal and community infrastructure (MI and SDSMC);
supporting programs for particularly vulnerable groups (SGS); and promoting community
dialogue and participation (CCB). That these measures had a positive impact is suggested
both by the overachievement of most intermediate outcome indicators and the positive
feedback received from beneficiary surveys (cf. Annex 5).

48.      Another set of activities under this component was intended to strengthen the
institutional capacity of AZM, PMU-SER, and RSDF through social impact monitoring
and evaluation, public information, and institutional development and training. It could
be argued that these activities were less successful. Over the course of project
implementation, AZM remained fraught with internal rivalries that impacted on project
implementation. As described above, key human resources trained under the project in
PMU-SER left the project for greener pastures when their salaries were cut. And RSDF,
as a very successful implementer of several other community-driven development
programs, was not in need of strengthening. Nonetheless, despite these institutional
weaknesses within AZM and PMU-SER, this component achieved strong results and
RASDIA, as AZM’s successor, is now well placed to continue supporting the socio-
economic regeneration of mining, and other, regions, as part of MEC.

49.     In light of the above, the project outcome for socio-economic regeneration post
restructuring is considered satisfactory; when examined in terms of the original PDO, the
rating becomes moderately satisfactory.

50.     Rating: Considering the above achievements, the project outcome after
restructuring is rated satisfactory; with respect to the original PDO the rating is
moderately satisfactory. Weighting by disbursements (cf. Annex 9) would give an
overall rating of satisfactory. However, considering that three out of the originally
planned 5 years implementation period occurred before restructuring and that achieving



13
   The indicators in the PAD for this component were retained as intermediate outcome indicators
following the restructuring.
14
   At restructuring several of the intermediate outcome indicators were somewhat revised and two were
dropped because they referred to the dropped micro-credit scheme. Under the original results framework 5
out of 13 intermediate indicators were not achieved.

                                                   17
the project’s objectives required 2.5 years of extension, overall efficacy is rated
Moderately Satisfactory.


3.3    Efficiency

51.     The PAD did not provide economic analysis for the mine closure component,
merely suggesting that the mines would be closed on a least cost basis. Available (albeit
limited) evidence suggests that closure costs under the project were efficient. The
economic analysis for the SER component, based on the ETIS and WSCMES schemes,
shows a rather impressive IRR of 75%. Sensitivity analysis suggests that this result
remains acceptable as long as one assumes that more than 20 percent of the jobs created
would not have been created without the project. But this analysis (which is really more
akin to a financial analysis) covers only a relatively small part of the project. Lack of
access to data posed a serious constraint to doing the economic analysis and made it
impossible to do a broader analysis. Therefore we are downgrading the rating for
efficiency to moderately satisfactory.

3.4    Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

52.    Relevance is satisfactory. The project objectives, both original and revised, are
relevant when compared to the CAS and the GOR’s 2004-2010 Mining Sector Strategy.
They also remain highly relevant when compared to CPS 2006-2009, Government
Program 2005 -2008, CPS 2009-2013, and Government Program 2009-2013, respectively.
Moreover, the project fits both GOR’s strategically development objectives, as well as
the European Union mining directives.

53.     Achievement of the PDO is moderately satisfactory. The project
implementation has in many cases exceeded the target values as shown by the key
performance indicators values. Moreover, this was achieved against a generally adverse
environment, including the financial crisis and insufficient loan disbursements.
Nevertheless, there are a number of issues mentioned in the previous sections that stood
out as barriers to smooth implementation, including extensions to the project that do not
suggest that the achievement of the project is fully satisfactory. It is additionally difficult
to make judgments regarding the impact of project schemes in the absence of a solid
treatment-control group evaluation framework.

54.     Efficiency is moderately satisfactory. Although constrained by a paucity of data,
the cost benefit analysis seems to suggest a reasonable degree of efficiency.

Based on the discussion in sections 3.1–3.3, the overall outcome is rated Moderately
Satisfactory.

3.5    Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

                                              18
55.     Poverty Impacts: One of the main emphases of the MCESER, drawing from the
PSIA, was to create opportunities for the people living in former mining communities to
reduce the socio-economic gap with the rest of the country. As intended, the project
helped reduce the poverty levels in the mining regions through employment creation and
income generation. For example, the number of registered unemployed in targeted
mining localities decreased by 10% from December, 2011 to September, 2012, while the
number of registered unemployed in the counties with mining localities decreased in the
same period only by 6%. This seems to suggest that MCESER had a positive impact on
stimulating the local economy. However, the financial crisis that affected the country
during the project implementation period has made it difficult to gauge the impact of the
project on poverty

56.     Gender Aspects: The Poverty and Social Impact Analysis carried out in 2005
ensured better targeting of women. The project was designed with gender sensitivity in
mind and, indeed, between 2005 and 2012, out of the 654,766 direct beneficiaries of the
SER component, 325,424 (49.7%) were women. RSDF, in preparing to implement the
Social Development Scheme for Mining Communities undertook a specific study to
assess the low involvement of women in development activities in such communities
(despite the assessment that mining sector restructuring hit women particularly hard) so
as to be able to better encourage their participation. The Small Grants Scheme focused on
several areas of particular concern to mothers, including child protection, access to child
care to allow mothers to work, and facilities for kindergartens. Over 45 percent of the
ETIS beneficiaries were women.

57.     Social Development: The project contributed to building the social cohesion of
communities and reportedly has led to positive outcomes in health, educational
achievements, crime prevention, community participation, and citizen empowerment in
the context of local economic development. Furthermore, there was significant
community participation in the choice of supplementary civil works connected to mine
closure and infrastructure works. Community meetings were held regularly in order to
obtain consensus regarding local infrastructure improvements that were in the spirit of
Mine Closure works and within the PMU budget. Some examples of infrastructure
improvements as a result of popular participation include: (i) developing access roads to
inhabited areas near the Aninoasa Sud premises, (ii) repairing the church near the main
premises of Valea De Brazi mine, (iii) reconstructing the road and bridge over the River
Jiu, towards Dalja town (near Livezeni Preparation Plant), (iv) protecting of the River Jiu
embankment with sand bags near the Uricani Preparation Plant and Uricani 5 Est Mine.
Moreover, under SDSMC the investments in small infrastructure covered the following:
roads and bridges rehabilitation (71 subprojects), water supply (14 subprojects),
community centers rehabilitation (13 subprojects), playgrounds (4 subprojects), and
rehabilitation of buildings (community centers and apartment houses – 80 subprojects).

(b) Institutional Change/ Strengthening.




                                            19
58.     Due to changes in the mining sector in Romania, state institutions changed their
orientation from being production and output driven to having a regulatory role. The
project supported this evolution by assisting the GOR in its pursuit of closing the mines
to international best practice standards. Specifically, it was successful in the introduction
of FIDIC15 standards and transfer of this know-how across the mining sector in Romania,
introduction of international quality mine closure procedures, and introduction of
community consultation (which led to supplementary community works around the
closure sites). Furthermore, the subsidies for the mining industry declined in view of
complying with the deadline set forth by European Union (i.e., USD 54.2 million were
awarded as compared to the target of USD 60 million in 2012). 16

3.1 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

59.     An assessment analysis of the SER project was carried out in 2011. Its main
findings include the following17: (i) approximately 70% of ETIS beneficiaries thought it
was highly important for their families and 50% of employers subsidized by ETIS
mentioned that it had contributed significantly to the development of the business. Many
felt it was a motivating factor in running their businesses legally; (ii) some 160
communities were assisted through the Small Grant Scheme, with their combined
populations totaling over 1 million inhabitants. An important accomplishment was the
provision of facilities for community members such as parks, playground, kindergartens,
and community centers; (iii) the CCB scheme largely fulfilled its proposed goals and
objectives and had a positive impact on the local mining-based communities. It was
instrumental in building institutional capacity and community participatory capacity in
areas that featured a challenging socio-economic situation.


                               Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Moderate

60.     The GOR shows strong commitment to the closure of uneconomic mines. This is
supported by the national mining strategy for 2008–2020. However, there is a chance that
the recurrent financial crisis might prevent the full implementation of the mine closure
strategy. This risk is mitigated by pressure from the EU to ensure that uneconomic mines
are closed in an environmentally acceptable way. Resentment among the mining
communities due to the mine closures was mitigated through the transparent and
participatory approaches to both major components of the project. The GOR, having
embarked on a process of restructuring the mining sector, will find it very costly to
reverse the restructuring and reform process given both domestic political pressures and
EU commitments to close mines to mitigate environmental damage.

                   Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1    Bank Performance

(a)    Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

61.     As discussed in section 2.1 above, the very comprehensive design of the project,
based on sound analytical work and previous experience, with hindsight proved overly
complex. This is particularly true for the SER component, with its 10 discrete activities.
The complexity also made the project very expensive to supervise. Furthermore, the
project did not have the vision to anticipate the impact and benefits of EU accession and
adjust its design accordingly. Specifically, the project might have better foreseen the EU
regional development initiatives and approach, as well as the imminent availability of
pre-accession and post-accession EU non-reimbursable funds, which could have largely
substituted for the loan financing for municipal infrastructure. This being said, the project
still contributed in setting a base for EU grant funds absorption via local capacity
building and the development of local socio-economic development programs, with
elements eligible for such financing. Many of the difficulties faced during
implementation could not have been anticipated. Nonetheless, given the difficulties
caused by this complexity, quality at entry is rated moderately satisfactory.

(b)    Bank Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

62.     The Bank team regularly supervised the project, building a strong rapport with its
counterparts. The TTLs ensured that appropriate expertise was mobilized to enable
effective supervision. Particularly noteworthy is the proactive and flexible approach
taken by the task team, working with the counterparts to make appropriate adjustments to
the project design during the course of implementation to address the problems that
emerged. The GOR has expressed concerns regarding the three changes of task team
leader, which in its opinion were not of the nature to support the consistency and
continuity required by the complexity of the project. This is a valid concern but could
hardly have been avoided as these changes were necessitated by the TTLs taking up new
positions within the Bank. Nonetheless, the Borrower appreciated the Bank’s
performance. Positive comments were made regarding Bank’s assistance with the
dissemination of information related to the project, prompt response to Borrower’s
technical requirements, as well as the successful transfer of knowledge from the Bank
team specialists to the PMU staff. In light of the above, quality of supervision is rated
satisfactory.




                                             21
(c)    Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

63.     Overall performance is considered satisfactory, because the flexibility shown
during supervision largely mitigated the complexity of the project, leading us to give
greater weight to the satisfactory rating for supervision than to the moderately
satisfactory rating for quality at entry.

5.2    Borrower Performance

(a)    Government Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

64.    Preparation: As discussed in Section 2.1, at project preparation, the Government
had demonstrated its commitment to the project. The Government’s performance during
preparation is thus rated Satisfactory.

65.     Implementation: During implementation, the Government’s commitment
fluctuated with changes in administration and leadership in the ministries. Further, the
diversity of Government counterparts across different agencies presented challenges and
a number of issues delayed the implementation of the project, triggering the need to
extend the project several times beyond the original end date.

66.      The project was initially delayed because the payment of the front end fee was
held up until December 21, 2005, and the Comfort Letter with the Commercial Bank of
Romania for the opening of the Special Accounts was signed only on March 9, 2006.
There were additional delays due to elaborate and complicated procedures, notably in: the
ratification of the loan agreement, the signing of the Subsidiary Loan Agreement, the
preparation and approval of a series of Operational Manuals, the consolidation of debt
management coupled with weaknesses in budget management, and the signing of
Government decisions. Indeed, the first disbursement payment from the loan proceeds
took place in May 2006, 14 months after the loan was signed. All these factors delayed
project implementation and the effects of the delays were felt well into 2009.

67.     Inadequate funding from GOR was among the primary reasons for delay. This at
times placed both PMUs’ budget allocations below the project’s needs and initial requests.
For example, the allocation received at mid-year rectification in 2011 was a total of US$9
million, much less than the US$29.6 million requested. This adversely affected the ability
to launch or finalize key municipal infrastructure and mine closure works in the years
2010 and 2011, especially construction works at the more complex mine closure sites.
The amounts approved for 2010 represented only a fraction of the project’s needs. As a
result, the PMUs could make only partial payments on contracts and had to delay the
signing of new contracts.

68.    The delays in the first quarter of 2012 that were caused by the extended time for
authorization of the Government Declaration approving the November, 2011

                                           22
restructuring created further suspensions and disbursement complexes. At the time of
preparing the request for project budgeting in 2012, the PIU assumed a timeframe
scenario of an 18 month extension and the budget request to MoPF included an additional
round of SDSMC and SGS micro-projects. The combination of loss of implementation
time awaiting Government approval and a shorter project extension that projected
resulted in a considerable unused balance in the loan account at project closing.

69.      Furthermore, the institutional weakness (lack of vision, lack of strong leadership,
internal disputes, and vocal syndical representation) of AZM, the agency assigned
responsibility of most of the SER component, ended up significantly delaying the startup
of this component.

70.     It should be noted that the Government is not homogeneous and some parts of the
administration, notably within the Ministry of Public Finance, were consistent and strong
supporters of the project, inter alia repeatedly intervening to try to remedy the problems
cited above.

In light of the above factors, Government performance during implementation is rated
moderately unsatisfactory.

Overall government performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory.

(b)    Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

71.     During the life of the project, both PMUs had received recognition of their strong
capacity in project implementation, especially the PMU of the mine closure component.
PMU-SER developed its capacity as the project progressed, even though the Project
Director changed four times and despite significant institutional weakness of the PMU’s
parent agency, AZM (lack of vision, lack of strong leadership, internal disputes, and
vocal syndical representation). Notwithstanding the drastic salary cuts mid-stream, PMU-
SER financial staff made extra efforts to solve some of the most pressing issues, e.g.,
taking care of pending payments. The same is true of the Romanian Social Development
Fund (RSDF), which was selected to implement the SDSMC sub-component due to the
strength of its experience in community-driven development, dating back to 1998.

72.     Financial Management: Overall, the FM performance of the implementing
agencies was satisfactory throughout the project life. The FM rating of the project was
downgraded to moderately satisfactory for about nine months following the significant
FM staff departures and turnover, as a consequence of the 25% salary cut throughout the
entire Romanian public sector in July, 2010. It was, however, upgraded again to a
satisfactory rating in early 2011. The quarterly (unaudited) interim financial monitoring
reports were received on time and all the interim financial reports were found acceptable
by the Bank.



                                            23
73.     Procurement: To the best of our knowledge (as determined through on-going
supervision), procurement of all works, goods and technical services under the project
followed the Bank’s Procurement Guidelines 18 . The Mine Closure PMU had strong
procurement capacity as continuity was maintained in both staffing and leadership from
the previous project and over the course of MCESER project implementation. Capacity in
the PMU-SER was lower since it did not benefit from such continuity. Nonetheless,
through the commitment of its staff and intensive support from the Bank supervision
team, the PMU-SER succeeded in procuring a large number of works and other contracts
without significant problems.

(c)     Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

In light of the Government and PMUs performance as discussed above, the overall
performance of the Borrower was moderately satisfactory.

                                          Lessons Learned

74.     Lesson 1: It is important to consult and involve the community in the mine
closure process. Before and during the mine closure process, meetings were held
regularly with the neighboring communities both to keep them informed and to solicit
feedback and inputs. Particularly significant is the fact that the project was able to take
advantage of the closure works to include a number of community infrastructure
improvements. While in many cases such infrastructure improvement focused on
repairing damage done during the mining operations – such as repairing roads and
bridges and making land usable for other productive or recreational purposes – in other
cases such additional works simply addressed community needs unrelated to the mines.
This engagement with the communities ensured their approval and support, created a
strong sense of ownership, and significantly contributed to improving their living
conditions.

75.     Lesson 2: Support socio-economic regeneration schemes that actively engage
the community as a whole and help bring people together. The success of socio-
economic regeneration beyond the life of the project depends to a great extent on the
local communities’ involvement and endorsement. Socio–economic regeneration
schemes that induce a sense of ownership within the community should be a top priority.
The Small Grant Schemes constitute good examples. Facilities for elderly people,
equipment for children playgrounds, rehabilitation of buildings for social purposes, etc.
were particularly appreciated and, consequently, are well implemented and benefit from
significant beneficiary contributions (both financial and in kind).



18
   However, as noted in para. 40 above, the Court of Accounts has alleged some misuse of administrative
procedures with respect to procurement.


                                                   24
76.      Lesson 3: Bureaucratic procedures that are functioning reasonably well should
not be changed in the middle of project implementation. Implementation of the MCESER
project began with a traditional process of disbursement through a special account and with
traditional project management units, with staff paid wages commensurate with their
expertise. The Government had very good reasons to move to a system whereby
disbursements would be made through the budget and where PMU salaries would be in line
with civil service salaries. In and of themselves these decisions cannot be faulted. But
applying them in the middle of project implementation had a severe impact on project
performance that could have been avoided had the project been considered “grandfathered?.
It would have been preferable to apply these measures to new projects and activities and not
to those on-going.

77.     Lesson 4: Delegate and empower field supervision to ensure a consistent level
of quality throughout the implementation phases. Field visits by the Bank team
confirmed that ensuring consistent levels of quality depended on proactive supervision by
site supervisors and the PMU engineers. Therefore, the Bank team concluded that PMUs
should further empower the consultant engineers by delegating to them the responsibility
to proactively solve technical (engineering) issues on the site as they emerged, through
discussions with contractors, site supervisors, designers, and beneficiaries (mayors and
communities), as needed. Delegating responsibility to local stakeholders is likely to
guarantee a consistent level of quality at all implementation phases. Regular supervision
and monitoring of works is a must to ensure that issues are addressed promptly, contract
amendments are executed if deemed appropriate, and construction is completed on time
or with limited delay.

78.     Lesson 5: Mine closure project duration should take into consideration the
complexity of the types of included mines. Closing hard rock mines (metals) is more
complex than closing coal and some other types of mines. Hard rock mines (a) typically
occur in more complex hydrogeological settings; (b) commonly have significant water
management issues; and (c) water resources are quite vulnerable to contamination by
heavy metals and acid. Permanent closure of hard rock mines, including environmental
protection measures, typically requires 5 to 10 years to complete and, if water treatment
is necessary, perpetual operation and maintenance of treatment facilities may be
necessary19.

performance should be rated satisfactory, which would result in an Overall Borrower

                             Annex 2: Outputs by Component

     I. Mine Closure and Environmental Regeneration Component.

1.       The principal results of the mine closure component were the following:

        Environmentally sound closure of 17 mines, thereby creating some 400 ha.
         of reclaimed land, available for new business and other activities in the
         mining communities.
        Rehabilitation of 9 preparation plants, including several situated in the centers of
         mining towns, thereby creating a healthy and safe environment for their
         inhabitants.
        Reclamation of 8 tailing dams, significantly reducing the potential risk of dam
         failure with potentially catastrophic environmental and social impacts.
        Transfer of technical know-how to some 650 individuals, thereby creating a
         cadre of professionals fully capable of carrying forward mine closure activities
         in the country.
        Development of a full legislative framework governing mine closure activity to
         promote efficiency and safety.

2.     The quality of mine closure activities carried out under this component is
consistent with international good practice. For example, the work at the mine closure site
in Bodos, including the backfilling of the open pit, cutting back of the high wall, and the
re-contouring of the waste dumps for use in agriculture are examples of international
technical best practice. Equally noteworthy were the efforts that went into redesigning the
closure plan to provide flood protection to the community. As a result, instead of an
unusable and dangerous former mine site, the community received new agricultural land
and a lake, to be stocked with fish, serving both the recreational needs of the community
and as a buffer to protect the community from flooding. In addition, the project rebuilt the
community’s main road (which had been damaged by mining trucks) and stabilized stream
banks to mitigate erosion, both actions of considerable importance to the community.

3.      This project component provided a model of good consultation with the local
community to ensure that the resulting closure plans at all sites were well designed to
address long term community needs. It built on experience in OECD countries that
demonstrated the importance of community consultation for facilitating effective mine
closure. This motivated the PMU to develop the community consultation manual as part of
its capacity transfer to CONVERSMIN for application in the closure of the remaining
targeted mines in Romania in a manner consistent with environmentally and socially
sound procedures.

     II. Socio-economic Regeneration Component.

4.     The principal results of the socio-economic regeneration component were the
following:

                                              28
        The Employment and Training Incentives Scheme (ETIS). A total of 6,692
         jobs were created. This fell short of the target of 8,000 jobs because the sub-
         component was discontinued earlier than scheduled 20 . Around 70% of the
         beneficiaries thought the scheme was important for their families and over 50% of
         employers thought the scheme helped them increase their business by subsidizing
         their employees. Entrepreneurs reported that the scheme was essential in
         overcoming the difficulties of entering the new market economy and was also a
         motivating factor in running their businesses legally.

        Workspace Centers Management and Enterprise Support (WSC). This sub-
         component provided consultancy, advice and/or training services to 4,991
         beneficiaries, thereby surpassing the target of 4,000. The total number of
         businesses incubated in the 10 workspace centers over the project duration was
         213 as compared to the target value of 200. A survey of 65 beneficiaries revealed
         that 52% of respondents felt that the services they received exceed their
         expectations. WSC helped them solve a specific problem (12%), led to a solution
         (48%), or directed them to an institution which could help (15%). The survey
         participants attended 105 specific courses offered by the WSC; 17% said they
         benefited to a very great extent and 51% to a great extent from these courses.

        Social Development Scheme for Mining Communities (SDSMC). Under
         SDSMC, 250 projects were approved of which 245 were implemented (compared
         to the original target of 250 and a revised target of 160 implemented projects).
         Some 89% of the community members declared that SDSMC sub-projects
         reflected community priorities, which exceeds the target value of 60%. The same
         holds true for the SDSMC beneficiary satisfaction (69% were satisfied with
         SDSMC compared to 60% target value).

        Municipal Infrastructure (MI). A total of 49 sub-projects were completed as
         compared to the initial target of 30. The initial budget allocation for the MI
         scheme was USD 17 million, but after the mid-term review this was increased to
         USD 18.1 million, which means that the cost per project was substantially lower
         than originally envisaged. A large share of MI subprojects concerned road
         rehabilitation (including asphalting), with an average cost of Euro 118.322 per


20
   At the mid-term review, following an evaluation of the first phase of ETIS, the Bank’s task team and the
PMU-SER agreed to significant changes in the sub-component, including stronger targeting. However, no
further calls for applications were launched, partly because there was little demand in the targeted areas and
partly because of the shortage of funds released by MoF.


                                                     29
    Km. Although the comparator is not available to the Bank, the PMU-SER asserts
    that this is lower than the costs of other roads rehabilitation programs in Romania.
    Feedback from local authorities and communities indicates that the support of
    AZM specialists and community capacity-building consultants in the context of
    the MI sub-component significantly increased local capacity to participate in other
    programs including, notably, those under EU funding. The MI program thus
    contributed to creating an institutional framework for more participatory
    approaches to development in participating municipalities. The program also
    increased the quality of life through increased property values, improved road
    access, and better utilities.

   Small Grants Scheme (SGS). The target value for the number of implemented
    micro-projects under SGS was 350. However, 568 micro-projects were approved
    out of which 564 were completed by the end of 2011. Moreover, 87% of localities
    that applied for SGS micro-projects received funding compared to the 80% target.
    During the implementation of the project, 160 communities were assisted through
    the Small Grants Scheme, with their combined populations totaling over 1 million
    inhabitants. Through this scheme communities developed such facilities as parks,
    playgrounds, kindergartens, and community centers. In addition to providing such
    facilities, the PMU-SER’s end of project evaluation concluded that the scheme
    was successful in strengthening social cohesion and social capital through
    establishment of informal groups and non-profit organizations involved in
    community development activities. The initial budget allocation for the scheme
    was of USD 3.1 million, which was increased to 5 USD million after the Mid-
    Term review.

   Community Capacity Building (CCB). The total number of localities assisted
    under the CCB program was 187 compared to the target value of 150, a 24.7%
    increase over the initial target despite a reduction in the budget allocated to this
    measure from USD 0.9 million to USD 0.5 million. Also, 62% of communities
    assisted under this scheme in the operating area are funding their priorities by
    accessing national and European Union funds, as compared to the target value of
    60%. Moreover, surveys administrated by PMU-SER showed that only 8.5% of
    the respondents from both the CCB and MI programs targeted communities
    mentioned a lack of interest as a reason for non-participation, compared with 23%
    of respondents from the control group. As per “The End of Project Evaluation
    Report? of PMU-SER, the CCB was instrumental in educating communities on
    how to approach future investments beyond SDMSC, SGS and MI programs. The
    scheme helped build social capital and became an integral part of the social and
    economic development of the communities assisted.

                      Annex 3: Economic and Financial Analysis
                        (including assumptions in the analysis)


1.      The economic and financial analysis in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD)
focused exclusively on the Socio-economic Regeneration (SER) component. With respect
to the Mine Closure and Environmental Regeneration Component it simply stated that
“competitive bidding process and time bound completion schedules will help ensure that
mines are closed in a least cost basis?. Comparative costs of mine closure in Romania are
not available (this is considered to be confidential information). However, the fact that all
the closures ended up costing significantly less than the estimated costs, which thereby
made it possible to cancel part of the loan for the project, suggests that this expectation
was met. Furthermore, the Mine Closure PMU estimated that mine closure under the
project was about 16 percent cheaper. The analysis with respect to the SER component
looks at socio-economic regeneration schemes.

Socio–Economic Regeneration Schemes

2.      The social and economic regeneration component of the projects consisted of
several sub-components (ETIS, WSCMES, MI, CCB and SGS) designed for the social
and economic rehabilitation of the mining regions in Romania. Some of the sub-
components (ETIS, WSCMES, and the Micro-Credit Scheme) are natural candidates for
cost-benefit analysis based on observable job-generation and, as such, formed the basis
for the analysis in the PAD. Since the Micro-Credit Scheme was not implemented due to
disagreements over the implementation approaches, this analysis now will include only
the ETIS and WSCMES. The PAD analysis, based on the three components, came up
with an internal rate of return (IRR) of 39%. The after the fact analysis, based on the two
components, gives us an IRR of 75% as shown in Table 1 below. More detailed analysis
of the two schemes follows.

3.      Table 1 assumes an incidence rate of 60%. That is, in the absence of the project,
40% of the benefits (i.e. avoided economic losses and income from job generated) would
have been realized through the local economy. Given this assumption, the net benefits of
the project are calculated as the difference between the benefits with the project (i.e. this
is equivalent to a 100% incidence rate) and the benefits realized in the absence of the
project. The assumptions regarding the jobs generated under the project are described
below the table. The sensitivity analysis, including different incidence scenarios (i.e. 0%,
20%, 40%, 60%, and 80%), as well as, different discount rates (i.e. 7%, 12%, 15%), is

Employment and Training Incentives Scheme (ETIS)

4.      ETIS was designed to help facilitate the access of unemployed miners (and later
their families and any other unemployed person from mining regions) to jobs by
providing the employers with a one year subsidy. The ETIS support for employers hiring
laid off miners was contingent on employers paying their taxes and on the promise of
providing on-job training to their new employees. The initial job generation target level
was of 8,000 jobs with a survival rate of 40% after one year. At the end the project, based
on AZM reports, ETIS managed to create 6,692 jobs (16.35% fewer jobs than the initial
target value). However the job survival rate after one year was 60% as compared to the
expected 40%.

5.      The cost of the scheme is represented by the scheme expense while the benefits
will consist of the jobs generated. Estimating the benefits for this type of interventions is
often very involving in terms of data requirement and the estimation design. For example,
in the absence of ETIS jobs a portion of the unemployed would have found jobs anyway.
To disentangle the actual impact of a job generating scheme, a contra-factual to the
treatment group is needed. The contra-factual is a sample of individuals, or any other unit
of aggregation, called the control group, which is not exposed to the treatment. In this
case the treatment would be getting a job through ETIS. The main assumption is that the
only difference between individuals in the control group and individuals in treatment
group is their exposure to the treatment. To enforce this assumption, the treatment has to
be randomly assigned. However, in many cases, this is not possible. ETIS job
opportunities cannot be randomly assign to people in the mining regions for obvious
reasons. As such, non-ETIS workers do not represent a good counter-factual to ETIS
workers due to self-selection. That is, people who are more likely to be aware of the ETIS
and to take advantage of it are also often those who are active, better connected, more
confident, and better educated. In this case, a simple comparison between ETIS
beneficiaries and non-ETIS workers has little merit.

6.      Even in the absence of randomization of the treatment, one can create counter-
factual using available econometrics techniques. One such method is the propensity score
matching, which strives to provide unbiased estimation of treatment effects by grouping

                                                33
observations in treatment and control groups based on observable characteristics. While
useful, the propensity score matching data requirement is heavy and increases with the
number of observable characteristics that one needs to control for. Many times, the data
requirements make the score matching infeasible.

7.      Aware of these drawbacks, due to data constraints, and in order to facilitate the
ETIS benefits estimation, a number of assumptions will be made. The value of the jobs
generated by ETIS needs to be determined and it is assumed to equal the wages received.
This is a simplification since the wage is a biased estimator of the value of a job and
ignores a number of intangible benefits (i.e., pride, financial security, avoidance of social
stigma associated with unemployment, jobs searching costs, others). Although the wage
rate is an imperfect indicator of the job value, it is the only data available. In order to
provide conservative estimators of the benefits, it was assumed the wage received for
ETIS jobs is closed to Romanian minimum wage. This is assumption is supported by
AZM. Table 2 shows the estimates of the ETIS job generation benefits.

8.      Table 2b shows ETIS benefits under different program incidence scenarios. For
example, a 20% incidence rate says that in the absence of the project 80% of the jobs
created under ETIS would have been created anyway by the local economy. Then only
20% of the ETIS benefits calculated under 100% incidence of the project scenario (see
Table 2a) would be generated by the scheme. As such, under 20% incidence scenario, the
ETIS NPV would -0.81million USD, which would mean that the scheme is inefficient
since its costs are greater than the discounted value of the benefits generated by the
scheme. A similar interpretation follows for the other incidence scenarios. Note that at all
other incidence rates the NPV is positive.

9.      The direct costs of ETIS scheme were provided by AZM. To estimate the number
of jobs created under ETIS that continue to exit at the end of the program, we used the
survival rate of 60% provided by the SER performance indicators reports. For example,
in 2006 according to AZM’s 4th Quarterly Progress Report, there were 6,135 jobs. For
2007, the number of jobs is calculated as the product of the survival rate of 60% and the
number of jobs in 2006. An additional number of 557 jobs were added to this number for
2007, as indicated by the End of the Project Evaluation Report for SER performance
indicators. Finally, the number of jobs for 2008 is calculated as the product of the
survival rate and number of jobs in 2007. The number of jobs in the following years was
estimated in a similar fashion. For simplicity the survival rate was kept constant. The
income generated is calculated as the product between the number of jobs and the
minimal national wage. The unemployment savings are calculated as 75% times the
minimal wage times the number of jobs. The percentage was taken from the Appraisal
document and is based on the Law 76/2002.

Workspace Centers Management and Enterprise Support (WSCMES)

10.     WSCMES was designed to facilitate the access of start-up businesses from
mining regions to additional support through the provision of space to conduct activities
and business consultancy services within the center. The approach was to support the
businesses development which in return should generate jobs for the unemployed in the
mining regions among other benefits. The estimation of the impact of WSCMES on the
number of jobs generated by the incubated business is an involving exercise in terms of
both data requirements and econometric design. For example, some of the jobs created by
business incubated by WSCMES would have been created in the absence of the scheme.
To account for this possibility while providing conservative estimates, the unemployment
savings (see ETIS) were not considered benefits for this scheme. Table 3a shows the
estimated benefits accrued by the implementation of WSCMES. The data was compiled
from AZM’s Quarterly Progress Reports and the actual estimation approach is similar to
that used for the ETIS calculations.

11.      Table 3b shows WSCMES estimates under different incidence scenarios. Similar
to ETIS scheme, a 20% incidence rate says that in the absence of the project 80% of the
benefits accrued under this WSCMES would have been created by the local economy.
The interpretation for other incidence levels is equivalent. Under 20% and 40% incidence
levels the NPV of this scheme would be negative, which would indicate that the scheme
is inefficient since its costs are greater than the discounted value of the benefits generated
by the scheme. For the remaining incidence levels, the NPV is positive.

  Analysis Limitations

  12.     This analysis provides a cost–benefit evaluation of Environmental and Socio-
  Economic Regeneration Project. The estimates, NPV or IRR, are readily available to
  evaluate the benefits of the project in a simple to use framework. However, given the
  specific nature of the project, a number of benefits and costs were difficult to evaluate.
  For example, the value of avoiding the social stigma associated with unemployed due to
  jobs created under ETIS. Also, due to data constraints a number of assumptions were
  needed in order to facilitate the estimation (i.e., yearly distribution of the mine closure
  costs).

  13.     The mine closure and environmental regeneration component of the project was
  not included in the current analysis due to the lack of data needed to conducted such an
  analysis. Mine specific data (e.g. mine operating losses) for mines closed under the
  project was not available. Neither was data available for mine closed outside the project,
  but during the lifetime of the project. We tried to conduct an analysis with some old mine
  data (i.e. 2002 cross sectional data for a few mine companies) provided by the Mine

                                                   37
Closure PMU. However, we concluded that this data was not reliable, since our NPV
estimates were too high to be believable (i.e. maybe because mine closure costs showed
in that data were sometimes less than 1% of the benefits of closing the actual mines). The
data requirements needed for evaluating the future environmental benefits associated with
closing the mine in an environmental sustainable way are even greater.

14.     The current analysis, as shown in Table 1, mirrors the analysis in PAD. However,
both analyses have more in common with a financial assessment rather than a cost and
benefit analysis given that they consider items such as unemployment savings and other
internal transfers. For the purpose of this analysis, data availability was the major hurdle.

15.    To further the analysis, one could investigate the impact of the project sub-
components under a treatment–control approach. The main requisite for such an endeavor
would be a richer panel data set.

                         Annex 5: Beneficiary Survey Results


ETIS

1.      ETIS was designed to help unemployed people, from the mining regions, find a
place in the labor market by stimulating the creation of new jobs and providing suitable
training for those jobs.

2.      Under ETIS, a beneficiary survey was administrated in 2008 covering 298 ETIS
employees and 120 non-ETIS employees, followed by another survey in 2011 covering
61 ETIS employees and 37 non-ETIS employees. The purpose of the surveys was to elicit
changes in employment status, perceptions of employment perspectives, scheme impact
on their employment status, and levels of self-confidence. In addition, 10 in-depth
interviews were conducted with companies that were beneficiaries of the ETIS program.

3.      The survey’s results show that:

     1. Around 70% of the beneficiaries thought the scheme was important for their
        families.
     2. Over 50% of employers thought the scheme helped them increase their business
        by subsidizing their employees. To most entrepreneurs, the scheme was essential
        in overcoming the difficulties of the market economies and it was also a
        motivating factor in running their businesses legally.
     3. Almost 60% of people newly employed under ETIS had previously been
        unemployed for 12 months or more.
     4. There is some evidence that the self-confidence of those hired under ETIS is to
        some extent improving and that their lives are improving.
     5. Overall it was reported that, to most entrepreneurs, the scheme had been like a
        ‘breath of fresh air’, a support in overcoming the difficulties of the market
        economy and also a motivating factor in running their businesses legally.

WSC

4.     The Workspace Centers (WSC) subcomponent was designed to support business
incubation by providing workspace centers and consultancy services to start-up
companies in mining regions.

5.      During the implementation of the MCESER project, a number of surveys and
interviews were administrated under WSC as follows: 10 in-depth interviews with
WSC’s representatives, 10 in-depth interviews with non-incubated firms, 10
questionnaire-based interviews with incubated firms` managers (one from each WSC), 65
questionnaire-based interviews with beneficiaries of consultancy support, and 60
questionnaire-based interviews with beneficiaries of training.




                                           41
6.      The survey of 65 beneficiaries revealed that 52% of respondents felt that the
services they received exceed their expectations. Specifically, WSC helped them solved a
specific problem (12%), led to a solution (48%), or directed them to an institution which
could help (15%). The survey participants had attended 105 specific courses offered by
the WSC. 17% said they benefited to a very great extent and 51% to a great extent from
these seminaries.

SGS

7.     SGS was designed to improve the welfare of disadvantaged groups (i.e., women,
youth, and elderly) in the mining regions, and induce social capital growth in mining
regions.

8.     Under this scheme three focus-groups discussions were conducted in localities
where the program operated. One focus-group discussion was conducted with women
with children in Rodna (Bistrita-Nasaud County), another one was conducted with young
people in Aninoasa (Hunedoara county), and one with elderly people in Salciua (Alba
county).

9.      Additionally, 6 in-depth interviews were conducted with LPA’s representative
from 6 beneficiary localities and 5 in-depth interviews were carried out with LPA’s
representatives from 5 localities that have not applied for the scheme. The six beneficiary
localities were: Aninoasa (Hunedoara county), Salciua (Alba county), Rodna (Bistrita-
Nasaud county), Comanesti (Bacau county), Darmanesti (Bacau County) and Saru Dornei
(Suceava county), while the five non beneficiary localities were: Sargeoz-Bai (Bistrita-
Nasaud county), Moinesti (Bacau county), Metes (Alba county), Panaci (Suceava county)
and Pui (Hunedoara county).

10.    Both the citizens and LPA’s representatives stated that nothing would have been
achieved, or far less, if the scheme had not existed.

Community Capacity Building (CCB) and Municipal Infrastructure (MI)

11.      Community Capacity Building was designed to encourage social dialog and to
facilitate the community involvement in the process of socio-economic regeneration in
the mining regions. The Municipal Infrastructure sub-component was designed to help
improve public utilities in mining regions by supporting community involvement in the
process of identification and selection of projects as well as assuring the sustainability of
the rehabilitated infrastructure.

12.    During the implementation of the project, 20 in-depth interviews with Local
Public Authority (LPA) representatives were conducted under CCB and MI as follows:
(1) 15 LPA representatives from beneficiary localities (both of CCB subcomponent and
MI program) and 5 LPA representatives from non-beneficiary localities. The interviews
with LPA representatives from the 15 beneficiary localities were conducted in Nucet (BH
county), Rodna (BN county), Motru (GJ county), Borsa (MM county), Chiesd (Salaj

                                             42
county), Balan (HG county), Iablanita (CS county), Iara (CJ county), Petrila (HD county),
Baia De Aries (AB county), Bobota (Salaj county), Baia Sprie (MM county), Sarmaşag
(SJ county), Albeni (GJ county) and Tautii Magherus (MM county). The five non
beneficiary counties were Vacau (BH county), Maieru (BN county), Viseul De Sus (MM
county), Balan (Sj county) and Sandominic (GH county).
 
13.     Regarding the level of information/knowledge regarding RASDIA programs and
investment, 36% of the respondents from localities exposed both to the CCB and MI
programs answered positively, compared with 27% from respondents coming from
localities exposed only to the CCB program. Also, only 8.5% of the respondents from
both the CCB and MI programs targeted communities mentioned a lack of interest as the
reason for non-participation, compared with 23% of respondents from the control group.

        Mine Closure, Environmental and Socio –Economic Regeneration Project
                                  (MCESERP)22

      I. Mine Closure Component

Assessment of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Performance Indicators
The performance indicators set forth for this part are as follows:
• Subsidies’ monitoring system, which indicates the decline of subsidies in view of
complying with the deadline set forth by the EU;
• Strict budget limitations imposed on mining companies aiming at preventing the
collection of additional debts in paying taxes to the central and local budgets and of
electricity fees;
• Number of mines and mining enterprises closed in an ecological manner;
• The land area rehabilitated and transferred by the mining companies to other players.

Assessment of Performances in Project Implementation; Lessons Learnt from
Implementation

Legislation
For the good performance of the mines closure activity and the environment regeneration,
the following were developed:

       - 3 Government Decisions
       - 18 Ministerial Orders
       - 1 organic law

1.     We underline that the advanced legislation makes reference to the implementation
of new technologies for the performance of works, the inclusion of new professions in the
closing activities circuit (e.g., public facilitator, etc.). Also, regulations concerning the
monitoring of environmental parameters before, during and after the performance of
closing works were developed.

2.     At present, the harmonization of the laws on mine closure with both the related
national laws and the European legislation in the field has become a priority in Romania.
Also, new regulations on the progress of activities have been developed.




22
     The content of this Annex is taken verbatim from the Borrower’s ICR.


                                                    44
3.      Norms and regulations on extracting activities and the closure and ecological
rehabilitation of mines, also considering the actions related to the enhancement of the
legislative and procedural framework, such as:


       - Updated Mine closure manual, approved by Order 273/2001 of the Ministry of
       Industry and Resources, which regulates the manner of progress of whole
       activities with the technical procedures set forth under the 14 annexes;
       - the Mine closure manual for uranium mines, advanced through Ministry of
       Economy and Commerce (MEC) Order no. 1523/2007;
       - the Mine closure manual for salt mines, advanced through Ministry of Economy
       and Commerce Order no. 1524/2007;
       - the Guidebook on the Development of the Environment Monitoring Programmes
       following the approval of the Plan for the Closure of the Mining Activity,
       advanced under MEC order no. 1525/2007;
       - the Manual on the Environment Procedures and the Implementation of an
       Environmental Management System in the Mining Sector, advanced under MEC
       order no. 1526/2007;
       - the Guidebook of the Public Facilitator for mine closure in Romania;
       - the Annex to the Mine Closure Manual concerning the methodology for the
       closure of preparation sites;
       - the Annex to Mine Closure Manual concerning the technical measures necessary
       for the time interval between the closing of the underground and of the surface
       area;
       - the Annex to the Mine Closure Manual on the manner of handing over/taking
       over of tailing dams;
       - Technical norms on the closure of underground works for special cases, etc.

Transfer of Know-How

4.      One of the major goals resulting from the progress of the project managed by the
PMU is that related to the know-how and experience transfer. In this view, the
performance of professional development training courses in the activities of design and
verification of plans for the closure of mining sites and of technical projects for the
performance of works for the mine closure and the ecological rehabilitation of areas
affected by mining activities, of specialists in the technical assistance activity – site
management, as well as of specialists in the works performance activity, at the Busteni
Industry Staff Training Center. These training courses are run by PMU specialists,
namely specialists acknowledged in various related fields.

5.     As a result of training with certification, the courses have been completed and 650
people have acquired certification so far for one of the three categories: design,
engineering and performance of works.

6.     In the same train of thoughts, training and know-how transfer meetings were
organized with help from the following companies:

                                           45
 - technical and environmental audit companies (Wardell Armstrong from the UK,
MonTech and Wisutech from Germany);
 - facilitators in the relation with the local communities (Atkins from the UK, the
Romania office, Plejades from Germany and SPAN from the Netherlands), which
developed the studies and monitoring procedures of environmental parameters as part of
the mining sites from Călimani, Suceava County and Baia de Arieş, Alba County
(BRGM France and Atkins from the UK, Romania office).

7.      During the next period, further training sessions are scheduled with specialists in
design, management, execution, from CONVERSMIN and line directorates from the
Ministry of Economy, Commerce and Business Environment and of other ministries
interested and involved in the mine closure activities, respectively.

Consultation of the Community

8.      The wide range of activities concerning the closure and the ecological
rehabilitation of a mining site is part of a line of very complex procedures and processes.
Among them, one of the most important ones is related to the ongoing review of land
requirements and the manner of adapting solutions of technical projects to them, as well
as adapting solutions to be applied to the requests and needs of local communities
impacted by mining activities. The ongoing contact with the local communities and with
the institutions of the local governments is made through the employees of the Ministry
of Economy, Commerce and Business Environment (MECBE) (Project Management
Unit (PMU) and CONVERSMIN), as well as through the designer engineers of closure
works. In order to enhance such contact and to address the occurred issues as effectively
as possible, the representatives of management companies and the designer engineer and
entrepreneur of the site show to the beneficiary all execution amendments occurring
during the performance of works; such amendments are also reviewed in terms of the
economic influence they exert on projects and of whether they comply with the technical,
social criteria and the criteria related to the amounts of necessary expenditures, they are
approved within the Technical-Economic Council (TEC) of the MECBE – General
Directorate for Mineral Resources (GDMR) and applied.

9.       Under the same considerations, starting 2007, with the enforcement in 2008,
within the PMU a new technical team of public facilitators in the relations with the
institutions, local governments and communities, was established, as per the provisions of
the new communities laws on the management of hazardous waste in the mining industry
and of the specific legislation advanced in this view after our country’s accession to the
EU.

10.     Public information, consultation and facilitation play a different role in the phases
characteristic of mines closure and environmental rehabilitation activities. Since the
public meetings (meetings with the community) do not distinguish between these phases,
it is advisable for public facilitation to be addressed as part of a coherent plan which
should be developed before starting the project and updated as applicable.



                                             46
11.     By applying the procedures for the consultation of local government institutions
and of local communities members, respectively, in correlation with the concrete on the
spot conditions as well as with the provisions of technical-economic documentations and
of legal endorsements and agreements, under the coordination of the PMU, amendments
and adaptations of projects depending on the outcomes of such actions were made. Such
works were basically performed on all sites comprised in the Mine Closure,
Environmental and Socio-Economic Regeneration Project.


Status of Funds Available and Disbursement

12.    Starting the loan was difficult to the extreme. By 2008, the project had benefitted
from budget allocations corresponding to the funding needs, which led to an accelerated
works contracting and performance pace. In this period, the main challenge was
represented by the lack of documentations originally considered for application. Starting
2009, the funds allocated to the Project were decreased compared to the amounts
necessary according to the approved Procurement Plans.

13.       The lack of funding led directly to the following situations:

      -   the contracting of works for all the sites in line for closure and environmental
          regeneration could no longer be contracted, as originally planned;
      -   the performance pace of works in progress had to be slowed down and even
          temporarily interrupted;
      -   during 2011, we had to abandon a project in progress to ensure the necessary
          funds for funding activities in other objectives with high hazard level.

14.       The status of funds used, is as follows:

      -   Civil works - initial allocation USD 69.1 mil. - closure and environmental
          regeneration of 20 mines and/or mine processing facilities. Disbursement to date
          USD 42.56 mil. (62% from initial allocation) - thus managing to close 17 mines
          and/or mine processing facilities (85% of the key performance indicators);
      -   Consultancy – allocation USD 3.2 mil.; disbursement to date USD 2.64 mil.
          (82%);
      -   Incremental operating costs – allocation USD 1.7 mil.; disbursement to date USD
          1.46 mil. (86%);

15.   As a result, out of the USD 60.09 mil initially allocated from loan to closure
component, in 2011 USD 21.03 million was cancelled.




                                               47
Evaluation of the performance of the World Bank and other partners.

The World Bank

16.    The project benefited from the close supervision of the Bank’s team which
provided a very important assistance for:

     - elaboration of the legislation necessary for the mine closure activities;
      -development of the bidding documents, terms of references, environmental
 management plans, etc;
      -dissemination of information related to the project, through participation of Bank’
 representatives to different workshops;
       - prompt responses to our technical requirements or assistance regarding WB’s
 procedures.
       - a successful transfer of knowledge from the WB team specialists to the PMU
 members regarding closure techniques, water management, etc, as well as procurement
 procedures.

Other Romanian entities

17.     In general, the majority of the implicated Romanian entities responded very well
to our requests regarding the elaboration of different norms and regulations, Ministry of
Environment, Ministry of Economy, Commerce and Business Environment, local
administrations and different other bodies. In the last three years we experienced
difficulties regarding the funds allocated taking into consideration the budget constrained
agreed with IFIs after 2008, this being one of the reason for the delays in the
implementation of the project. In this moment, we have the necessary funds for the
activities scheduled this year.

Outcomes

18.       The mine closure component has the following main outcomes:

      -   The successful closure of 17 mines, 9 preparation plants and the putting into
          safety and reclamation of 8 tailing dams. Practically in doing this, we created
          more than 400 ha of reclaimed land, free for new business and other activities in
          the mining communities, where the lack of such new available surfaces is acute.
          The positive reaction of the communities is proved by the fact that a lot of new
          activities started on such areas using not only the new available land but also the
          buildings of the former mining site. The ministry and PMU, received positive
          reactions from both the local authorities and local businessmen for the new
          opportunities created after the implementation of the closure plans;
      -   By closing and environmentally rehabilitating the former preparation plants
          situated in the very center of the mining cities we created a healthy and safe
          environment for their inhabitants.
      -   Know-how transfer to 650 people;

                                              48
   -   The development of a full legislative framework which allows the mines’ closure
       activity to take place under full efficiency and safety conditions.

   Lessons Learned

   -   The system for the organization and performance of site activities as per the
       FIDIC norms, with understanding of and compliance with the responsibilities by
       the beneficiary, engineer and contractor;
   -   New technologies were implemented, as well as new approaches to solving
       environmental issues, in line with the Best Available Techniques (BATs), for
       putting into safety and the reclamation of tailing dams. These solutions are
       currently set forth and applied in Romania;
   -   The use for the first time of a detailed environment monitoring program in a site
       with several difficult environment issues, which allowed the timely tracking of
       issues and their resolution with significant savings and as per the environmental
       parameters;
   -   The use for the first time of public facilitators in designing, performing and
       monitoring closure works, which allowed local communities to take part all along
       the activity progress.


   II. Socio-Economic Regeneration Component

Assessment of the project’s objective, design, implementation, and operational
experience

Project objectives

19.     According to the World Bank project appraisal document (PAD), the overall
economic purpose of the socio-economic regeneration component of MCESERP was to
respond to poverty-related impacts by providing considerable support for job creation and
economic recovery in economically depressed mining communities through the various
sub-components of the Socio-economic Regeneration (SER) Component.                    The
development objective, as initially stated in the Schedule 2, page 16 of the Loan
Agreement (LOA), was “providing support to AZM, RSDF, mining communities and
local public authorities for socio-economic regeneration of the mining regions?23 This
objective has been redefined through the Amendment to the Loan Agreement concluded
in 2008 to read as follows: “providing support to mining communities and local public
authorities for socio-economic regeneration of the mining regions through central
entities?.




                                           49
Project design

20.     The socio-economic regeneration component was conceived to continue
providing support for job creation and employment in mining regions, while also
developing local capacity to cope with the adverse outcomes of the mining sector
restructuring and to generate economic relief through better use of local resources and
accessing domestic and international funding schemes.

21.     The project design contained corresponding measures/programs for each specific
objective.

22.    Support for job creation activities in mining regions, including:

(a) Employment and Training Incentives Scheme (ETIS)
(b) Micro-Credit Scheme (canceled through the 2008 Loan Amendment)
(c) Workspace Centers

23.     The mechanisms established in the project design for employment promotion in
the mining regions aimed at encouraging both employment by entrepreneurs of jobless
people from mining communities, especially through the Employment and Training
Incentives Scheme but to a certain extent also through the Workspace Centers program,
and self-employment, especially through the Workspace Centers program and its
enterprise support component, and through the Micro-credit Scheme. Additionally, the
Income Generating Activities measure under the Social Development Scheme for the
Mining Communities was also aimed at encouraging self-employment. Altogether, these
programs might have had a relevant contribution to supporting job creation activities in
the mining regions, although compared to the dimension of the employment problems
incurred by mine closures in mining communities the project proceeds allocated to them
were not expected to significantly improve the employment situation in mining regions,
but rather to encourage and support local initiatives for employment creation, including
through entrepreneurial activities. However, dropping the Microcredits Scheme has
significantly affected the potential of the programs/measures set forth under this objective
to achieve the intended outcomes.

24.    Support to AZM and the RSDF for community capacity building and local
development activities in the mining regions through:

(a) Social Development Schemes for the Mining Communities (SDSMC).
(b) Municipal Infrastructure.
(c) Small Grants Scheme (SGS).
(d) Community Capacity Building.

25.     With regard to community capacity building and support for local development
activities in the mining regions, the project design also included a mix of intervention
measures that were expected to interact. Under the Community Capacity Building
program the Project aimed at providing technical assistance and training to facilitate a

                                            50
process of community mobilization and dialogue among local stakeholders, to assist with
participatory strategic planning, including identification and selection of priority
infrastructure and social service sub/micro-projects to be financed under the Municipal
Infrastructure, Social Development Scheme for Mining Communities and Small Grants
Scheme programs.

26.   As a sub-component of the socio-economic regeneration program, SDSMC aimed
to support the local development processes in the mining communities, through
community capacity building and financing investments in community infrastructure,
income generating activities and community based social services.

27.     Integrating itself in the assembly of approaches of stimulating the socio-economic
regenerating process in the areas affected by the restructuring of the mining sector, the
SDSMC has mainly targeted developing the mining communities’ capacity to manage
their own problems, as a result of transferring responsibilities from the mining companies
to communities. The specific objectives of the SDSMC were aimed to : increasing the
social cohesion degree, improving the living standards, by performing some small
infrastructure works, improving life quality through environment preservation, creating
economic development opportunities and stimulating job creation, increasing access of
the disadvantaged groups to social services, increasing the organizational capacity of the
mining communities, local authorities and the NGOs, increasing self-confidence, together
with confidence in institutions and authorities involved in the mining communities.

28.     Although this objective has not been redefined through the 2008 Loan
Amendment in the light of the redefined PDO for SER, the programs designed to ensure
its achievement were actually aimed at supporting (through central entities, such as AZM
and RSDF) the mining communities and the local public authorities for socio-economic
regeneration of the mining regions. Hence, one may consider that the relevance of the
programs through which this objective was to be achieved has not been affected by this
Loan Amendment.

29.   Strengthening the institutional capacity of AZM, PMU-SER and RSDF to
implement the Project, through:

(a) Social Impact Monitoring and Evaluation.
(b) Public Information.
(c) Institutional Development and Training.

30.      The implementation of the programs mentioned under the objective 2 above was
envisaged in the project design to be underpinned by strengthening the institutional
capacity of AZM, PMU-SER and RSDF to implement the Project. From this perspective,
the measures/programs set forth in the project design in a view to strengthening the
institutional capacity of the implementing agencies have been relevant, although the
public information and the institutional development and training measures have lost
momentum after the 2008 Loan Amendment.



                                           51
31.     The project design has also included an Institutional Support Component (Part C),
which in the case of the socio-economic regeneration component was aimed to provide
“Support to AZM, PMU-SER and RSDF for implementation of Part B of the Project?.
The amendment to the Loan Agreement from 2008 has modified this provision to read as
follows: “2. Institutional support for implementation of Part B of the Project, consisting
of incremental operating costs for: i) AZM, PMU-SER; and ii) RSDF?. This was actually
a rephrasing to ensure consistency with the revised PDO.

32.     The overall design as described above would have ensured achievement of the
development objective of the socio-economic regeneration component, provided that
suitable allocation of resources would have been timely ensured. Moreover, in case the
Micro-credit Scheme would not have been dropped, but implemented in synergy with the
WSCMES and ETIS, the impact of SER in terms of strengthening the enabling
environment for socio-economic regeneration and inducing community action for their
own development would have been higher.

33.     In consideration of the foregoing, we may assess the relevance of the initial
project design as high. The revised design as resulted from the 2008 amendment to the
Loan Agreement has lost relevance to a certain extent through dropping the Microcredits
Scheme, remaining however substantial.


Project implementation

34.     The socio-economic regeneration component of MCESERP was aimed to scale up
the job creation activities piloted by the MCSMP and to add sub-components to foster
local conditions for economic and social regeneration, relying on a bottom-up planning
process.

35.     The joint analyzes from early 2006 by the Bank and the entities having
responsibilities in project’s implementation revealed that it will not be possible to
complete the planned activities before the pilot project was scheduled to close at the end
of June 2006. Consequently the MoPF formally requested that this closing date be
extended until the end of October 2006, which the Bank approved, so that the pilot
project and the follow-up project were implemented in parallel up to the fourth quarter of
2006.

36.     The SER component has exceeded most of its objectives, with an average level of
achieving the target values for key performance indicators of 164.48%. If correcting to
100% the achievements that exceeded 100%, as to better reflect the poorer than expected
performance, the average level of targets’ achievement is 98.35%, which is not bad in the
conditions of severe under financing. The key performance indicators with achievements
against targets as of October 31, 2012 are presented below.

37.    The overlapping economic and financial crisis that profoundly affected Romania
during the last years not only has worsened the perspectives for economic regeneration of

                                           52
mining communities and especially diminished the employment opportunities, but also
affected the pace of implementation of the SER component in the conditions of
Government’s difficulties to provide necessary funds for financing the Project.

38.     The pretty late start of SER programs’ implementation along with the delays
accumulated during the implementation process, mainly as a consequence of under
budgeting but also due to the time consuming process of developing and enforcing
operation manuals and other regulations, such as GDs for approval of technical-economic
indicators for the selected MI subprojects, have resulted in exceeding the planned
deadlines for finalization of the programs, which required repeated extensions of the
project closing date.

39.     In consideration of the foregoing, our rating of the implementation performance is
only satisfactory.

Operation

40.    Disbursement under SER has been the main and most difficult issue and actually
the single issue flagged as putting the project at risk in the annual/quarterly portfolio
reviews for Romania. As acknowledged by the Bank’s Mid-Term Review mission, this
was not due to any shortcomings of project management and implementation, but to
shortages in project funding. This has been reiterated in some of the JPR/QPR reports.

41.    In spite of the operation arrangements being suitable for SER programs
implementation, except for budgeting, these programs could not be completed on
schedule. Therefore, even though lagging behind the schedule has been mostly due to
under budgeting, our rating for the operation performance is only satisfactory.

Evaluation of the performance of the Bank, any co financiers, or of other partners
during preparation and implementation of the operation, including the effectiveness
of their relationships, with special emphasis on lessons learned;

42.    The Bank played a key role in the identification, preparation and appraisal of this
follow-up project.

43.    The Bank has provided continuous support to project implementation through
supervision and/or implementation support missions, as well as through analyzing and
providing clearance or, as the case required, comments and recommendations to
procurement documents prepared by PMU-SER.

44.     The supervision and support missions carried out twice a year, at pretty regular
intervals, have had a pronounced pragmatic character, each including site visits and
analyzes at the level of programs and/or operational activities, from which both PMU-
SER personnel and AZM programs responsible personnel had something to learn. In the
conditions of PMU-SER depopulation in 2010, the Bank’s specialists have significantly
contributed to restoring its capacity, especially in financial management and procurement

                                           53
matters. A special contribution that should be pointed out has been brought in by the
Bank’s Consultant for infrastructure, who not only provided technical advice on the spot,
during the Bank’s missions, for implementation of MI subprojects, but also provided the
PMU-SER with written recommendations by type of civil works to be taken into account
while preparing technical specifications for future civil works contracts and carrying out
monitoring visits on site.

45.     Worthy to mention also is the constant concern of the Bank team for provision by
the Government of necessary funds for project implementation, yet not always resulting
in actually increasing budget allocations in this regard.

46.    In consideration of the foregoing, our assessment of the Bank’s performance is
highly satisfactory.

47.     Other key partners in project implementation have been Ministry of Economy,
Commerce and Business Environment (MECBE)/Ministry of Economy (MoE), as of the
date of updating this report, and Ministry of Public Finance (MoPF). The specialized
bodies in the MECBE and the minister himself have provided support to RASDIA in
budgeting matters as well as in preparing and enacting necessary legal regulations
necessary for project implementation. The MPF has also been very supportive in matters
regarding budgeting and endorsement of budgetary reallocations, of course within the
limits of the approved state budget, as well as in preparing necessary documents during
the Loan amendment process. Worthy to mention here is also the support provided by the
National Agency of Employment (ANOFM) through quarterly submitting to PMU-SER
data regarding the unemployment in mining regions at locality level, which allowed
undertaking comparative analyzes of the evolution of unemployment.

48.   Based on the above mentioned, overall appreciation of the entities involved in the
implementation of the project could be rated as satisfactory.
