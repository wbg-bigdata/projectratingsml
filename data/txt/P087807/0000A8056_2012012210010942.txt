                         The Project Development Objectives (PDO) in the Loan Agreement is to strengthen the government's ability to undertake mining sector reform by (i) building
                         MEC's capacity for closing uneconomic mining enterprises through support for closing complex mines and ancillary facilities in an environmentally sustainable
                         manner; and (ii) providing support to mining communities and local public authorities for socio-economic regeneration of the mining regions through central
                         entities."

                         The Bank has received a letter from the Government of Romania dated November 28, 2011 requesting a six month extension of the project Closing Date, from November 30, 2011 to
                         May 30, 2012, in order to fully achieve the project development objectives (PDO) and requesting a cancellation of US$31,089,780 out of the Loan amount of US$120,000,000. This

                         is a Level II restructuring as there are no changes to the PDO, scope, design, or project outcomes and no additional safeguards are triggered as a result of the restructuring. There
                         was no change in project scope or revision of the end of project targets established during the May 2008 restructuring of the Project. Following Bank Management’s concurrence with
                         the client’s request, the project Closing Date was extended to May 30, 2012 and US$31,089,780 was cancelled effective November 28, 2011.

                         The Mine Closure Component has successfully closed 9 mines, and closures of an additional 3 are ongoing. A total of 14 additional mining-related sites have been closed so far and
                         the final number is expected to be 15 by the revised Closing Date. Therefore, the “number of mines as well as mining enterprises closed in an environmentally sound manner? is
                         expected to be 27 by the revised Closing Date. This exceeds the end of project target of 20 for this indicator that was established during the May 2008 first order restructuring of the
                         Project. Similarly, the target for the transfer of knowledge on environmental-friendly mine closure procedures through training has been exceeded—602 persons trained compared to
                         the target of 500.

                         The Socioeconomic Regeneration Component has supported the local economic development of localities severely affected by mine closures, through a range of instruments
                         designed to rejuvenate the economic and social life of the affected local communities. Of 50 municipal infrastructure (MI) projects planned, a total of 21 have been completed, 10 are
                         scheduled to be finalized by December 15, 2011, and the final 19 are expected to be completed by the revised Closing Date. The total number of MI projects was increased from 15
                         at appraisal to 30 when the project was restructured in May 2008, and the projected completion of 50 will significantly surpass the project target. A total of 194 social development
                         schemes for mining communities (SDSMC) have been completed, and an additional 51 are under implementation and will be completed by the revised Closing Date. The total
                         number of SDSMCs expected to be finalized by the revised Closing Date will be 245, which significantly exceeds the end of project target of 160. As of September 30, 2011, 522
                         small grants schemes (SGS) were completed and have had a strong positive impact on community development. (The end of project target established in May 2008 was 350).
