                         The Project Development Objectives (PDO) in the Loan Agreement is to strengthen the government's ability to undertake mining sector reform by (i) building MEC's
                         capacity for closing uneconomic mining enterprises through support for closing complex mines and ancillary facilities in an environmentally sustainable manner; and
                         (ii) providing support to mining communities and local public authorities for socio-economic regeneration of the mining regions through central entities."

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Bank received a letter from the Government of Romania dated April 12, 2012 requesting a six month extension of the project Closing Date, from May 30, 2012 to November 30,
                         2012, in order to fully achieve the project development objectives (PDO). This is a Level II Restructuring as there are no changes to the PDO, scope, design, or project outcomes and
                         no additional safeguards are triggered as a result of the restructuring. There was no change in project scope or revision of the end of project targets established during the May 2008

                         restructuring of the Project. Following careful review of the request by Bank Management the project Closing Date was extended by five months to October 31, 2012.

                         The Mine Closure Component has successfully closed 9 mines, and closures of an additional 3 are ongoing. A total of 14 additional mining-related sites have been closed so far and
                         the final number is expected to be 15 by the revised Closing Date. Therefore, the “number of mines as well as mining enterprises closed in an environmentally sound manner? is

                         expected to be 27 by the revised Closing Date, which exceeds the end of project target of 20 for this indicator that was established during the May 2008 first order restructuring of the
                         Project. Similarly, the target for the transfer of knowledge on environmental-friendly mine closure procedures through training has been exceeded—602 persons trained compared to
                         the target of 500.

                         The Socioeconomic Regeneration Component has supported the local economic development of localities severely affected by mine closures, through a range of instruments
                         designed to rejuvenate the economic and social life of the affected local communities. Compared to an end of project target of 30 municipal infrastructure (MI) projects, 50 are now
                         expected to be completed by the October 31, 2012 Closing Date. This includes 27 which have been completed and an additional 23 that are under implementation. A total of 202
                         social development schemes for mining communities (SDSMC) have been completed, and the total number of SDSMCs expected to be finalized by the revised Closing Date will be
                         245, which significantly exceeds the end of project target of 160. A total of 564 small grants schemes (SGS) were completed and have had a strong positive impact on community
                         development. (The end of project target established in May 2008 was 350).
