SUMMARY
The Bank has received a request from the Government of Romania a letter dated
November 28, 2011 requesting a six month extension of the project closing date, from
November 30, 2011 to May 30, 2012, in order to fully achieve the project development
objectives (PDO) and requesting the cancellation of US$31,089,780 out of the loan
amount of US$120,000,000. This is a level II restructuring as there are no changes to the
PDO, scope, design, or project outcomes and no additional safeguards are triggered as a
result of the restructuring.

There is no change in project scope or revision of the end of project targets established
during the May 2008 restructuring of the Project.


PROJECT STATUS
Overall project implementation has been satisfactory, and the PDO is expected to be fully
achieved by the revised closing date of May 30, 2012. The Project Development
Objectives (PDO) in the Loan Agreement is “to strengthen the government's ability to
undertake mining sector reform by (i) building capacity of the Ministry of Economy,
Trade, and Business Environment (MEC) for closing uneconomic mining enterprises
through support for closing complex mines and ancillary facilities in an environmentally
sustainable manner; and (ii) providing support to mining communities and local public
authorities for socio-economic regeneration of the mining regions through central
entities.?

The Mine Closure component has successfully closed 9 mines, and closures of an
additional 3 are ongoing. A total of 14 additional mining-related sites have been closed
so far and the final number is expected to be 15 by the revised closing date. Therefore
the “number of mines as well as mining enterprises closed in an environmentally sound
manner? is expected to be 27 by the revised closing date. This compares very favorably
with the end of project target of 20 for this indicator that was established during the May
2008 first order restructuring of the Project. Similarly the target for the transfer of
capacity for mine closure through training under this component has been exceeded—602
persons trained compared to the target of 500. However, the target for total area of
rehabilitated land will not be met. The 2008 target was 923 hectares, and current
estimates indicate that the final amount achieved will be less than 500 hectares by the
revised closing date. This indicator target was estimated based on the number of mines to
be closed. However, the final selection of many of the mines to be closed was done
during project implementation, and was based on level of risk and sites that warranted

                                            3
international expertise and Bank supervision, rather than on the size of sites and amount
of hectares that could be restored. Furthermore the indicator also includes mining related
sites such as processing facilities many of which have much smaller footprints than actual
mines. The mine closure works undertaken have been complex, have met recognized
international standards, and have incorporated state of the art environmental monitoring
to address significant environment and health risks to the surrounding environment and
local populations.

The Socioeconomic Regeneration component has supported the local economic
development of localities severely affected by mine closures, through a range of
instruments designed to rejuvenate the economic and social life of the affected local
communities. Of 50 municipal infrastructure (MI) projects planned, a total of 21 have
been completed, 10 are scheduled to be finalized by December 15, 2011, and the final 19
are expected to be completed by the revised closing date. The total number of MI
projects was increased from 15 at appraisal to 30 when the project was restructured in
May 2008, and the projected completion of 50 will significantly surpass the project
target.

A total of 194 social development schemes for mining communities (SDSMC) have been
completed, and an additional 51 are under implementation and will be completed by the
revised closing date. The total number of SDSMC expected to be finalized by the revised
closing date will be 245, which significantly exceeds the end of project target of 160. As
of September 30, 2011, 522 small grants schemes (SGS) were completed and have had a
strong positive impact on community development. (The end of project target
established in May 2008 was 350).

In summary, most of the project targets will be achieved or have already been exceeded,
however several important works are still ongoing that require additional time and close
technical support or supervision. In particular, the proposed extension will permit
continuation of work at 3 highly complex and environmentally hazardous sites under the
Mine Closure component. These sites: Valea Devei, Baia de Aires, and Gura Baii
Superior require close on-going technical supervision to ensure their successful
completion. Finalization was delayed by budget allocation shortfalls in prior years of
project implementation. Additional municipal infrastructure projects which will be
finalized by the revised closing date will enable the implementing ministry to deliver
agreed projects which were approved for project financing by Government decision more
than 1.5 years ago, and for which implementation was delayed due to shortage of funds
allocated to the project by Ministry of Public Finance. Further, since community
contributions for these MI works were collected prior to government decision and held in
escrow, the client is keen to ensure that these works are finalized.

During the November 2011 supervision mission, additional works, including new small
grants and closures of mines, that had been proposed by the implementing ministry to be
undertaken with the substantial estimated savings of US$31,089,780 were discussed.
However, it was decided that these proposed works were not feasible during the revised
closing date and should therefore be dropped from consideration, and the potential
savings cancelled.

                                            4
There are no outstanding audit reports due on the Project and previous audit reports were
found satisfactory to the Bank.



PROPOSED CHANGES
   •   Closing date: The closing date for the project is proposed to be extended by six
       months from November 30, 2011 to May 30, 2012, the new date discussed during
       the November 2011 supervision mission and agreed with management. This is
       the second extension of the project closing date. The original project closing date
       was May 31, 2010, and the total number of extensions is less than two years and
       therefore subject to Country Director approval. It is suggested that the extension
       will be processed through a notification to the Borrower which is proposed to be
       signed by the Country Director.

   •   Financing: A total of US$31,089,780.00 of the loan proceeds is proposed to be
       cancelled as per the Government’s letter request of November 28, 2011, since it
       will not be required to achieve the end of project targets, and is the result of
       significant cost savings across the two components. Therefore, it is suggested that
       the Borrower be notified of the partial cancellation of the loan amount and revised
       Schedule 1 of the loan agreement accordingly modified as follows:
