Block 1: Project Description
1. Project development objectives (see Annex I for key performance indicators):
The Project seeks to generate and stimulate sustainable rural employment in poor rural areas of northwest Algeria. The
instruments to be used emphasize asset creation, mainly through natural resource management and protection of the
environment, with the purpose of increasing labor productivity in a sustainable manner. Asset creation is defined broadly as
the enhanced availability of resources that can be used directly or indirectly in productive activities. Examples are
infrastructure with important externalities, maintenance of the natural resource base by reducing soil erosion, enhanced
availability of water for irrigation and human consumption, etc. Unemployment is a structural problem in Algeria. Hence,
longer term solutions are necessary to address the problem. Short term solutions such as direct transfers can alleviate
shortfalls in income and consumption flows but will not have durable effects. It is necessary to focus on asset creation to
have longer term effects, particularly on labor productivity.
The proposed Project is part of a wider effort to support growth in agriculture, a key sector for the economy, and it is
complementary to agricultural reform, in that it seeks to enhance popular support for reform and alleviate the adverse social
effects of adjustment. This Project would also be the first phase of a broader set of activities with a similar objective in the
long run. It would provide a model and laboratory for developing experience in community involvement in rural
development in Algeria.

Country: ALGERIA                                                                    Project Tltle: Rural Employment
3. Benefits and target population:
The target area is the rural communities in 67 communes in six perimeters (Monts de Tlemcen, Monts de Traras, Sbaa
Chioukh, Tessala, Cheurfa II and Monts de Beni-Chougrane) in the mountainous areas of four wilaya in NW Algeria:
Tlemcen, Sidi Bel Abbes, Mascara and Ain Temouchent (see project area maps). Poverty in this area is widespread,
especially among the farming population, the unemployed and disadvantaged women. No special targeting mechanisms
are therefore required. Over a period of three years, by creating 40,000 person years of direct employment, and possibly
additional indirect employment, and through training, the Project is expected to reach the following beneficiaries, some
of whom are in more than one group: (a) around 69,000 rural unemployed, most of whom are young; (b) around 6,400
landless rural households and 34,000 rural households with less than 5 ha of land, together comprising 58 percent of rural
households; (c) impoverished households (estimated per capita income of less than US$1.00 per day), comprising 84
percent of rural households; and (d) 10,000 disadvantaged women. Local communities, local governments and the DGF
would also benefit from training on participatory approaches to project design and implementation.
Project benefits include the following:
* economic: about 40,000 person years of direct employment, and a significant amount of indirect employment;
diversified and higher production on private lands; and increases in land asset values for poor rural households resulting
from higher production as well as reduced soil erosion.
* social: social acceptability of Government interventions and increased community "ownership" of these interventions;
integration of disadvantaged women who would acquire skills under the Project into the social and economic life of
their communities; and reduced migration and greater stability in the rural population.
* environmental: reduced soil erosion.
* institutional: enhanced capacity of DGF in managing decentralized projects; and increased local capacity through the
involvement of the local enterprises in pro ect implementation.
4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
Implementation period: 4 years
Executing agencies: General Directorate of Forestry (DGF) of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (MOAF). The
DGF has recently adopted a decentralized structure, and would devolve responsibility for day-to-day management of
project activities to local levels of its new structure (see Annex 2 and the Project Files for details on the organization,
procedures and responsibilities of various levels of the decentralized management structure).
* Central level. A Project Management Unit (PMU) within the DGF would be responsible for overall project
coordination and administration, including project accounting and disbursement; management of the project special
account; and ensuring timely audits and M&E (see below). It would also be the principal interlocutor of the Bank on
procurement matters, periodic progress reporting. etc., in accordance with procedures agreed with the Bank at
appraisal.
* Regional level. The DGF's conservation desforets (CF) in each wilaya will be responsible for project
implementation. Specifically, it will execute the annual action plans and coordinate project actions in the respective
wilayas; manage the human, financial and material resources at the wilaya level; and coordinate the M&E of project
performance at the wilaya level.
* Communal level. The 67 communes in the project area will be organized into 1 1 Cellules Intercommunales de
Developpement (CID), each covering 5-7 communes. The CID will be the basic unit for project implementation and
interface with the communities. Each CID will have development agents (forester, agriculturist, extension agent,
sociologist and agricultural economist), one of whom will be a female agent in charge of women's activities. A
coordinator will head the CID, and will be responsible for liaison with the DGF hierarchy as well as public and
private agencies or organizations (Chambers of Agriculture, cooperatives, Directorates of Agricultural Services
(DSA), extension agents, etc.) that are expected to participate in project implementation.
* Village and "douar": level. Informal comites de village (CV) are proposed to be the interlocutor for project activities
with the CID. They will identify and represent the beneficiaries and interest groups, organize them, and assist in
promoting community involvement, participation and partnership.

Within the above decentralized management framework, project activities would be executed mainly by local private and
public enterprises through competitive processes. Force account will not be used. Maintenance of community
investments will be done by the communities themselves. Maintenance of investments on private lands will be the
responsibility of the beneficiaries themselves. For water resource mobilization activities, water utility associations
(WUA) will be established to manage and maintain the water infrastructures through concession contracts.
Project oversight (policy guidance, etc.): MOAF
Accounting, financial reporting and auditing arrangements: Accounting and financial reporting will be handled by the
DGF; and auditing by the Inspection General of Finance (IGF) in the Ministry of Finance, which handles the audits of
Bank- financed projects in Algeria. To facilitate disbursements for what are expected to be numerous contracts under the
Project, a Special Account with a 90-day advance will be established, with the Government making all its annual
contributions available to the Project at the beginning of each fiscal year. Semi-annual audits of the wilaya level
expenditure accounts will be conducted by the IGF.
Monitoring and evaluation arrangements: DGF will be responsible for normal progress reports on the Project and
consultants financed by the Project will be employed for monitoring and evaluation, based on TOR approved at
Appraisal. Detailed procedures and forms to aid M&E and disbursements have been developed and are available in
project files.
Block 2: Project Rationale
5. CAS objectives supported by the Project (CAS: Report (15316-AL); Board Date: February 27, 1996)
This Project supports the CAS objective of employment and poverty reduction by directly creating around 40,000 person-
years of employment through physical interventions emphasizing asset creation, and indirectly by increasing the
availability of productive resources and improving agro-ecological conditions. The Project aims to support growth in
agriculture and will contribute in a complementary manner to agricultural policy and reform actions, particularly in
enhancing popular support for reform and alleviating the socially adverse effects of adjustment. The CAS indicates that a
series of priority employment promotion operations would be prepared. It also identifies poverty reduction as one of its
three priority action areas, the other two being acceleration of reforms and mobilization of external financing. Job creation is
an important aspect of poverty reduction. In this context, the CAS has identified rural unemployment as a high priority issue
and the Bank concurs with the Government in the urgency of addressing the problem. The Bank recognizes the social
repercussions of adjustment and development. It has already approved a Social Safety Net Project in FY96 which utilizes a
similar approach of asset creation. Implementation of the agricultural and rural components of the Social Safety Net Project
started in early 1997.
6. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
Agriculture is a key sector in the economy, employing about 25 percent of the labor force. Self-sufficiency in food
production is low at around 20 percent of requirements. Annual food imports exceed US$ 2 billion on average. This is
due to a history of emphasis socialist organization of production on state farms, which were dissolved in 1987 (Review of
Agricultural Policies and Agricultural Services; Report No. 12534-AL, 1994). Agriculture is now responding to a
liberalized environment where virtually all input subsidies have been eliminated and producer supports are confined to
wheat and milk production. Agricultural trade has been liberalized but dominant public enterprises (PE) restrict private
sector activity; some of these PE are being privatized or dissolved. Agricultural growth has been over 10 percent in the
past two years due to diversification and average weather conditions.
The remaining priority issues on the agricultural reform agenda are as follows:
*  rural unemployment: in the short run this will be addressed through a civil works program, which, inter alia, the
present Project would be supporting, and through the development of labor-intensive techniques and private sector
SME-SMI in the medium term. The emphasis on the issue of rural employment will also address rural poverty
problems.
* natural resource management and protection of the environment, especially erosion control and water resource
management: soil erosion has been identified as a serious problem in an agro-ecological review and would be

incorporated in a National Environmental Assessment Plan (NEAP) under preparation. It is being addressed through
a civil works program. Policy aspects of water resource management will be the focus of sectoral adjustment
operations, and water resource mobilization will be addressed through rehabilitation and investment projects (an
Agricultural Expenditure Review -AER- has demonstrated that the performance of water resource investments is very
poor and that the priority should be the rehabilitation of existing infrastructure to make it functional).
* agricultural and rural credit: this requires certain developments in financial sector reform, especially private sector
involvement in banking. The recent rehabilitation of the Agricultural Credit Unions will be a step in the right
direction if they are developed as grass roots organizations.
* privatization of state-owned lands: out of the total arable land of 7.5 m ha, 4.7 m ha is under private ownership.
Therefore this issue pertains to 2.8 m ha of state land which used to be under state farms but which have now been
distributed to individual and collective farms with perpetual usufruct rights. The present appointed Government has
decided that the modalities for the privatization of state-owned lands would be determined by an elected Parliament.
In the project area 90 percent of the agricultural land is under private ownership.
*  privatization of agriculturalpublic enterprises: there is already some progress in this area, e.g., with the dissolution
of ONAPSA which dominated input supply markets. However more liberalization is needed, e.g., in the cereal, dairy
___and   feed   sectors.----------   --________________________________________
7. Sector issues to be addressed by the Project and strategic choices:
Addressing the problem of rural unemployment is the main focus of the proposed Project. The instruments to be used in
the Project emphasize natural resource management and protection of the environment. These instruments are
conducive to labor-intensive techniques and employment generation.
The Project represents be a turning point for rural projects in Algeria. It embodies the following strategic choices that the
Government has made in addressing the problem of rural poverty and unemployment: (i) a shift in emphasis from capital-
intensive approaches to labor-intensive ones, in line with the prevailing factor proportions in the country; (ii) the priority
accorded to small scale interventions; and (iii) finally, a change from top-down approaches to one where communities
would be more involved in projects at various stages. Hence, participatory approaches aim to generate community
involvement in the present Project and build the base for similar projects in the future.
8. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
Given the crisis proportions of unemployment in rural areas and in the project area in particular, a longer term integrated
rural development (IRD) program, which could have been an alternative, was not considered. It would have taken
considerably longer to prepare due to logistical constraints and, due to lack of experience with IRD projects in Algeria,
would have had a lower probability of success.
Initial proposals by the Government for relatively more capital-intensive options and large scale operations (grands
chantiers) were also excluded to focus on small scale, labor-intensive interventions with community involvement and
local contractors.
In developing design alternatives, the option of establishing of a Social Fund, which has worked well in other countries, was
also considered. The Project, which relies on conventional delivery mechanisms, and a social fund, which is an integrated
and targeted approach, were not viewed as mutually exclusive but as complementary options to address social and
employment issues. Because setting up an effectively functioning fund would take time to develop, the Government has
decided to proceed with the Project first in light of the urgency of the unemployment and social problems. As opposed to
program support in Social Funds, the present Project entails a set of identified activities.
Finally, even though the initial proposal was for a national project, it was decided not to diffuse effort and resources over
wide and discrete areas. Hence, the Project focuses on a relatively contiguous area in NW Algeria. It is expected that the
experience gained in a focused effort in one area can be transferred to other areas as well.

The Bank projects above were developed before the current CAS was prepared and before the ESW which established
the sectoral policy dialogue (Review of Agricultural Policies and Agricultural Services; Report No. 12534-AL, 1994)
was finalized. Future cooperation will be based more in terms of policy and investment operations that are in the context
of the sectoral strategy. A portfolio review in February 1996 and subsequent actions have improved portfolio
performance. Remaining problems in projects will be reviewed in upcoming supervision and review activities in March -
10. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
The main lessons learned are presented in three documents available in the project files and pertain to community
involvement, poverty focus, emphasis on labor-irntensive technologies and project organization.
Experience with Bank-assisted poverty reduction projects shows that community involvement is critical, especially in
ensuring sustainability of results. Hence, participatory approaches were emphasized during project preparation and a
significant training program in participatory approaches is included in the Project.
Project preparation also emphasized poverty and unemployment issues based on the policy dialogue with Algeria 1987
(Review of Agricultural Policies and Agricultural Services; Report No. 12534-AL, 1994). Rural unemployment implies a
highly probable consequence of poverty. The poor have their labor as the primary resource. In Algeria, rapid population
growth is compounded by land scarcity. Furthermore, rural unemployment is concentrated in the mountainous zones. Nearly
half the farms of Algeria are in mountainous zones and 85 percent of these farms are below 10 ha. Hence, the employment

Country: ALGERIA                                                                       Project Title: Rural Employment
policy objective is to find ways to increase the productivity of labor and use that resource efficiently. Sustainable,
remunerative employment based on high labor productivity should be the aim of employment policies. Higher labor
productivity can be achieved only when employment programs are combined with asset generation, the utilization of labor-
intensive technology and the enhancement of human resources. The poor lack assets as well as income, including access to
infrastructure and the human capital embodied in skills and knowledge. These are critical aspects that were incorporated in
the Project.
Hence, the Project emphasizes labor-intensive techniques. In the case of Algeria, historical policy choices that emphasized
capital-intensive options in the face of factor proportions with abundant labor led to inefficient results and were maintained
only with macroeconomic distortions that proved to be unsustainable. The basic lesson here is that rectifying these
distortions with employment-intensive activities would lead to efficiency; in other words, it would be necessary to focus on
the lower labor/capital cost ratio or the lower shadow price of labor vs. that of capital.
Finally, the Project can not be implemented with top-down approaches as it requires community involvement and diffused
operations. A decentralized project implementation structure would be more effective. Hence, the Project aims to reinforce
the decentralization efforts of the DGF through capacity enhancement emphasizing training in participatory approaches and
Droject management.
11. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
The Government has already designed important employment programs: social safety net type expenditures by the
Government amounted to DA 60.5 billion in 1996 and are expected to increase to DA 75.4 in 1997. However, given the
magnitude of the unemployment problem, particularly in the rural areas, the Government faces financing constraints. It
has agreed to finance its contribution to the Project and to make those resources available at the beginning of each fiscal
year. The Project has already been inscribed in the 1997 Investment Budget. The decentralization of the DGF is an
important development signaling the Government's willingness to devolve employment-oriented interventions to the
community level.
The Government has also officially indicated to the Bank that the following commitments will enhance the sustainability
of project interventions:
* labor-intensive approaches will be used in rural projects instead of over capital intensive ones;
* the Government will move towards small-scale operations rather than the large scale grands chantiers approach;
* instead of centralized, top-down approaches, local populations will be involved in different stages of projects;
* the investment program will be a realistic one, with initial emphasis on improving project implementation capacity
and local participation; some of these activities have already started during project preparation;
* use of independent consultants for monitoring project performance will facilitate rapid resolution of constraints and
problems; and
* the possibility of retroactive financing will allow for the bidding procedures for institutional development,
particularly training, and monitoring activities to start well ahead of project implementation.
Finally, institutional development activities, particularly training and monitoring, have started ahead of other project
activities with grant resources, and will also be supported by retroactive financing (see section 2 above).
12. Value added of Bank support:
The contributions of the Bank stem from the international experience gained in employment and social safety net type
projects. This experience was influential in changing the policy perspective of the Project from its initial design that was
relatively more capital-intensive towards small-scale, labor-intensive options. Again based on its international
experience, the Bank has been able to cast the seeds of participatory approaches, limited and gradual as they may be.
Initial training in community involvement was completed during the preparation phase and the authorities have agreed to
include a significant training program within the Project. This will be a major improvement over traditional top-down
approaches. Finally, the Bank emphasized decentralized implementation and in the project design encouraged and
reinforced the decentralization of the DGF with activities that complement technical capacity with project management
skills.

Block 3: Summary Project Assessments (Detailed assessments are in Annex 4 and in the Project Files: see Annex 8)
13. Economic Assessment    [X] Cost-Benefit Analysis : NPV:= US$132m   []Cost Effectiveness Analysis:
(see Annex 4):                    ERR = 26.5%
The Project is economically viable as indicated by an NPV of US$132 million, using a 10% discount rate, and an ERR of
26.5 percent. Project benefits that were quantified in monetary terms and included in the cost benefit analysis were as
follows: (i) for the erosion control component, increased water accumulation in downstream dams due to reduced siltation
and modest wood production; (ii) for the agricultural component, increased production of tree fruits and grapes; and (iii) for
water resource mobilization (hill ponds), increased water availability for irrigation. These three components, which account
for 93% of total project costs, are also expected to yield significant environmental benefits - in terms of improved land
quality, reduced erosion, reduced runoff and increased recharge - that were not taken into account in the NPV and ERR
calculations. Also not evaluated in monetary terms and therefore excluded from the NPV and ERR calculations were the
environmental, institutional or human resource development benefits from project activities that account for the remaining 7
percent of total project costs
In addition to a 10% discount rate , the key assumptions underpinning the cost benefit analysis were: (i) an economic
value of labor equivalent to only 30 percent of its financial value. While this is lower than that previously used in projects
in Algeria (e.g., 50 percent in the Pilot Forestrv and Watershed Management Project), it is appropriate given the
prevalence of unemployment in the project area; (ii) an economic value of water equal to 150 percent of its financial value,
to reflect the current subsidized water tariffs; (iii) farmgate prices equivalent to 75% of product prices, to take into account
a 25 percent marketing allowance, except for cereals and grapes which are purchased at contractual prices by public
enterprises; (iv) farmers will be given good access to supporting agricultural services as part of the CID (see section 4
above) to help them shift successfully from annual crops to fruit trees and grapes, and have the incentives to do so (see
section 12 below); (v) seasonal financing mainly from unofficial sources and own sources is available; and (vi) most
importantly, country conditions would be conducive to the effective implementation of the Project. Given that the last
factor would likely have much more of an impact on expected outcomes than the earlier project-specific assumptions and
risks, but is not amenable to quantification, a formal risk and sensitivity analysis was not carried out.
Fiscal impact (see Annexes 4 and 5):
Given that the Project essentially entails social transfers to address the social problem of rural employment, the overall fiscal
impact will be negative. The present value of the implicit water subsidy is estimated at DA 154 million, or 1 .4 percent of the
present value of economic benefits of the Project. The Government will also finance recurrent expenditures. Excluding the
interventions on private lands, the Government will finance 50 percent of recurrent expenditures during the life of the Project
and 100 percent of these recurrent expenditures during the operational period. The present value of the recurrent
expenditures is DA 1.843 b. Taxes and duties on Project inputs have a present value of DA 2.280 b. Given that agricultural
production in mountain areas is tax exempt, the Project is not expected to yield significant additional revenues for the
Government. As the budgetary burden of the Project has a present value of the DA 5.561 b, the overall fiscal impact is
negative. In comparison, the social safety net type expenditures of the Government in 1996-1997 are expected to total
DA 136b.
14. Financial Assessment (see Annex 5)           NPV = US$20.3m; FRR = 11.7 %
The financial assessment was based on the financial cost of project inputs and outputs, and resulted in a much lower NPV
of US$20.3 million (using a 10% discount rate) and an FRR of about 12%. The main source of the difference was the
much higher financial wage, which was 3.33 times the assumed economic value. Taxes on project inputs also contributed
to the wedge between the economic and financial NPVs but to a lesser extent.
At the level of individual farmers, the profitability of various investment activities is expected to be more attractive than
indicated by the overall project FRR. For example, for destoning, which is equivalent to creation of new cultivable land,
and fruit trees, the FRRs are about 38 and 16 percent, respectively (see project files).

Country: ALGERIA                                                                     Project Title: Rural Employment
15. Technical Assessment:
Technical specifications for project activities will emphasize the use of labor-intensive techniques, as indicated by the
number of days of employment created per unit cost, and a high labor cost component as percentage of total costs (see
Attachment I to Annex 4). The technical design of the main project activities was based on: (i) the global resource
management and development strategy of the MOAF and DGF for mountainous areas; (ii) the existing technical
experience and lessons learned in Algeria and in neighboring countries; (iii) the technical effectiveness to protect the
environment; and (iv) the social acceptability and potential economic returns (income generation, sustainable production
improvement, etc.) of the proposed techniques and approach to local populations. Adaptations were made to traditional
practices usually carried out by public enterprises: (i) to reduce mechanization in favor of labor-intensive work; (ii) to
simplify techniques to meet the local implementation capacities (SME-SMI); and (iii) to improve cost-effectiveness in
employment generation. The basic approach for land management on cultivated lands is to replace annual crops on
sloping areas which are mainly responsible for soil erosion with perennial crops, fruit and wood trees which provide a
permanent pr_tection for the soil. ____________________________________________
16. Institutional Assessment:
The institutional and implementation arrangements described in section 4 above, including the borrower's detailed
Project Implementation Plan, were evaluated at appraisal and found satisfactory. DGF is currently executing a Bank
project (Forestry and Pilot Watershed Management Project - Loan 3487) and has the experience and the organization to
manage the accounting, financial reporting and auditing arrangements. As already noted, DGF has recently adopted a
decentralized structure with increased representation at the wilaya and daira levels. Actual responsibility for project
operations has devolved to these levels. Key nominations to the decentralized project management structure have already
been made. An institutional development component is included in the Project to reinforce the decentralization efforts of
DGF  with   trainin  and  eguipm ent ..-- --------------------------------        -----------------
17. Social Assessment (See Annex 2 and Project Files for a review of the social conditions in the project area.):
The region has been characterized as having a tradition of social cooperation and hence participatory approaches are
expected to yield positive results, even if a certain degree of skepticism is expected initially. Social assessment during
project preparation indicated considerable interest and willingness to participate in the Project. One interesting
observation was that traditions in the Project area would facilitate water resources to be managed by WUA.
The interactions between social and environmental factors are evident. Poverty and unemployment result in
overexploitation of existing resources, monoculture for food production, and incursion of cultivation into parcours and
forests. These affect the natural resource base further through more erosion and degradation and produce a vicious circle
of poverty with consequences in migration and social pressures. Poverty could affect the degree of participation in the
Project. The Project aims to overcome these social constraints by providing incentives for interventions on private lands
and emphasizing participat_ry approaches in general ________________________________________
18. Environmental Assessment:           Environmental Category: B
The Project has a "B" environmental rating. A review of existing environmental degradation in the project zone and of its
causes was carried out during project preparation. The zone suffers from serious land erosion which is also causing serious
sedimentation in downstream reservoirs. The environmental protection activities of the Project would contribute to achieve
over 80 percent of the employment goal of the Project (about 40,000 person-years of employment). The Project would have
positive economic and environmental effects as activities on agricultural development and erosion control would be critical
instruments in realizing the employment creation objectives of the Project. Hence, the Project is to be considered as a "win-
win" proposal. Assessment and monitoring of potential environmental impacts of project activities in rural and water
resource mobilization will be an integral part of project implementation. Interventions in water resource mobilization and
rural roads will require prior technical studies and environmental impact assessments which would be subject to Bank
approval.

For each group indicated above the entry defines the highest level of participation according to the following increasing
scale: information sharing (IS); consultation (CON); collaboration (COL), e.g., consultation implies that information
sharing logically took place as well. NGOs could not be identified in the project area and hence NA: "not applicable".
From the early stages of project preparation, major stakeholders were identified and involved in the Project through
information sharing and consultation. Close collaboration was maintained throughout project preparation between the
decentralized field organization of the DGF, the communities, consultants in charge of preparing the Project and local
government. Financed by a PHRD grant, training in participatory approaches was provided by FAO to DGF staff in the
project area through activities in the field and sessions in Rome. A similar program is included in the Project. During
implementation, particular emphasis will be put on organizing rural communities so as to involve them increasingly in
project implementation and decision making, in particular with respect to the location of project activities, their scope,
priority and schedule, cost-sharing, and the identification of priority beneficiaries. A gradual improvement of
government/community relationship as well as an incremental ownership of the Project by the communities and the
development agents who will be implementing the Project are expected. It should, however, be noted that under the
current circumstances in Algeria, participatory approaches and efforts to promote community involvement have to be a
gradual and progressive process, on the one hand for the technical staff and administrators to appreciate the efficacy of
the approach and, on the other hand, for the people to reduce the cautious and defensive skepticism based on an
accumulation of experience arising from years of dirigiste practices. (See Annex 2 and project files for a detailed
discussion of partiipatorX development issues in the context of the Pr2ject.)
20. Sustainability:
The sustainability of the Project would depend on three factors. First, consistent employment policies would need to be
implemented in non-agricultural sectors, especially in industry. Agriculture should not be expected to absorb labor in a
disproportionate manner, after accounting for differences in social costs of maintaining labor in rural and urban areas. SME-
SMI, which would utilize more labor-intensive techniques than the large scale public enterprises, would need to be
encouraged in rural areas to promote labor absorption. Ultimately, labor-intensive industrialization and complementary
macroeconomic and structural policies would be needed for a coherent employment strategy. Second, the focus would have
to be on asset creation which would increase labor productivity, rather than social transfers. In this respect developing
capacity for participatory approaches to promote community involvement is critical for the proposed Project and for the
longer term programs of the Government. Third, reasonably stable security conditions would need to be maintained in the
project area. It is also necessary that the environmental aspects of the Project be coherent with a strategy for natural resource
management and the environment. The TOR for the planned NEAP include the issue of soil erosion as a priority problem to
be addressed. An Agricultural Environmental Review under preparation has also noted the severity of agroecological
problems and has been used in identifying priorities under the present Project.
In the specific case of the sustainability of project interventions, there are two critical elements:
(i) Adequate O&M resources in the budget for maintenance activities to be managed by the Government (See Annex 5. This
is an issue that merits attention in the context of a PER and AER. However, the priority given to rural employment by the
Government is reflected in the increased resources being allocated to the DGF and its reorganization into a decentralized
structure.

(ii) The involvement of communities in project activities through participatory approaches will be a radical departure from
traditional top-down approaches. Gradual as it may be, it will increase the sensitivity of the communities to the justification
for the interventions and enhance their "ownership" of the resources created, leading to better chances for sustainability.
Cost recovery issues are addressed in terms of sustainability of the infrastructure investments. Financing of O&M costs of
interventions on public lands during the life of the Project would be shared between the Bank and the Government due to the
incremental nature of the interventions. Costs of interventions on private lands would be shared by the beneficiaries through
in kind (e.g., as family labor) or financial contributions, as these interventions are expected to create externalities in reducing
soil erosion. Subsequently, O&M expenditures would be the responsibility of the Government and the beneficiaries and
are included in financial and economic analyses (See Annex 5). In particular, all maintenance costs for interventions on
private lands would be borne by the beneficiaries of agricultural development type interventions. In water resource
mobilization operations, WUA would take over the management of the infrastructure as a concession and assume the
responsibility of O&M.

22. Possible Controversial Aspects:
The main adverse factor for the Project is the potential deterioration of the security conditions in the project areas. Initial
indications are that the populations in the project areas are quite receptive to the interventions proposed under the Project.
However, external factors or incipient local elements can have a negative effect on project performance and also target
local populations, not necessarily due to the substance of the Project but because it would enhance the image of the
Government. It is expected that the Government will provide the necessary security measures for staff of implementing
agencies, contractors and consultants.

Standard conditions.
24. Other
Project Implementation
*  For investments in rural roads, rehabilitation of rural roads and water resource mobilization, technical studies
acceptable to the Bank and which include environmental impact assessment, would be required before the investment
can be approved and authorized for disbursement (see section 18).
*  For investments in water resource mobilization, before the investment can be approved and authorized for
disbursement, the beneficiaries would be required to establish a Water Users Association (WUA), whose Charter
would conform to existing Algerian laws and would also indicate the cost sharing mechanisms for the operation and
maintenance of the water infrastructure. The Government would sign a long-term management concession contract
with the WUA, conceding the infrastructure for a symbolic fee to the WUA. Subsequently, all operation and
maintenance expenditures would be the responsibility of the WUA (see sections 4 and 20).
*  In order to ensure that employment is created through the use of labor-intensive techniques, bidding documents will
restrict the modalities of execution of works to the technical norms agreed upon for individual activities. Except for
transport and as agreed upon in technical norms, machinery use will not be allowed in the execution of works (see
section 21).
Counterpart Funds
* The Government will place its annual contribution to the Project at the disposal of the DGF at the beginning of each
fiscal year (see section 11).
Monitoring, Review and Reporting
* A "mid-term" review will take place after 12 months of project implementation, with the mandate to restructure the
Project in line with a realistic assessment of implementation experience (see section 21).

Rural Employment Project (DZ-43724)
Detailed Project Description
Introduction. Project activities focus on labor-intensive works in rural areas. The choice of instruments to
achieve the objective of employment creation emphasizes environmental protection activities and structures on public
land and on farmers' fields. Specific activities, including contingencies, cover:
Project Component 1 - US$ 59.6 million: Erosion control measures including afforestation. reforestation, and flood
control structures; these activities were chosen because of two principal reasons: (i) they ar-e amenable to labor-intensive
techniques and hence conducive to significant employment creation; and (ii) they involve significant externalities as
public goods, justifying public investments.
Project Component 2 - US$ 58.0 million: Agricultural development interventions comprising land improvement
through destoning, windbreaks, and fruit trees and grapevines on sloped land to replace cereal monoculture, and
maintenance and opening of rural roads to reduce social and economic isolation and to integrate populations into a larger
economic area (desenclavenzentJ; these activities are also labor-intensive with direct benefits to the populations in the
project area but some also create externalities in reducing erosion.
Project Component 3 - US$ 1.8 million: Small scale water resource mobilization through ponds (retetnuies
collinaires), and improvement of wells and springs; these activities were expressed by the populations in the project area
to be of high priority and have been maintained due to the potential indirect effects they can have on health, welfare and
production.
Project Component 4 - US$ 0.7 million: Activities targeting women, especially disenfranchised women (widows,
impoverished women, etc.) such as training workshops, family gardens, etc.
Project Component 5 - US$ 2.7 million: Institutional development, which will emphasize capacity development in the
decentralized rural organization of the implementation agency, the General Directorate of Forestry (DGF); and
Project Component 6 - US$ 0.4 million: Resources for independent consultants to monitor project performance.
Unallocated - US 0.5 million
Project Areas. The authorities have identified the project areas based on criteria of rural unemployment and
environmental degradation. The proposed Project will take place in four contiguous witacva in the NW of Algeria in six
mountainous zones, as indicated in the table above. This will ensure that resources and effort are not diffused.
The project area exhibits a significantly high degree of poverty, in particular among the farming population, the
unemployed and disadvantaged women. An estimated 84 percent of the farming households live in poverty. Based on the
costs of per capita daily energy requirements of 2200 calories from a basic consumption package, 31 percent of the
households were estimated to have an income below what is necessary for the satisfaction of basic food needs. Overall,
84 percent of the rural households were estimated to be living with a daily per capita income of less than US$ 1.00. The
estimated per capita income varies from DA 595/month for the landless group of farmers to DA 3214/month for the
group of farmers with more than 15 ha, i.e., per capita income between the lowest and the highest per capita income
groups differs only by a factor of 5.4. Around 10,000 disadvantaged women (widows, landless, divorced) live in
precarious conditions. The most significant social indicators of poverty include:

The interactions between social and environmental factors are evident. Poverty and unemployment result in
overexploitation of existing resources, monoculture for food production, and incursion of cultivation into parcours and
forests. These affect the natural resource base further through more erosion and degradation and produce a vicious circle
of poverty with consequences in migration and social pressures.

The choice of instruments in the Project emphasizes a high degree of labor-intensity to address the problem of
unemployment and poverty. The thrust of the activities are in the first two components which have a high degree of labor
intensity. The preliminary assessment of the investment activities were based on the following: (i) wages are based on
four categories of wages observed in the project area and additional social charges amount to 30.5 percent of wages; (ii)
profit margins of 25 percent are maintained for all investment and maintenance activities; (iii) VAT of 13 percent
(Government contribution) is also maintained for all investment and maintenance activities; and (iv) 240 days a year were

taken as the standard for annual employment. Based on this preliminary assessment, the proposed activities would be
expected to create around 40,000 person-years of direct employment during the three years of the Project.
All contracts will be competitive and the only restriction will be in technical specifications which will require
labor-intensive techniques. Hence, the contractor will determine wages according to market mechanisms, within
nminimum wage regulations. As these contracts will entail legal obligations between the Government and the contractor,
the overhead costs of social charges, profit margins and VAT can not be avoided, even though they will increase unit
costs significantly. Of course, the profit margin is maintained to encourage competitive market activities and avoid force
account.
Excluding these overhead costs, labor costs average 68 percent of overall investment costs and imply a pure
average daily wage rate of DA 277, excluding contingencies. This is 23 percent above the minimum wage of DA
4500/month, and the difference is due mainly to the fact that technical specifications for certain investment activities
require skilled workers (e.g., masons, forepersons, etc.). Furthermore, it was noted by consultants in charge of project
preparation that, while traditional extended family and tribal relations are weakening, the remaining vestiges of these
social organizations still perform a function of absorbing the unemployed by sharing available resources. This was
observed to increase the reserve wages for entry into the labor market. Excluding contingencies and overhead costs, the
average investment cost per person year of direct employment created is DA 98,160 or US$ 1666.
Investment and maintenance costs during the three years of the Project, excluding overhead charges and
contingencies is presented in the table below.

Project activities would be executed mainly by local private and public enterprises, especially ttdcherons, through
competitive processes. Project design would emphasize labor-intensive activities. This would be achieved through involving
local populations and communities in project implementation and identifying priorities. Training in and implementation of
community involvement approaches started during project preparation. In addition, the capacity of the DGF to execute
projects in the new decentralized structure was assessed during preparation and the necessary support to improve this
capacity is included as an institutional development component in the proposed Project.
The Project aims at asset creation rather than social transfers. With this approach, durable effects would be expected
in increased labor productivity. Agricultural and environmental infrastructure would be maintained, rehabilitated and
become functional. Serious agroecological problems would be addressed with the involvement of local populations so that
environmental protection is appropriated by communities.

The Project would have positive environmental impacts by reducing soil erosion, limiting forest and rangeland
degradation, reducing annual dam sedimentation rate by a target rate of 50 percent, and strengthening institutional
capacity for natural resource management. Environmental and erosion control activities would help create over 80
percent of project jobs (see Project Files on the environmental aspects of the Project). The expected employment and
environmental gains will make this Project a "win-win" proposal which could be replicated in terms of design and expected
outcome in other areas in Algeria as well as in other countries of the region which suffer from the same three problems:
sluggish economy, unemployment, and environmental and natural resource degradation.
The technical design of the main project activities was based on: (i) the global resource management and
development strategy of the MOAF and DGF for mountainous areas; (ii) the existing technical experience and lessons
learned in Algeria and in neighboring countries; (iii) the technical effectiveness to protect the environment; and (iv) the
social acceptability and potential economic returns (income generation, sustainable production improvement, etc.) of
proposed techniques and approach for the local people. Traditional practices usually carried out by public enterprises
were adapted: (i) to reduce mechanization in favor of labor-intensive work; (ii) to simplify techniques to meet the local
implementation capacities (SME-SMI); and (iii) to improve cost-effectiveness in employment generation. Detailed
technical data (fiches techniques) including unit costs and monitoring indicators have been prepared for each activity (see
fiches techniques in Project Files).
The basic approach for land management on cultivated lands is to replace annual crops on sloping areas which
are mainly responsible for soil erosion, with perennial crops, fruit and wood trees which provide a more permanent
protection for the soil.
The erosion control measures include: (i) 23,475 ha of afforestation to rehabilitate degraded forest cover mainly
on sloping areas; (ii) 1377 ha of biological stabilization of water course banks to limit stream expansion; (iii) 2687 ha of
rehabilitation and biological stabilization of contour trenches and bunds to control runoff; and (iv) building of 323,842 m3
of loose-rock check dams to reduce water induced erosion.
Agricultural development interventions include: (i) land improvement through the destoning of 23,890 ha of
cultivated land; (ii) 28,389 ha of indigenous fruit trees and 1 100 ha of grapevines plantations on sloped private land
mainly to replace existing cereal monoculture; (iii) I I km of windbreaks in cultivated areas; and (iv) the rehabilitation of
562 km of existing roads and 410 km of new roads to reduce the economic and social isolation of the douars of the
project area.
The small scale water resource mobilization activities include: (i) the building of 12 hill ponds (retenues
collinaires) to reduce runoffs and to increase recharge but also to improve the irrigation potential in the project area; (ii)
the boring and management of 26 wells mainly to provide water for human consumption and (iii) the extension of water
supply systems from 53 springs to improve access to drinking water and quality of life for local populations.
Project activities on private lands would be based on demand only and with priority given to those lands that face
erosion problems. The essential purpose of these activities on private lands is to reduce cereal monoculture, especially on
sloped lands susceptible to erosion. The Project is in a traditional fruit production zone, especially for wine grapes wine.
In addition, the activities of destoning, fruit trees and grapevines produce high financial returns (FRR of 37.9, 15.5 and
8.3 percent respectively.) Constraints to access to inputs and material prevent farmers from diversifying production. The
injection of these activities in the project area will be reinforced by the regional extension services of the MOAF, which
will be an integral part of the project implementation units: the Cellules Intercommunales de Developpement (CID, as
well as the field services of the ONCV, the wine production public enterprise. The substitution of fruit trees and vines on
these lands would produce economically better results, as well as having environmental externalities in reducing erosion.
Hence, it is necessary to balance cost recovery considerations on interventions on private lands with the externalities
created and equity factors due to the pervasive poverty of the rural households. Therefore, the beneficiaries of
interventions on private lands will pay 50 percent of the ordinary labor costs in kind or in financial terms. The subsequent
maintenance costs would be borne entirely by the beneficiaries.

Water related investments do not have as high a labor content as the other components of the investment
activities. However, water for human consumption, irrigation and for livestock was expressed as the highest priority by
the rural populations in the project area and they comprise only around 1.5 percent of investment costs. In water resource
mobilization activities, particularly for hill ponds (retenues collinaires), before these investments can be approved by the
Bank, the beneficiaries will have to establish a Water Users Association (WUA). The Charter of the WUA, signed by its
members, has to be submitted to the Bank for its approval, before disbursement for the investment can be authorized. The
basic principle for the WUA is for them to have a management concession contract with the Government for a reasonably
long period and possibly for a symbolic concession fee to manage the hill pond, source or well. The WUA will then be
responsible for the management and maintenance of these infrastructures. These management and maintenance activities
will be financed by the members of the WUA, who will also pay the usual water charges. The modalities of sharing these
management and maintenance costs contribution to the expenses of the WUA will be explicitly stated in the Charter of
the WUA.
Reinforcing the capacity of the DGF and its decentralized structure is important for several reasons. In the first
instance, supporting decentralization by developing the necessary capacity to plan, execute and monitor projects at the
regional units is important. Second, the Government has designed a long term program to use the instruments of natural
resource management and environmental protection for the objective of employment creation in rural areas. Significant
resources are being shifted to DGF for this purpose, increasing its share in public investment resources to a third of the
allocation to MOAF. Institutional reinforcement that will permit efficient management of such a program will also lead to
effective budgetary expenditures.
Developing capacity for participatory approaches to promote community involvement is critical for the proposed
Project and for the longer term programs of the Government mentioned above. Hence, training in participatory methods
was provided during the preparation of the Project with PHRD grant resources. Field and HQ staff from DGF participated
in a two stage training at FAO, Rome, coordinated by local and expatriate consultants. DGF staff, coordinated by a local
consultant, prepared preliminary information on the project area according to a format prepared by consultants. FAO
modules for participatory approach training were adapted to project area conditions during the first stage of the training.
Based on this training, DGF staff returned to Algeria and collected more in depth information, again coordinated by the
local consultant. The second stage of training involved the analysis of the information collected for further training and
the development of a program of community involvement, including wider training in the context of the execution of the
Project. This program was incorporated into the Project as a component under institutional development. It should,
however, be noted that under the current circumstances in Algeria. participatory approaches and efforts to promote
community involvement have to be a gradual and progressive process, on the one hand for the technical staff and
administrators to appreciate the efficacy of the approach and, on the other hand, for the people to reduce the cautious and
defensive skepticism based on an accumulation of experience arising from years of dirigiste practices.
In addition, training would be provided to DGF staff in technical areas of natural resource management,
especially in the area of Restauration des Terres de Montagnes, short term technical courses and courses in project
management covering M&E, accounting, audit and computer management systems. Some of these training activities will
also target key representatives of the local communities. A project management course will be carried out in February
1997 with PHRD grant funds to ensure that a minimum management capacity is in place before the Project starts.
The detailed institutional development program and the specific TOR for the different training activities are in
the Project Files.

* The discount rate is taken at 10 percent.
The basic objective of the Project is to create employment. Hence, labor-intensive activities which were
susceptible to creating employment were given priority in selection criteria (see the Attachment to this Annex). Other
activities, especially water resource mobilization, were included as they were expressed as high priorities by the rural
populations in the project area.
For the 92.9 percent of Project activities that could be subjected to economic evaluation, namely erosion control,
agricultural development and water resource mobilization, the ERR is estimated as 28.3 percent and the FRR is 12.4,
percent. Attributing the benefit flows of only these three sets of interventions to all the cost flows of the project activities
would result in an ERR of 26.5 percent and an FRR of 11.7 percent for the Project.
The economic evaluation of project activities is subject to two caveats:
a.        Some activities were not conducive to robust economic assessment and, for some, such evaluation was not
possible given the limited information available. These components which were not included in the economic evaluation of
the Project comprise 7.1 percent of project costs and are as follows: (i) among agricultural development activities,
windbreaks and rural roads; (ii) in water resource mobilization, wells and springs; (iii) monitoring and evaluation
activities; (iv) institutional development activities; and (v) promotion of rural women. The latter two activities would be
expected to have positive rates of return in human resource development, hence increasing the ERR. The environmental
externalities of the Project could increase ERR by 2-4 percent if they could be assessed.
4        The Govemment will receive taxes on project inputs and there is a water subsidy. The Government is also expected to finance recurrent expenditures. Excluding the
interventions on private lands, the Govemment will finance 50 percent of recurrent expenditures during the life of the project and 100 percent of these recurrent expenditures during the
operational period (see Annex 5). The present value of these recurrent expenditures is DA 1.843 b. Finally, given that the project aims at social transfers to address the problem of rural
employnment, the present value of the budgetary burden of project costs is DA 5.561 b, making the overall fiscal impact negative. In comparison, the social safety net type expenditures
of the Govemment in 1996 1997 are expected to amount to DA 136 b.
The main source of the difference was the much higher financial wage, which was 3.33 times the assumed economic value. Taxes on project inputs also contributed
to the wedge between the economic and financial NPVs but to a lesser extent.

b.     For activities subjected to economic evaluation, in some cases, not all the benefits and/or costs could be
quantified due to lack of information.
The main assumption in economic analysis is that, apart from ascribing economic values to tradables, the
economic value of labor is taken at 30 percent of its financial value. This is a lower figure than those previously used;
e.g., in the Pilot Forestry and Watershed Management Project -Loan 3487, where the economic value of labor was taken at
50 percent of financial value. However, the lower figure was used to account for the prevalence of unemployment in the
project area. Product prices were adjusted to reflect farmgate prices by allocating a 25 percent marketing allowance,
except for cereals and grapes which are purchased at contractual prices by public enterprises. On tradables, the
conversion rates for economic evaluation reflect inland transportation costs, customs duties and taxes. However, most of
these tradables will actually be supplied by contractors and are not expected to be imported for the Project.
Another critical assumption pertains to the value of water, which is highly subsidized, especially for irrigation.
The financial value of water was assumed to be the marginal financial cost of water as estimated by the ANRH according
to the information obtained by the consultant. As a conservative estimate, it was assumed that the economic cost of water
would be 50 percent above this financial cost.
Assumptions on economic values are given in the following table:
Financial value      Conversion rate        Economic value
Labor                              100                  30 %                    30

Agricultural inputs                100                  70 %                    70

Machinery work                     100                  70 %                    70
W.ater                             l00                  150 %                   lS0
The benefits of the Project taken into consideration in economic evaluation are as follows:
a.     For erosion control measures: (i) the modest amount of wood production as these are not expected to be
productive forestry activities but defensive environmental measures; and (ii) for areas that have reservoirs downstream,
increased water accumulation in dams due to reduced siltation; it was assumed that the interventions would lead to a gradual
reduction of the rate of dam-specific siltation to 50 percent of actual levels. In the case of one dam, which was already 67
percent silted, project interventions would not have any effect. Benefits of erosion control activities related to improved land
and air quality were not taken into consideration due to lack of information. Given the incremental nature of the
interventions, during the three years of the Project and according to annual programs for project activities, O&M costs for
erosion control measures would be shared between Bank financing and the Govemment, subsequently, all O&M costs for
erosion control measures would be assumed by the Government.
b.     Agricultural development measures: only the private net benefits of destoning, fruit and grape production
activities were considered, excluding the environmental benefits of replacing annual cultivation in terms of reduced erosion.
With destoning, it was assumed that the land would be devoted to tree crops. To encourage participation in project activities
in destoning, fruit trees and grapevines, considering the environmental externalities of the activities and the pervasive
poverty in the project area, beneficiaries would pay 50 percent of ordinary labor costs in kind or in financial terms. All
subsequent O&M expenditures for these investments would be the responsibility of the beneficiaries. Investments in rural
roads and their rehabilitation would require prior technical studies including an environmental impact assessment subject to
Bank approval.

c.     Water resource mobilization: with an average capacity assumption of 500,000m3, hill ponds were assessed
in terms of irrigation potential over 50 ha of land and environmental benefits related to reduced runoff and increased
recharge were not included. The benefits of water resource mobilization investments on health, quality of life, water for
livestock, etc., were not assessed due to lack of information. It was assumed that the water would be used for high value crop
production and potatoes were used as example. Water resource mobilization investments would be subject to prior Bank
approval of: (i) technical studies including an environmental impact assessment; and (ii) the establishment of Water Users
Associations (WUA) for each water infrastructure; the Government would lease the water infrastructure to the WUA
through a long term management contract for a symbolic fee; the charter of the WUA would state explicitly the cost sharing
elements for O&M as well as the arrangements for paying the customary water charges.
The Project would finance mainly and mostly local costs. The strategic justification for this option is that the CAS
has identified employment as a priority issue and this would require labor-intensive activities which would essentially entail
local costs. All taxes and customs duties will be assumed by the Government.
The main risk that the Project faces arises from the existing conditions in Algeria. This risk would not affect the
parameters of economic evaluation per se but would have an effect on specific project activities being carried out. As this
risk is hard to quantify, the economic evaluation of the Project was not subjected to sensitivity analysis.

Rural Employment Project (DZ-43724)
Employment Creation Effectiveness
The objective of the Project is to create employment. The choice of instruments in the Project thus emphasizes a
high degree of labor-intensity to address the problem of unemployment and poverty. The thrust of the activities are in the
erosion control and agricultural development components which have a high degree of labor intensity. The preliminary
assessment of the investment activities was based on the following: (i) wages are based on four categories of wages
observed in the project area and additional social charges amount to 30.5 percent of wages; (ii) profit margins of 25
percent are maintained for all investment and maintenance activities; (iii) VAT of 13 percent (Government contribution)
is also maintained for all investment and maintenance activities; and (iv) 240 days a year were taken as the standard for
annual employment. Based on this preliminary assessment, the proposed activities would be expected to create around
40,000 person-years of direct employment during the three years of the Project.
All contracts will be competitive and the only restriction will be in technical specifications which will require
labor-intensive techniques. Hence, the contractor will determine wages according to market mechanisms, within
minimum wage regulations. As these contracts will entail legal obligations between the Government and the contractor,
the overhead costs of social charges, profit margins and VAT can not be avoided, even though they will increase unit
costs significantly. Of course, the profit margin is maintained to encourage competitive market activities and avoid force
account.
The effectiveness of the interventions in employment creation was assessed based on a high percent of total cost
allocated to labor and, conversely, low cost/day of labor as indicated in the following table (which excludes
contingencies). Overall, including social charges, profit margins and VAT, labor costs average 55 percent of investment
costs and vary from 16 - 71 percent. The investments with lower labor costs as percentage of total costs are those that are
indicated to be of priority by the population in the project zone (especially water resource mobilization) and some of the
interventions on private lands which would provide incentives for the overall project activities while having
environmental externalities; their overall share in investment costs are 7 percent.
