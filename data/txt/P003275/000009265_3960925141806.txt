PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ZIMBABWE
FIRST HIGHWAY PROJECT
(LOAN 2Z82-ZIM)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the First Highway
Project in Zimbabwe, for which Loan 2282-ZIM in the amount of US$26.4 million
was approved on May 17, 1983. Cofinanciers of the project were Arab Bank for
Economic Development in Africa (US$9,590,000), Swedish International
Development Agency and Government of Italy (US$3,297,000), Danish
International Development Agency (US$630,000) and the Government of Zimbabwe
(US$20,861,000). The World Bank loan was closed on April 10, 1989, about two
years behind schedule. A total of US$6,887,550.68 of this loan was canceled.
The last disbursement was made on April 10, 1989.
The PCR was prepared by the Infrastructure Operations Division of
the Southern Africa Department (Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III)
and the Borrower (Part II).
Preparation of this PCR was started subsequent to th6 Bank's final
supervision mission of the project in June 1988, and is based, inter alia, on
the Staff Appraisal Report; the Loan Agreement; supervision reports; project
progress reports of the Ministry of Transport; correspondence between the Bank
and the Borrower; and internal Bank memoranda.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ZIMBAB^WE
FIRST HIGHWAY PROJECT
(LOAN 2282-ZDM)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Obiectives
The principal objectives of the First Highway Project were to
strengthen the main road network ud provide better road links between certain
long neglected commuual areas acd the more economically developed centers of
the country, thus stimulating development In those less accessible areas
(para 4). Specifically, the project aimed at upgrading the priority main road
section between Pamushana and Birchenough Bridge (88 km), strengthening the
Birchenough Bridge, constructLng three roads (215 km) serving camunal areas
and assisting in the improvement of national transport coordination and
planning (para 5).
Implementation Experience
The loan became effective on September 2f, i;3 (para 11).  By
that time, bids for the initial phase of construction had ilready been
received end thus the first contracts were awarded soon after loan
effectiveness. Nevertheless, the project was not ctupleted until January
1989, 27 months after the scheduled time in the Loan Agreement.  The principal
reason for the delay was that, during implementation, the scope of the civil
works on three roads was expanded to include construction of base and
bituminous surfacing (para 12). The principal procurement action under the
project was contractor services for civil works under international
competitive bidding; in general, procurement action for both contractor
services and consultant services proceeded satisfactorily and followed Bank
guidelines (paras 14-13). Studies and detailed engineering financed by
bilateral agencies were carried out by consultants satisfactorily and the Bank
had ample opportunity to review terms of reference and consultant repurts
during implementation (para 16). The actual cost of the project is about
US$53.9 million, approximately 24Z lower than the appraisal cost estimate
(para 17). This lower cost is axplained by savings realized from the sharp
devaluation of the Zimbabwe dollar during implementation. Disbursements were
slow, as compared with the targets set at appraisal, largely because of the
devaluation (paras 18-19). At the time of closing, disbursements totalled
about US$19.5 million; about US$6.9 million of the US$26.4 million loan was
canceled. Cofinanciers (BADEA, SIDA, DANIDA and the Government of ttaly)
accounted for about US$13.5 million of project financing and the Government of
Zimbabwe for about US$20.9 million.

Results
Overall, the project was successful in meeting its principal
objectives of upgrading a section of the main road net r'k and contribut.lng to
national economic integration by improving road links to communal areas
(para 21); the project also assisted in the improvement of national transport
coordination and planning. The original targets for civil works were exceeded
as three of the project roads, originally to be built to gravel standards,
were provided with bituminous surfacing when it appeared that the actual
traffic after opening the gravel roads, justified the higher standards
(para 22). On reevaluation (para 23), the Ndanga-Triangle, Chivhu-Lothian and
Range-Mharadzano roads had ERRs of 24Z, 372 and 402, respectively, compared
with appraisal estimates of 15?, 13? and 132, respectively. The estimated ERR
at the time of appraisal for the Pamushona-Birchenough Bridge Road was 21? but
since the actual traffic has been much lower than anticipated, the return now
appears to be 12?. For the Birchenough Bridge improvement, an ERR of 42? was
found at appraisal and 34Z on reevaluation. The ERR for the project as a
whole, estimated at 18? at appraisal, is satisfactory at 25?.
Sustainability
The benefits from the project are likely to be sustained during
the economic life of the various road improvements provided the Ministry of
Transport (MOT) adequately maintains these facilities (para 25). The
principal risk to sustainability of benefits is that future road maintenance
budgets may not be adequate. To underscore the need for adequate maintenance
budgets for sustainability of project benefits, a seminar on road maintenance
was he)d in Harare end Hay/early June, 1989 at which the Minister of Transport
and senior officials of MOT and the Ministry of Finance, Economic Planning and
Development participated.
Findings and Lessons Learned
Bank performance on the project has been satisfactory (para 26).
Borrower compliance with covenants in the Loan Agreement was generally
satisfactory (para 27). At times, the Borrower was not in cotipliance with
certain covenants but subsequently corrected the problems (para 28). Frequent
changes in MOT staff hindered the ability of the ministry to carry out the
project effectively (para 30). As to the National Transport Study, the
Government has not been sufficiently aggressive in implementing study
recommendations (para 31). One of the lessons learned in the project is that
the means of achieving appropriate levels of hire rates for vehicles and
equipment rented to the Ministry of Transport (and others) by another ministry
should be dealt with in a non-transport project of suitable scope to allow for
resolving underlying problems affecting those hire rates (para 27).

Sector                                s Transport
B.    Background
1.          The highway network of Zimbabwe totals about 86,000 km of which
about 15Z is paved, 55Z gravelled and 301 earth roads and tracks. Those
designated as "state roads". about one-fifth of the total, connect the
provincial ancl district centers and provide international links; these roads
are administered by the MOT. This ministry is responsible for planning,
building and maintaining the state road network. Equipment and vehicles
needed by MOT to carry out its functions are rented to the Ministry by the
CMED of the Ministry of National Supplies.
2.          The Bank's involvement in the sector began in 1981 with the
US$42 million Transportation Rehabilitation Program Loan to provide foreign
exchange for railway spare parts, equipment and technical assistance as well
as road maintenance equipment, vehicles and spare parts.
3.          In 1981, the Government established the sectoral objectives of
strengthening the main road network and providing better road links between
communal lands and the more economically developed centers of the country as a
means of facilitating overall economic integration of regions and particularly
to stimulate development in the communal areas that had long been neglected,
especially during the independence struggle.
C.    Project Objectives and Description
4.          Project Oblectives.  The First Highway Project was conceived aR a
means of furthering the sectoral objectives both through high-priority road
construction and through strengthening the road planning function in
Government. Moreover, the project was viewed as an essential step in the
implementation of the National Development Plan. The specific objectives of
the project were tot
(a)   upgrade priority sections of the basic road network,
construction of which had been deferred because of the
independence struggle;
(b)   extend the basic road network into the communal lands:



-2-
(c)   asslit in the planning of development and maintenance
of feeder roads In the communal lands; and
(d)   Improve transport coordination and planning.
S.          Pro3ect Description.  the project provided fort
(a)   constrursion of the Pamushana-Birchenough Bridge Road
(88km) to two-lane bituminous standard;
(b) widening and strengthening of Blirchenough Bridges
(c) implementation of a three-year program to construct
the following state roads in communal lands to all-
weather gravel standard;
(i)   Chivhu-Lothian Road (132km)
(ii)   Ndanga-Triangle Road (100 km)
(iii)   Range-Hharadzano Road (83 km)
(d)   procurement of training aids and equipment for the MOT
Roads Training Center; and
(e)   consulting services for:
(i)    construction supervision of (a), (b) and
,c) above;
(ii)    detailed engineering of 172 km of roads in
(c) above;
(iii)    a national transport study;
(iv)    a national feeder road study; and
(v)    feasibility studies and detailed
engineering of about 400 km of state
roads.
D.    Project Design and Organization
6.          Construction and maintenance of the Zimbabwe road system had been
badly neglected during the war period which ended in 1980. It was thus timely
in the early 19808 cO undertake the First Highway Project and begin to
overcome some of the road limitations. Inclusion of road construction on
routes serving selected communal areas was also appropriate given the national
objective of redressing the neglect of such areas. It was recognized that a
very large undertaking would be required over a long period of time to meet
the overall needs in this fie'd but the First Highway Project represented a
beginning with a scale of civil works that was reasonable given the
institutional limitations of MOT and the shortages of local financial
resources.
7.          A sufficient amount of project preparation was accomplished prior
to project appraisal to permit a moderate amount of civil works to begin as
Phase I; during the course of this construction, preparation proceeded on the
second phase of civil works. This feature of the project proved satisfactory.



-3-
8.          The project design was changed te some extent during the course of
project implementation, the change being in the cesign standards of the three
roade which, originally, were to be built to gravel standards. Upon opening
of thq first road sections, it was found that the traffic levels were
signitA.-ntly higher than had been anticipated at appraisal.  Accordingly, the
Borrower requested and the Bank agreed to change the design standards of the
three roads to include a single seal bituminous su=facing. A formal agreement
was reached permitting financing under the project of the additional base
construction and surfacing by contractors.
9.          The inclusion of the National Feeder Road Study in the project was
probably premature given the unsettled nature of fundamental institutional
change. Although the study itself was, inter alia, to analyze institutional
problems concerning feeder road administration and make recommendations for
changes, the parliament at that time had not yet resolved major political
issues on governmental organization involving District Councils and Rural
Councils. Thus the study was undertaken before basic sLructural
reorganization had been achieved and this was a handicap for those conducting
the study.
10.         The HOT (at the time of project approval it was called the
Ministry of Roads and Road Traffic, Posts and Telecommunications) was the
executing agency for the project and this was an appropriate arrangement.
Despite severe problems of personnel shortages at the technical and
administrative level during project implementation, the function of project
execution was carried out more or less as planned although it changed to some
extent when the scope of the project was expanded to include bituminous
surfacing of certain roads.
3.    Prc4ect Implementation
11.         Loan Effectiveness and Project Start-up:  Although Loan 2282-ZIM
was approved on Hay 17, 1983, the Loan Agreement was not signed until August
8, 1983. The long delay in signing the document was caused by confusion
within thu Zimbabwe Government in authorizing an official to sign on behalf of
the Government. The loan became effective on September 29, 1983.
12.         The principal reason for the delay in effectiveness, as compared
with the December 1982 target date established at the time of appraisal, was
that, following appraisal, the Bank required the government to obtain bids for
civil works contracts prior to Board Presentation. The reason for this
requirement was that there was then very little recent experience with civil
works contracting in Zimbabwe and thus much uncertainty as to the appraisal
cost estimates. Although the Government proceeded to invite bids with
reasonable dispatch, the interested construction firms required relatively
long periods of time to prepare their bids because of lack of familiarity with
Zimbabwe.
13.         Implementation Schedule: According to the Loan Agreement, the
project was scheduled to be completed by September 30, 1986, but the project
was not completed until January 1989. The main reasons for the delays weret
(a)   scope of the civil works on three roads was expanded
to include construction of base and single seal
bituminous surfacing;



-4-
(b)   contractor on the Pamushana-Birchenough Bridge Road
Was slow in mobilizing for construction;
(c)   lengthy negotiations between DANIDA and Government
concerning the financing of the Naticnal Feeder Road
Study caused ine year delay in the study completion;
As to point (a) above, (1) an economic reevaluation showed that it was
feasible to add to the nroject the base and bituminous surfacing and (2)
sufficient funds were available 1, the project to finance this extension;
therefore the additional time required to complete the project with the
expanded scope was warranted. Concerning the Pamushmna-Birchenough Bridge
Road, the 7 months delay in completion of civil works could have been avoided
had the contractor mobilized more promptly an' adequate'y: the problem
occurred despite considerable pressure on the contractor by Government
officials, supervising consultants and the Bank. As to the lengthy period of
time for negotiations between Goverament and DANIDA, it is difficult to say
how the period could have been reduced.
14.         Procurement: The principal procurement under the project was
contractor services for civil works under international competitive bidding
and of consulting services under competitive technical proposals. Invitation
of bids and evaluation of bids for initial works were accomplishid before
Board approval of the loan, as indicated in para. 12 above. The main reasons
for delays in procurement have also been discussed (para. 12). In general,
procurement action proceeded satisfactorily and followed Bank guidelines.
15.         The Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa (BADRA) extended
a US$10 million loan to the Government of Zimbabwe to finance a portion of the
project. BAD7AR financed the Ndanga-Triangle Road (including bituminous
surfacing) and the widening and strengthening of the Birchenough bridge; the
agency also financed about 27Z of the foreign costs of the construction of the
Pamushana-Birchenough Bridge Road, wit the Bank financing the remaining 73Z
of foreign costs. Procurement action fo. these civil works was satisfactory.
16.         Procurement of consultant services for studies and detailed
engineering financed by bilateral sources was carried out satisfactorily. The
Bank had ample opportunity to review consultant terus of reference, study
proposals and consultant reports during pr-ject implementation.
17.         Project Costs:  The estimated cost of the First Highway Project at
appraisal was about US$70.60 million. The final cost is about US$53.89
million, as shown in Table 5A in Part III. This reduction in total project
costs was realized despite some increase in the scope of the project. The
US$16.71 million (242) reduction in total project costs is due to the
substantial devaluation of the Zimbabwe dollar, from US$1.09 at the time of
appraisal to US$0.5892 at the beginning of 1988; the weighted average value of
the Zimbabwe dollar for all World Bank disbursements was US$0.6632. Since the
contracts for civil works were in terms of Zimbabwe dollars and were '4.gned
early in the project implementation period, the Government realized large
reductions in project costs when it later made payments to the contractors
with greatly devalued local currency. With the devaluation, much larger
amounts of Zimbabwe dollars were available from the World Bank under the loan
which was denominated in terms of US dollars. Inasmuch as the project cost
was much reduced, the amount of financing required was also reduced.



Accordingly, the Bank cancelled US$6.9 million of the US$26.4 million project
loan.
18.         Disbursements:  Another major variance in project implementation
was the slow rate of disbursements as compared with the targets established at
appraisal. At the end of FY84, actual disbursements were only 62Z of the
planned level. The percentages were even lower in the two subsequent fiscal
years but improved somewhat in FY87. At the time of closing, disbursements
totalled US$19.5 million or 74Z of the original loan amount of US$26.4
million.
l9.         The principal reason for the shortfall of actual disbursements was
that the Zimbabwe dollar was devalued substantially during project
implementation. As indicated above, considerable project cost savings were
realized and disbursements were reduced accordingly. At Government's request,
a total of US$5.5 million of the loan was cancelled on July 1, 1988 and an
additional US$1.4 million was cancelled on April 10, 1989 when the loan was
closed.
20.         Loan Allocatio:.:  The original allocations and actual
disbursements for Loan 2282-ZIM are shown in Table 5, Part III. The table
also shows the final disbursements of funds by cofinanciers.
F.    Project Results
21.         Project Objectives:  Overall, the project was successful in
meeting its principal objectives of upgrading a main road and assisting
through road improvements in the integration of the communal lands into the
modern economy of Zimbabwe. In addition, the project contributed to better
national planning and coordination of transport through basic studies which
provided practical recommendations for improving these important governmental
functions.
22.         Physical Results:  The project improved four roads totalling about
300 kms and widened and strengthened the Birchenough Bridge. In fact, the
original targets for civil works were exceeded, as three of the project roads,
originally to be built to gravel standards, were provided with bituminous
surfacing when it appeared that the actual traffic, after opening the gravel
roads, justified the higher standards.
23.         Economic Rate of Returns  Recent data on traffic levels for use in
reevaluating the economic benefits of the road and bridge components of the
project were made available in March and May 1990. At appraisal, the
Pamushana-Birchenough Bridge Road had a relatively high ERR of 212; because
of much lower traffic than projected on this Route (only about 602; see Table
6A), the ERR on reevaluation is 122. The three project roads originally to be
built to gravel standards had appraisal ERRs of 132 to 152.  In Augues  1984,
less than a year after loan effectiveness, an economic evaluatiun was
undertaken to ascertain whether bituminous surfacing of the Range-Mharadzano
Road was justified; the added investment was found to have an FRR of 19? and
on this basis all three roads were provided a bituminous surfacing. On
reevaluation, the Range-Mharadzano Road was found to have a 402 ERR and the
ERRs for the Ndanga-Triangle and Chivhu-Lothian roads were found to be 24? and
37Z, respectively. The Birchenough Bridge improvement had an ERR of 42? at



- 6 -
appraisal and 34Z on reevaluation. Taking into consideration these data, the
information at hand indicates that the overall ERR for the First Highway
Project, which was estimated at 18Z at appraisal, is satisfactory at 25S.
24.         Impact of the Prolectt The project has improved the access of
communal area population to the main road network and thereby facilitated
trade and communications. As a result, the roads are beginning to stimulate
general development in the communal areas.
G.    Prolect Sustainability
25.         The benefits from the project, in terms of savings in vehicle
operating costs and general stimulation of development, are likely to be
sustained during the economic life of the various road and bridge
improvements, provided the MOT maintains these facilities in an appropriate
and timely manner. The principal risk to sustainability of benefits is that
future road maintenance budgets may not be adequate to provide the level of
maintenance required; it is significant, however, that the provision of
adequate funds for road maintenance was a condition of the 01-hwar II loan and
that the Government has complied with this provision. Anothe. risk is that
MOT staff limitations may prevent adequate maintenance of the roads. In
Hay/June 1989, the Bank held a seminar in Harare on the linkages between
adequate funding and human resource development for road maintenance and
sustainability of project investments; the seminar was attended by the
Minister of Transport, and senior officLals of MOT and Ministry of Finance,
Economic Planning and Development.
H.    Bank Performance
26.         Through the First Righway Project, the Bank made a contribution to
the physical and institutional development of the transport sector. Bank
performance has been satisfactory.
I.    Borrower Performance
27.         Table 7 of Part III contains a review of performance of the
borrower with regard to special covenants in the Loan Agreement. Compliance
with the covenants was generally satisfactory. A problem arose, however,
under Section 4.04 of the Loan Agreement, relating to the adjustment from time
to time of equipment and vehicle hire rates charged to MOT (formerly MRRT).
Although a substantial 32S increase in such rates was made effective on July
1, 1983, no further adjustment was made until March 1987 notwithstanding a
trend of significant price increases for such items following 1983. The
Government holds the view that it is less costly to maintain equipment by
force account than by contract but it fails to chnrge hire rates that reflect
real costs. Since the vehicles and equipment are made available, at hire
rates, by the CMED of the Ministry of National Supplies, the problem of
achieving appropriate levels of hire rates should be dealt with, not in a
highway project, but in some other development program in which the underlying
problems affecting the hire rates of CMED can be analyzed and resolved; this
is an important lesson learned in the project. While a highway project is not
the best type of project through which to secure economic hire rates at CMED,
the Highwsy II project nevertheless included a condition similar to that in
Highway I because of the lack of other timely means of accomplishing the



objective and the urgent need for increases in hire rates to reflect economic
costs.
28.         For a time In 1984, the Borrower was uot in compliance with the
requirement that the Range-)haradsano Road be built In conformity with the
agreed gravel standards; the Government had proceeded to add a bituminous
surfacing. This addition was discovered by a Bank supervision mission in May
1984 and the Borrower then sought agreement of the Bank that all three of the
roads, originally planned as gravel roads, be given bituminous surfacing.  As
previously noted, this change was formally agreed to in May 1986.
29.         In some cases, regular road maintenance by NOT was inadequate on
project roads following the completion of both construction and contractor
maintenance. nother concern of the Bank was the reduction at times of the
overall Government budget for road maintenance to levels that did not allow
adequate maintenance of the road system.
30.         Frequent changes in MOT staff hindered the ability of the ministry
to carry out the project efficiently.  The Government's request for extension
of the closing date of the loan from 12131188 to 3/31189 was based in part on
staffing problems in MOT.
31.         The Borrower appeared to have a high regard for the National
Transport Study and was supportive of its recommendations. The follow-up in
terms of implementation of recommendations, however, has been disappointing.
HOT seems not to have pressed the Parliament for adoption of report
recoendations.
J.   Proiect Relationship
32.         Bank's relationships with Government, cofinanciers, consultants,
and contractors on the project were good.
K.   Consultina Services
33.         The performance of the various consultants in the project was
generally satisfactory.
L.   Project Documentation and Data
34.         The Loan Agreement for Loan 2282-ZDM was appropriate for achieving
the objectives of the project. The staff appraisal report of the project
provided a useful framework for the Bank, BADEA and the Government to monitor
project Implementation.



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ZIMBABWE
FIRST HIGHWAY PROJECT
(LOAN 2282-ZIM)
PART II. PROJECT REVIEW FROM THE BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
A.    Introduction
35.         The First Highway Project was initiated soon after Zimbabwe's
Independence in 1980, and started with the appraisal of roads comprising the
project in 1982. The project was jointly funded by the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (IBRD - The World Bank), BADEA, and the
Government of Zimbabwe.
36.         The project originated from the Zimbabwe Government's broad
objective of integrating the communal lands into the country's economy through
various rural development programs in previously neglected areas. The
provision of adequate transport facilities was important in the rural
development program, and the first step was to construct engineered roads of
an appropriate standard to and from communal areas.
37.         The design of the roads comprising the First Highway Project were
done partly by consultants and partly by the MOT. One consulting firm
designed part of the Chivhu-Gutu-Lothian road, another designed the Lothian-
Triangle road, a thtrd designed part of the Masvingo-Birchenough road, and a
fourth designed the Chivhu-Buhera road. The project was commenceC in 1983,
and completed in early 1989. Road construction work was effected by various
local and international contractors, and supervised by consulting engineers.
B.    Pro3ect Obiectives and Description
38.         The objectives of the project, as given in the Staff Appraisal
Report No. 3961-ZIM of April 1983 were tot
(a)   upgrade priority sections of the basic road network which
had been deferred because of the independence struggle;
(b)   extend the basic road network into the communal lands;
(c)   assist in the planning of Jevelopment and maintenance of
feeder roads in the communal lands; and
(d)   improve transport coordination and planning.
39.         The project comprised the following activitiest
(a)   construction of the Birchenough Bridge-Hasvingo road,
sect4.on 125 to 220 km, to two-lane bituminous standard;
(b)   strengthening and widening of Birchenough Bridge;



- 9 -
(c)   implementation of a three-year programme to construct the
following state roads in couounal lands to all weather-
gravel standards
1)    Chivhu-Lothian (132 Km)
ii)   Ndanga-Triangle (100 Xm)
iii) Range-Mharadmano (83 Km)
(d)   procurement of training aids and equipment for the HOT's
Roads Training Center; and
te)   consulting services fort
i)    construction supervision of (a), (b) and (c) above;
ii)   detailed engineering design of 172 km of roads in
(c) above;
iii) a national transport study;
iv)   feasibility studies and detailed engineering design of
about 400 km of state roads.
40.         The Pamushana-Birchenough Bridge road is part of the Mutare-
Masvingo road (route 409). A 95 km section was the only portion of the road
that was constructed initially (in the 19309) as a two lane earth or gravel
road and la'.er reconstructed as a single mat road (that is, a single lane of
pavement wss added in the center of the road); it generally followed the
existing ground line with little or no earthworks having been carried out.
The resulting alignment was both winding and hilly with poor geometrics making
it a considerable hazard to traffic. The road forms part of an important link
in the domestic and regional main road network in linking the major economic
centers of Harare, Bulawayo, Gweru, Mutare with Masvingo. The route provides
the shortest link between Bulawayo and Masvingo by at least 125 Km and a 258
Km for Mutare-Masvingo traffic than via Harare. The road is locally important
for it is the only main road in the area from which the most important
irrigation establishments in the south eastern part of the country are linked
with other economic centers of the country. Such irrigation schemes are at
Chiredzi, Triangle and Mkwasine. At Birchenough Bridge there is also an
irrigation scheme on which over 300 plotholders make a living.  The main crops
grown in the area are maize, wheat, soya beans, sugar and cotton. The road is
also important in the tourist industry in that it provides a direct link
between Lake Kyle, Great Zimbabwe and the Eastern Highlands via Birchenough
Bridge which is also a tourist attraction. (Reference: Prefeasibility Study
Fort Victoria-Birchenough Bridge, March 1981.)
41.         In the regional context the Range-Mharadzano road provides a more
direct link to the capital, Harare, from Melsetter, Chipinga and Middle Sabi
Irrigation area. The road also provides a good infrastructure for the local
population to the growth points at Mharadzano and Birchenough Bridge. The
road traverses through Natural Regions III, IV and V. These regions are
characterized by low rainfall that ranges from 450 mm to 800 mm with



- 10 -
infrequent heavy falls and at times dry spells during the rain season. The
temperatures are very high ranging from 25 to 35 degrees Celsius. The main
economic activity in the area of influence is subsistence agriculture. The
main crops that are grown are maize, sorghum and groundnuts. The highest
development scheme in the area is the Sabi Valley Development Scheme which has
high fertile soils which have to be developed to their highest potential. The
adjacent areas of Chipinga and Melsetter are already producing good yields of
tea, coffee and timber. The road will therefore act as a good communication
link between the highly populated immed'ate area of influence to the Sabi
Irrigation Scheme and the Chipinga-Melsetter area, a major attraction to labor
and a large generator of traffic. The population in the Buhera-Mharadzano
area is about 200,000. (References Prefeasibility Study Enkeldoorn-Buhera-
Birchenough road, March 1981.)
42.         At the northern and southemn ends of the Chivhu-Gutu-Lothian-
Triangle road are livestock farming areas and between are densely populated
areas of arable farming in the Gutu, Chikwenda and Ndanga districts. About
300,000 people live within 25 kilometers of the road line of whom 130,000 are
in the northern section. The road is the only road route through these
districts that is used for the delivery of agriculture inputs such as
fertilizers and seeds and for the extraction of crops for harvest. The main
crops that are grown are maize, sorghum, cotton and groundnuts. The road also
provides a good infrastructure to the growth points of Gutu and Jerera at
which there are the main administrative, agricultural, health and educational
services. (References Prefeasibility Report Enkeldoorn-Ndanga-Zaka-Triangle
Road, March 1981.)
C.    Project implementation
43.         Appendix A gives a chart indicating the project implementation
schedule. All components of the project started some two or three months
after the planned or original commencement dates, and were completed some
months after the original completion dates. It is considered, however, that
the delays that occurred were not serious, and really the project ran
reasonably well on schedule.
44.         Generally the project ran smoothly, and there were no major
problems. The supervising staff, consisting of the HOT officials and
consulting engineers engaged on the projects, administered the constructicn of
the projects well. For contract details, see Appendix 1.
45.         However, there have been long delays in the final clearing works
on some of the projects, resulting in extensions of the deadlines for
disbursement applications firstly from 30th June 1988 to 31st December 1988,
and secondly to 31st March 1989.
46.         Also, there were some erosion problems on the Lothian-Zaka-
Triangle (77-132) project. Initial construction was to gravel wearing course
standard. The road was left without adequate protection measures when the
decision to upgrade it to a bitumen-surfaced road was made. The second
contractor who was awarded the Base and Surfacing Contract, could only start
work in September 1987, six months after the previous contractor had moved
off-site. During the rainy season of December 1987 to February 1988 there
were a number of cases of road erosion damage. The change in both contractors



- 11 -
*nd consultants led to rather poorly organized lack of continuity in project
execution and control.
47.         All the roads comprising the First Highway Project are being
maintained by the MOT's maintenance organization and there have not been any
major problems apart from routine maintenance requirements. Although no
maintenance statistics can be produced for these roads, it is evident that the
frequency and duration of maintenance activities on these roads, and hence
costs, have reduced considerably.
48.         The National Transport Study by a Swedish consulting company and
National Feeder Road Study by a Danish consulting company were carried out
well and the resulting studies were generally acceptable to the MOT.
49.         Most of the roads-related recommendations of the National
Transport Study have already been adopted and have been implemented. The
Department of State Roads has also come up with further policy decisions
besides those from NTS which are being implemented. However, the Study has
not yet been officially adopted because of some technical problems.
50.         The National Feeder Road Study has regrettably not yet been
implemented because of some problems with recommendations particularly those
related to the institutional management of Feeder Roads. However, the
economic analysis carried out on the selected feeder roads has been found
sound and the Department of State Roads has three of those roads on its
1990/91 Public Sector Investment Programme.
51.         Following on from some of the discussion in the National Feeder
Road Study, the HOT has decided to embark on a labor-based pilot project
involving the construction, and maintenance, of three rural feeder roads by
labor-based methods. DANIDA has been approached for assistance, and project
appraisal is taking place, with project implementation scheduled for 1990/91.
52.         The final project costs (Appendix 3), at 2$ 75.33m, are some 15Z
higher than initial estimates of 2$ 64.87m. Such a small increase in costs
over some 5 years of project implementation period indicates that initial
estimates were very high and very conservative. Also, and very important, is
the fact that the Zimbabwe Dollar has been devalued considerably against the
American Dollar, leading to a lot less expenditure of foreign currency than
originally expected. This is clearly illustrated by the significant World
Bank savings of some Z$ 5.5m which has already been cancelled by the Bank.
Loan savings are also expected in the BADEA loan when final figures are known.
53.         Original estimates of project costs were Z$ 65m.  The financing of
all the foreign exchange cost, estimated at Z$ 35m (equivalent to US$ 38m),
was shared among the World Bank, BADEA and the Government of Zimbabwe as
follows:



- 12 -
$USm
World Bank               26.4
BADEA                    10.0
Government                1.6
Total                    38.0
54.         A lot of information on periodic (monthly) and cumulative
disbursement payments was, and still is, not readily available at this time to
get an accurate report on World Bank and BADEA payments, and the records
within the MOT are not up-to-date. This has been partly due to changes in
staff dealing with the administration of the project, and partly due to
inadequate information systems within the Ministry. As a result of this,
final figures of contributions by the World Bank, BADEA and Government were
not available at the time of writing this report. (See Part III of the PCR
for complete data on financing of project.)
D.    Project Results
55.         The economic analysis detailed in Appendix 4 indicates that the
First Highway Project was a worthwhile project. The economic rates of return
and benefit-cost-ratios are favorable. The bulk of the benefits are due to
savings in vehicle operating costs, resulting from upgrading of the roads from
gravel to bituminous-surfaced roads, and reduced maintenance costs.
56.         The First Highway Project will undoubtedly enhance economic
development of the areas it serves, particularly Gutu growth point which has
already a lot of business activity, and Zaka business center.
57.         Other significant benefits include soci2l benefits - accessibility
of the rural population to facilities like schools, district centers and
cities. These benefits have not been quantified, and have not been considered
in the economic analysis. However, the positive social impact of surfaced
roads is evident from increased and generated traffic to the business centers
and areas served by these roads. Also, in many areas where surfaced roads
have been provided through the First Highway Project, the levels of rural bus
services have visibly increased.
E.    Conclusions
58.         From the increased traffic and improved rural bus operations in
the areas served by the First Highway Project, it is evident that the project
has been successful, and has achieved one of its objectives to extend the
basic road network into communal lands.
59.         The recommendations of the National Transport Study and the
National Feeder Road Study have been considered, but have not been formally
accepted by Government four yeare after the completion of the studies. This,
to some extent, has been a failure since the studies have identified some
significant issues in the national transport administration. Nevertheless,



- 13 _
most roads-related recommendations of the National Transport Study have been
implemented in practice.
60.         It is considered that on the whole, however, the First Highway
Project has been a successful project. The MOT on behalf of the Government of
Zimbabwe is grateful to the World Bank and to BADEA for their assistance.

APPENDIX 4
ECONOMIC RE-EVALUATION
General Approach
Introduction
1.01        The economic analysis is based on savings in vehicle operating
costs. Other benefits which are difficult to quantify, e.g. social benefits,
etc., have not been included. However, all major pre-investment studies
undertaken in Zimbabwe before 1985 arrived at somewhat different estimates of
road user costs. Further, vehicle classification used was also different from
that used in National Transport Study (Final Report 1985) - the basis of all
VoC Estimates used in this report. Another major difference is that time
savings for passengers were not considered in these reports. Also the traffic
growth rates used tended to be high, 7-10 being based on the First
Transitional Development Plan which forecast the GDP to grow at 82 per year.
Thus, differences in the absolute size of the IRR values, calculated with road
user costs according to different methods, can be expected. Comparison of the
IRR must be done carefully, with these differences in mind.
Basic Economic Parameters Used
1.02        Price Levels  July 1988 Prices.  Price Indices Useds  The
following inflation factors are used for converting current prices to 1988
pricess
1983        1.664
1984        1.476
1985        1.330
1986        1.161
1987        1.040
1988        1.000
A sensitivity analysis was carried out assuming a higher inflation rate of 152
per annum.
1.03        Shadow Pricing for Labor and Foreign Exchange.  The following
shadow pricing factors have been used (NTS):
0.5 for unskilled labor
1.0 for semi-skilled labor
1.5 for skilled labor
1.5 for foreign exchange
1.04        Discount Rate of 6Z.  In calculations of present value and of
annualized capital costs, a real discount rate of 62 per annum is used (NTS).
1.05        Economic Life of Road.  The remaining economic life of each
project is taken to be twenty years - these projects have already been
implemented. The cash flows for costs have already occurred and may thus be
considered to be sunk cost. However, on the basis that for all these
projects, the operational life of the road is still in the future, an



- 18 -
assumption is made that each of these projects represents an improvement
proposal to the required standard - but with costs that are definite rather
than estimates, this assumption being necessary for the economic
re-evaluation of these projects. Ideally the economic analysis should be done
using the year each road was opened to traffic as a base year for discounting
costs and benefits. The important fact, however, is that all costs and
benefits must be reduced to the same base year.
1.06        Prolect Cc;ta.  All costs have been adjusted to July 1988 prices,
the base year assumed for discounting of costs and benefits. Appendix 3
summarizes the cost estimates and underlying assumptions used.
Results of Economic Evaluation
1.07        All resultant economic indicators and detailed economic analysis
are shown below.
Conclusion
1.08        The results above indicate that all these projects were worthwhile
in the first place, despite the over-optimistic traffic growth rates.

Chivhu-Gutu-Lothian-Triangle Corridor
Project Description
2.01        This project is divided into two sections as follows:
(a)   Route 346:  Chivhu-Gutu-Lothian, sub-divided into the
following sub-sections:
i)    Km 0-52;  Lothian-Gutu
ii)   Km 0-48:  Gutu-Chivhu
iii)  Km 48-84:  Gutu-Chivhu
(b)   Route 452:  Lothian-Zaka-Triangle, sub-divided into
the following sub-sections:
i)    Km 32-77.6
ii)   Km 77.6-132.6
Stage Construction
2.02        The roads were initially designed to 0/8 gravel, to be upgraded at
a later stage subject to sufficient traffic build-up, by the provision of
surface dressing of 'ituminous carpet.



- 19 -
Original Economic Evaluation
2.03        The project feasibility was done in two parts:
i)    a pre-investment study and report for the construction
of the road to 0/8, and;
ii)   an appraisal summary report for base and surfacing.
Economic Re-evaluation
2.04        Since the road was upgraded to bituminous surface anyhow, we
present this project as an upgrading from poor gravel (GIII) to 6/7.
Project Costs
2.05        The project costs, each for 0/8 and base and surfacing, have been
combined after adjustments to the same base year. All costs are adjusted to
July 1, 1988 prices.
ExistinR Traffic
2.06        The existing traffic volumes are based on MOT 1988 actual traffic
counts, adjusted for seasonal variations. MOT has several circuit and
permanent count stations along this road. Existing average traffic volume
(1988 AADT) are as follows:
LV          NV           BUS
Route 346: Lothian-Gutu, &A 0-52                  236          67          13

(Hinimum volumes on the existing roads are 29, 11, 20 respectively i.e. of
long distance traffic, perhaps half of the heavy traffic will rather pasa via
Mvuma instead of Chivhu-Lothian). This traffic however has not been taken
into account in the traffic growth rates used in the actual economic analysis
in order to have comparative results with the consultancy study.

Traffic Growth
2.08        The growth rate of population in the areas influenced by the road
is among the highest in the country. Development projects )roposed and/or in
various stages of implementation include irrigation projects, sugar estates
and ethanol plant, etc. Projected Annual Growth Rate (NTS):
LV          HV           BUS

Scenario II                                       3.0         4.5          4.0
Assume NTS Scenario I growth rates (traffic).  The original pre-investment
study and report assume an over optimistic growth rate of 7Z per year for all
traffic - this being based on the initial projected development (of GDP) of 82
per year as per the First Transitional Development Plan. Revised estimates of
GDP growth rate now vary somewhat between 3 and 52 with the lower value being
the more likely.
Results of Economic Analysis

Bank Staff Notes Concerning Part I1
1.          The economic reevaluations by the Goverament and Bank staff differ
somewhat and these differences are explained as follows: In the case of the
Pamushana-Birchenough Bridge Road, Part I shows an ERR of 122 while Part II
shows ERRs for each of three road segments, the third of which includes the
Birchenough Bridge improvement. Part II's very high 42.8Z ERR for the first
segment pertains to only 8 km or 92 of the total length of the road. Part II
has a relatively low 9.11 ERR for the second segment which represents 872 of
the total road length. The third segment has a rather high ERR of 20.22
because it includes the bridge improvement; Part I has a separate reevaluation
for the bridge improvement with an ERR of 342. Had the ?art II report
presented an ERR for the full 87 km road improvement without including the
bridge improvement, the ERR would probably have been about 92. The small
difference between this 92 and the comparable 122 in Part I is explained by
differences in methodology: (1) in calculating benefits and costs, the
Government assumes that all the construction costs were incurred in 1988
rather than determine, for each road subproject, the actual amounts expended
by actual construction period; (2) in Part II, all benefits are assumed to
begin in 1988 rather than immediately followlng the completion of construction
and the opening of the road segment to traffic; and (3) construction costs in
the Part II reevaluation sppear comparatively low, either because some costs
are excluded or the factor used to adjust data for inflation differ from those
used in the Part I reevaluation.
2.          For the other three road projects, Part II shows ERRs that differ
from those of Part I as follows: On the Chivhu-Lothian Road, Part II has ERRs
for each of three segments of 26.22, 50.12 and 19.42, respectively, but no
overall ERR for the total road; Part I shows a 372 ERR which is only slightly
lower than the average rate for the Part II ERRs. In the case of the Lothian-
Triangle Road, Part II has ERRs for particular road segments of 27.12 and
12.92 while Part I has a 242 ERR for the total road, the latter being
virtually equal to the weighted ERR of the two ERRs in Part II. Finally, in
the case of the Range-Mharadzano road, Part II has ERRs of 33.32 and 26.92,
respectively, for the two road segments, yielding a weighted average of about
30Z which is somewhat below the 40X ERR derived in Part I. Differences
between Part I and Part II ERRs are probablyr due mostly to differing traffic
*        projections.
3.          Part II contains no ERR estimate for the overall project but, in
view of the above observations, it is doubtful that it would be substantiallv
different from the 25Z determined in Part I.
