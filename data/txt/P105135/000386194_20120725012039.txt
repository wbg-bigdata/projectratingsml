F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (from Program Document)

In line with the Country Assistance Strategy for Madagascar, a series of single tranche
Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs), provided in the form of budget support, was
envisaged to support implementation of key components of the second-generation
Madagascar PRSP called the Madagascar Action Plan (MAP). The focus of the series
was centered on: (i) governance and budget management reform and (ii) improved
systems for service delivery in education, health, nutrition, water and sanitation.

Context of the Preparation of the Implementation Completion and Results Report

The PRSCs were originally designed as a three single-tranche credit series. The first two
operations, PRSC-4 and PRSC-5, were approved by the World Bank Board, respectively
on July 31, 2007 and June 26, 2008. However, due to the emergence of a political crisis
in Madagascar in early 2009, and OP 7.30 coming into effect2, the preparation of PRSC-6,
planned for mid-2009 was suspended, and the series was discontinued. Section 2.2
expands on the political situation in 2009 and following years.

The ICR for this PRSC series was delayed on account of expectations that PRSC-6 would
take place once the political situation was resolved. However, the political crisis
continued to be in effect for longer than expected and finally PRSC-6 was discontinued
and an ICR prepared.

1. Program Context, Development Objectives, and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

a. Macroeconomic situation at appraisal

Madagascar is one of the poorest countries in Sub-Sahara Africa, with a GNI per capita
of US$340 in 2007. Following the 2002 political crisis—a crisis that had lasted almost a
year and seen a 12.5 percent drop in real GDP, GDP had rebounded to its pre-crisis level
by 2004, and overall growth was set on a pace of close to 5 percent a year over 2005-06
with an estimated growth of 6.5 percent for 2007. Inflation continued to decline in 2006
aided by tight monetary policy, low prices, and a decline in world oil prices during the
second half of the year. Fiscal policy was been consolidated with the overall
macroeconomic situation remaining stable.

Growth in 2006 was led by the tertiary sector. Tourist arrivals increased 14 percent and
growth was strong in public sector, transport, and telecommunications. The primary
sector, on the other hand, grew only 2.3 percent due to rain shortfalls and low world
prices for key agricultural exports, such as vanilla. The secondary sector grew at a
moderate 4 percent, paced by solid gains in construction and mining, the latter related to
a large ilmenite mining investment in the Fort Dauphin area. Early estimates at the time
projected a healthy 6.5 percent growth in GDP for 2007 due to the launch of another
large mining investment project of around US$2.5 billion (or 45 percent of GDP) to be
undertaken over three years (2007-2009). This optimistic outlook was in spite of the six
tropical storms/cyclones that hit Madagascar in early 2007 when more than 300,000
people were affected by deteriorating food security, increasing health risks, and
substantial damage to public infrastructure and crops.

In 2006, inflation slowed down from its previous high levels over 2004-05, owing to
tighter monetary policy, lower rice prices, and a decline in oil prices later in the year.
However, the declining trend started to reverse in the early months of 2007 due to the
floods and increasing import prices, especially rice and petroleum. The exchange rate of
the ariary was broadly stable in 2005, but it began to rise against the U.S. dollar in the
last quarter of 2006 and the first months of 2007, with a nominal appreciation of 10
percent in the beginning of the year, reflecting an improved export performance and
greater foreign direct investment (FDI) linked to the mining project. FDI increased from
1.7 percent of GDP in 2005 to 4 percent in 2006. Stronger exports, greater FDI inflows,
and temporarily declining world petroleum prices contributed to an improvement in the
balance of payments, with the overall current account deficit improving from -
10.9 percent of GDP in 2005 to -8.8 percent in 2006. Foreign reserves were maintained at
three months of imports at year end 2006. The Central Bank of Madagascar (BCM)
guidelines for intervention in the foreign exchange market, aimed at achieving its foreign
assets objectives and dampening sharp swings that would create uncertainty, were
broadly followed.

Fiscal policy had two key objectives: reducing macroeconomic imbalances and avoiding
crowding out the private sector. Total spending was kept in line with domestic revenue
and concessional external financing, allowing domestic financing of the budget to be held
at a minimum. In 2006, the tax revenue to GDP ratio was still a low 10.7 percent.
Persistent problems in revenue collection hindered the Government's ability to implement
its ambitious poverty reduction strategy, with mid-year expenditure cuts implemented in
2006 to maintain overall fiscal discipline. The domestic fiscal balance improved from
-2.2 percent to -2.0 percent of GDP, and the overall fiscal balance (excluding grants)
from -10.1 percent to -10.5 percent of GDP.3 As a result, bank credit to the government
declined in the context of a modest pace of overall credit and monetary expansion. A
tight statutory limit on central bank financing of the budget deficit was strictly observed
and steps were taken to develop the Treasury bill market. Consolidated Government debt
owed to the BCM was converted into marketable securities. The Government was also
implementing a customs reform program and, with support from the IMF and World
Bank, was designing a comprehensive reform of tax and customs administration.


b. Alignment of PRSC program with Government, Bank and donor strategies

This PRSC series was approved shortly after the re-election of President Ravalomanana,
in December 2006, and the launch of the Madagascar Action Plan (MAP), the
government‟s Poverty Reduction Strategy. The series was designed to support
implementation of this strategy, and was consistent with the Bank's Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) discussed at the Board of Executive Directors meeting on April 3, 2007.
The MAP‟s objective was to promote rapid and sustainable development over the next
five years in line with the Government's national vision document (Madagascar

 The overall deficit, including grants, increased drastically from -4.3 percent to 37.5
percent of GDP due to a onetime MDRI.

Naturally) and the UN Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). To attain this objective,
the MAP presented eight key commitments: (i) responsible governance; (ii) connected
infrastructure; (iii) educational transformation; (iv) rural development and a green
revolution; (v) health, family planning, and the fight against HIV/AIDS; (vi) high-growth
economy; (vii) cherish the environment; and (viii) national solidarity.

The PRSC program for this series focused explicitly on improving governance, budget
management, and service delivery, and it included specific policy actions in these areas.
In parallel, Bank support aimed at directly enhancing Madagascar's growth potential
through its significant portfolio of ongoing IDA investment projects in infrastructure,
environment, mining, rural development, the Integrated Growth Poles project, the
Irrigation and Watershed Management project, and the Regional Telecommunications
project. Overall, the 2007 CAS devoted significant IDA resources to operations designed
to continue investment and policy dialogue on the growth agenda.

In line with the Government‟s request and consistent with the Paris Declaration on
harmonization, Bank assistance to Madagascar was aligned with financial and technical
support from other donors to provide a package of coordinated support around the MAP.
A partnership agreement (“Cadre de Partenariat?) was signed between the Government
and key donors providing part of their assistance through budget support (the European
Commission (EC), France (Agence Française de Développement and the French Co-
operation), the African Development Bank, and the World Bank) to provide a framework
and lay out procedures and modalities for a multi-donor approach to budgetary support.
This Budget Group initiated joint-donor missions already since October 2004 to review
implementation of the PRSP/MAP and supervise their respective budget support
operations.

In addition, the Bank collaborated and coordinated activities with the IMF. The staff of
the two institutions conducted regular joint assessments of the PRSP/MAP
implementation and worked closely together on such areas as: (i) analysis and reforms in
public financial management; (ii) other governance reforms, including customs and tax
reform; (iii) trade; and (iv) financial sector reforms. Joint policy advice was given on
budgetary procedures, including expenditure execution and the functioning of internal
and external controls.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)

The original PDOs were stated as follows:

In line with the Country Assistance Strategy for Madagascar, a series of single-tranche
Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs), provided in the form of budget support, is
envisaged to support implementation of key components of the second-generation
Madagascar PRSP called the Madagascar Action Plan (MAP). The focus of the series is
centered on: (i) governance and budget management reform and (ii) improved systems
for service delivery in education, health, nutrition, water, and sanitation.

The original Key Outcome Indicators are shown in Table 1 below.

1.3 Revised PDO, Key Indicators, and Reasons/Justification

The PDO and key indicators were not revised.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved)

The PRSC series supported three policy areas:

   (i)      Public Finance Reform:

            Public finance reform was aimed at establishing an efficient and effective
            government budget process by: (i) advancing on the public finance reform
            started in 2005 and already in process of implementation, along with specific
            steps identified in the rolling working plan for 2007-09; (ii) enhancing budget
            formulation; (iii) improving budget execution and quality of public
            procurement; (iv) strengthening controls on public finance management; (v)
            improving debt management; (vi) improving revenue generation and
            management; and (vii) improving budget transparency.

   (ii)     Governance:

            Governance reforms included actions to improve decentralization and reduce
            corruption. In the area of decentralization, the Government‟s reform program
            supported by this PRSC series was expected to lead to a higher share of
            resources available to the local governments. In the area of fighting corruption,
            the reform program was expected to improve the perception of corruption
            among the population and civil servants, and reduce opportunities for
            corruption in extractive and natural resource industries.

   (iii)    Basic Service Delivery:

            Basic service delivery was concentrated on education, health, nutrition, and
            water and sanitation. Support in these areas was aimed at strengthening the
            institutional systems and improving access and quality of services.




                                             5
The reforms supported under the above policy areas were expected to increase fiscal
discipline, streamline and consolidate government budget practices, improve
transparency, and sustain efforts to upgrade the overall institutional setting for service
delivery. These reforms were expected to produce higher growth rates and faster poverty
reduction.

1.5 Revised Policy Areas

Not applicable.

1.6 Other Significant Changes

Supplemental Financing Grant under OP 8.6.4 A supplemental financing grant in the
amount of US$10 million was approved by the Board on August 13, 2008 in response to
the evolving risks of food crisis facing Madagascar. Since the beginning of 2008, when
international rice prices rose sharply, domestic prices had risen only moderately due to
the availability of locally produced rice.5 However, rice needs during the post-harvest
October-to-December period needed to be met through imports. At the time of PRSC-5
preparation, it was difficult to anticipate import needs. After PRSC-5 approval, it was
estimated that import needs for the rest of the year would be large (100 to 150 thousand
tons) and domestic prices could rise by more than 50 percent if international prices
remained at high levels. In addition, Madagascar faced the impacts of cyclones and the
oil price shock. Under this scenario, the Government worked with development partners
in preparing a coordinated response, and the Bank responded with this grant.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

 The welfare of a majority of the population is highly sensitive to the price of rice, which
both is the main agricultural crop (rice production contributes around 10 percent of GDP)
and accounts for a large share of the consumption basket for the population.

          The Borrower has allocated            Met in 2007.        The budget for 2007
           adequate resources to PRSP/MAP        allocated 18.1 % to education, 16.3% to
           priority sectors in its Budget for    infrastructure, and 9% to health, which was
           2007.                                 consistent with the MAP priorities. (See
                                                 current allocations under PRSC-5 status.)

       The Borrower has adopted new             Met in 2007. The 2007 Budget Law
          regulations         on        fiscal   increased the share of certain taxes (impôt
          decentralization to be reflected by    synthétique, impôt foncier) in favor of the
          the 2007 Budget Law.                   communes. Formally the prior action was
                                                 fulfilled, but the adopted regulations fell
                                                 well short of the originally envisaged scope
                                                 of the reform due in part to difficulties in
                                                 conceptualizing and operationalizing a
                                                 broader      revision     of    the    fiscal
                                                 decentralization framework. In 2008, the
                                                 Government instituted a local development
                                                 fund (FDL) 6 . As the Bank and EU

                                                 materialized, the FDL has not been able to
                                                 channel block grants to communes to
                                                 finance basic social and economic
                                                 infrastructure.    However,      since    the
                                                 beginning of the crisis in early 2009, the

    The Borrower has developed Met in 2007. Government initiated the
       conflict-of-interest regulations.     process to develop conflict of interest
                                             regulations for the civil service. A decree
                                             was drafted and implementation was to
                                             start in July-August 2007 in 4 pilot
                                             ministries. However, it was never
                                             implemented.
Basic Service Delivery
    Implementation of the National Met by 2006. The EFA plan was
       Education for All Initiative Plan implemented and is broadly on track. The
       (EFA) is on track.                    program is in the third phase and a new
                                             EFA strategy is under preparation.
    The Borrower has prepared and Met by 2007, when the Ministry of Health
       validated the Health Sector completed the elaboration of the PDSS and
       Development Program (PDSS).           it was validated by the Cabinet. The PDSS
                                             is still the reference document for the
                                             health sector today.
    The Borrower has elaborated, Met in 2007. The institutional assessment
       validated, and implemented the of the National Office of Nutrition (ONN)
       recommendations of a nutrition was completed in early March 2007 and
       sector institutional assessment.      validated with the Prime Ministry. A decree
                                             formalizing the main institutional changes
                                             was issued on May 2007 (decree No. 397).

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation

Over the early implementation of the program supported under PRSC-4 and PRSC-5,
major factors affecting implementation included donor coordination, the effects of shocks,
capacity issues, and complementarities between PFM reforms and social sector policy
implementation.

Bank coordination with other donors through the common framework of budget
support was a positive element in the implementation of PRSC-4 and PRSC-5. The
joint donor status reports on PAP implementation provided inputs to the status of various
reforms supported by the series. During the joint supervision missions, common areas of
support with the EU‟s program of budget support (Programme d‟Appui Budgétaire à la
Réduction de la Pauvreté, or PARP) included the public-sector reform agenda, education
and health. There were also synergies with other donors on areas supported by the series.

Madagascar’s vulnerability to external shocks affected implementation of this series,
in particular, cyclones and variations in global commodity prices, such as oil and
rice, and the global financial crisis. These risks were identified in PRSC-4 and PRSC-5,
and some measures were taken to mitigate their impact. To reduce vulnerabilities to


                                           12
climate shocks, for example, the Bank supported the Government in finalizing a Risk and
Social Protection review that paved the way for risk prevention and mitigating strategies.
There were also steps taken to investigate the feasibility of specific options to mitigate
shocks, such as weather risk insurance. The Bank also supported Government efforts to
protect vulnerable groups affected by food price increases.

Capacity constraints were a negative element in the implementation of PRSC-4 and
PRSC-5. Although the Government undertook efforts to improve internal capacity,
significant weaknesses at the sectoral and local levels remained. To mitigate the impact,
the Government, in coordination with the donors, prepared a capacity building strategy as
a key element of the MAP. The donor community designed a range of technical
assistance grants and training initiatives designed to enhance capacity. These efforts were
enhanced through round tables for public expenditure management reforms and the
Budget Support Group.

Delays in implementing public finance and structural reforms in strategic sectors
were a challenge and an identified risk for improving service delivery. The
unpredictability of budget execution, capacity weaknesses in applying the program
budget structure, and poor monitoring and evaluation (M&E) negatively impacted service
delivery in priority sectors. The PAP implementation was identified as critical to ensuring
real impact on service delivery and poverty reduction. The political crisis in early 2009
was the main impediment to the full implementation of the series and progress on its
objectives. Given Madagascar‟s recent history, political risks to implementation of both
PRSC-4 and PRSC-5 had been identified in the program documents. At appraisal of
PRSC-4 and PRSC-5, however, the political situation in Madagascar appeared to be
stable, having been solidified by the transparent and peaceful national elections in
December 2006 and municipal elections in December 2007. The coup d'etat of March
2009 forced President Marc Ravalomanana into exile and put into power the elected
Mayor of Antananarivo, who took the title of President of the High Authority (HAT).
This unconstitutional access to power was rejected by the international community. The
causes of the 2009 crisis were multiple and complex, and include governance issues in
the policy process and conduct of officials at the highest level of the Government, with
significant issues coming to the forefront already by late 2008 and forming part of the
triggers for the subsequent crisis and entrenched and widespread poverty, and limited
progress in sustained, inclusive economic growth.

The onset of the crisis, the change in government and several donors’ decisions to
suspend their respective programs effectively led to the interruption of the reform
program supported by the PRSCs. For the planned PRSC-6, although many of its
triggers were met by February 2009, the onset of the crisis triggered the application of OP
7.30, and its processing was suspended. In this context also, the broader agenda
supported by the PRSCs, including in PFM reform and service delivery has been
interrupted. The political crisis translated into a sharp contraction in spending, with donor
aid falling sharply, a fall in domestic revenues related in part to a decline in GDP, and the
adjustment of overall expenditures to maintain macroeconomic balance, even as the
relative allocation of funds to current spending on priority social sectors was broadly
maintained. On the structural front, since 2009, in particular, the PAP was not
implemented in its form, and the political crisis undermined the vision created for the
social sectors. It also created greater uncertainty in the modes of governance. In particular,

                                             13
at the “last segment? of the value chain in education and health care, service delivery is
currently underfunded, inefficient, and insufficient.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation, and Utilization

The design of the indicators to monitor PDO progress was partly adequate and
envisaged adaptation to the detailed results framework for the MAP that was finalized in
2008. Prior actions for PRSC-4 and PRSC-5 and indicative triggers for PRSC-6 were
selected with Government on the basis of (i) their importance in contributing a key
constraint to the implementation of the intended reform and (ii) their alignment with
MAP objectives. Indicators in the Policy Matrix were also consistent with the MAP.
Despite the ambitious set of indicators, the PRSC was more conservative than the MAP
in foreseeing outcomes because the MAP presented a very ambitious progression path,
predicated on a large increase of external financing that did not fully materialize. PDO
indicators were based on data expected to be available. Without the data, gaps were
created in the M&E process. For example, the last PEFA took place in 2009 and
indicators related to it became very difficult to monitor and evaluate after 2010.

M&E was implemented in an environment already known for weak monitoring
capacity and data that needed quality improvements. The Bank supported efforts to
improve these, such as through an Institutional Development Fund grant on statistical
capacity-building and through a PRSP Trust Fund for M&E of the MAP. The Bank also
provided support through the PGDI Madagascar Second Governance and Institutional
Development Project (P103950) that aimed at improving ministry level monitoring
systems, developing the National Statistics Institute (INSTAT), and contributing to the
funding of the 1993 Population and Housing Census. 9 Despite these efforts, M&E
implementation was inadequate. Several activities, such as the roll-out of the MAP M&E
system and the Population and Housing Census, were never carried out after suspension
of development assistance in March 2009.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The PRSC objectives and design were fully relevant, and remain so today. An
extensive program of analytical and advisory activities (AAA) informed the PRSC design.
Key monitoring indicators were mostly chosen from the Government‟s Action Plan
Matrix in coordination with the Government and donors. The monitoring and evaluation
of this series was adapted to the monitoring system of the MAP. The Government
developed in close collaboration with partners, including the Bank, the detailed results
framework for the MAP and designed the proper institutional setting to monitor its
implementation.

The PRSC objectives are still relevant to Madagascar despite the political crisis that
put a halt to its implementation. The three-year crisis has imposed a high cost on one of
the world‟s poorest populations. As a result, Madagascar is gradually sinking into a state
of increased fragility, including a rise in poverty and a continued deterioration in
governance. Health and education are close to an emergency situation because the
delivery system for public services risks paralysis despite humanitarian aid, which,
bypassing public institutions is showing its limits. The infrastructure is in an alarming
state of falling into disrepair. Furthermore, Madagascar remains prone to exogenous
shocks (financial crisis, food or oil prices) and extreme climate risks (hurricanes,
drought), which further aggravate the vulnerability of the poor in a country where the
Government has only limited capacity to respond. Therefore, improving governance and
public sector management, and service delivery in key areas are still at the core of
Madagascar needs.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

Program Development Objectives Results Matrix in Annex 7 presents a summary of the
achievements under this PRSC series relative to baselines and targets. Detailed indicators
provide evidence of progress towards achieving the PDOs.

3.2.1. Public finance reform (unsatisfactory)

In the area of public finance management, substantial improvement of the whole budget
process was achieved by 2008, a trend captured by the PEFA indicators comparing the
situation in 2006 and 2008 (see Annex 8). Despite these improvements, however, most of
the target indicators were not met as of 2011 (see Annex 7). A rapid assessment of the
PFM was done in 2011. It concluded that the PFM did not worsen significantly during the
political crisis, but the need for improving the system is urgent.

In the area of budget execution, the overall process was streamlined through the
introduction of the modern computerized SIGFP. As a consequence, all central public
institutions (ministries and central government level) now execute their annual budgets
through SIGFP. However, budget execution rates, which improved significantly between
2006 and 2008, deteriorated in recent years. The closest available measure of execution
rates for 2011 is presented in the Analysis of the Finance Act of 2012, which shows a
comparison between the Finance Act of 2011 budgeted amounts and expected realization
for 2011. These data show that, in most cases, the expected realization rate is
significantly off the projected amounts, except for staff costs, interest payable, and other
net treasury operations. The differences are most notable in non-tax revenues, grants, and
capital expenditures where expected realization is only 60%, 63%, and 51% of the
budgeted amounts, respectively, reflecting in part low donor‟s disbursements relative to
budget forecasts. This said, the execution of domestically-financed capital expenditure
also fell short of budget plans.

In the area of revenue generation, improvements from 2006 to 2009 resulted from
substantial administrative and policy reforms, such as the consolidation of the tax and


                                            15
custom reforms, which led to an unprecedented increase in tax collection in 2008.10 The
Government was able to maintain the tax share at 10.7 percent of GDP in 2009 and 2010
and even increased it slightly to 10.9 percent of GDP in 2011, with a continued effort in
tax collection compensating for the decline in economic activity. The Government has
continued to pursue macroeconomic stability and fiscal sustainability, with public
investment having born the burden of adjustment to lower revenues and donor resources
since the beginning of the political crisis.

Internal control systems operate with significant deficiencies, particularly for
commitment controls. Controls continue to appear inadequate for the execution of civil
service payroll, for ensuring compliance of non-salary expenditure execution with
procurement rules and regulations, and in the verification of the actual delivery of goods
and services. However, limited information is currently available for assessing recent
trends and practices.

In the area of improving budget transparency, efforts included the previously
mentioned introduction of a SIGFP, which allowed the production of regular reports as
well as reformed public procurement. However, the absence of an effective control
system on the use of public funds remains a concern. Reporting and control processes on
use of funds in Treasury accounts (“comptes des dépôts?) remain insufficient. A
significant fraction of non-tax revenues and public funds managed by autonomous public
agencies are not included in the budget. To improve transparency of the public
procurement process, the ARMP set up a website to provide information about open
tenders and about the results of the tendering process. However, the information now
often appears outdated and its quality varies. The application of the new procurement
code was becoming more common, but due to a lack of training, local entities (communes,
regions, independent public agencies) do not systematically use it. Cases of misuse of
public funds are rarely reported due to weak and insufficient controls. The same is true
for corruption cases in public procurement.

3.2.2. Governance (unsatisfactory)

In the area of reduction of corruption, the PRSC program assisted the Government in its
efforts to consolidate the regulatory framework, but the political crisis took a heavy toll
on governance indicators. Between 2002 and 2009, most governance indicators were
improving, and Madagascar was doing better than the African average on most accounts.
Transparency International‟s Corruption Index for 2007, which the Government used to
assess the effectiveness of anti-corruption efforts, gave Madagascar a rating of 3.2,
ranking 95th out of 179 countries. This was an improvement over the rating of 2.8 in 2005.


10
   The Government also included a number of reforms in the 2008 Budget law, including the
merging of personal and corporate income taxes and the reduction of the top rate from 30 percent
to 25 percent, removing taxes on dividends and excise taxes on sugar and flour, raising the VAT
threshold and increasing its rate by 2 percentage points, removing small taxes, and eliminating
some special treatments.




                                               16
Furthermore, the index for 2009 improved to 3.4 before rapidly deteriorating during the
ongoing crisis. From 2008 to 2011, Madagascar fell from 85th to 100th in the world on
Transparency International‟s Corruption Perception Index, earning a rating of 3.0 in 2010
and 2.6 in 2011. Similarly, the Bank‟s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment index
(CPIA) declined from 3.7 in 2008 to 3.4 in 2010 with the indicator on Transparency,
Accountability and Corruption in the Public Sector falling from 3.5 to 2.5.

In the area of reducing opportunities of corruption in natural resource industries, the
forestry sector has seen a surge in illegal logging of precious timber. This has risked
destroying the progress made in two decades of efforts to preserve the island‟s unique
biodiversity.

In the mining sector, where sound governance institutions have been adopted since the
late 1990s, transparent governance is at risk of being undermined. A transparent permit
management system was designed to encourage prudent exploitation and valuation of
Madagascar‟s mining potential, but implementation has been weak, with limited gains in
transparency and indications of political interference, including in the redistribution of
mining revenues among affected communes. Madagascar was accepted as an Extractive
Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI) candidate in February 2008, but it was suspended
from the EITI process in October 2011 due to a non-conducive environment for effective
multi-stakeholder dialogue.

Regarding decentralization, this PRSC series was expected to lead to a higher share of
resources available to the local governments. Initially, the share of the total budget
transferred to local government rose from 1.8 percent in 2007 to 2.3 percent in 2008;
however, it fell to 1.7 percent in 2009 and reached 1.9 percent in 2010. However, the
decentralization process which had already started in the 1990s has made little progress
over the last 20 years. Although decentralization is one of the seven challenges under the
governance agenda of the MAP, government commitment has been uneven.

3.2.3 Improving Service Delivery (unsatisfactory)

The public health service delivery system is increasingly under threat, with increasing
fragmentation of scarce donor resources, decreasing utilization of public health services
and growth of parallel service delivery systems. Despite improvements in such indicators
as the child underweight rate and skill birth attendance (see PDO Results in Annex 7), the
impact of the crisis in the health/nutrition sector is noticeable. Between 2008 and 2010-11,
other indicators showed worsening trends; for example, the prenatal consultation rate in
basic health centers decreased from 74 to 62 percent and the acute malnutrition rate
increased from 4.7 percent to 7.4 percent. Moreover, the poorest segment of the
population is now most likely to need these parallel systems, which inherently cost more.

Public delivery in education has also suffered. None of the indicators in the Annex 7 were
met, although some showed improvements, such as the primary enrollment rate and the
primary completion rate. However, the impact of the crisis in this sector is high. Lower
public funding for education has led many communities to hire and pay for teachers. It is
estimated that as many as two-thirds of primary school teachers are hired by the



                                            17
community. Given the economic context and the absence of regulation, these trends are
becoming increasingly unsustainable and leading to higher dropout rates.

Regarding service delivery in water and sanitation, indicators show mixed results.
Among the rural population, access to safe drinking water was reported to have improved
from 31.6 percent in 2006 to 38.5 percent in 2010; meanwhile, sanitation access fell from
47 percent in 2006 41.5 percent in 2010.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Unsatisfactory

Based on the achievements of the PDOs, the overall outcome of the PRSC series is rated
unsatisfactory. Ten of the sixteen indicators were not met, one was partly met, and only
four were met. The implementation of the reform was halted by the political situation and
the likelihood that most of the results would be achieved is nil until the political crisis is
resolved.

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes, and Impacts

a. Poverty impacts, gender aspects, and social development

The series was expected to have contributed to reduced poverty incidence from 68.7
percent in 2005 to 64 percent in 2010, with significant distributional impacts. However,
poverty incidence was estimated to have increased by more than 9 percentage points
between 2005 and 2010, reaching 77 percent of households, one of the highest rate in
Africa (World Development Indicators, 2011). The poverty challenge differs across
regions and other dimensions. There are wide gaps among regions (from 57 percent to 77
percent) and between rural areas (74 percent) and urban areas (52 percent) 11. In addition,
income differences between the rich and the poor are large, especially in urban centers,
where the ratio between the highest and the lowest income groups may top 10. Under the
current circumstances, there are little chances that Madagascar would achieve most of the
MDGs by the deadline date of 2015.

b. Institutional change/strengthening

This PRSC series had a strong complementarily with the Governance and Institutional
Development Project I and II. Both PRSC-4 and PRSC-5 were implemented in close
collaboration with these projects which supported specific activities in the area of focus
of the PRSC series. Some progress was made in the institutional front. For example, the
management of the Tax Directorate and the large taxpayer doctorate underwent
restructuring and modernization to allow for more transparency on tax declaration and tax
collection.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: High

Political and economic developments since early 2009 have effectively pre-empted the
achievement of most of the PRSC program‟s development objectives for the medium
term.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

a. Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry

Rating: Moderately satisfactory

The design of this PRSC series, the second PRSC series in Madagascar, focused on
critical issues facing the country and in line with the CAS and Madagascar‟s
development goals as stated in its MAP. It supported the Government in implementing a
comprehensive reform program in the areas of governance and service delivery. It was
built on an extensive program of analytical and advisory activities (AAA), which
underpinned the Bank‟s policy dialogue and programmatic lending. It also incorporated
lessons from PRSC1-3. These ensured quality at entry. However, the series‟ scope was
very broad, and it could have benefited from more focus. There also could have been
scope to improve some of the linkages between prior action, triggers and PDO indicators.
For example, the trigger „the borrower has satisfactorily implemented the Priority Action
Plan‟ was very broad and could have been further detailed. Conversely, other PFM
related triggers were very much focused: allocation of adequate resources to PRSP/MAP
priority sectors in the budget (although no clear link to PDO indicators), and timely
submission of budget execution reports on an economic classification (PEFA Indicators 5
and 24).

Furthermore, the ambitious set of indicators, although less ambitious than the PAP, could
have been more conservative. For example, the PDO indicators related to PFM, in
particular, indicators 1, 3 and 4, could have been less ambitious at least in terms of the
horizon to achieve outcomes. For example, some of the objectives set out for PFM
reforms expected to be achieved in 3-4 years exceeded, in some cases, the performance of
two Middle Income Countries (Brazil and Peru) with very strong public sector and PFM
capacities.



                                           19
b. Quality of supervision

Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory

Supervision was carried out through consultations with the Government and other
development partners. During the appraisal of PRSC-5, the Bank assessed the
achievement of prior actions and indicators as of 2007. In the context of the preparation
of the concept note for PRSC-6, it also evaluated the achievements of triggers for PRSC-
6. The Bank prepared two Implementation Status and Results Reports (ISRs), the last one
on August 2008, which assessed progress with indicators as of the end of 2007. It also
conducted periodic reviews with the other partners in the context of joint missions on
budget support and relevant sector programs. After March 2009, however, there was no
formal supervision. Nevertheless, the Bank maintained a technical dialogue with the
Ministry of Finance and Budget and other relevant ministries.

c. Justification of rating for overall Bank performance

Ratings: Moderately unsatisfactory

Despite a moderately satisfactory quality at entry, the scope for bank supervision and
policy dialogue was sharply reduced since March 2009 as a result of the ongoing political
crisis.

5.2 Borrower Performance

Rating: Unsatisfactory

In the early years of design and implementation, the Madagascar Government led the
design of the PRSC series through a process of frequent Bank-Government dialogue.
This series was designed to conform to the budget cycle, which runs from January 1 to
December 31, and PRSC-5 was delivered by the second quarter of the calendar year, as
requested by the Ministry of Finance. The responsibility for implementing this PRSC
program rested with the Ministry of Finance and Budget. The Government took the lead
in monitoring progress, implementing and updating the program policy matrix, and
coordinating inputs from other relevant ministries. The Government initially showed
strong ownership of reforms and commitment to achieve development objectives. In the
context of the political crisis, donor disengagement, and ensuing economic and financial
developments, however, the specific reform agenda supported by the PRSCs is no longer
a core government priority. Despite initial strong commitment to the DPOs and efforts to
strengthen the institutional structure to implement the overall MAP, subsequent
developments in policy conduct and performance called for a rating of unsatisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

     Development Policy Lending can be effective instruments for the Bank and
      other development partners to signal significant concerns about governance.
      By late 2008 development partners‟ governance concerns escalated. As a result,
      the IMF postponed its Board presentation that was scheduled for December, 2008.


                                           20
    Other partners (EU and Germany) who were on the verge to disburse their budget
    support in December 2008 decided to discontinue their disbursements until the
    Government would provide satisfactory explanations and remedies. The Bank also
    signed the letter that started the discontinuation of the disbursements. This was a
    strong and coordinated signal that development partners were able to use to convey
    these concerns about worsening governance and issues of transparency in fiscal
    policy and management.

   Donor coordination for budget support remains essential. A partnership
    agreement was signed in 2004 between the Government and the key budget
    support donors, the European Union (EU), France (Agence Française de
    Developpement and the French Co-operation), the African Development Bank
    (ADB) and the World Bank, later joined by Germany. The goal was to provide a
    better alignment with Government procedures and Paris declaration objectives.
    This group based its support on a harmonized matrix that guided individual
    interventions. This group also agreed, in close coordination with the IMF, to
    suspend budget support in December 2008. However, several members have also
    noted that discussions within such a coordination group could be strengthened to a
    more technical substantive level than has been the case.

   Broader monitoring of developments on the ground and more attention to
    outcomes, as opposed to inputs, is needed. Although selected prior actions and
    indicators were coordinated with the Government‟s Action Plan and MAP
    objectives, their monitoring did not always provide a whole picture of real progress
    on the ground, especially in regards to developments on the governance front.
    While in social sectors, outcomes indicators were used to assess progress, in PFM,
    too much emphasis was put on progress on inputs (such as PFM systems,
    institutions, and legal texts) rather than outcomes. In particular, the indicators used
    to evaluate progress on transparency and PFM focused too much on budget
    preparation and not enough on execution and checks and balances.

   Even when the range of systemic performance issues is broad, as it is in all
    areas supported under the PRSC series, especially PFM, it remains important
    to set as much as possible a few reasonable objectives aiming at gradual and
    sustainable improvements. Related to this is the need for careful recurrent review
    of existing analytical work when designing and implementing a reform program,
    targeting more focused triggers and PDO indicators. For example, as noted above,
    the PRSC series could have supported two or three selected and critical PFM
    improvements rather than proposing such a broad coverage.

   Supplemental financing may sent mixed signals to authorities when issues
    emerge in the implementation of a PRSC-supported program. PRSC-5 was
    approved as an instrument to support the Government's progress on the
    implementation of its national strategy. Concurrently, another budget operation
    was prepared in 2008 to help Madagascar deal with the international food crisis.
    Although these two operations were distinct, they resulted in an increase in budget
    support and may have been interpreted by the authorities as a seal of approval from



                                          21
      the Bank and the donor community even at a time when significant governance
      concerns had emerged at the forefront.
