APPRAISAL OF THE CHUNGJU MULTIPURPOSE PROJECT
1. BACKGROUND
General
1.01      The Government of the Republic of Korea has requested Bank assist-
ance in financing the Chungju Multipurpose Project, a key element in the
multipurpose development of the Han River Basin covering 26% of Korea's
land area, and containing 50% of its industry and nearly one-third of Korea's
population including the capital city of Seoul. The water resources of
the Basin have been partially developed through the construction of multi-
purpose dams on the north branch of the Han River. However, by the mid-
1980s additional surface water storage will be needed to satisfy the Basin's
rapidly growing demands for municipal, industrial and irrigation water.
The proposed Chungju Project, consisting of a dam and power plant on the
south branch of the Han River, would meet the growth in future water demands
over a period of at least 15 years after its completion in 1984.  In addition
the project would help to meet Korea's rapidly growing power demands and
also have significant flood control benefits.
1.02      The Government has recently secured financing for the Chungju
Project in the amount of Yen 14,000 million (US$70 million) from the Overseas
Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF) of Japan. The loan agreement was signed on
January 20, 1978 and the proceeds will be used primarily to finance the
procurement of powerhouse equipment and the employment of consultants.
1.03      The Chungju Project was identified as the next stage in the multi-
purpose development of the Han Basin in a comprehensive study of the Basin
published in 1971 by the United States Bureau of Reclamation (USBR). A feas-
ibility study of the project was prepared in 1976 by Engineering Consultants
Incorporated (ECI) of Denver, USA. This report is based on the findings of a
preappraisal mission comprising Messrs. W.T. Smith, K. Sigrist (Bank) and
D.G. Knott, J. Hilf, L. Wolofsky, and W. Bright (consultants) which visited
Korea in June 1977, and an appraisal mission comprising Messrs. W.T. Smith,
R.R. Morton, V. Talvadkar (Bank) and D.G. Knott and V. Brandt (consultants)
which visited Korea in October 1977.
Multipurpose Basin Development
1.04      The drainage basins of Korea's four largest rivers, the Han,
Nakdong, Geum and Yong San, account for nearly two-thirds of Korea's land
area. Because of Korea's mountainous terrain, most of its major cities and
industries as well as much of its best agricultural land lie along these
major rivers and depend on them for their water. Korea has the advantage
that an unusually high proportion of its annual precipitation, nearly 50%,
appears as surface water runoff. However, this advantage is offset by
Korea's high population density of about 350/sq km with the result that
annual surface water runoff per capita is about 2,100 cu m compared to
4,300 cu m for Japan and 13,100 cu m for the USA.



-2-
1.05      In the 1960s it became apparent that water demands for cities,
industries and farms would soon exceed the unregulated flow in the dry
season (November through March) when only 15% of the annual runoff occurs.
Also, with the rapid urban and industrial development, and more intensive
cultivation of the farmlands, the consequences of floods had become much more
serious during the three months - July, August and September - when the
rivers carry 65% of the annual runoff. Recognizing also the large untapped
hydroelectric potential of these river basins, the Government commissioned
the preparation of multipurpose development plans for each of Korea's four
major river basins.
1.06      The Han Basin.  In 1965, the United States Agency for International
Development (USAID) arranged for a three-man team to assist the Government in
a preliminary survey of the Han River Basin. This led to the Han River Basin
Survey, financed by USAID and carried out by the United States Bureau of
Reclamation (USBR), which began in 1966 and was completed in 1971. The
objective of the survey was to formulate a long-range comprehensive plan for
developing the Basin's water resources. Existing projects in the Han Basin
include the Hwacheon Project, built in 1940, and the Soyang Gang Multipurpose
Project completed in 1973. There are also several smaller hydroelectric
projects. An important finding of the USBR study was that additional storage
would be needed in the Basin by 1986 and that this requirement would be best
satisfied by construction of the Chungju Project.
1.07      The Nakdong Basin.  A basin study was financed by the United Nations
Development Program with the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) as
executing agency.  The study began in 1966 and was carried out by NEDECO, a
Netherlands consulting firm. The first phase of this study recommended early
implementation of the Andong Multipurpose Project on the upper reaches of the
Nakdong River.  This project was completed in 1976 with financial assistance
from  ADB.   Recent studies have shown that a barrage across the mouth of the
Nakdong River will be needed by 1985 to meet the growing industrial and urban
demands in the Nakdong Delta, including Busan, Korea's second largest city.
1.08      The Geum Basin.  A study of the Geum Basin was carried out in 1972
by Nippon Koei, a Japanese consultant. A key element in the basin plan, the
Daechung Dam, is now under construction and will be completed in 1980. This
will develop the only major reservoir site in the Geum Basin and will firm up
the river flows for a large area of irrigated land bordering the Geum River.
A further possibility for development of the Geum River, an estuary dam near
the mouth of the river, has been investigated under a Bank-financed project
(Loan 942-KO). This dam would provide water for urban, industrial and
irrigation use in areas outside of the basin.
1.09      The Yong San Gang Basin.  Stage I of a development plan, prepared
by government agencies, consisting of four storage dams and related irriga-
tion systems, was financed by the Bank (Yong San Gang Project Stage I,
Loan/Credit 795/283-KO) and was completed in 1978. Work on a second stage



- 3 -
of the basin's development also financed by the Bank (Yong San Gang Project,
Stage II, Loan 1364-KO) has recently begun. This comprises an estuary dam
across the Yong San River near the town of Mok Po, reclamation of 5,500 ha of
tidal land, and irrigation of 15,000 ha of presently cultivated land.
1.10      The Ministry of Construction (MOC) has jurisdiction over the
development and use of water resources throughout Korea. The Water Resources
Bureau of MOC is responsible for collecting hydrologic data and issuing
licenses for the use of water from the major rivers. Multipurpose projects
are constructed, operated and maintained by the Industrial Sites and Water
Resources Development Corporation (ISWACO), a semi-autonomous corporation
under MOC. The Agriculture Development Corporation (ADC), a semi-autonomous
agency in the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, has authority to
construct dams for irrigation and reclamation of agricultural land.
The Power Sector
1.11      Korea's consumption of electrical energy in 1978 showed a sixfold
increase over 1968, an average annual growth of almost 20%. Per capita use
in 1978 was 725 kWh, compared with over 6,000 kWh for a highly industrial-
ized country such as Japan and 840 kwh for a developing country such as
Brazil. Industry accounts for some 80% of total consumption. About 95%
of the urban population has access to electricity, and through a vigorous
rural electrification program some 90% of the rural population will be
served by 1981. Over the next ten years annual growth in demand is expected
to decline from 15% in 1978 to 12% in the mid-1980s. Peak demand in 1986
is estimated to reach 13,400 MW compared to 5,300 MW in 1978.
1.12      Indigenous resources for power generation in Korea are small
compared to future demands. Hydroelectric development, usually in combina-
tion with other purposes such as flood control and water supply, is a com-
petitive source of peaking capacity; however, the total potential is only
about 1,500 MW of which nearly 50% has already been developed. Coal reserves
consist of anthracite which, because of its low heating value, has to be
used together with fuel oil. These coal reserves are an important source of
home heating fuel but are unlikely to be a significant source of fuel for
power generation in the future. Oil exploration, which has been going on for
several years, has yet to yield commercially significant discoveries.
Korea's tidal power potential is still under study. In order to diversify
its sources of imported fuel needed to meet the bulk of future demands,
Korea's long-range power program consists of a mix of oil-fired thermal,
coal-fired thermal, and nuclear plants. Future plans also include continued
development of hydroelectric resources as well as some pumped-storage instal--
lations. Korea's first nuclear power plant (600 MW) was commissioned in 1978,
four 600 MW units are under construction, and two 900 MW units are in the
design stage. The Korea Electric Company (KECO), formed in 1961 through
a merger of three smaller power companies, has the primary responsibility for
power generation, transmission and distribution. About 62% of KECO's capital
stock is owned by the Government and the balance by private shareholders. The



-4-
Ministry of Energy and Resources, the ministry primarily responsible
for energy matters, supervises KECO's activities, exercises the Government's
rights as a major stockholder and recommends action on electricity rates.
KECO presently owns and operates 88% of Korea's installed capacities. It
purchases the output from a 300 MW privately-owned thermal plant and also from
300 MW of hydroelectric capacity at multipurpose projects owned and operated
by ISWACO.
1.13      The overall performance of KECO has been impressive in maintain-
ing a dependable electricity supply during a period in which demand has
doubled every four years. However, in the early 1970s, the financial
performance of KECO deteriorated considerably. It reached a critical stage
in 1974 when the rate of return on average net fixed assets dropped to 4.5%
and the debt service coverage dropped to 0.9. The main reasons for this
were the temporary overinvestment in generation facilities, delays in adjust-
ing tariffs to reflect a sharp rise in oil prices, and short-term borrowing
at high interest rates. However subsequent tariff increases of 61.7% in
1975, and 14.2% in 1976 improved KECO's financial performance resulting in a
rate of return of 8.6% in 1976. Tariffs were increased 11.3% in 1977 and
12.1% in 1978, and the Government intends to allow future increases in tariffs
to ensure a return of 9% on KECO's rate base, which would result in approxi-
mately a 10.5% rate of return on average net fixed assets.
1.14      Bank financing in Korea's power sector has so far been limited to
rural electrification. The Rural Infrastructure Project I (Loan 1216-KO
and Loan 1218T-KO) provided US$18.1 million toward the cost of providing
electricity to over 6,000 villages.
The Water Supply Sector
1.15      About 55% of Korea's population is served by piped water systems
compared to 22% ten years ago. Service ratios range from 90% in Seoul
and other major cities to 30% in the smaller urban centers. In the rural
areas, a major government program to construct simple and inexpensive systems
has brought piped water to over 40% of the villagers in communities of
over 20 households. However, in the rural towns (population - 1,000 to
20,000) the service ratio averages only about 5%. This is because these
towns are too large for the type of systems installed in the villages and too
small to support the more complex and costly systems adopted in the urban
centers. Over the next five years, the Government aims to increase the
percentage of the total population with piped water to 60%. The service
ratio will be raised to 100% in the six largest cities, and to over 20% in
the rural towns. Continued construction of small community systems is
expected to bring piped water to about 75% of the village population.
1.16      Water produced by the municipal systems in the urban centers
averages about 170 liters/capita/day (lpcd), with production in major
cities such as Seoul, Busan and Incheon on the order of 200 lpcd. Water



sold accounts for about 60% of water produced in most urban centers. The
high percentage of unaccounted for water, a characteristic of large and
rapidly expanding systems in developing countries, is gradually being reduced
through leak detection and inspection programs. The rural systems are
reasonably efficient because of their small size and limited possibilities
for leakage, and consumption is on the order of 80 to 100 lpcd. In 1978, the
total volume of water produced by municipal and industrial systems amounted
to 3,800 MCM of which about 90% was from surface water and the remainder
from groundwater.
1.17      The ministries concerned with the water supply sector are the
Ministry of Construction (MOC) and the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs
(MHSA). MOC has responsibility for all municipal and industrial water
supply facilities. Planning is handled by MOC's Housing and Urban Planning
Bureau and its Industrial Water Bureau. Construction services are provided
by Regional Construction Bureaus in each of the nine provinces. Some of
the major cities have developed their own capabilities for planning and
construction management of municipal water systems, and ISWACO (para. 1.10)
has planned and executed some municipal and industrial water systems in
connection with industrial site development. However, the activities of the
municipalities and ISWACO are subject to the review and approval of MOC.
System operation and maintenance is the responsibility of the local author-
ities in the urban and industrial centers. MHSA through its Environmental
Health Bureau is responsible for rural water systems and establishes policy
guidelines, allocates funds, and monitors construction. Planning and design
is carried out by county construction divisions subject to review by the
provincial administrations. The cities in the Han Basin have demonstrated
their ability to plan, design and operate systems to keep pace with their
growing demands. In Seoul, the production capacity of water treatment plants
in the municipal system has shown a 400% increase over the past 10 years and
there are firm plans to double the present capacity by 1984. Construction of
distribution systems can be expected to keep pace with treatment plant
capacity.
1.18      Water tariffs in Korea are reviewed and approved by the Economic
Planning Board (EPB) through its Price Control Division. At present tariffs
are based on a standard formula developed by EPB in which only operation
and maintenance costs and principal and interest payments on loans are
taken into account. In the near future, however, EPB plans to include
depreciation and a 7% return on investments in the water tariff calculation.
The present tariffs, although increasing almost annually, have remained low.
For domestic and commercial consumers average tariffs charged by municipal
systems range from W 25 (US$0.05) to W 60 (US$0.12) per cu m. Rates for
bulk supply to industrial areas vary according to the public investment in
intake and treatment facilities. Industries drawing water directly from a
river pay about W 4 (US$0.01) per cu m but the rate from government systems
in some cases is as high as W 30 (US$0.06). A study by the Asian Development
Bank indicates that present tariffs would have to be increased from 1.3 to
2.6 times to achieve a 7% return on investments and to cover depreciation.
1.19      Bank lending for water supply has so far been concentrated in
the rural sector. Rural Infrastructure Project I (Loans 1216-KO and 1218T-KO)



-6-
provided US$5.4 million toward the financing of piped water supply systems in
4,073 villages which were completed in 1977. Rural Infrastructure Project II
(Loan 1530-KO) provides US$21.8 million towards financing of 7,400 village
water supply systems.
Project Formulation
1.20      The USBR Han River Basin Survey (para. 1.06) found that the existing
reservoirs on the Soyang and Hwacheon rivers, both tributaries of the North
Han, would provide sufficient flow regulation to meet water demands in the
Lower Han until the mid-1980s. Following a comparison of a number of poten-
tial projects and different sequences of development, USBR recommended the
construction of the Chungju Project to be in service by 1985. In 1976,
ISWAC0 retained Engineering Consultants Incorporated (ECI) of Denver, USA to
carry out a feasibility study of the Chungju Project and to prepare contract
documents. These services were financed by USAID. ECI updated the USBR
studies and reached the same findings as USBR in regard to the timing of
additional storage in the Han Basin.
1.21      Chungju is clearly superior to other potential projects, and also
to any sequence of alternative projects, as the next development in the Han
Basin. Compared with other potential storage projects in the Han Basin, the
Chungju Project would have the largest reservoir capacity, the lowest cost
per unit of storage, and the largest potential for hydroelectric power and
flood control. The project would provide almost complete regulation of the
runoff from 26% of the catchment area of the Han Basin. No other project in
the Basin can regulate so large a part of the Basin's runoff. Studies
carried out during project appraisal (Annex 2) confirmed the USBR and ECI
findings that the frequency and magnitude of surface water shortages in the
Lower Han would reach unacceptable levels in the mid-1980s, and that cons-
truction of the project to be operational by 1985 was justified. There has
been a four-fold increase in water use by cities and industries over the past
ten years, and demands are projected to more than double over the next ten
years. By 1986, without the project, there would be a 20% chance of significant
dry-season shortages in an area containing nearly one-half of Korea's industry
and one-third of its population. The project would also provide 460 MW of
peaking capacity to help meet Korea's power demands which are expected to
grow from 5,300 MW at present to 12,000 MW by the mid 1980s. Further justifi-
cation for the project rests on the urgent need to provide flood control to
prevent widespread damage which in the past has occurred about once in four
years.
1.22      ECI's report recommended construction of a concrete gravity dam
with a crest at El. 150.5 (about 100 m above the river bed), a normal conser-
vation level of El. 140.5, and top of gates at El. 147.0. The capacity of
600 MCM between El. 140.5 and El. 147 would be used for temporary storage for
flood control purposes. The report recommended installation of three 70 MW
generating units with the intake and power tunnel sized to permit future
installation of two additional units.
1.23      ECI investigated two alternatives to a concrete dam: a rockfill
dam with a central clay core, and a rockfill dam with an upstream concrete
membrane. These alternatives did not show any appreciable cost savings.



A concrete dam was, therefore, selected because river diversion would be
simpler and the consequences of an unprecedented flood during construction
would be less serious than with a rockfill alternative.
1.24      Although the dam site and reservoir topography would permit a
higher dam than proposed, the conservation level at El. 140.5 was oetermined by
the presence at the edge of the reservoir of a cement plant which has a floor
level of El. 142. An existing embankment surrounding the plant would be
raised to protect the plant during the short periods when the temporary flood
storage is used and the reservoir level rises above El. 142. During such
periods rail access to and from the plant would be interrupted.
1.25      In March 1978, ISWACO appointed Nippon Koei, a Japanese consult-
ing firm, to design the project and supervise its construction. The only
significant change from the feasibility design is the location of the power-
house on the right bank instead of the left bank as proposed by ECI. Other
changes are an increase in powerplant capacity to 460 MW (4 units of 115 MW
each), and lowering the height of dam by three meters to ease the problem of
protecting the cement plant from inundation.
1.26      Consideration was given in the ECI report to the possibility of
increasing the height of the dam by about 30 m at some time in the future.
This would not significantly increase the project's capability to control
river flows for water supply or flood control. With a higher dam the power
and energy output would be increased, but the benefits would not justify the
considerable cost of raising the dam, including the relocation of three
cement plants. Accordingly, ISWACO has decided that no provision would be
made in the design of the project for future raising.
2. THE HAN RIVER BASIN
General
2.01      The Han Basin (Map IBRD 13282) covers 26,200 sq km, or 26% of
Korea's land area, and contains nearly one-third of Korea's population of
35 million. The Han River system consists of two main branches, the North Han
and South Han, which join about 35 km upstream from Seoul to form the Lower
Han which flows through Seoul to the Yellow Sea. Besides the capital city
of Seoul with its population of 7.3 million, the port of Incheon (population
1.2 million) and the cities of Suweon and Anyang are dependent on the Han
River for municipal and industrial water. The industries of the Han Basin,
of which the greatest concentration is in the Seoul-Incheon area, account for
nearly 50% of Korea's industrial production. Because of its rugged terrain
only 400,000 ha, or 15% of the Basin, is cultivated and this area accounts
for 18% of Korea's cultivated land. About 140,000 ha is presently irrigated
from the Han River and its tributaries.
Climate
2.02      Korea lies in the path of warm, moist, southeasterly air currents
from the Pacific Ocean in the summer, and a northeasterly front of cold, dry



-8-
air from the Asian land mass in the winter. The summer extends from May
through September with temperatures reaching 30 degrees centigrade. December
and January are the coldest months with temperatures often below freezing.
Seoul has about 220 frost-free days, whereas the mountainous areas of the Han
Basin have about 140. Annual precipitation averages about 1,200 mm at Seoul
and about 1,070 mm at Chungju. At higher elevations annual precipitation
averages about 1,300 mm. About 70% of the annual precipitation occurs in
four months - June, July, August and September. It is not unusual for 30%
of the annual rainfall to occur in one month. Typhoons and frontal storms in
the summer can produce intense rainfall and flooding, and storms producing
more than 400 mm of rainfall in 24 hours have been recorded at Seoul and
other stations in the Basin.
Water Resources
2.03      Surface Water.  The average annual runoff of the Han River at
Paldang, just downstream of the confluence of the North and South Han, is
about 15,000 MCM. A high percentage of the annual precipitation, about
55%, appears as runoff because of the Basin's steep and rocky terrain. About
65% of the annual runoff occurs in the July-September period, and less than
20% in the six-month dry season from October to March.
2.04      The Lower Han is affected by tides in the Yellow Sea and at low
flows sea water intrudes up the river as far as Seoul. Although the main
intake for Seoul municipal supplies will be moved upstream of Paldang in the
near future, some major intakes for municipal, industrial, and irrigation
water will remain in areas subject to salinity intrusion. A minimum flow of
100-135 cu m/sec is needed to control salinity intrusion in the Lower Han
and also to dilute the industrial and municipal wastes discharged into the
river.
2.05      Annual surface water use in the Basin is about 2,000 MCM at present
(municipal 550 MCM, industrial 500 MCM, and irrigation 950 MCM). In addition
the annual salinity and pollution control requirement is about 3,000 MCM.
Seoul, which accounts for a large part of the municipal demand, has increased
its treatment capacity 400% in ten years and work is in progress for a
further 50% increase in capacity. Industrial demands have increased at a
rate of nearly 20% in recent years, and new industrial estates with large
water demands are planned in the near future. Irrigation use which is
largely confined to periods of high river flows is also increasing. Shortages
of irrigation water are becoming more frequent in June when low river flows
often coincide with peak irrigation demands.
2.06      Floods occur every year in the Han Basin and about once in every
four years the floods cause widespread damage to property and crops. The
Basin's second highest recorded flood occurred as recently as August 1972 and
caused damage estimated at US$25 million. There have been ten flood events
of a similar magnitude in the 60-year period of record, and numerous lesser
floods which have also caused significant damage.



- 9 -
2.07      Groundwater.  Good quality groundwater is found in many places
in the Basin, but aquifer yields are highly variable. The best yields are
found in alluvial formations of the Lower Han, and particularly along its
southern tributary the Anyang River. In some places the alluvium is 20 m
deep and averages about 14 m. USBR has estimated that about 350 MCM of
groundwater is stored in the alluvium along the main stream of the Lower Han
and about 200 MCM in the Anyang alluvium. These groundwater reservoirs
cannot be considered as independent water sources since experience in the
Anyang sub-basin shows that heavy withdrawals induce infiltration of surface
water and significantly deplete dry-season river flows. Groundwater is used
extensively at Anyang for industry, but primarily as cooling water because
the recharge is polluted by industrial wastes. The saprolite of bedrock
,Dedrock disintegrated in place) is a common source of groundwater throughout
the Basin for villages and farms.
Land Resources
2.08      The 370,000 ha of cultivated land in the Basin consists of 165,000
ha of paddy and 205,000 ha of upland. The paddy land is devoted to a
single summer crop of rice with barley grown on about 30% of the area in the
winter. The uplands are intensively cultivated in the summer for crops such
as soybeans, peppers, tobacco and vegetables, and about 40% of the area is
planted to barley in the winter. In the Han Basin, as in the rest of Korea,
the past 15 years have seen a substantial increase in the irrigated area and
about 80% of the Basin's paddy land is now irrigated. The uplands are not
generally irrigated because of the steep slopes, uneven topography and
distance from water sources.
2.09      Except for the possible reclamation of about 40,000 ha of tidal
flats at the mouth of the Lower Han, virtually all of the land suited to crop
cultivation is already in use. Large areas of uncultivated land are under
forest and the lower slopes are used by the farming communities as sources
of fuel wood. Over the past ten years the Government has implemented a major
program of reforestation in Korea and the use of forest land is strictly
controlled.
Present Status of Development
2.10      The surface water resources of the Han Basin have been partially
developed. There are seven completed dams with hydroelectric plants, and
numerous small reservoirs, diversion weirs and pumping plants used for
irrigation. The Soyang Multipurpose Project, completed in 1973 on the
Soyang River, a tributary of the North Han, is the largest project. It has
an active storage of 1,700 MCM and an installed capacity of 200 MW. Next in
size is the Hwacheon Project on the North Han built in 1944, with 600 MCM of
active storage and an installed capacity of 108 MW. There are three run-of-
river hydroelectric projects on the North Han - Chuncheon (58 MW), Euiam
(45 MW), and Chongpyeong (80 MW) - and a 3 MW project at Koesan on a tributary
of the South Han. The Paldang hydroelectric project (80 MW) was completed in
1971 on the Lower Han just below the confluence of the North and South Han.
The hydroelectric plants of the Han Basin accounted for about 20% of Korea's



- 10 -
generating capacity in the early 1970s, but will account for a much lower
proportion as new thermal and nuclear plants are added to meet Korea's
rapidly growing power demands.
2.11      An important function of the Soyang Project is to augment the
dry-season flow in the Lower Han which is the main source of municipal and
industrial water for Seoul, Incheon and the surrounding industrial areas.
Water use in the Lower Han is now about four times what it was ten years
ago. The Soyang Project also helps to control floods in the North Han by
providing almost complete control of the runoff from some 2,700 sq km, or
25% of the catchment area of the North Han.
2.12      Irrigation has been practiced in the Han Basin since ancient times,
but it consisted essentially of efforts by small groups of farmers to conserve
rainfall and control local runoff.  Some small storage   and diversion dams
were built in the 1920s, but it is only since the early 1960s that major
efforts have been made to use the water resources of the Han River and its
tributaries for irrigation. The rapid development of irrigation in the
Basin has been stimulated by land reform and other Government policies aimed
at self-sufficiency in rice production. At present about 140,000 ha, mostly
paddy land, benefits from irrigation. Most of the irrigation is by diversion
from rivers and streams, either by means of weirs or by pumping, and there
are numerous small reservoirs on the tributaries of the main rivers to
conserve runoff for irrigation use. Direct diversions are made from the Han
River and its two main branches for several large irrigation schemes, such
as the irrigation of the Kimpo Plain from a major pumping plant downstream
of Seoul. Farmers have also made increasing use of groundwater in recent
years to supplement surface water, particularly in the early part of the
growing season.
2.13      The rapid urban and industrial development of the Basin, coupled
with the more intensive cultivation of farm lands, has created a situation in
which the consequences of flooding are much more serious than in the past.
An extensive system of flood embankment to protect the low-lying areas of
Seoul has been built in recent years. Also, some particularly vulnerable
towns and agricultural areas in the North and South Han are protected by
embankments.
3. DAMSITE AND RESERVOIR
Location
3.01      The damsite is on the South Han about 110 km southeast of Seoul.
The city of Chungju (population 110,000) is 6 km from the damsite. Chungju
is connected to Seoul by railway and a recently completed expressway. An
access road from Chungju to the damsite was completed in 1978.
Hydrology
3.02      Daily staff gage readings are available from 1917 to 1940 for a
station sited about 10 km downstream of the damsite. In 1956 the station was



- 11 -
moved about 4 km upstream to a highway bridge and in 1968 it was equipped
with a water level recorder. ECI developed rating curves for these two
stations and used them to compute daily discharges for the periods 1917-1940
and 1956-1974. The average annual runoff for the 43 years of record is
5,200 MCM of which 60% occurs in July, August and September. Reservoir
operation studies (para. 4.08) show that the reservoir would almost com-
pletely regulate the runoff of the South Han at the damsite. The minimum
monthly runoff in the dry season, which at present often falls below 20 MCM
would be increased to 200 MCM in normal operation. In months of exceptionally
low runoff, dry-season outflow from the reservoir could be further increased
to meet demands in the Lower Han.
3.03      The highest recorded flood at the damsite occurred in August 1972
when the peak discharge was estimated as 14,000 cu m/sec. Two other flood
peaks exceeding 10,000 cu m/sec occurred in 1936 and 1959. The most severe
flood for the Han Basin as a whole occurred in 1925 and the peak at Chungju
was 9,000 cu m/sec. The project is designed to pass safely a probable
maximum flood of 26,700 cu m/sec with a volume of 3,500 MCM.
3.04      The proposed reservoir would greatly reduce the frequency and
magnitude of floods in the South Han. The reservoir would be drawn down to
its lowest level by the end of June and then the normal operating level would
be gradually increased up to the end of August in such a way as to maximize
flood control without jeopardizing the filling of the reservoir by the end of
the wet season (para. 4.09). A study of recorded floods shows that the flow
below the damsite could be kept within the safe channel capacity of the river
except for a few exceptional floods which would however be significantly
reduced (see Annex 4).
Sedimentation
3.05      Records of suspended sediment load and bed material data are
available for the gaging station near the damsite for the three year period
1969-1971. On the basis of these data, the feasibility report presents a
curve relating total sediment discharge to river discharge. This rating
curve, when applied to daily flow data for the 43 years of streamflow record,
results in an estimated annual average sediment yield of 5.4 million tons
from the 6,648 sq km drainage basin above the damsite. For practical purpose
the trap efficiency of the reservoir can be assumed as 100%, and if the
in-place density of the sediment is assumed to be 1.2 tons/cu m, the average
annual sediment deposit would be 4.5 MCM. Thus, the total sediment deposited
in 50 years would be over 200 MCM, or about 10% of the reservoir's gross
storage capacity. Although these estimates are based on a short period of
sediment data, it can be concluded that it would be many years before sediment
deposition would have any material effect on the functioning of the project.
Damsite and Reservoir Geology
3.06      The valley at the damsite is about 120 m wide at river level and
450 m wide at the crest level of the proposed dam. On the right bank, the
dam axis is at the center of a rock slide area consisting of a disturbed
rock mass overlying the schist bedrock. The slide area which extends 80-100 m



- 12 -
into the abutment from the surface is stable under present conditions.
However, the excavation needed to found the dam and powerhouse on the schist
bedrock, would create a potential for a landslide. Therefore, extensive
excavation will be required to remove the slide material. About 200 m upstream
of the dam the slide zone merges into a "slump zone", which could become unstable
following the filling of the reservoir. The slump zone is similar in appearance
to bedrock but contains numerous shear zones and stress-relief fractures. To
preserve its stability, the toe of the slump zone will be weighted by placing
material excavated from the slide area.
3.07      The left bank consists of quartzite for about 50 m above the river
followed by dolomitic limestone. Sound rock is exposed in the lower part of
the left abutment and 8-20 m of overburden would have to be removed in the
upper part. There is some evidence of karsticity in the dolomite. However,
dolomite is not very susceptible to solution and karsticity is likely to be
localized and not present problems which cannot be handled by normal con-
struction procedures. The foundation for the dam in the river section is
composed of excellent rock, the quartzite/schist contact is near the left
bank and the rest of the river channel is in schist.
3.08      There are numerous faults at, and in the vicinity of, the damsite.
None are active or of engineering significance in terms of the design or
future safety of the dam, except for the faulting in the slump zone on the
right bank. In the major faults the fault material has been replaced by
amphibolite intrusions.
3.09      Seismicity in Korea is very minor in relation to damage effects
when compared to nearby areas of the "Circum-Pacific Belt." Seismic records
for Korea began in 1905. Since then 313 earthquakes have been recorded,
compared to thousands in Japan over the same period, and have produced
little property damage. Dam design criteria will provide for the potential
effects of minor seismic activity.
3.10      Above the town of Danyang, an area of well developed karsticity is
present in limestone bands enclosed within other sedimentary rocks. This
karstic limestone will not be a leakage problem as it is underlain by dense,
tight igneous rocks. The geologic conditions in the reservoir do not indicate
any features which will need remedial treatment and there are no indications
of any areas of potential leakage out of the basin.
Construction Materials
3.11      Construction of the dam will require about 1,100,000 cu m of coarse
aggregate, 550,000 cu m of sand, and 285,000 tons of cement. There are
deposits of sand and gravel suitable for use as concrete aggregate along the
river channel both upstream and downstream of the damsite. However, the
largest deposits sufficient to meet the needs of the project are more than
6 km from the dam. A potential quarry site in the dolomite just upstream of
t:he damsite has also been identified and tests show that this material would
be suitable for concrete aggregate. Korea is a major cement producer and
there are several cement plants within 60 km of the damsite.

The Reservoir Area
3.12      Land Use and Population.  At a reservoir level of El. 145 the
reservoir would have a gross surface area of 9,800 ha. ISWACO, in coopera-
tion with the provincial authorities, would acquire and pay compensation for
all land and property below El. 145 (Chapter 5). The possibility of the
reservoir rising above El. 145 is remote, and poses less risk than the river
flooding experienced in areas presently cultivated. Present land use in the
reservoir area is as follows:
Land Use                          Area (ha)
Paddy land                            1,210
Cultivated upland                     2,510
Forest                                1,320
Towns and villages                      450
Roads and railways                      120
River channel                         1,500
Unproductive land                     2,690
9,800
3.13      Virtually all of the land suitable for crop cultivation has already
been developed, and all of the 3,720 ha of cultivated land and 1,320 ha of forest
land is owned by the farmers. The cropping pattern is described in para.
2.08. The forest land is used primarily as a source of fuel wood and fodder.
The timber has no commercial value and cuttings of trees is strictly con-
trolled by government regulations and local custom. The unproductive land is
mainly mountainous terrain, with no economic value, owned by the Government.
3.14      The area which would be inundated by the reservoir has a population
of 51,000 made up of some 9,300 families. Of these, 8,300 families own
6,320 ha of cultivated land of which 3,720 ha is within the reservoir area.
The farm size distribution (excluding forest) is shown in Table 3.1. There
is no clear distinction between urban and rural families since it is common
for families living and working in the town of Danyang (part of which is
below El. 145) and other communities to own and farm small plots of land.
However, nearly 90% of the reservoir population can be assumed as primarily
dependent on agriculture for their livelihood.

3.15      Industrial Plants.  The only major industrial plant to be affected
by the reservoir will be the Sungjin Cement Plant. At the plant an existing
dike will be raised to protect the plant when, for short periods, the flood
storage space of the reservoir is used for flood control. Several small lime
and fertilizer plants will also be relocated.
3.16      Mines.  Most of the mineral deposits along the length of the
reservoir are above the proposed reservoir level. Measures will be needed,
however, to ensure continued operation of the Danyang Talc Mine. These will
include sealing the present entrance to the mine at El. 137 and closing
several disused entrances. The area between Chungju and Danyang is one of
the principal fluorite processing areas in Korea, but only one mine would be
affected by the reservoir. This is the Chungi mine at El. 120, with reserves
of about 100,000 tons of 60% fluorite, which ceased operation because of
financial difficulties in 1972. Although marginal, the mine could conceivably
be worked again in the future and some compensation may be negotiated
between the present owner and the Government.
3.17      Infrastructure.  About 100 km of roads would be relocated along with
10 km of the Seoul-Pusan railroad. Further details are given in Chapter 4.
Also about 80 km of 66 kV and 22 kV transmission lines and two substations
will be relocated.

4. THE PROJECT
Project Description
4.01      The principal features of the proposed Chungju Multipurpose Project
are summarized below and illustrated in Figures 4.1 and 4.2:
(a) construction of a 90 m high concrete dam on the South Han
River;
(b) construction of a powerhouse below the dam on the right bank
of the river;
(c) supply and installation of four 115 MW generating units and
appurtenant mechanical and electrical equipment;
(d) supply and erection of a 10 km long, 154 kV double-circuit
transmission line;
(e) construction of a reregulation dam about 20 km downstream of the
main dam;
(f) relocation of about 100 km of roads and 10 km of railway;
(g) construction of protective works in the reservoir area including
the raising of an existing flood embankment at a cement plant, and
miscellaneous works to ensure continued operation of a talc mine;
(h) implementation of a reservoir resettlement program including
compensation of some 9,300 families for land and property, and
assistance in their resettlement;
(i) consulting services for detailed design and construction super-
vision of the project;
(j) the services of an independent consulting panel to assist ISWACO
in their review and approval of the consultants' designs; and
(k) consulting services for detailed engineering of the Nakdong Barrage
Project, the next phase in the development of the Nakdong River
Basin.
Project Works
4.02      Main Dam and Spillway.  The concrete gravity dam would have a
maximum height above streambed of about 90 m and a crest length of 450 m.
The upstream face would be vertical and the downstream face would have a
slope of 0.75 to 1. The spillway would have five 22 m high radial gates with
a span of 15 m. A stilling basin at the toe of the dam would dissipate
the energy of the spillway discharge. The dam would contain about 900,000 cu
m of concrete. A 7 m wide service bridge would be provided along the top
of the dam. The only unusual feature of the dam will be the excavation of
some 5 million cu m of slide material on the right abutment (para. 3.06).



- 16 -
4.03      Diversion Tunnels and Cofferdams.  A flood with a 25-year return
period is generally adopted for the design of river diversion works during
construction. The 25-year flood for the wet season (July-September) is
10,500 cu m/s, and for the dry season (October-June) it is 3,5000 cu m/sec.
In the proposed diversion scheme, a concrete cofferdam would be built upstream
and a rockfill cofferdam downstream of the damsite. The downstream cofferdam
would be armored with large rocks and heavy cable mesh to withstand overflow
in the wet season. The dry season flow would be diverted through two 12 m
diameter, concrete-lined, diversion tunnels each about 500 m in length.
It would be too costly to provide for diversion of the wet-season flood
since it would require additional tunnels and higher cofferdams. There-
fore, during wet seasons following completion of the tunnels, the cofferdams
would be overtopped and the river allowed to flow through the dam site.
4.04      Power Facilities.  The power plant would be located at the toe of
the dam on the right bank. Individual penstocks, each 6 m diameter, would
connect the generating units to the power intakes in the dam. The power-
house would be equipped with four 115 MW generating units. The switchyard
would be about 1,000 m from the powerhouse and would be linked to it by one
single-circuit and one double-circuit 154 kV transmission line.   A 10-km
long 154 kV double circuit line will link the switchyard to the main grid at
the Chungju substation.
4.05      Road and Rail Relocation.  Sections of two highways totalling
100 km, including bridges with a total length of 1,600 m, would require
relocation in the reservoir area. The railroad connecting Seoul to Busan
passes through the reservoir area. About 10 km of track would have to be
relocated, including eight tunnels with a total length of 930 m and eleven
bridges with a total length of 500 m. Also a new 400 m span rail bridge
across the South Han would be needed.
4.06      Protective Works in Reservoir.  An existing flood protection dike
surrounding the Sungjin cement plant would be raised by 1 m to El. 146. This
would protect the plant during short periods when the resevoir level rises
above its normal level of El. 140.5 for flood control. Works at the Danyang
Talc mine would include sealing of an entrance to the mine at El. 137 and two
disused entrances at El. 142 and El. 144. A new entrance would be opened at
El. 168. A retaining wall about 20 m high and 130 m long would be built to
retain the tailings from the mine and prevent the mine wastes from polluting
the reservoir.
4.07      Reregulation Dam.  During the dry season the outflow from the
Chungju reservoir will be released through the powerplant for two or three
hours each day. Thus, without provision for reregulation of these releases,
there would be wide fluctuations in the flow of the South Han. These changes
in flow would cause wide variations in water levels and cause operating
difficulties at the numerous intakes for irrigation, municipal and industrial
water along the river. The reregulation dam is located 20 km downstream of
the Chungju Dam and, with a storage capacity of 8 MCM, it would store the daily

inflow and release a uniform flow to the river. The dam would consist of a
gate-controlled concrete weir about 340 m long with a crest at El. 58.0,
some 8 m above its bedrock foundation. It would have twenty, 15 m wide bays,
three of which would be controlled by 5 m high radial gates. These gates
will control outflow in the dry season when the other bays would be closed by
stoplogs. Reregulation of powerplant releases would be unnecessary during the
wet season and the stoplogs would be raised to permit passage of flood
flows.
Reservoir Operation Studies
4.08      The maximum conservation level of the reservoir at El. 140.5 is
aictated by the presence of the Sungjin cement plant at the eastern end of
the reservoir which has a floor level at El. 142. The reservoir's gross
storage capacity at El. 140.5 is 2,200 MCM. The top of the spillway gates is
at El. 145 and gross storage at this level is 2,600 MCM. The reservoir
storage between El. 140.5 and El. 145 would be for temporary storage of flood
inflows. Table 4.1 shows the relationship between reservoir level, reservoir
content and generator output.

t.09       The feasibility report proposed a mode of operation in which the
reservoir would be drawn down to El. 110 by the end of each dry season and
-hen allowed to fill as quickly as possible to El. 140.5. During appraisal,
alternative modes of reservoir operation were investigated to improve the
project's power characteristics and provide a higher degree of flood control.
These studies, described below, are based on simulations of reservoir
operation using a 43-year sequence of monthly reservoir inflows. The
aim of the studies was to develop operating rules which would:
(a)   maximize the project's flood control function without jeopard-
izing the filling of the reservoir at the end of the flood season;
(b)   maintain peaking capability at or close to 460 MW throughout the
year; and
(c)   given these objectives, to determine the minimum monthly plant
factor and average annual energy generation.
4.10       The following rules were evolved:
Rule A: Gradually draw down the reservoir during the dry season so
that by the end of June it would be no higher than El. 130,
thus providing 1,120 MCM of storage capacity for flood control.
Rule B: Allow the reservoir to rise to El. 136 by the end of July,
to El. 138 by the end of August, and to El. 140.5 in September.
Rule C. Regulate the monthly dry-season outflow to maintain a plant
factor of not less than 10%.
4.11       The application of these rules is shown in Table 4.2 for the
year 1931, a year of average reservoir inflow. The rules are compatible with
the water supply function of the reservoir since they result in dry-season
releases of about 200 MCM/month which substantially exceeds the unregulated
flow in months of low runoff. The dry season flow could be increased above
200 MCM/month if needed to meet demands in the Lower Han, by temporarily
relaxing Rule C. The application of Rule C during the years of low runoff
would result in excessive reservoir draw-down and loss of peaking capability,
and under these circumstances the target plant factor of 10% might have to be
reduced for a few months. For the 43-year sequence of river flows the average
annual energy generation is 770 GWh. The peaking capability falls below 460
MW less than 10% of the time and very rarely falls below 400 MW. The monthly
plant factor is 10% for six to seven months in most years. In the remaining
months the plant factor is substantially higher but varies considerably from
year to year.
4.12       The mode of operation described above could be followed during
about the first ten years of the project's life. As water demands in the
Lower Han increase further after 1995, it will become necessary to draw
the reservoir down below El. 130, particularly in years of low runoff. The
effect of this will be to drop peaking capability below 460 MW for about 15%
of the time, and below 400 MW for about 10% of the time.

Investigations and Design
4.13      Prior to the ECI feasibility study, various planning studies and
investigations had been carried out over the preceding 20 years. Four
possible dam sites along a 5 km stretch of the South Han had been considered.
Two of these were rejected by the USBR Han River Survey Team because of the
very large volume of material needed to form the dam. ECI investigated the
remaining two sites, Axes 3 and 4. These were both ruled out because of
unfavorable geologic conditions on the right abutment. ECI identified a
suitable site between Axes 3 and 4 where the conditions on the right
abutment were relatively more favorable, although considerable excavation
would be needed (para. 3.06). Investigations during the feasibility study
included five adits to explore the right abutment, and a number of drill
holes on both abutments and in the river bed. Since the feasibility studies
were completed, ISWACO has continued site exploration to obtain additional
geologic data for detailed design. This has included extending three adits
on the dam axis beyond the limits of the slide zone. Drilling has also been
carried out to test the water tightness of the left abutment and to determine
requirements for pressure grouting below the dam.
4.14      The feasibility designs prepared by ECI were reviewed by the proj-
ect consultants appointed in March 1978 (para. 5.08). Their findings together
with a revised cost estimate were submitted to ISWACO in May 1978. The
consultants' report has been reviewed by ISWACO with the help of its consulting
panel (para. 5.09). Following this review, the consultants have prepared a
final design report and bid documents, and bid invitation for the dam and
power house is now scheduled for April 15, 1979.
4.15      A survey of land, property, and infrastructure in the reservoir
area was carried out in 1976 in the course of the feasibility study to provide
a basis for cost estimates. A more detailed survey to form a basis for land
and property acquisition for payment of compensation is being undertaken
by ISWACO and the provincial authorities (para. 5.16).
Construction Schedule
4.16      The project would be implemented over a period of six years,
including one year of preconstruction activities (Figure 4.3). Construction
would begin shortly after the award of the main civil works contract in
August 1979.  Construction of the diversion tunnels would be
completed in time to divert the river by December 1981. During 1980 and 1981
excavation would proceed on the left and right abutments. Placing of concrete
in the dam would begin by March 1982. The construction of the dam, including
installation of spillway gates, would be completed by the end of 1984.



- 21 -
Construction of the powerhouse would begin towards the end of 1981. The
generating units would be installed over a 24-month period beginning in
January 1983. The reregulating dam would be constructed over a three-year
period beginning in October 1981.
Cost Estimates
4.17      The total project cost is estimated at US$510 million, of which
US$236 million or 46% is foreign exchange. The foreign exchange component
reflects the large volume of excavation and concrete for which much of the
equipment and fuel will be imported, and also the fact that the turbine and
generators will be imported. The quantity estimate is taken from the consul-
tants' design report of May 1978 (para. 4.14) and their December 1978 report
on measures needed to achieve a stable slope on the right abutment. The
assumptions made in the consultants' report are, on present evidence, conserva-
tive. Unit prices and the costs of generating equipment, which include about
10% for taxes and duties, are in line with the recent bid prices for similar
work. The base cost estimate is in mid-1979 prices. Physical contingencies
of 15% have been applied to all civil works and materials, and 10% to equipment
costs. Compensation costs are based on the survey made during the feasibility
study and some recent data collected by ISWACO. Prices for land and property
are in line with recent compensation payments on Government-sponsored projects.
Expected price increases over the implementation period amount to 21% of
the base cost plus physical contingencies and assume the following annual
rates of price escalation:

Financing and Disbursements
4.18      The proposed Bank loan of US$125 million would finance 53% of
the foreign exchange requirement of US$236 million. An OECF loan of Yen
14,000 million (US$70 million equivalent) wouild finance 30% of the foreign
exchange requirement. Further financing would be needed in the amount of
approximately US$20 million for the supply and installation of one generating
unit (Unit 4) which is not covered by the above loans. An assurance was
obtained that the Government would arrange to provide ISWACO with such finan-
cing by June 1980. The estimated balance of project costs, of W 143 billion
(US$295 million) would be met by annual Government budgetary allocations to
ISWACO. A financing plan showing the allocation of the proceeds of the Bank

and OECF loans is shown in Table 4.4. For the Bank loan, ISWACO would be the
Borrower. Disbursements from the proposed Bank loan would be completed by
December 1984.

Procurement
4.19      Contracts for civil works construction and the supply of gates and
materials, except as noted in para. 4.20, would be awarded on the basis of
international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank Group guidelines.
There would be two major civil works contracts; one for the main dam, spillway
and power house (US$95 million), and one for the reregulating dam (US$10 mil-
lion), excluding contingencies and expected price increases. The total value
of contracts for the supply and installation of spillway gates, intake gates,
outlet valves and penstocks would be about US$21 million and for road and rail
relocation about US$30 million. ISWACO's policy is to supply contractors with
the cement and steel to be incorporated in the works. Materials would be
procured on behalf of ISWACO by the Office of Supply, Republic of Korea
(OSROK). Contracts would be awarded with total values of US$11 million for
cement and US$3 million for reinforcing steel; these would be divided into



- 24 -
several contracts to keep the supply of materials in line with requirements.
A preference limited to 15% of the c.i.f. price of imported goods or the
customs duty, whichever is lower, would be extended to local manufacturers in
the evaluation of bids.
4.20      Contracts for protective works in the reservoir (US$3 million) would
be spread over a wide area and divided into a number of small contracts, and
would therefore be awarded after local competitive bidding. Contracts for the
supply of turbines, generators and related powerhouse equipment (US$69 million)
would be awarded following international competitive bidding according to
OECF guidelines.
Accounts and Audits
4.21      Assurances were obtained that ISWACO would maintain separate
accounts for the project and would employ independent auditors, acceptable
to the Bank to audit project accounts annually; and that the audited accounts,
together with the auditor's comments, would be sent to the Bank within four
months of the close of each financial year.
Environmental Impact
4.22      The displacement of some 9,300 families from the reservoir area
would be the main adverse environmental effect of the project. Prompt and
adequate compensation, combined with other measures described in Chapter 5,
would considerably ease the social problems faced by the reservoir population
in finding new land, homes, and employment. Downstream effects will be
almost entirely positive. Flood control will considerably reduce the
incidence of damage in the flood plains of the South Han and to a lesser
extent in the Lower Han. The reduced flood risk will lead to enhanced
agricultural production in the flood plains. There are no areas of flood-
dependent agriculture which would be affected by the changes in flood regime.
The release of essentially sediment-free water from the reservoir may create
a tendency for increased river bank erosion. However, this will be offset by
the considerable reduction in flood flows which are a major source of bank
erosion. Surveys carried out as part of the feasibility study found no
significant archeological, historical or cultural sites in the reservoir
area. A further conclusion of the survey was that there would be no signi-
ficant detrimental or beneficial impact on wildlife, but it was noted that
the reservoir could become an important fisheries resource.

5. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
Implementing Agency
5.01      The Industrial Sites and Water Resources Development Corporation
(ISWACO), a government owned corporation, would be responsible for project
implementation. ISWACO was established on February 1, 1974 to (a) promote
and develop industrial sites for heavy and chemical industries and (b) develop
water resources for irrigation, flood control, electric power generation,
industrial and municipal water supply. ISWACO's predecessor was the Korea
Water Resources Development Corporation (KWRDC) which was established on
November 1, 1967 and dissolved on ISWACO's creation. ISWACO has planned and
constructed five industrial esates, three shipyards, and four multipurpose
iams. Three industrial estates and two multipurpose dams are presently under
construction.
5.02      ISWACO has developed into a large and competent organization with
a head office staff of 400 and another 400 in its branch offices. The
organizational structure of ISWACO consists of a President, a Vice-President
and seven Directors who are all appointed for a three-year period and an
auditor for a two-year period. The Board of Directors, which makes both
management and policy decisions, is composed of the President, the Vice-
President and the Directors. The Ministry of Construction (MOC) exercises
the Government's authority in matters dealing with ISWACO. The President of
ISWACO is appointed by the President of the Republic of Korea. The Vice-
President and the Directors are appointed by the Minister of Construction.
Any loans applied for by ISWACO have to be approved by MOC. The amount of
Government's annual capital contribution to ISWACO is determined by the
President of the Republic of Korea in consultation with other ministries,
including MOC.
5.03      ISWACO is a government-owned corporation which acts as the Govern-
ment 's agent or implementing agency for the construction of industrial sites
and multipurpose dams. With an authorized capital of W 200 billion, of
which W 49.3 billion has been paid as of December 31, 1978, ISWACO is owned
71.5% by the Government and 28.5% by the Korean Development Bank (KDB).
ISWACO's industrial sites and multipurpose dam operations are conducted
independently and with separate accounts.
5.04      ISWACO's chief sources of funds are periodic capital subscriptions
by the government, loans from KDB, foreign loans and revenues from its opera-
tions. Construction of industrial sites is financed partly from the Govern-
ment's contribution towards capital and by long-term loans from KDB; after
completion, these industrial sites together with related loan obligations are
sold to users at a price marginally above cost. Multipurpose dam construc-
tion is financed mainly by the Government's capital contribution and foreign
loans. The Soyang-River Dam and the Andong Dam, both owned and operated by
ISWACO, provide ISWACO revenues only from the sale of energy to KECO. The
revenues from this energy, determined by contract between KECO and ISWACO,
cover operating and maintenance costs, and provide a 3% rate of return on a
rate base which includes revalued assets and working capital allocated to
power. This return is designed to cover debt service assigned to the dams.



- 26 -
TSWACO does not receive any revenue on the water supplied from its dams; the
Government, through MOC, however, collects a raw water charge from all
entities diverting water from Korea's major rivers.
5.05      As of December 31, 1977, ISWACO had net assets of about W 124.4 bil-
lion as summarized below:
W billion
Net current assets                    4.23
Net fixed assets                    120.17
Net total assets                    124.40
Represented by:
Long term debt                       59.07
Equity                               65.33
Assets are revalued in accordance with the Assets Appraisal Law of Korea.
ISWACO takes the exchange risk on foreign loans. ISWACO's liquidity position
is good, current ratio of 1.34 is adequate and a Debt/Equity ratio of 47/53
provides the capacity for additional borrowing.
5.06      As stated earlier, the main sources of income are sales of power
and industrial sites. In 1977, the ratio of net income to operating assets
was a low 0.1% and the ratio of net income to capital and reserve accounts
only 0.16%. This is due to the Government's policy for the sale of indus-
trial sites and energy (para. 5.04). ISWACO has not declared dividends
to date and is authorized to do so only after retained earnings reach 50%
of paid-in capital, a point unlikely to be reached for many years. However,
the Government does indirectly receive dividends from ISWACO's operations
when it collects raw water charges in river basins benefitted by the multi-
purpose dams.
Project Implementation
5.07      Responsibility for engineering and procurement would rest with
ISWACO headquarters at Daejeon, while construction supervision would be under
a project office to be set up by ISWACO at the damsite. ISWACO's Director of
Dam Construction would serve as Project Director reporting directly to the
President of ISWACO. The staff assigned to the project would be organized
in four divisions. The Civil Works and Power divisions would handle engineer-
ing and procurement in cooperation with the consultants (para. 5.08) and
project accounts would be maintained by the Accounting Division. The Field
Operations Division would provide staff to work with the consultant in
construction supervision, and would cooperate with local authorities in
implementing the reservoir compensation program (para. 5.12).
Consulting Services
5.08      Consulting services for project design and supervision is being
financed by OECF. In December 1977, ISWACO invited proposals for design
and construction from three consulting firms. Nippon Koei, a Japanese firm,



- 27 -
in association with Saman Engineering of Korea was selected in March 1978
and a contract was signed in May. Nippon Koei has wide experience in the
engineering of major hydroelectric projects in Korea and elsewhere. The
estimated cost of the consulting services is US$5.3 million. Average
billing rates per man-month are US$9,100 for expatriate staff and US$2,500
for Korean staff. The consultants, whose terms and conditions of employment
have been reviewed by the Bank, will provide the following services:
(a) detailed design and preparation of contract documents for the dam,
spillway and powerhouse;
(b) preparation of contract documents for mechanical and electrical
equipment;
(c) assistance to ISWACO in advertisement of bids, prequalification of
bidders, evaluation of bids and award of contracts for civil works
and equipment;
(d) supervision of civil works construction, inspection of equipment
fabrication, and supervision of equipment installation and
performance tests;
(e) review and certification of payment requests submitted by civil
works contractors and equipment suppliers;
(f) preparation of monthly and annual progress reports; and
(g) assistance to ISWACO in the initial operation of the project and
in establishing operation and maintenance procedures.
5.09      ISWACO will assign staff to work closely with the consultants in
all aspects of project implementation, and will provide the majority of the
field inspection staff. The consultants will, where necessary, make arrange-
ments for on-the-job training of ISWACO staff. ISWACO has appointed a consul-
ting panel to advise its management in the review and approval of the consul-
tant's designs and to advise on any special technical problems encountered in
the design and construction of the project. As presently constituted, the
panel consists of a concrete dam design expert, an engineering geologist, and
a concrete technologist. Other specialists may be retained if necessary. The
panel met twice in 1978 and during implementation will visit Korea about twice
a year for periods of one to two weeks. ISWACO will also appoint a consulting
firm, on terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank, to prepare designs and
contract documents for the Nakdong Barrage project. Man-month inputs would be
on the order of 130 man-months of expatriate staff and 100 man-months of local
staff.
Operation and Maintenance
5.10      ISWACO has considerable experience in the operation and maintenance
of multipurpose projects. Key personnel of ISWACO's O&M staff for the Chungju
Project, some of whom will be experienced staff from existing projects, will
be employed in the inspection of equipment installation and performance
testing in order to become thoroughly familiar with the equipment and its



- 28 -
operation. The power plant will be an integral part of Korea's power system
and its daily operation will be coordinated with other generating plants
through the Korea Electric Company's central load dispatching system. The
principles of reservoir operation have been established in sufficient detail
for project formulation and assessment of project benefits. However, further
studies are needed to specify more detailed operating rules to be followed
in practice in order to maximize the benefits of the project. An assurance
was obtained that ISWACO would, by December 31, 1981, submit to the Bank
for review and comment detailed rules for reservoir operation.
5.11      The proposed dam is a major structure with a large volume of
storage and it would be situated so as to cause severe damage in the unlikely
event of failure. An assurance was obtained that ISWACO would arrange a
suitable maintenance and inspection program for the dam and would advise the
Bank in writing not later than December 31, 1983 as to how it proposes to meet
this obligation. The ISWACO proposal would include a description and schedule
of the maintenance and inspection program, the designation of the experts, if
any, to be employed, and, if applicable, a copy of their terms of reference.
The Bank would have an opportunity to comment on the proposals before they are
adopted.
Compensation for Land and Property
5.12      Details of population and land use in the reservoir area are
given in Chapter 3. About 9,300 families living in the reservoir would be
required to relocate and 3,700 ha of cultivated land would be acquired by
the Government. The total cost of land and property acquisition and other
forms of compensation is estimated at US$109 million exclusive of price
contingencies; details are given in Annex 1, Table 1. A major part of
this cost would be paid to 8,300 families as compensation for the portion
of their land holdings in the reservoir area. Payments for land would
average US$25,000/ha for paddy land and US$16,000/ha for cultivated upland.
Additional compensation would be paid for established tree crops. All
families, rural and urban, would receive removal and subsistence payments of
about US$220 per family. The average payment per farm household would be
about US$12,800 in 1979 prices.
5.13      In recent years, government agencies and local authorities in
Korea have gained considerable experience in land and property acquisition.
Since 1967, some 100,000 ha of farmland have been acquired to make way for
public works projects and industrial and urban development. The loss of
land has been more than offset by considerable growth in employment in the
industrial and service sectors. The Government's policy is to pay market
prices for land and property together with removal expenses and subsistence
payments during relocation. People displaced from their land make their own
decisions as to where to relocate and whether or not to resume their former
occupations. In Korea, a strategy of prompt and fair compensation is
preferred by the Government, and the families affected, to resettlement in
areas set aside by the Government. This approach recognizes the independence
and resourcefulness of the average Korean. It also recognizes the highly
articulated and sharply defined Korean lineage system which enables people



- 29 -
to keep track of a very large number of relatives. As a result of increased
geographic mobility in recent years, chiefly rural-urban migration, nearly
every Korean has a widespread personal network of kinship ties that can be
extremely useful in achieving such objectives as finding a job, a house or a
marriage partner. Korean sociologists, who have studied the relocation of
farmers from the Andong reservoir, as well as from a number of industrial
sites, stress the importance of such kinship connections in enabling displaced
families to resettle in other communities.
5.14      Since 1967, ISWACO and its predecessor organizations have implemented
projects entailing compensation for the acquisition of some 15,000 ha of
land. Notable among these are three major dams, Soyang, Andong and Daechung,
all involving the displacement of large reservoir populations. ISWACO's
charter specifies that the following privileges will be accorded to persons
displaced by their projects:
(a) access to low-interest loans under the Housing Construction
Promotion, and priority for purchase of lots in new towns established
by the Government;
(b) exemption from purchase and registration taxes applicable to real
estate transactions;
(c) preference in employment by contractors employed by ISWACO.
5.15      While the funds for compensation payments will be provided by ISWACO,
the implementation of the compensation program will be largely in the hands of
the provincial and county authorities. The Chungju reservoir covers parts of
three counties all in Chungchong province. A provincial committee would be
established to review and approve the assessed values of land and property.
The communities would be composed of members of the community under the
chairmanship of the Vice-Governor of the province. Compensation would be
based on the average values obtained from two independent appraisals by pro-
fessional appraisers; farmers and property owners have the right to appeal
assessments to the provincial committee.
5.16      A survey of land and property to form a basis for planning a
compensation program is being carried out by ISWACO in cooperation with local
authorities. This will update the information obtained from the 1976 survey
(para. 4.15). During negotiations, an assurance was obtained that ISWACO
would, by December 31, 1979, submit to the Bank for review and comment a
report presenting the results of this survey, together with a timetable for
the acquisition of property and for the payment of compensation. In addition,
a study is being carried out by a local research institute to help ISWACO
develop a comprehensive compensation program. The institute will survey
experience of people previously relocated from other reservoir areas. It will
also conduct a socio-economic census of the Chungju reservoir inhabitants and
obtain their views on future ambitions regarding location and type of work.
On the basis of these surveys, the study will recommend resettlement/compen-
sation methods for different income groups and occupations.
5.17      In order to widen the oportunities for farmers to purchase land
with the proceeds of their compensation payments, the Government gives



- 30 -
displaced farmers priority in the purchase of land in government-sponsored
tidal reclamation projects. This approach has been followed in ISWACO's
Daechung Project where a dam presently under construction on the Geum River
will displace about 4,000 families. An area of some 700 ha out of a total
2,400 ha of reclaimed tidal flats in the Bank-financed Pyongtaek-Kumgang
Project (Loan 600-KO) has been set aside for the purchase by applicants from
the Daechung reservoir at a price of US$10,000 per ha, with a 30% down payment
and the balance to be paid over 12 years with 3 years of grace and an interest
rate of 12%. This is potentially highly productive land and in 1977, the
first year of cultivation, good rice yields were achieved on about 1,700 ha of
recently settled land. The ongoing Bank-financed Yong San Gang Project:
Stage II (1364-KO) also includes 5,500 ha of tidal land which will be reclaimed
between 1980 and 1983. During negotiations an assurance was obtained that the
Government would give farmers displaced by the Chungju Project priority for
purchase of reclaimed tidal land including such land in Yong San Gang Stage II.
5.18      Also, some of the land acquired in the reservoir area will be
available for cultivation in the spring and early summer. All land below
El. 145 would be acquired, but about 600 ha of land in the draw-down zone
between El. 145 and El. 138 would not be inundated until the end of July at
the earliest. This could be used to raise spring vegetables (cabbage,
potatoes and radish) for which there is a strong demand. The purchase of
such land would be an attractive option for the farmers with smaller holdings.
During negotiations an assurance was obtained that by June 30, 1981 ISWACO
would present to the Bank for review and comment, a detailed proposal for the
allocation to displaced farm families of land in the draw-down zone of the
reservoir.
Project Charges
5.19      Power.  As in the case of other projects owned and operated by
ISWACO, the energy produced by the project would be purchased by KECO. During
negotiations, agreement was reached that the rate per kWh paid by KECO would
be set to provide ISWACO with annual revenues sufficient to cover operation
and maintenance costs, depreciation at an annual rate of 2%, and a return of
6% on the portion of the project's gross fixed assets allocated to power.
This would be equivalent to providing a discounted cash flow rate of return of
8%. An assurance was obtained during negotiations that (a) by June 1983,
ISWACO would submit to the Bank for review and comment a proposed rate per kWh
together with any relevant supporting data, and (b) ISWACO would establish and
impose by December 1983 a rate for energy sales acceptable to the Bank. A
provisional allocation of project costs between power, water supply, and
flood control was made using the separable costs-remaining benefits method.
About 65% of capital and O&M costs would be allocated to power, 20% to water
supply and 15% to flood control; on this basis, ISWACO would have to charge
W 18/kWh (37 mills/kWh) for energy sold to KECO.
5.20      Water Supply.  In the case of major multipurpose projects which
benefit in varying degrees a wide range of users, ISWACO does not impose
direct charges for water. A charge for raw water withdrawals at a rate of
W 4/cu m is, however, imposed on all users throughout the Basin by the
Ministry of Construction. Virtually all of the increase in water use in the



- 31 -
15-year period beginning in 1986 can be attributed to the Chungju Project
(para. 6.13). Incremental revenues from raw water charges due to the project
would provide a rate of return of about 10% on costs allocated to water
supply. The Government is presently reviewing tariffs for raw water with-
drawals in the Nakdong River Basin, and the findings of the review and any
subsequent tariff increases will be applied to other river basins in Korea.
5.21      Flood Control.  Although the economic benefits of flood control
would be significant, there is no way in which direct charges could be imposed
to recapture these benefits. A major part of the project's flood benefits
arise from elimination of flood damage. This, together with more productive
land use in the flood plains, will increase revenues to the Government and
local authorities, and reduce Government outlays for repair of public facilities
and flood relief programs. However, such financial benefits to the Government
have not been quantified since they cannot be estimated with any accuracy.



- 32 -
6. BENEFITS, JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
6.01      The proposed Chungju Multipurpose Project would meet the growing
demand for municipal, industrial and irrigation water in the Han Basin for
at least 15 years following its completion in 1984. It would also substan-
tially reduce flood damages in the South Han, generate an average of 770 GWh
annually, and provide 460 MW of peaking capacity for Korea's power system.
6.02      The rapid population growth and industrial development of the Han
Basin has been accompanied by a four-fold increase in water use over the past
ten years. A major factor in this development has been the surface water
storage provided by the existing reservoirs in the Han Basin which conserve
the monsoon flows for use in the six-month long dry season when only 20% of
the Basin's runoff occurs. The Chungju Project would provide the additional
storage needed by the mid-1980s when growing demands would exceed the regu-
lating capacity of the existing reservoirs. The projected water demands
in the Han Basin are summarized in Table 6.1. The basis for these demands
and the studies made to determine the Basin's storage needs are described in
Annex 2. In these studies a test of future demands was made against a
24-year sequence of historic flows taking into account existing reservoirs.
Without the Chungju Project, it was found that with 1986 demands there would
be significant shortages in 5 years of the sequence, and with 1991 demands
in 10 years of the sequence. Thus, the project is needed to ensure the
reliable source of water essential to the Basin's continued economic develop-
ment beyond the mid-1980s.
Table 6.1   WATER DEMANDS IN THE HAN BASIN
(MCM)
1976     1981      1986     1991      1996     2001
Municipal                      500      800    1,100    1,400    1,800    2,200
Industrial                    400       800    1,300    1,800    2,400    3,000
Irrigation                    900    1,000    1,100    1,400    1,500    1,600

6.03      In addition to meeting the storage needs of the Basin, the project
would provide a low-cost source of peaking capacity and energy to help meet
Korea's rapidly growing power demands. Peak demands are projected to grow
from 5,300 MW at present to 12,000 MW in 1985 and nearly 20,000 MW in 1990.
By 1985, efficient operation of the system will require that about 10% of the
installed capacity be designed to operate for short periods at times of peak
demand. An important contribution to this would be the 460 MW of capacity
provided by the project. A further important justification for the project
is the urgent need to control floods which about once in every four years
cause serious and widespread damage in the Basin.



- 33 -
6.04      Comparison of the project with investments in alternative facili-
ties to meet the above objectives shows that the Chungju Project is the
least-cost alternative. In addition to a least-cost analysis, the project's
economic rate of return was calculated. The methods and assumptions used in
carrying out these analyses and the results obtained are described below. In
summary, it was found that, for the project as whole, comparison with the
lowest-cost alternatives for water supply, flood control and power results in
an equalizing discount rate (EDR) of 19%. The economic rate of return was
found to be 12%.
6.05      Foreign Exchange.  Because of import duties and quantitative
restrictions, the official exchange rate understates the value to the economy
of foreign exchange used in carrying out the project and savings due to
reduced fuel imports. For this reason, a standard conversion factor (SCF) of
0.85 has been applied to all local costs and benefits before converting them
to US$ at the official exchange rate of US$1.00 = W 485.
6.06      Project Costs.  For purposes of project evaluation, the total
economic cost of the project in mid-1979 prices is US$313.2 million. This
consists of civil works (US$162.2 million), furnished materials (US$13.5 mil-
lion), equipment (US$67.8 million), reservoir compensation (US$45.6 million),
engineering and administration, including consulting services (US$24.1 mil-
lion). The costs of civil works, furnished materials and equipment were
reduced by 10% to exclude taxes. The economic cost of compensation for land
was expressed as the present value (at a discount rate of 12%) of agricultural
production which would be lost in the reservoir area. For this purpose,
farm-gate prices for crops and inputs, and farm labor costs are based on the
staff appraisal report on the Ogseo Area Development Project, (Report 1728-KO,
December 1977). All local costs were multiplied by the standard conversion
factor to express them in terms of shadow prices.
Least-Cost Analysis
6.07      This analysis compares the discounted cost stream of the Chungju
Project with the sum of the discounted cost streams of the lowest cost alter-
natives for meeting the same water and power demands. The selection of the
next lowest cost alternatives for water supply and power are described in
Annexes 2 and 3, and briefly summarized below.
6.08      Water Supply Alternative.  An alternative to Chungju in meeting
the storage needs of the Han Basin would be the sequential construction of
the following two projects:/1
(a)  Hongcheon dam on a tributary of the North Han.  Constructed by 1986
this would meet storage needs through 1991 (Cost US$176 million).
(b)  Yeoju dam on the South Han about 50 km downstream of the
Chungju site. This would be constructed to be operational
in 1992 and meet storage needs until about the year 2000
(Cost US$290 million).
/1 The combined economic cost of the two projects would be US$322 million.

Hydroelectric development would be justified at both projects but their
combined output (200 MW and 340 GWh) would be much less than Chungju. Flood
control benefits of Hongcheon and Yeoju would be about 15% of Chungju's flood
control benefits. For the least cost analysis, the cost stream for this
water supply alternative was reduced to compensate for these hydroelectric
and flood control benefits.
6.09      Power Alternatives.  The project was compared with four alternative
types of power plant which could be in service by 1985 - oil-fired steam, gas
turbine, combined cycle thermal, and pumped storage. Chungju and its alter-
natives would each have different operating characteristics and, therefore,
can only be compared in the context of the overall power system. A "with
Chungju" system was therefore compared to "without Chungju" systems with
capacity equivalent to Chungju provided by the four alternative types of
plant. Cost streams were developed for each of the four alternatives con-
sisting of initial capital costs, replacement costs, annual operation and
maintenance costs, and the difference in fuel costs between the "with
Chungju" system and a system with the alternative substituted for Chungju.
The gas turbine alternative was found to be the lowest cost of the four
alternatives at discount rates above 10%. The capital cost of this alterna-
tive is estimated at US$115.5 million (460 MW at US$250/kW) and the annual
incremental fuel cost would be US$25.9 million.
6.10      Flood Control.  The alternative to Chungju in providing flood
control in the South Han and the Lower Han would, theoretically, be the
construction of flood embankments and the raising of existing embankments.
In practice, it is unlikely that such an alternative to provide the same
degree of flood protection, would be technically and economically feasible.
Thus, as a proxy for the cost stream of a "flood control alternative," a
stream composed of the Chungju project's annual flood control benefits has
been used.
6.11      The cost streams for Chungju and its alternative are shown in
Table 6.2. The present value of the Chungju cost stream is lower at discount
rates below 19%.
Economic Evaluation
6.12      In quantifying the projects benefits, economic values have to be
assigned to the water and electrical energy supplied by the project. Where
the economic values cannot be measured directly, such as in the case of
energy and municipal water, it can be approximated by prices that consumers
are willing to pay less the costs incurred in constructing and operating the
delivery systems. The retail tariff has been adopted as a minimum measure of
consumer's willingness to pay, ignoring consumer surplus and the possibility
that the market clearing rate might be higher than the actual tariff. For
industrial water, the tariff for raw water withdrawals has been used and the
relatively small costs of intake systems have been ignored. For irrigation
water, the economic value is measured in terms of incremental crop produc-
tion. Flood control benefits have been quantified in terms of reduced
damages and enhanced agricultural production due to reduced flood risks.

6.13      Water Supply.  The demand for municipal, industrial and irrigation
water in the Han Basin is expected to grow from 3,700 MCM in 1986 to 6,800
MCM in 2001 (Annex 4). Without the Chungju project, or alternative storage
projects, growth in demand beyond levels projected for the mid-1980s would
be physically impossible because of lack of water in the dry season. Thus,
virtually all of the increase in water use beyond 1986 can be attributed to
Chungju.
6.14      The basis for estimating the economic value of water for each of
the three uses is described below and the resulting values and economic
benefits are shown in Table 6.3.
M4unicipal: A retail tariff of W 40/cu m /1 was used, less O&M
costs of W 10/cu m, and less system expansion costs of W 16/cu m
capacity./2 Thus, the net economic value of municipal water is
W 14/cu m.
Industrial: The prevailing tariff for raw water withdrawal is
W 4.0/cu m.
Irrigation:  An irrigation diversion of 7,600 cu m/ha is required
to increase rice yields from 3.2 ton/ha (rainfed) to 5.2 ton/ha
(fully irrigated), and leads to an incremental net production value of
W 396,000/ha, or W 52/cu m./3 Construction costs of W 2.5 million/ha
(US$5,000) have been assumed. The net economic value of irrigation
water is therefore W 9/cu m.
/1  The domestic tariff in Seoul for consumption exceeding 15 cu m/month/
household.
/2 Based on data from WHO Sector Survey 1974, adjusted for inflation,
capital cost for system expansion W 35,000/cu m/day. Assuming a load
factor of 75%, the annualized value of the capital cost (at a discount
rate of 12%) is equivalent to W 16/cu m.

6.15      Power Benefits.  The average annual gross generation of the Chungju
project would be 770 GWh. After deducting transmission and distribution
losses (8%), energy sold would be 708 GWh. The average revenue per kWh in
Korea on the basis of current tariffs would be W 24.2. The project's share
of investments need to expand transmission and distribution systems has been
estimated at US$45.0 million and US$66.0 million respectively./I The annual
O&M cost associated with this incremental investment is US$0.5 million for
transmission and US$0.8 million for distribution. These incremental costs
were deducted from the annual power benefit.
6.16      Flood Control.  The project would substantially reduce the magni-
tude and frequency of flood damage in the South Han and the Lower Han.
/1 The incremental transmission and distribution investments, about US$100/KW
installed capacity for transmission and about US$147/KW installed capacity
for distribution, were based on KECO's past investments. The annual O&M
cost of these facilities has been estimated at 1% of capital cost for
transmission and about USi0.11/KWh supplied for distribution.

Changes in the flood regime would also induce more productive use of agri--
cultural land in the flood plains. An analysis of the project's flood
control benefits is presented in Annex 4. There has been considerable urban,
industrial and agricultural development along the rivers of the Han Basin in
recent years. This would continue even in the absence of the project. Thus
for a given level of flooding, future damages in real terms would be greater
than at present. The annual benefit due to damage reduction is estimated to
increase from US$6.3 million, when the project is completed in 1985, to
US$12.2 million 20 years later. The annual value of incremental agricul-
tural production as a result of reduced flood risks is estimated to reach
US$4.3 million four years after completion of the project.
6.17      Economic Rate of Return.  Using the foregoing assumptions and
discounting investment costs and water supply, power and flood control
benefits over a 50-year evaluation period, the economic rate of return of
the project is 12% (Table 6.4). The water and power benefits are primarily
based on retail tariffs which are minimum measures of consumers willingness
to pay. The sensitivity of the rate of return to higher estimates of
willingness to pay was tested; the results of these and other sensitivity
tests are given below:
(a) Water and Power Benefits: A 20% increase in tariffs
used as measure of economic value.                               14%
(b)  Water Demands:  A 5-year lag in attaining projected
water demands.                                                   10%
(c) Construction Costs: A 20% increase in construction
costs.                                                           10%
Risks
6.18      ISWACO and other government agencies who would be concerned with
the project have considerable experience in the implementation of multipur-
pose projects, and there should be no problems in management and coordina-
tion of the physical works. A demanding feature of the project in terms of
management will be the timely acquisition of land and property in the reservoir
area, and in the prompt payment of compensation. However, programs of a
similar nature in Korea have been undertaken in the past without serious
delays or social problems. The only significant technical problem could be
in implementing the works required to deal with the geologic conditions
at the dam's right abutment. For this reason, ISWACO has selected as
engineering consultants a firm with considerable experience in dam design in.
Korea and elsewhere. ISWACO will also be advised by a consulting panel
which will include an expert in engineering geology.

7. RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During negotiations, assurances were obtained that:
(a) the Government would arrange to provide ISWACO with financing by
June 1980 in the amount of approximately US$20 million for the
supply and installation of a fourth generating unit (para. 4.18);
(b) ISWACO would maintain separate accounts for the project and would
employ independent auditors, acceptable to the Bank, to audit
project accounts annually, and that the audited accounts, together
with the auditor's comments, would be sent to the Bank within four
months of the close of each financial year (para. 4.21);
(c) ISWACO would, by December 31, 1981, submit to the Bank, for review
and comment, detailed rules for reservoir operation (para. 5.10);
(d) ISWACO would, by December 31, 1983, submit to the Bank for review
a detailed proposal for the maintenance and inspection program
of the Chungju Dam, including a description and schedule of this
proposed program, the designation of experts, if any, to be employed
and, if applicable, their terms of reference (para. 5.11);
(d) ISWACO would, by December 31, 1979, submit to the Bank for review
and comment a report presenting the results of a land and property
survey together with a timetable for the acquisition of property
and for payment of compensation (para. 5.16);
(e) the Government would give farmers displaced by the project preference
in the purchase of reclaimed tidal land including such land in Yong
San Gang Stage II (para. 5.17);
(f) ISWACO would, by June 30, 1981, present to the Bank for review
and comment a detailed proposal for the allocation to displaced
farm families of land in the draw-down zone of the reservoir
(para. 5.18); and
(g) ISWACO would submit to the Bank for review and comment by June 1983
a proposed rate for the sale of the project's energy to KECO, and
would establish and impose a rate acceptable to the Bank by
December 1983 (para. 5.19).
7.02      With the above assurances the proposed project is suitable for a
Bank loan of US$125 million for a period of 17 years including 4 years
of grace to the Industrial Sites and Water Resources Development Corporation
with the guarantee of the Republic of Korea.

Water Demands and Storage Needs
Demand Projections
1.        Present and projected annual demands for the Han Basin are sum-
marized below and discussed in further detail in Attachment 1. These are
the demands for surface water, after deducting groundwater use and return
flows.
Water Demands (MCM)
1976      1981      1986     1991      1996      2001
Municipal                     500      800      1,100    1,400    1,800    2,200

Total                 4,900    5,700      6,600    7,700    8,800    9,900
Monthly dry-season
demand (Oct.-March)        330       400        470      530       630      730
Monthly demand in June        865      915        970    1,040    1,115    1,190
Streamflow Data
2.        In the course of the Han River Basin Study, USBR developed monthly
streamflow data for the years 1917-1940. Because of numerous gaps in the
streamflow records, much of the above data were obtained by correlation of
rainfall with runoff. Prior to 1940 the Basin was essentially undeveloped,
therefore, the 1917-1940 sequence has the advantage that no adjustments are
needed for existing projects or large-scale water use.
3.        The flow at Paldang, just below the confluence of the North and
South Han, is of particular interest since it represents the volume of surface
water available to meet the Basin's water demands.  The data for Paldang,
developed by USBR, show a runoff/rainfall ratio of 0.64 which is unusually
high for so large a catchment. It compares with ratios of about 0.55 for



-50 -                               ANNEX 2
Page 2
other major basins in Korea, such as the Nakdong and Yong San, with similar
rainfall and topography. A study, during appraisal, using the technique
of graphical correlation indicated a ratio of 0.56. Therefore, for the
studies described in the Annex the streamflow data for Paldang have been
reduced by 10%. For the other stations in the Basin, the USBR data have
been used except for Chungju where runoff data for the damsite are taken
from the ECI feasibility study.
4.        The annual runoff at Paldang averages about 15,000 MCM.  About
65% of the runoff occurs in the three months of July, August and September.
Less than 20% of the annual runoff occurs in the six-month dry season (October
through March). In the 1917-1940 sequence the monthly dry-season flow
falls below 200 MCM in 10% of these months. This figure increases to about
450 MCM with the storage regulation provided by the existing Soyang and
Hwacheon projects. This firm flow of 450 MCM would barely exceed the estimated
1986 dry-season demand and fall below the 1991 demand. June is also a
critical month because, when the monsoon rains are late, above average
demands for irrigation water coincide with below average runoff. Recently, in
1976, the June demands were met only by excessive depletion of the upstream
reservoirs. The above figures provide a broad indication of water supply and
demand and show that additional storage will be needed by 1986 or shortly
thereafter. However, to permit a more accurate picture of the supply/demand
balance a simulation model of the Basin was developed during project appraisal.
Han River Basin Model
5.        Outline of the Model.  The model is designed to simulate the
operation of existing and possible future storage reservoirs within the Han
Basin but excludes run-of-river schemes. The following reservoirs are
incorporated in the model:
Hwacheon         -         existing
Soyang           -        existing
Hongcheon        -         future
Chungju          -         future
Yeoju            -         future
Paldang          -         existing
6.        The analysis is based on monthly records of streamflows which are
inputs at each reservoir in the system. These flows, however, are modified
to take account of the effect of upstream reservoir operation and evapora-
tion. All system water demands are aggregated at Paldang, a simplification
adopted merely for the purpose of the analysis. At each reservoir initial
releases are made for power generation to ensure that a minimum plant factor
is maintained. The effects of these discharges are worked through the system
and the inflows at Paldang modified accordingly. Water demand is then bal-
anced against available flows in the river. Any resulting shortage is met
by further releases from upstream reservoirs in order of priority and subject
to a number of operating constraints. Where it is not possible to meet
demand a system shortage is recorded. When the water releases from the

Page 3
reservoirs are finally determined, monthly energy and peaking capability
at each power station are calculated. The power calculations take account
of flows passed through the dam and the plant capability is adjusted as
required by the net head across the turbines. An upper limit of energy
generated is imposed by the generator capacity, and any water not utilized
for power is shown as spill. An example of the output from the model is
shown in Attachment 2.
7.        Results of Simulation Studies.  The system was simulated for
the 1917-1940 sequence of monthly streamflows to determine the number of
years in which shortages would occur at different stages of Basin development
and with different combinations of reservoirs added to the system. The
existing Soyang, Hwacheon and Paldang reservoirs are part of the system
in all studies. With no additional storage in the Basin, it was found that
significant dry-season shortages would occur in 5 of the 24 years at the 1986
level of demands. This is an unacceptable frequency of shortages for the
major population centers and industries in the Han Basin. Thus construction
of the Chungju project, to be operational by 1985, is justified. With Chungju
in the system, shortages would not occur until the year 2001 (4 years out of
24). An alternative sequence of reservoirs consisting of the Hongcheon and
Yeoju projects (para. 9) was also investigated. It was found that with the
Hongcheon project operational in 1986, shortages would occur in 5 years at the
1991 level of demands, and therefore the Yeoju project would have to be in
service by 1992. With both Hongcheon and Yeoju in the system, demands would be
met without serious shortages until the late 1990s.
Alternatives to Chungju
8.        An alternative to upstream storage considered in the USBR study
was the construction of a barrage at Hangang downstream of Seoul on the Lower
Han. Such a barrage would prevent salinity intrusion and hence allow some
reduction in the maintenance flow requirements. USBR rejected this solution
because it would be necessary to divert all municipal and industrial effluents
downstream of the barrage. This alternative was considered during appraisal.
In addition to the objection noted by USBR it was found that even if the
maintenance flow were reduced by 60% in the six-month dry season (a total
volume of 900 MCM) it would defer the need for upstream storage for only
about five years. Thus, it was concluded that the Hangang Barrage was
inferior to upstream storage in meeting the water needs of the Han Basin.
9.        Other than Chungju, the only large undeveloped reservoir site
in the Han Basin is on the Hongcheon River, a tributary of the North Han.
The dam would provide complete regulation of an annual runoff of some 1,000
MCM. Constructed by 1985, Hongcheon would meet incremental downstream water
demands through 1992. The project would have an installed capacity of 100 MW
and generate about 140 GWh in an average year. Flood control benefits



- 52 -                               ANNEX 2
Page 4
would be negligible. This project was chosen as the first in the sequence of
projects forming an alternative to Chungju. There are three possible projects
to be considered for construction to meet demands after Hongcheon. These are
Yeoju on the South Han, and Dalcheon and Kanhyon both on tributaries of the
South Han.  In the case of the latter two, the annual runoff is only about
1,000 MCM and would not be fully regulated because at both sites the
topography limits the reservoir capacity to about 700 MCM. At Yeoju, the
storage capacity is only 800 MCM, but the upstream catchment area is very
large and annual runoff is of the order of 7,300 MCM. The useful yield of
Yeoju would be greater than the other two reservoirs and would meet downstream
incremental demands for a longer period. Yeoju has therefore been chosen as
the next project in the alternative sequence to be in service by 1991.
The head available for power generation would be only about 20 m, and the
installed capacity would be about 100 MW and annual energy generation some
200 GWh.

Input to Least-Cost Analysis
13.       The least-cost analysis of Chungju as a multipurpose project is
described in Chapter 6 of this report. For this purpose a cost stream
for the alternative means of meeting the water supply function of Chungju
was developed. This is the cost stream associated with constructing Hongcheon
by 1986 and Yeoju by 1992. However, both of the projects would produce some
power and energy, although significantly less than Chungju, as well as a
limited degree of flood control. Therefore, the Hongcheon-Yeoju cost stream



ANNEX 2
Page 5
has been "credited" by amounts equivalent to the cost of producing their
power and energy output from an alternative source. The power and energy
credit has been based on the capital and fuel costs of equivalent gas turbine
installations using the data given in Annex 3. Flood control benefits of the
two dams has been assumed as 15% of the benefits attributable to Chungju
(Annex 4).

Water Production in Seoul
2.        Production statistics for Seoul over the last 12 years are given below.
Treatment facilities have been steadily developed over this period increasing
from a capacity of 0.5 MCM per day in 1965 to 2.17 MCM per day in 1976.
The treatment capacity will be increased to 3.17 MCM by 1981 under an ADB-
financed project. Further extensions to the system will be made as the
demand for water increases, and it is expected that capacity will be increased
to 4 MCM per day by 1990.

Industrial Demands
3.        Estimates of actual water used by industry were made by USBR and
ECI in 1968 and 1976. The growth in demand between these years from 114 MCM
to 500 MCM, is close to the observed growth in the industrial sector during
the same period. The estimate of actual use in 1976 was used as the starting
point for the mission'.s long-term projections. Growth rates for five-year
periods are taken as the expected growth rates in Korea's industrial sector.
A considerable increase in the use of groundwater and return flows has been
assumed. The mission's estimate of industrial water demands is shown
below.

Irrigation Demands
4.        The presently cultivated area of the Han Basin is 370,000 ha
(165,000 ha of rice and 205,000 ha of uplands). At present, about 120,000 ha
of riceland is irrigated to some extent, with only about 30,000 ha having a
full water supply. It is estimated that by 1991, about 30,000 ha of upland
will be converted for paddy cultivation, and of the 195,000 ha of riceland,
some 80% will be irrigated as well as 10,000 ha of upland. Also, it is
assumed that 8,000 ha of tidal land in the Lower Han will be reclaimed. The
required monthly irrigation diversions for 1991 are shown below.

5.        Maintenance Flow.  In addition to withdrawals from the river system
there is a requirement to maintain a minimum flow in the Lower Han. This has
two purposes: firstly to prevent the intrusion of saline water; and secondly,
to maintain the water quality in the Lower Han, which will become increasingly
polluted as more wastewater is discharged into the river. Measurements made
by USBR showed that the minimum flow needed to control salinity was between
10 and 150 cu m/s depending on the state of the tide in the Han River estuary.
A figur-e of 100 cu m/s has been adopted for the Basin study. Detailed
analyses for a similar problem in the Nakdong River (second in size to the Han
River) were made by NEDECO (a Netherlands consulting firm) under an FAO
study. The required flow was estimated as 90 cu m/s.

CHUNGJU MULTIPURPOSE PROJECT
Power Studies
Introducton
1.        The studies presented in this Annex have the following objectives:
(a) to demonstrate that the investment in power facilities at the
Chungju project is economically justified in comparison with
alternative sources of power; and
(b) to provide input to a least-cost analysis of Chungju as a multi-
purpose project (i.e., a cost stream of the next lowest cost power
alternative).
Power and Energy Demands
2.        A load forecast for the period 1977-86, prepared by the Korea
Electric Company (KECO) is shown in Table 1. A recent study of power demands
carried out by the Korea Development Institute (KDI) closely corresponds to
the KECO forecast. Peak demands shown in the installation program (Table 2)
follow the KECO forecast through 1986 and the KDI projections are used for
the period 1987-1993.
Installation Schedule
3.        KECO plans to meet the growth in demand largely through a mix of
oil-fired steam, coal-fired steam and nuclear generation in order to divers-
ify its sources of fuel, all of which has to be imported. The program also
includes pumped storage and hydroelectric plants (including Chungju) as well
as gas turbines and combined-cycle plants. KECO's current installation
program includes provision for slippage of individual projects and contin-
gencies to cover underestimates of peak demand; consequently, it shows system
reserves greater than needed for operational purposes. The installation
program used in the studies (Table 2) was obtained by modifying KECO's
program to arrive at an estimate of the units which would actually be in
service each year; reserves are limited to normal operational needs. The
first three units of Chungju are scheduled to be in service in 1984 and the
fourth unit in 1985.

The Power Component of the Chungju Project
4.        Chungju's power facilities would consist of four 115 MW generating
units.  The project's peaking capability would fall below its installed capac-
ity of 460 MW only about 10% of the time, and would rarely fall below
400 MW. Annual energy generation would average 770 GWh.  For about seven
months in each year the plant factor would be close to 10%, and in the
remaining five months of the wet season it would be much higher but vary
considerably from year to year.  For the studies, a wet-season plant factor
of 53% has been adopted. The investment required to exploit the project's
power potential would be about $153 million in mid-1979 prices.
Comparison of Alternatives
5.        There are a number of different types of power plants which could be
considered as alternatives to Chungju. In order to show that Chungju is the
"least-cost" project, it has to be found superior to the lowest cost of the
possible alternatives. Four alternative types of generation, which could be
in service by 1985, were considered - oil-fired steam, gas turbine, combined-
cycle thermal, and pumped storage.  Chungju and its alternatives would each
have different operating characteristics and, therefore, can only be compared
in the context of the overall power system. Therefore, a "with Chungju"
system was compared to four "without Chungju" systems, in each of which one
of the alternative sources of power is substituted for Chungju.
6.         comparison of the alternative power system expansion program
requires the calculation of all system costs - capital, operation and mainte-
nance (O&M) and fuel costs - over an extended period of system development.
In this study a 30-year period of analysis was adopted. The systems were
then compared by computing the present values of their total costs over a
range of discount rates. All costs have been expressed in economic prices by
multiplying the local cost components by the standard conversion factor (see
Chapter 6, para. 6.05).
7.        Capital and O&M Costs.  The capital and O&M cost elements in the
cost streams can be considerably simplified because all components of the
"with Chungju" and "without Chungju" systems are common except for Chungju
and the particular plant substituted for it in the "without Chungju system."
Therefore, the capital and O&M costs of all plants common to the alternative
systems cancel each other out. Capital and O&M costs of the alternatives to
Chungju in mid-1979 prices are listed below:

8.        Fuel Costs.  The annual incremental fuel costs were calculated
for each of the four alternative systems in 1986, the first year in which the
Chungju project would be in service for a whole year. This required calcu-
lating total fuel costs for the "with Chungju" and "without Chungju" systems.
This was done by "stacking" the various plants in the system under the
monthly load duration curves in a sequence which minimizes fuel costs. In
estimating fuel costs for the "with Chungju" system, the seasonal variation
in Chungju's output was reflected by carrying out the stacking procedure for
dry-season and wet-season months.
9.         The incremental fuel costs would, for practical purposes, remain
constant after 1986 except for the oil-fired steam alternative. In this
case, the introduction of a new more efficient plant, operating at a high
plant factor, displaces higher cost energy generated by older plants in the
system. This tends to reduce the difference in fuel costs between the "with"
and "without" Chungju systems. As th,e system expands, this effect diminishes
and the difference in fuel costs increases. Studies showed that from about
1993 onwards the incremental fuel costs for the oil-fired alternative would
be essentially constant.
10.       The following fuel costs in mid-1979 prices for the thermal alterna-
tives were used in the study:

11.       For the pumped storage alternative, the pumping energy would have
to be generated by oil-fired steam plants, since the coal-fired steam plants
and nuclear plants would be base loaded.   An overall efficiency of 67% has
been assumed and therefore the cost of energy generation by pumped storage
plants adopted for the study is 35 mills/kWh.
12.       The heat rates and energy costs of existing steam plants in the
system are listed below. All new steam plants installed after 1977 are
assumed to have a heat rate of 9,000 Btu/kWh. The large coal-fired and
nuclear plants do not enter into the analysis since these would be base-load
plants and their operation would be the same in all alternative systems
considered.

13.       The incremental annual fuel costs in US$ million for the four
alternative systems are:
Oil-fired steam          10.7 in 1986 increasing to 14.7 in 1993
and then constant.
Gas turbine              25.9
Combined-cycle           19.9
Pumped storage           24.7
14.       Results of Analysis.  Comparison of the four alternatives to Chungju
showed that at discount rates above 10% the cost stream of the gas turbine
alternative has the lowest present value (Table 3). This alternative was
then compared with Chungju (the incremental investment in power facilities)
and it was found that Chungju has the lowest present value at discount rates
below 23%. For the least-cost analysis of the Chungju project as a whole,
described in Chapter 6, the cost stream for the gas turbine alternative was
used.
15.       Studies were also made to compare a 345 MW (three units) installa-
tion at Chungju with the proposed 460 MW scheme. Cost streams were prepared
in the same way and using the same basic data as described above, but with

Page 5
the capacities of Chungju and its alternatives scaled down to 345 MW. The
gas turbine was again found to be the next lowest cost alternative. Compar-
ison of this alternative with Chungju showed that Chungju has the lowest
present value at discount rates below 22%. The cost of the additional 115 MW
capacity and 40 GWh energy (US$23 million for civil works and equipment)
is therefore justified. This additional peaking capacity will be needed by
the mid-1980s when about 10% of the 13,000 MW demand will have to be supplied
by plant operating at low plant factors.

2.  Dependable capacity takes into account seasonal variations in hydro capa-
bility, derating of some existing steam plants, and assumes that capability
of nuclear plants builds up as follows (60% - Year 1, 80% - Year 2, and 100%
- Year 3). Reserves cover maintenance and forced outages.

FLOOD CONTROL BENEFITS
Introduction
1.        The Han River Basin has experienced numerous floods over the
years as evidenced by historic data from various sources and in more recent
years from systematic observation of river stages at strategic points in the
basin. The most devastating floods generally occur for short periods during
the months of July, August, and September, although it is possible, but
statistically rare, for a flood of significant magnitude to occur during
the months of June and October. Severe floods during the remaining months
of the year are virtually unknown. Seasonal variation of major flood
events is demonstrated by the following monthly distribution of all floods
occurring during the 60 years of available record at the Indogyo gage on
the Lower Han at Seoul.
Seasonal Distribution of Floods at Indogyo Gage
(%)   -
April      May       June       July       August       September       October

2.        The configuration of the river systems of the Han Basin, the loca-
tion of the existing damsites and the proposed Chungju damsite, and relevant
stream gaging stations are shown in Figure 1. Three gaging stations are of
significar,ce to the studies presented in this annex:
Indogyo:  On the Lower Han at Seoul.
Yeoju:    On the South Han near the town of Yeoju about 50 km from the
Chungju damsite and roughly midway between the damsite and the
confluence of the North and South Han.
Chungju:  About 6 km downstream of the damsite.
The 10 highest flood events which have occurred in the past 60 years at
these 3 gaging stations are shown in Table 1.
Flood Reduction Due to Chunglu
3.        The Chungju reservoir would have a gross storage of 2,800 MCM.  In
each year, by the end of June, the reservoir would be drawn down to El. 132 at
which level the storage content would be 1,600 MCM, thus providing flood
storage space of 1,200 MCM. From the end of June until the end of August the



- 71 -                                 ANNEX 4
Page 2
reservoir would be operated according to a rule curve which specifies the
target pool level at different dates. The reservoir level would exceed
the target level only when necessary to store flood inflows. At the end of
each flood the reservoir would be gradually drawn down to the target level.
Detailed operation rules for the reservoir have yet to be devised but the
rule curve would be broadly as follows:
June 30      July 31      August 31
to
July 15
Target level (m)                                  126          136        140.5 /a
Reservoir content at target level (MCM):        1,230        1,860        2,200
Flood storage space available (MCM)             1,370          740          400
/a Maximum conservation level is at El. 140.5. The volume of 400 MCMt between
El. 140.5 and El. 145.0 would be used only for flood storage.
4.         Reservoir releases during a flood would be allowed to rise to the
safe channel capacity of the South Han downstream of the dam, which is about
2,000 cu m/s. The remaining inflow would be stored. The volumes of inflow
exceeding 2,000 cu m/s for the ten highest floods are listed below, and
are compared with the flood storage space available at the time the flood
occurred. It can be seen from this table that all floods, except for the
1972 flood, could have been fully controlled. The 1972 flood could have been
substantially reduced, but the outflow from the reservoir would have exceeded
the safe channel capacity; it is estimated that the peak discharge would have
been reduced from 14,000 cu m/s to about 6,000 cu m/s.

5.        The storage of floods in the Chungju reservoir would have the
effect of substantially reducing peak discharges and flood levels throughout
the South Han and, to a lesser but nevertheless significant degree, in the
Lower Han. This is illustrated by the following table showing the estimated
effect that Chungju would have had on the 1925 flood, which is the highest
recorded flood at most stations in the basin, although higher peaks have been
recorded at Chungju. These estimates are based on flood routing studies in
which the "without Chungju" case takes into account the effect of the existing
Soyang reservoir on flood levels in the Lower Han.

6.        The reduction in the depth and duration of flooding due to the
Chungju rEservoir would lead to the following economic benefits:
(a) reduction in damage to crops, land, property, and public facilities;
(b) changes in agricultural land use and cropping patterns due to lower
flood risks which would lead to increased agricultural production.
The methods used to estimate these benefits are described below and benefit
streams are shown in Table 3.
Benefits Due to Reduction in Flood Damage
7.        Detailed studies leading to estimates of benefits due to reduction
in flood damages were made by USBR in the Han River Basin Survey during
1968. The USBR methods, described below, were employed in the ECI feasibil-
ity study to update the flood benefit estimate to 1976.
8.        In order to estimate benefits due to reduction in flood damage the
river below the damsite was divided into five "flood damage reaches" in each
of which an existing gaging station was chosen as an "index station" (see
Figure 1). There are three reaches on the South Han (S-1, S-2, and S-3).
The downstream reach, S-1, begins at the confluence of the North and South
Han and extends beyond its index gage at Yangpyong. The S-2 reach extends
further upstream beyond the index gage at Yeoju, and S-3 ends at the damsite
and its index gage is at Chungju. The Lower Han is divided into two reaches



- 73 -                               ANNEX 4
Page 4
(D-1 and D-2). The upper reach (D-2) extends below the confluence, and the
Koan gage is its index gauge. The lower reach (D-1) includes Seoul and its
index gauge is at Indogyo.
9.        For each of the five index gages the following curves were prepared
and assumed to depict conditions in their respective flood damage reaches.
Stage-Frequency Curve (without Chungiu): This shows the return period of
different water levels in the absence of the Chungju project.
Stage-Frequency Curve (with Chungiu): This is the same as the above..but
reflects the impact of flood control provided by Chungju.
Stage-Damage Curve: This portrays the value of flood damage at different
water levels.
The derivation of these curves is briefly described below.
10.       Stage Frequency Curves.  At each of the five index gages there is
an observed relationship between river discharge and water level (the stage-
discharge curve). The return period of a given peak discharge can also be
derived from the records of unregulated flows during the 60-year period of
record (a discharge-frequency curve). These can be readily combined to
produce a stage-frequency curve for the "without Chungju" condition. The
effect of Chungju is to change the discharge frequency relationship since it
considerably increases the return period for a given discharge, however the
stage-discharge relationship is unchanged. A new discharge-frequency curve
was derived by using the results of flood routing studies for floods of
various magnitudes. This was then used to derive a stage-frequency curve for
the "with Chungju" condition.
11.       Stage-Damage Curves.  During 1968, USBR conducted extensive field
surveys in the flood plains of the South Han and Lower Han to prepare inven-
tories of crops, property, and public facilities. Data on damages caused
by past floods were also collected. Estimates were made of potential flood
damage in each reach for 0.5 m increments in flood levels and the results
were plotted to obtain stage-damage curves. ECI, with the help of local
consultants, carried further surveys in 1976 and prepared new curves to
reflect the considerable development in the flood plains since 1968.
12.       With the curves referred to above, the flood damage at 0.5 m
increments in water level was obtained. The return period for each increment
was also determined from the curves. The average annual damage in each
increment was then expressed as the value of damage divided by its return
period. For each reach, therefore, the average annual damage was obtained by
adding the values for each increment over the entire range of recorded flood
levels. This procedure was carried out for the "without Chungju" and "with
Chungju" conditions and produced the following estimate of the reduction in
flood damage due to Chungju.

/a Data from the ECI feasibility report were increased by 20% to
reflect inflation from December 1976 to mid-1979.
13.       The above flood damage estimates represent the present (1978)
status of development in the flood plain. However, improvements and addi-
tions to property will continue to take place in the future as they have in
the past. Also it can be expected that crop yields in the flood plain will
follow the continuing upward trend observed throughout Korea. Thus, the
value of potential damages, in constant prices, will increase in the future.
For purposes of project evaluation, the growth rates in the benefits due
to flood regulation have been assumed to increase at an annual rate of 5%
through 1985, at 4% for the next ten years, and at 3% thereafter (see
Table 3).
Benefits due to Increased Agricultural Production
14.       About 13,300 ha in the flood plain is subject to flood damage.
About 7,500 ha is devoted primarily to rice as a summer crop with barley on
around 40% of the area as a winter crop. The remaining 5,800 ha is devoted
to upland crops. Over most of the flood plain, upland crops consist chiefly
of spring crops (cabbage, potatoes and radish) which are harvested before the
flood season in July. Autumn crop cultivation is constrained by the diffi-
culty of land preparation on recently flooded land in early September. With
the flood control provided by Chungju, the frequency and duration of flooding
will be considerably reduced for much of the flood plain, except for the low
areas close to the river. The farms can be expected to take advantage of the
reduced flood risk by growing upland crops throughout the summer, and by
expanding the cultivation of upland crops in the autumn. Also, it is likely
that there will be some increase in the area of rice lands with a correspond-
ing reduction in the areas occupied by upland crops. Present and future
cropping patterns, yields and production are shown in Table 2. The annual
value of incremental production in the flood plains due to flood control is
estimated at US$5.3 million. It is assumed for project evaluation that the
changes shown in Table 2 would take place over a four-year period.
