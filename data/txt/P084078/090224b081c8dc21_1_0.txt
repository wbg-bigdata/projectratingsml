                         Progress towards PDO continues to be rated as “Satisfactory?. Based on the project internal assessment, there is all round increase by about 14-20% in productivity of main
                         commodities (as measured in terms of yields). The number of farmers adopting the recommended technologies has almost doubled, reaching a total of 2,065,877 from 1,022,140 (of
                         which 30% women). Not only that most of the Common Interest Groups (CIG)members (95%) are now adopting the technology but each of them is also able to attract an increased
                         number of farmers outside the CIGs (1:4.6 against 1:3.3 six months ago). An uninterrupted flow of new technology packages continued to be provided by research to extension. This

                         implemented in compliance with with environment and social safeguards requirements. All mitigation measures are being carried out to address adverse potential impacts associated
                         with its activities. The project benefited from an additional financing provided through a USAID client-executed Trust Fund to scale up ongoing activities in new districts. In spite of
                         good progress, the project will not be able to complete all ongoing activities by its closing date (December 31, 2013), due to the 18 months delay at its start and will require an
