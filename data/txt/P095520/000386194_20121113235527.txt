 PROMOTING INNOVATION TO ENHANCE COMPETITIVENESS PROJECT
                   RESTRUCTING PAPER


A. SUMMARY

1. The main purpose of this restructuring is to extend the closing date of the Project, in
   order to allow for a more complete realization of Project Development Objectives
   (PDOs). In particular, there is room to fully achieve the objective of “Strengthen
   capacity to transfer knowledge and technology?, by improving and completing
   execution of activities under Component 3 (Promoting Innovation and Technology
   Transfer to the Productive Sector).

2. Taking advantage of this restructuring process, additional changes encompassing the
   three components and indicators will be proposed to strengthen implementation and
   monitoring of the Project as a whole.

3. Overall, the proposed changes and rationale are as follows:

      Components. Component 3 (Promoting Innovation and Technology Transfer to
       the Productive Sector) will make use of an expanded set of subprojects including:
       (i) Sector Technology Centers, (ii) Sector Technology Networks, (iii) Stimulating
       Demand Projects and (iv) Alliances. In particular, the introduction of Networks
       and the renewed effort in the implementation of Centers will allow offering
       innovation-related institutional services to firms and organizations. Stimulating
       Demand Projects will represent an additional subproject tailored to the needs of
       smaller firms. Overall, all these subprojects will promote opportunities for
       exchanging knowledge and technology among public and private actors, thus
       contributing to the achievement of the PDO “Strengthen capacity to transfer
       knowledge and technology?.

      Results/ Indicators. Consistent with the changes to Project activities and
       timetable, PDO indicators will change as follows: 1 indicator will be dropped; 1
       new indicator will be created; 4 indicators will be revised in structure and or
       target. Targets for 8 out of 18 intermediate indicators included in the 2010
       restructuring will change to reflect the evolution of activities observed until 2012
       and 2 new intermediate indicators will be created to monitor key activities.

      Reallocation of the loan proceeds. Resources from the Project Preparation
       Facility that were not used during project preparation (US$449,602.53) will
       finance additional scholarships under Component 2, in order to support the
       ANII’s strategy of strengthening human capital accumulation and improving
       productivity of firms.

      Closing Date. The closing date will be extended by 18 months to June 13, 2014.


                                            1
      Implementation schedule. An updated action plan guiding the proposed
       additional 18 months of Project implementation has been approved by the ANII
       and is satisfactory to the Bank. The extension will allow completing activities
       already initiated under the three components, as well as the implementation of
       expanded activities under Subcomponent 2.2 (Increase the stock of advanced
       human capital) and new activities under Component 3 (Promoting Innovation and
       Technology Transfer to the Productive Sector).

B. PROJECT STATUS

4. The Uruguay Promoting Innovation to Enhance Competitiveness Project was
   approved by the Board on May 1, 2007, and became effective on August 6, 2007. The
   Project was restructured before on January 22, 2008, December 1, 2008 and June 25,
   2010. The rationale behind previous restructuring processes was, respectively: (i) to
   apply the newly adopted IBRD pricing policy; (ii) to reflect the new role of the ANII
   as the implementing agency of the Project; (iii) to ensure sufficient funding to
   financing access to the TIMBO portal (international database of scientific
   publications) and to adjust output indicators on the basis of implementation
   experience.

5. The Project has three main Components, each one with the following
   Subcomponents:

          Component 1: Supporting STI Policies and Institutional Strengthening,
           including Subcomponents: 1.1 – Support the development of public STI
           policies; 1.2 -Support the National Research and Innovation Agency; 1.3 -
           Setup and support the STI Observatory

          Component 2: Building Human Capital and High Quality Research Teams,
           including Subcomponents: 2.1 - Promote excellence in science and technology
           research in priority areas; 2.2 - Increase the stock of advanced human
           capital; 2.3 - Strengthen priority technical tertiary education programs

          Component 3: Promoting Innovation and Technology Transfer to the
           Productive Sector, including Subcomponents: 3.1 - Develop sector technology
           centers; 3.2 - Support public-private research consortia.

6. Up to date, approximately US$8.3 million out of the total Loan (US$26 million) still
   need to be disbursed. About 80% of this amount is related to Component 3.

7. While implementation of Components 1 and 2 has shown significant progress, there
   have been delays in the implementation of Component 3, creating the rationale for an
   extension of the Project.

8. Under Component 1, a National Strategic Plan for Science, Technology and
   Innovation (PENCTI) has been established. The ANII, created in 2007, has managed
   to consolidate itself as an active agency in promoting and transmitting the science and

                                            2
   technology policies in Uruguay. The ANII has been strengthening its supervision
   ability, and is currently monitoring 22 indicators based on reliable methodologies.

9. In 2008, the ANII was managing about 10% of the total R&D funds in Uruguay.
   When the Project was launched in 2007, this percentage was expected to reach 40%
   by 2012. In 2010, however, the approval of the new National Budget Law limited
   resources allocated to the ANII to be in the range between US$20-24 million,
   accounting for 15-18% of total R&D funds in Uruguay. Despite putting a cap on the
   total amount of funds administrated by the ANII, this new structure makes it the third
   national institution in terms of management of resources dedicated to R&D, from
   being fifth in 2008. Hence, the new legislative framework not only does not affect the
   ANII’s ability in managing the Project, but also allows it to get institutional
   recognition as a key player in managing public funds in the field of Science,
   Technology and Innovation.

10. Within Component 2, 51 subprojects in priority areas have been initiated. This type of
    subprojects involves research and activities in the fields of environment, health, social
    inclusion and other areas with high social impact. In the same manner, 18 specific
    programs aimed at improving living conditions of low-income families have been
    implemented. With respect to the increase of stock of advanced human capital, 558
    scholarships have been awarded to young researchers, and 230 scholarships to master
    and doctoral students. In addition, 6 graduate programs have been created and 15
    have been strengthened.

11. Delays in the implementation of Subcomponent 3.1 have been due to several factors,
    associated with both the supply and demand of innovation-related services. In
    particular, towards the end of 2011 the ANII experienced changes in its management
    team. In addition, delays were caused by the overlapping of financing sources for
    similar purposes, such as the IDB-financed Program for Competitiveness, Clusters,
    and Productive Chains (PACC). A better coordination with these programs has
    allowed to partially overcoming this issue. Moreover, some of these projects have
    been finalized, freeing room for demand of resources by firms. Finally, this
    Subcomponent faced a slow response from Uruguayan companies, highlighting a
    deficit in joint-venture culture and innovation tradition among the Uruguayan
    productive sector.

12. In 2010, Sector Technology Centers were temporarily put aside as an activity of
    Subcomponent 3.1, since the low demand by the productive sector did not justify the
    cost of setting up such type of organizational structure. Recently, however, companies
    have showed an increasing interest for Centers’ services, creating new rationale for
    the use of this particular instrument.

13. Subcomponent 3.2 has proven to be very successful, surpassing target expectations.
    Up to now, 13 Alliances (as public-private research consortia were named) have been
    created against an initial target of 8.




                                             3
14. Overall, the Project has achieved the targets of three of the five original PDO
    indicators ahead of time. In particular, the objective of “Strengthen capacity to
    generate knowledge and technology? has been met, as measured by the number of
    internationally published scientific articles and the number of graduates from
    domestic masters and PhD programs. The observed number of project-supported
    researchers inserted into industry also indicates the achievement of the objective of
    “Strengthen capacity to adapt knowledge and technology?. Due to delays in the
    implementation of Component 3, however, the Project requires more time to fully
    meet the remaining Project’s core objective, namely “Strengthen capacity to transfer
    knowledge and technology

C. PROPOSED CHANGES

Components

15. Component 3 will be increased in scope to include two new subprojects, named
    Sector Technology Networks and Stimulating Technological Demand Projects.
    Increased technical and financial attention will be devoted to the implementation of
    Sector Technology Centers. As a consequence, Subcomponent 3.1 will be renamed as
    Develop sector technology centers and networks and will comprise the following
    subprojects:

      Sector Technology Centers. The Centers are legal non-profit institution offering
       services to firms and other organizations in a particular sector. They can count on
       sectoral experts who help companies/organizations to identify their specific
       demand for technology and to develop a related action plan.

      Sector Technology Networks: Networks put together actors from private and
       public sector, which have a significant degree of involvement in productive
       activities in a common value chain. Unlike Centers, the Networks’ services are
       offered to Network members only, and are set up to address innovation challenges
       that are specific to the Network.

      Stimulating Technological Demand Projects. This activity addresses the demand
       for innovation and knowledge of companies which do not have yet the expertise
       nor the necessary funds to be incorporated in a Network.

16. All these subprojects aim at promoting opportunities for exchanging knowledge and
    technology among public and private actors, thus contributing to the achievement of
    the PDO “Strengthen capacity to transfer knowledge and technology?.

17. The Operational Manual will be updated to reflect the changes to Project’s
    components.




                                            4
Results/ Indicators

18. The PDO will continue to be monitored through 5 PDO Indicators: 1 indicator will be
    dropped; 1 new indicator will be created; 4 indicators will be revised in structure
    and/or target. The changes to the PDO indicators are:

      1 PDO indicator will be dropped: Proportion of public R&D funding administered
       by the ANII (excluding Universidad de la República) (annual)

       Rationale: The current review of the Project has assessed this indicator as an input
       indicator rather than an outcome.

      1 new PDO indicator will be created: Number of technological
       innovations/process improvements developed by subprojects under Component 3
       (Centers, Networks, Stimulating Technological Demand Projects, Alliances)

       Rationale: This indicator will allow evaluating progress towards achieving the
       Project’s core objective of “Strengthen capacity to transfer knowledge and
       technology?. In particular, the target will be limited to those new products or
       processes adopted by industry, in order to capture their contribution to the
       productive sector. The ANII will monitor this indicator on the basis of
       information published in the Technical Reports released at the closing of each
       subproject, when achievement of the objective of the subproject (innovation or
       process improvement) is assessed.

      1 PDO indicator will be revised: Beneficiary satisfaction levels

       Rationale: Data collection relative to this indicator will be disaggregated to
       capture possibly different satisfaction levels among different types of
       beneficiaries, i.e. persons (mainly scholarships recipients under Subcomponents
       2.1 and 2.2) versus entities (mainly firms and institutions supported under
       Component 3). While the previous indicator was measured at four different stages
       of the subproject (at grant application; after award; during implementation; at
       closing), the new indicator will be evaluated only once the subproject has been
       completed, in order to better measure the outcome. Final target, although not
       exactly comparable with the previous one, will be changed from 70% to 80%.

      Targets for 3 PDO indicators will be revised:

       (i)    Number of internationally published scientific articles (Scopus)
              Old target: 708
              New target: 1000
              Note: the baseline of this indicator has changed with respect to the 2010
              restructuring to reflect a change in the platform used. The current baseline
              has been calculated by the ANII by converting ISI – Institute for Scientific
              Information articles (Thompson Reuters) into Scopus articles (Elsevier).


                                            5
       (ii)    Number of graduates from domestic masters and PhD programs
               Old target: 240
               New target: 300

       (iii)   Number of project-supported researchers inserted into industry
               Old target: 10
               New target: 25

       Rationale: targets will be revised upwards to reflect progress observed to date. In
       fact, values reached by these indicators surpassed expectations and more
       ambitious targets can be set to reflect the Project’s impact during the extended
       implementation period.

19. Targets for 8 out of 18 intermediate indicators included in the 2010 restructuring will
    be modified according to the following rationales:

              Rationale: targets for the following indicators will be revised to reflect
               results observed to date. All targets will be revised upwards, with
               exception of the last one -Private sector cash contributions to supported
               public-private research partnerships. The experience up to now has
               shown that these partnerships tend to implement smaller projects and
               consequently ask for less funds.

       (i)     Number of monitoring indicators tracked annually based on reliable
               methodologies
               Old target: 25
               New target: 33
               Note: in addition to PDO and intermediate indicators described in Annex
               1, the ANII will design and monitor additional indicators to track
               efficiency in the implementation of subprojects. In this sense, this
               indicator reflects the ANII’s institutional strengthening and its ability to
               monitor activities.

       (ii)    Number of articles downloaded from TIMBO portal
               Old target: 184,134
               New target: 249,834

       (iii)   Number of research projects supported
               Old target: 18
               New target: 84

       (iv)    Private sector cash contributions to Alliances supported
               Old target: 1,200,000
               New target: 500,000

      Rationale: more ambitious targets are proposed for those cases in which loan
       proceedings during the extension will allow to reach new beneficiaries

    Technology Centers; Number of Stimulating Technological Demand Projects to
    reflect changes in Subcomponent 3.1.

Reallocation

21. Resources from the Project Preparation Facility that were not used during project
    preparation (US$449,602.53) will finance the additional scholarships for Young
    Researchers (Becas de Iniciación) under Subcomponent 2.2 of the Project. The
    rationale is to reinforce the ANII’s strategy and activities to support knowledge and
    technology in the productive sector, as well as to meet an increasing demand for this
    type of scholarship. The resulting proceeds allocation structure follows:
