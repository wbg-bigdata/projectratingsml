                         Project Development Objectives
                         Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)

                         The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to strengthen Uruguay's capacity to generate, transfer and adapt knowledge and technology by supporting: (i) the
                         institutional framework for science, technology, and innovation (STI); (ii) investments in human capital and high-quality research teams; (iii) technology transfer and
                         private sector innovation; and (iv) cross-sectoral and international research collaboration and mobility of researchers between public institutions and the productive
                         sector.
                         Has the Project Development Objective been changed since Board Approval of the Project?

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Project implementation is progressing well. In Component 1 the main progress has been in the implementation of the TIMBO portal (Trama Interinstitucional y Multidisciplinaria de
                         Bibliografías On-line), allowing access to Scientific Publications. Downloads in the period between January and December 2012 maintained the high levels of 2011. Component 2

                         subcomponent; sixteen alliances have been approved by ANII (Agencia Nacional de Investigación e Innovación) and there are also five additional alliances under evaluation. Finally,
                         the “Develop Sector Technology Centers " subcomponent is making progress: three sector technology networks are under implementation and there is another one under
                         preparation. In addition to this, two Sector technology centers will be presented to the ANII's Board in the upcoming weeks and there are other 7 technology centers under

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         As per the Government request, the project was restructured on November 2012. As a result of such restructuring, the following changes were incorporated in the Project:

                         Components. Component 3 (Promoting Innovation and Technology Transfer to the Productive Sector) will make use of an expanded set of subprojects including: (i) Sector
                         Technology Centers, (ii) Sector Technology Networks, (iii) Stimulating Demand Projects and (iv) Alliances. In particular, the introduction of Networks and the renewed effort in the
                         implementation of Centers will allow offering innovation-related institutional services to firms and organizations. Stimulating Demand Projects will represent an additional subproject
                         tailored to the needs of smaller firms. Overall, all these subprojects will promote opportunities for exchanging knowledge and technology among public and private actors, thus
                         contributing to the achievement of the PDO “Strengthen capacity to transfer knowledge and technology?.

                         Results/ Indicators. Consistent with the changes to Project activities and timetable, PDO indicators will change as follows: 1 indicator will be dropped; 1 new indicator will be created;
                         4 indicators will be revised in structure and or target. Targets for 8 out of 18 intermediate indicators included in the 2010 restructuring will change to reflect the evolution of activities
                         observed until 2012 and 2 new intermediate indicators will be created to monitor key activities.

                         Reallocation of the loan proceeds. Resources from the Project Preparation Facility that were not used during project preparation (US$449,602.53) will finance additional scholarships
                         under Component 2, in order to support the ANII’s strategy of strengthening human capital accumulation and improving productivity of firms.

                         Closing Date. The closing date will be extended by 18 months to June 13, 2014.

                         Implementation schedule. An updated action plan guiding the proposed additional 18 months of Project implementation has been approved by the ANII and is satisfactory to the
                         Bank. The extension will allow completing activities already initiated under the three components, as well as the implementation of expanded activities under Subcomponent 2.2
                         (Increase the stock of advanced human capital) and new activities under Component 3 (Promoting Innovation and Technology Transfer to the Productive Sector).
