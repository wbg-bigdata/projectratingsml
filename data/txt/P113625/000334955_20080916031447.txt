Description:    The proposed Food Crisis Response Development Policy Grant o f US$2.5
                million i s intended to support the government's poverty reduction strategy
                byproviding the authorities with needed fiscal space to compensate for the
                lost revenues resulting from the temporary customs duties reduction on
                rice imports. The proposed Grant i s being undertaken under the Global
                Food Crisis Response Program (GFRP), which was endorsed by the Board
                on May 29, 2008, and will be financed out o f the Food Price Crisis
                Response (FPCR) Trust Fund (TF). The government's recent policy
                clarification that the export banon agricultural products expired at the end
                2007, andthat no new export banis being considered, will provide a boost
                to food production. The government has, however, made an exemption
                from this policy for rice exports for the time being because o f distortions
                inthe market.Itis preparingto analyze the rice market, with support from
                its development partners, to study the possibilities o f levying a tariff on
                the re-exports o f rice to address distortions inthe market. Inthe medium-
                term, the government intends to stimulate agricultural production through
                agricultural investment projects, investments in rural infrastructure and
                rehabilitation o f extension services.

Benefits:       The measures supported by the proposed grant are expected to have a
                significant positive impact on poverty reduction.        By providing the
                authorities with needed fiscal space to compensate for the lost revenues
                resulting from the recently reduced customs duties on rice imports (25
               percent broken rice), the operationwould help mitigate the impact o f such
               price increases and contribute to continued basic service delivery for
               vulnerable groups. Also, the government's confirmation that there i s no
                export ban on agricultural products in place since the end 2007, i s
                expected to ameliorate food security.

Risks:          The following risks couldjeopardize the success of the program supported
               by the proposed grant.         First, Guinea remains highly vulnerable to



                                           vi

                commodity price changes. Further increases inworld food and fuel prices
                may undermine macroeconomic stabilization efforts and the impact o f the
                government's program on the poor. Also, further worsening o fthe external
                environment may lead to increased political and social instability. These
                risks are mitigated through intensive monitoring by the government and
                dialogue with donors and, in the case o f further significant increases in
                food and fuel prices, may require additional measures to sustain the fiscal
                balance and macroeconomic stability. The risk o f further social and
                political instability i s mitigated by the broad commitment from the
                government and trade unions to the objectives o f the economic program
                and the willingness o f development partners to support the program with
                additional financing, incase needed.

                Second, the goal o f creating fiscal space to protect critical expenditures
                could be made more difficult in the event that revenues and grants fall
                significantly short o f targets or if substantial new and unavoidable
                spendingrequirements emerge. This risk is mitigatedbythe government's
                already demonstrated commitment to protect priority expenditures through
                reductions inless essential spending.

                Finally, while Guinea may be able to import food (notably rice), the
                vulnerable and food insecure may not be able to pay for it. This risk i s
                mitigated by the fact that several development partners (including the
                World Bank) are supporting programs aimed at creating income and
                employment opportunities duringthis period o f rising food and oil prices.

           OVERVIEW OFA PROPOSEDEMERGENCY FOOD CRISISRESPONSE
                       PROGRAMFORTHE REPUBLICOF GUINEA

A.      INTRODUCTION

1.      This document seeks approval to provide Grants totaling US$lO.O million to support the
Bank's Guinea Emergency Food Crisis Response Program (GEFCRP). The program consists of
a proposed Food Crisis Response Development Policy Grant (US$2.5 million), additional
financing to the Third Urban Development Project (US$2.5 million), and an Emergency
Agriculture Productivity Support Project (US$5.O million). The proposed Grants are being
undertaken under the Global Food Crisis Response Program (GFRP), which was endorsed by the
Board on May 29, 2008, and will be financed out o f the Food Price Crisis Response (FPCR)
Trust Fund(TF). The objectives o f the GFRP are to: (i) the negative impact o f high and
                                                            reduce
volatile food prices on the lives o f the poor in a timely way; (ii)support governments in the
design o f sustainable policies that mitigate the adverse impacts o f high and more volatile food
prices on poverty while minimizing the creation o f long-term market distortions; and (iii)support
broad-based growth inproductivity and market participation in agriculture to ensure an adequate
and sustainable food supplyresponse.

2.      This document is composed o f three sections: (i) overview document describing the
                                                             an
GEFCRP program including background, context, rationale and a description o f the Government
and the Bank's response; (ii)    the program document for the proposed Food Crisis Response
Development Policy Grant (Attachment 1,plus Annexes); and (iii)       the emergency project paper
(EPP) for the two proposed investment operations (Attachment 2, plus Annexes).           To avoid
duplication, the overview document provides the context andrational for all three operations and
the Food Crisis Response Development Policy Grant program document provides the
macroeconomic and fiscal outlook for the entire GEFCRP. Thus, the Emergency Policy Paper
(EPP) assumes the information in the overview document and the proposed Food Crisis
Response Development Policy Grant as background and does not repeat what i s provided in
these sections.

3.      The proposed GEFCRP would help finance activities to mitigate both the short-term and
the medium-to-long-term impact o f rising food prices in Guinea, which result from the global
acceleration in food price inflation. The proposed interventions will support the Government of
Guinea's (GoG's) national strategy to maintain and enhance food security, including: (i)  customs
duty reduction on rice imports,which is a basic staple for the poor; (ii) increasing access to food
for the poorest and most vulnerable; and (iii)expediting a supply response o f agricultural
production through the implementation o f measures to raise yields and consequently the
production o f staples. Specific Bank interventions include:

    0  Increasingthe availability of affordable rice by temporarily reducing customs duties
       on imports o f the lowest-price rice, thus targeting the most vulnerable consumers;

    0  Creating employment and income opportunities for households in the most affected
       urbanareasthrough labor intensivepublic works programs; and




                                                -1-

        Enhancing rice productivity by distributing improved seed, fertilizer, and providing
        technical assistance.

4.      The GEFCRP was formulated inthe context o f the Government's own strategic response
to the food crisis and constitutes the Bank's contribution to ajoint UNresponse.

5.      The proposed overall allocation is as follows:

B.      RATIONALE FOR PROPOSEDBANKEMERGENCY PROGRAM

6.      Food insecurity i s a chronic phenomenon in Guinea. In spite o f a strong agricultural
potential, the country imports approximately a third o f its rice needs. The World Food Program
(WFP) estimates that 6 percent o f households are severely food insecure. Acute malnutrition
affects 9 percent o f Guinean children. Food insecurity i s linked to poverty, which affects 54
percent o f the population. There i s concern that higher prices could lead to a decline in the
quantity and quality o f food consumption, and lead to higher rates o f acute malnutrition,
especially during the current lean season. This risks exacerbating an already fragile political
situation with potential for increased unrest and violence.

7.      It is in this context that the Bank is proposing a three-pronged food emergency response
program for Guinea.       The first component o f this program consists o f a new Food Crisis
Response Development Policy Grant aimed at providing the authorities with needed fiscal space
to compensate for the loss o f revenues resulting from the temporary reduction o f customs duties
on low-quality rice, while targeting the reductions to the poorest consumers. The second
component o f this program proposes a labor-intensive urban public works program aimed at
providing employment and income to the poorest households in the most affected areas. The
third component o fthis program is a new agricultural productivity project that would finance the
distribution o f improved seeds, fertilizer and technical assistance to boost rice production.

8.      The proposed emergency food crisis response programis consistent with the Bank's new
Global Food Response Program (GFRP), which aims at allowing a comprehensive and rapid
response to the crisis across a range o f different instruments. The objectives o f the GFRP are to:
(i) thenegativeimpactofhighandvolatilefoodpricesonthelivesofthepoorinatimely

impacts o f highand more volatile food prices on poverty while minimizing the creation o f long-

term market distortions; and (iii)support broad-based growth in productivity and market
participationinagriculture to ensure an adequate and sustainable food supplyresponse.

C.       COUNTRY CONTEXT

9.       Guinea i s a low-income, food-deficit country o f 10.2 million, which ranked 160 out o f
175 countries in the 2007 UNDP Human Development Indicators.                            Over the past 15 years,
Guinea has been plagued by political instability. Starting in early 2000, the country has been
strongly affected by military conflicts in neighboring countries, such as Liberia and Sierra
Leone. Since then Guinea's economy has experienced low growth and double-digit inflation. In
January and February 2007, strikes and confrontations between security forces and
demonstrators inurbanareas were partly caused by high food and fuel prices, but a fragile peace
has since been maintained. There i s concern that the recent worldwide increases in commodity
markets could againjeopardize the country's new-found political stability. Gas prices increased
63 percent on April lst, and retail rice prices have increased by over 85 percent inthe past year,
leadingto fear o frenewedpolitical tension and violence.


D.       INSTITUTIONAL AND CAPACITY ISSUES

10.      As part o f its 2007 emergency response program, the Government has embarked upon a
significant program o f governance reform with assistance from development partners including
the Bank. Government's five-point strategy for public finance reform aims at: (i)improved
effectiveness, efficiency and transparency o f public resource management; (ii)improving
internal and external resource mobilization with a view to carry out all expenditure programs and
attain fiscal balance; (iii)reinforced institutional structures o f the Ministry o f Economy and
Finance, working along with Guinea's development partners, with a view to improve social
delivery; (iv) establishing a public financial management fiamework that i s coherent, effective
and adapted to the Guinean needs; and (v) developing a Public Financial Management (PFM)
control systemthat reflects internationalbest practices.

11.      The Bank has been able to support progress ingovernance in selected areas, where there
has been national leadership and political commitment. Government, under the leadership o f
former Prime Minister Lansana Kouyat6, acted resolutely in re-establishing basic principles o f
economic governance. These include work on budgetary deconcentration and the development
o f budget tracking mechanisms. The government also implemented measures related to the
mining sector, including the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), finalizing
audits for most ministries bublished in form o f a summary), and starting a review o f several
mining contracts and implemented measures related to the Extractive Industries Transparency
Initiative (EITI).' Finally, the authorities pushed forward with reforms in the Central Bank o f
Guinea (BCRG) to strengthen its accounting system and independence addressing rapidly key
weaknesses in the realm o f economic governance. The reform policies were acknowledged by
the IMF, whose three-year arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility
(PRGF) was approved by the Board on December 21, 2007. However, both economic and

' Guineaadheredtothe EITIin2005. The first EITIreportauditinggovernmentrevenuedatafrom six mining companies for
2005 was publishedinOctober 2007. It foundthat paymentsreportedby the authoritiesandthe companies matchedclosely.




                                                        -3-

political governance remain challenges that need to be addressed. The new Government seems
highlycommitted to continuingreforms already started.

12.     Strengthening institutional capacity has focused mainly on institutional transformation in
government entities carrying out service delivery functions. The Bank's support in this area
focuses primarily on system-wide reforms in public financial management and procurement -
critical functions for implementing development programs. In addition, the Bank provides
technical assistance to strengthen capacity and governance in the mining sector, a key sector in
the Guinean economy. However, overall implementation capacity remains weak. To mitigate
this, the Bank's proposed investment financing responding to the food crisis will be channeled
through entities carrying out existing Bank's projects which have strong management and a good
track record o f implementation.

E.      GOVERNMENT RESPONSETO THE CRISIS

13.     The Government o f Guinea has recently formulated its strategy for responding to the
food price crisis along two main pillars: (i)  supporting access to food for the most vulnerable
populations; and (ii)supporting increases in agricultural production. In the short-term, the
Government i s working with partners and the private sector on measures to ensure a sufficient
stock o f rice and fish until the end o f the year; putting in place social protection measures to
protect the poorest and most vulnerable; and enhancing management o f 150,000 hectares o f land
to improve agricultural production in the 2008/2009 period. Over the longer term, Government
plans to meet food demand with local production through improvements in water management
systems, access to technology, provision o f tools and seeds and building capacity inthe fishing
sector. An Emergency Food Crisis Committee, under the supervision o f the Prime Minister, has
been created to coordinate and monitor the crisis situation and undertake emergency measures
aiming at protection o fvulnerable groups. Specifically, the program includes:

    .
(i)Supporting access to food:

    ..  The temporary reduction o frice customs duties from 12.75 to 2.75 percent from June 1to
        end October 2008;
        The distribution o f take-home food rations for children for families o f five or more
        members;
        Emergency school feeding andnutrition support;
        Buildingan emergency food reserve o f25,000 metric tons.

    .
(ii)Increasingagricultural production:

        Emergency support in the 2008 planting season with fertilizers, improved seeds,
    .   veterinary inputs, repair and maintenance o f agricultural assets, construction o f storage,
        capacitybuildinginagricultural services; and
        Medium- to longer-term support to intensify rice production and ensure national food
        supply through investments in irrigation infrastructure and improved inputs, water
        management, technology transfer, technical assistance to producers and diversify crop
        production.



                                                -4-

F.      OTHER DEVELOPMENTPARTNERSTRATEGIESAND PROGRAMS

 14.    In the past months, intensive discussions on support for the government's efforts in
responding to the crises have taken place among representatives from the European Commission,
France and key UNagencies. A rapid food assessment has been carried out by WFP from May
 12-23, 2008, identifying priority sectors for response. The result is an emerging UN-family
response from WFP, UNICEF, FAO, WHO and UNFPA that reflects a number o f existing
approaches combined with innovative rapid-response initiatives aligned with the strategic pillars
o f the Government's response to the crisis. The objective o f the response i s to save lives by
delivering food and medicines to people in need while also putting in please measures to
safeguard against epidemics and reduce the prospects o f violence. Currently, WFP has set up a
food security program in the poorest areas o f Guinea during the 3 months o f the lean season
(July to September), consisting o f a monthly rice food-ration o f lOkg per person per day
distributedto an estimated 88,000 acute food insecure people. Also, since March2008, UNICEF
is providing therapeutic feeding to severely malnourished children between the age o f 0 to 5
years old and pregnant women in areas most at risk and plans to scale up activities to 50,000
children and pregnant women throughout the country. Finally, the Red Cross is regularly
mobilizing to assist the population during vaccination campaigns, epidemics and to provide first
aid.

 15.    In addition, FA0 plans to provide agricultural inputs and tools to 70,000 households in
33 prefectures and 2 communes in October to December 2008 for gardening and to 165,000
households inMay to September 2009 for rice and maize production in all the prefectures. Inthe
health sector, UNFPA, WHO, UNICEF will intensify prenatal care for 500 000 pregnant women
and nutritional rehabilitation o f malnourished babies under 5 years o f age in 360 health centers
o f Haute Guinea, Moyenne Guinea and the Forest Region through existing national programs
aiming at reduction o f maternal morbidity and mortality, neonatal and juvenile nutritional
rehabilitation.

G.      BANKRESPONSE

16.     The Bank's strategy for emergency support is aligned with the Government's strategic
approach and i s in the context o f the agreed joint UN response.        The Bank proposes an
emergency program that focuses on measures to address boththe short and medium to long term
implications o f the global food crisis for Guinea. The suggested sequence o f the emergency
program i s mutually supportive. The proposed program reflects the Bank's comparative
advantage and builds on current strengths - particularly its existing portfolio o f programs - and
i s cognizant o f proposed responses o f Government and other Development Partners. It i s fully
consistent with the interventions set out in the Bank's Global Food Crisis Response Program
(GFCRP). In this context it should be noted that Guinea is very fragile and has no additional
resources to use for food price crisis response. Guinea's existing IDA program is limited and
fully committed. Thus, the proposed interventions are suggested to be financed out o fthe newly
created Food Crisis Response Trust Fund.

17.     The three components o fthe Bank's emergency response are:




                                                -5-

     .
        Component 1: Food Crisis Response Development Policy Grant (US$2.5 million). This
        is intended to support the Government's poverty reduction strategy by providing the
        authorities with needed fiscal space to compensate for the loss o f revenues resulting from
        the temporary reduction o f customs duties on low-quality rice by 10 percentage points,
        from 12.75 to 2.75 percent. The application o f reduced customs duties will be effective
        for the period from June 1 to October 31,2008, which covers the lean seasonthrough the
        Ramadan period. The reduced duties will apply to low-quality imported rice only. The
        Government's 2008 budget assumed a rice import price o f US$280 per ton. At a now
        assumed current average import price o f US$600 per ton and projected monthly rice
        imports averaging about 30,000 metric tons, the Government estimates that the revenue
        loss due to the reduction o f customs duties on rice amounts to US$2.5 million compared
        to the projected revenues to be collected from custom duties on rice imports assumed for
        the budget 2008 law. Also, the government's recent policy clarification that the export
        banon agricultural products expired (except for rice for which an export tariff is currently
        being considered by the government after conclusion o f a respective study) at the end
        2007, and that no new export ban i s being considered, will provide a boost to food
     .  production.

        Component 2: Emergency Urban Labor-Intensive Public Works Program (US$2.5
        million). This component includes road maintenance andurbanworks programs aimed at
        providing employment and income to households in the most affected areas.              This
        support would be provided through additional financing to the ongoing Third Urban
        Development Project.

     1  Component3: Emergency Agricultural Productivity Support Program (US$5.0 million).
        This component would finance (i) production o f2000 tons o fcertified seedby scaling
                                           the
        up the farmer seed multiplication network; (ii) procurement o f 2000 tons o f fertilizer;
                                                        the
        and (iii)the distribution o f input packages to 70,000 smallholder farmers.             The
        component aims to increase yields by 50% on 1000 irrigated hectares during the 2008-09
        dry season and on 35,000 hectares duringthe 2009-10 rainy season for a total increase in
        rice production o f 100,000 tons (equivalent to national consumption needs for four
        months).

18.     The proposed interventions are beingundertaken under the Global Food Crisis Response
Program (GFRP), which was endorsed by the Board on May 29, 2008, and will be financed out
o f the Food Price Crisis Response (FPCR) Trust Fund (TF). The objectives o f the GFRP are to:
(i) thenegativeimpactofhighandvolatilefoodpricesonthelivesofthepoorinatimely
    reduce
way; (ii)support governments in the design o f sustainable policies that mitigate the adverse
impacts o f high andmore volatile food prices on poverty while minimizing the creation o f long-
term market distortions; and (iii)support broad-based growth in productivity and market
participation in agriculture to ensure an adequate and sustainable food supply response. The
interventions proposed under the Guinea Food Crisis Response Program fit well within
objectives o fthe GFRP.

H.      CONSISTENCYWITH COUNTRY STRATEGY

19.     The activities proposed under this emergency response build on the implementation
successes and lessons learned o f the past CAS and offer a continuation through the focus on the
most vulnerable. The current portfolio emphasizes community development, basic and urban
services, and rural infrastructure mirrors this focus. The Government's Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper I1 (PRSP II),      completed in August 2007, outlines three main objectives:
governance, growth and employment, and access to basic services. It also identifies the
agricultural sector as the prime sector for pro-poor growth and the sector's development as the
prime vehicle to achieve food security. Following the general strike and riots in 2007 which
brought to the open deep socio-economic tensions in Guinea, the country has embarked on a
political transition in a context o f political fragility, with two governments in 15 months (five
governments since 2004) and a challenging macroeconomic stabilization in a difficult external
environment. Recognizing the fragile context, the Bank i s currently preparing an Interim
Strategy Note (ISN) for the period 2008 to 2010 in support o f the PRSP 11, assuming that the
period up to the next presidential elections in2010 will help to strengthen the policy framework
and, therefore, the conditions for a Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) after 2010. The ISNwill
be presented to the Board before the end o f fiscal year 2009. The ISN supports the three main
PRSP I1 objectives by arguing for improvements in economic governance as well as the
government's capacity, especially in areas with a high growth potential such as mining and
agriculture. The strategy note also focuses on strengthening o f basic services, with an additional
financing provided to the education sector governance project and a lending operation to
improve performance o f water and electricity. The proposed food price crisis response program
fits well within the PRSP and ISN frameworks.

I. RISKSANDMITIGATIONMEASURES

20.     Guinea's political and security situation remains fragile and volatile and i s likely to be
exacerbated by food and fuel price increases. The Government might not be able to meet popular
demand for better living conditions within the given tight fiscal situation and shifting external
conditions. Popular unrest and demand for political change could de-stabilize the situation. Also,
the country's external position remains frail and is vulnerable to external shocks. The program
seeks to mitigate these risks as part o f a multi donor effort to address the food and fuel price
crisis targeting the most vulnerable groups, a key source o f instability, particularly in urban
areas. Moreover, the proposed program includes budget support to help offset budgetary gaps
caused by Government's response to the food price crisis and help keep the macro program on
track.

21.     In general, the governance situation remains weak and there is the risk that institutions
lack capacity and political will to implementreforms; even though much has been accomplished
on the reform agenda and on building institutional capacity since 2007 and although the new
government seems committed to continuing the reform path, future commitment remains
uncertain. The program aims to mitigate these risks through use o f well established project
management entities to implementthe food crisis response program. The investment components
o f the program are being implemented through existing project management units (PMUs) of
second phase Adaptable Program Loans (APLs) with solid track records on project and fiduciary
management. The program includes provisions for intensified supervision and monitoring for

investment projects as allowed for under OP 8.00. Also, continuous support through a PRGF
arrangement with the IMF will help the Government to make more progress toward
macroeconomic stabilization and implement important structural reforms which impact
positively on governance over the longer term. A broader dialogue on governance issues will be
articulatedinthe ISNto bepresented to the Boardbefore the end o f fiscal year 2009.

     ATTACHMENT 1: PROGRAMDOCUMENT FORA PROPOSEDFOOD CRISIS
                         RESPONSEDEVELOPMENTPOLICY GRANT

A.       INTRODUCTION

1.       Food insecurity is a chronic phenomenonin Guinea. Six percent o f rural households
are severely food insecure,2 35 percent o f the population has regularly problems to meet
minimum daily caloric requirements and 9 percent of children suffer from acute malnutrition.
Food insecurity i s linked to poverty, which affects 54 percent o f the population. Furthermore,
Guinea has among the world's highest rates o f infant and maternal mortality - thus access to
affordable food i s a major concern.

2.       Rice is the main staple food, accountingfor about 48 percent of the caloric intake of
the poorestquintile of the population.About a third ofthe annual national rice consumptionis
supplied though imports and rice represents almost 70 percent o f all food imports. The urban
population i s dependent on imported rice. Higher rice import prices are therefore a particular
burden on the one-third o f the Guinean population that resides in urban areas (60 percent o f
which live inthe greater Conakry area).

3.       Global price increases have reached crisis proportions in 2008: the average export
price for rice increased from US$375 metric tons inJanuary 2008 to US$775 metric tons by June
2008. The impact o f highworld food prices is compounded by the pass-through effects o f higher
fuelprices, which adds to distribution costs, further fieling the rate o f food price inflation across
the world. As a result, consumer prices for food have risen rapidly in Guinea. The price o f a
kilogram o f imported rice in Conakry increased 96 percent from June 2007 to June 2008.
Similarly, the price of locally produced potatoes and palm oil increased during the same period
by about 80 and 64 percent, respectively, while annual inflation, which had declined to 12.8
percent at end-2007 from 39.1 percent at end-2006, has accelerated since then and was 24.6
percent at end June 2008.

4.       The combined effect of the food and fuel price hikes has created severe hardships
for the population,made it more difficultfor the governmentto maintainthe plannedlevel
of basic services and exacerbated existingpolitical and social tensions. The government is
especially concerned about the programs for education, health, and the security services. There
i s a need for urgent action. The months between July and September are traditionally known as
the "lean season" and, since Guinea does not have a food security stock, the government is
deeply concerned about both welfare and maintaining social peace during this period. It is
estimated that at least 220,000 people could be pushed below the poverty line by a rice price
increase o f 50 percent alone, according to a recent analysis, raising the poverty headcount by 1.6
percentage point^.^ The impact would be more severe for the urbanpopulation, whose poverty
headcount would be increased by 5.5 percentage points (or a quarter o f the urbanpopulation).

5.     Thus far, the government has taken several actions to mitigate the impact of the
food and fuel price increases,notably it has reduced customs duties on rice imports since June
1,2008, for a limitedperiod, reduced transport prices for school students, increased scholarships
for university students and launched work-for-food schemes. The customs duty reduction
applied during the period June 1 to end October 2008 will result in revenue losses o f about
US$2.5 million. Inaddition, the cost o f delivering priority basic services in 2008 has increased
by about US$4 million, o f which US$3 million is accounted for by the higher cost o f food,
electricity and fbel.

6.     The proposed grant of US$2.5 million would support the Government's poverty
reduction strategy in 2008 by providing the authorities with needed fiscal space to
compensate for the lost revenues in 2008 resulting from the recently reduced customs
duties on rice imports. The proposed grant is beingundertaken under the Global Food Crisis
Response Program (GFRP), which was endorsed by the Board on May 29, 2008, and will be
financed out of the Food Price Crisis Response (FPCR) Trust Fund (TF). This support would
help mitigate the impact of such price increases, especially for the urbanpoor who rely heavily
on imported rice, and would contribute to continuedbasic service delivery for vulnerable groups.
The government recently issued a policy instructions to the administration, which was
publicized, clarifying that an export ban on agricultural products, which was in place in 2007,
expired at end 2007. The policy instruction exempts, however, the export o f rice for which an
export tariff i s currently being considered by the government after conclusion o f a respective
studyS4 The issuance o f the policy stance was necessary because custom officials and popular
perception continued to assume that the export ban was in place jeopardizing regional export
flows o f agricultural products. The policy clarification is expected to provide a boost to food
production. These measures would be complemented by the provision o f additional employment
and income-generating opportunities for the poor, notably through work-for-cash programs,
supported by donors (see paragraph 29 under this attachment). These interventions would help
bridgethe impact o fhigher food pricesuntilan agricultural supply response sets inwith the next
plantingseason. Inthe medium-term, the government intends to stimulate agricultural production
through a combination o f agricultural investment projects, investments inrural infrastructure and
rehabilitationof extension services.

B.     COUNTRY CONTEXT

              DEVELOPMENTAL            STATUS AND RECENT POLITICALDEVELOPMENTS

7.     Despite its rich endowment of natural resources, Guinea's is one of the world's
poorest countries. The country fares poorly in most indicators related to human development
and the Millennium Development Goals. It ranked 160th out o f 175 countries in the 2007/08
UNDP Human Development Report.' Life expectancy at birth is reported at 54 years. Infant
mortality in 2005 was estimated at 91 per 1,000 live births, and the mortality rate o f children
under 5 years stands at 163 per 1,000, Thirty five percent o f children under 5 are chronically
malnourished and 26 percent are underweight. The adult literacy rate i s 28 percent, whilst the
gross enrolment rate for primary education i s estimated at around 78 percent.


 The export market for rice is distorted and a tariff on re-exported rice would aim to address such distortions.

8.      Guinea's fragility has been exacerbated by governance problems and external
factors, including regional instability. In the early 2000s, regional conflict in neighboring
countries spilled over into Guinea, resulting in armed attacks, significant destruction o f
infrastructure and an inflow o f rehgees.      As a result o f political instability and weakened
governance, Guinea's macroeconomic situation worsened, with real growth averaging only 2.5
percent in 2001-2006, a fiscal deficit o f -4.3 percent in 2006 and inflation rising to 39.1 percent
by end 2006. The worsening socio-economic situation and governance environment led to
strikes and civil unrest in early 2007. The unrest rapidly became a wide political movement
demanding hndamental political change, improved governance and public service delivery.
After eight weeks o f strike and political action, resulting inviolent clashes and over 100 deaths,
an agreement on the formation o f a government o f national consensus was made between the
unions and the President. A new reform-minded government came to power in late March 2007
underthe leadership ofPrime Minister Lansana Kouyate.

9.      The government led by Lansana KouyatC began in April 2007 to carry out
fundamental reforms aimed at stabilizing macroeconomic performance, improving
governance and basic services.         Its policies were first based on a short-term economic
rehabilitation emergency program (May 2007) and, as o f August 2007, on a second generation
PRSP (PRSP 11). The government acted resolutely to stabilize the economy by tightening fiscal
and monetary policies, extending rapidly its control over expenditures and re-establishing basic
principles o f economic governance. The reform policies pursued by the Kouyate government
resulted in the approval by the IMF Board o f a three-year arrangement under the Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) on December 21,2007. The ongoing PRGF supports the
government's macroeconomic stabilization and reform program. Maintenanceofmacroeconomic
stability i s in turn a key condition for Guinea to reach the HIPC Completion Point: currently
estimated for end2008, and for continued and increased donor assistance.

10.     The political situation remainedtense in the first half of 2008, compounded by the
impact of world food and fuel price increases. A threatened general strike in early 2008 was
only avoided by last minute negotiations with the trade unions.              Finally, the Kouyate
Government was dismissed by presidential decree on May 20, 2008, after having exhausted its
credibility to bring visible change inthe living conditions o f the population. The rise infood and
petroleum prices further undermined its range o f options. The new Prime Minister Ahmed
Tidiane Souare declared his intent to continue with the reform program initiated under the
Kouyate Government. Underliningthis point is that key Ministers o f that government remain in
their positions, including the Minister o f Finance. The new government i s considered one o f a
"large consensus," reachingout to the politicalparties, unions and civil society.

                               RECENT   ECONOMICDEVELOPMENTS

11.     Economic stabilizationpolicieswere broadly successfulin 2007. Fiscal targets for the
year were broadly achieved in spite o f a revenue shortfall. The basic primarybalance improved
by 2 percentage points o f GDP (to 3.7 percent o f GDP), largely due to the strict application of
monthly expenditure ceilings for line ministries, suspension of automatic debits o f treasury
accounts by the Central Bank o f Guinea (BCRG), prohibition o f extra-budgetary expenditures


 The HIPCDecisionPoint was reached in2000.

and ad hoc tax or customs exemptions. Currency appreciation lowered the taxable basis in
Guinean francs and mining revenues fell short because o f costs overruns, but intensified audits
and a growing telecommunications sector boosted domestic taxation to 14.3 percent o f GDP (as
compared to a target o f 14.8 percent).                    The authorities cut non-priority current spending to
maintain budgetdiscipline.

12.     Monetary policy supported prudent fiscal policies through improved coordination
and reporting, freezing credit to the government and aligning reserve money growth
strictly to nominal GDP growth. Significant reductions in the fiscal deficit and a zero
government financing policyhelped the BCRGto make progress inthe management o fmonetary
policy, allowing for a sharply declining growth rate o f reserve money from 84.1 percent in2006
to 11 percent in 2007. Inflation declined from 39.1 percent at end-2006 to 12.8 percent at end-
2007, the interest rate for treasury bills turned positive in May 2007 as the annual inflation rate
declined, the nominal effective exchange rate ended the year about one third stronger and
exchange volatility eased.

13.     After stalling during social unrest in early 2007, economic activity made a timid
recovery (to 1.8 percent). Several sectors were constrained by frequent power outages and low
government spending. However, most miningcompanies made up during the year for the losses
occurred to their operations duringthe civil unrest inearly 2007.

 14.       In 2008, the government continued to implement bold actions to stabilize the
economy despite the challenging and fragile social context. The authorities increased the
petroleum price at the pump on April 1by 63 percent;' the electricity prices were increased on
average by 62 percent on May 1, leaving the social tariff unchanged. The custom administration
was reinforced through contractingthe pre-inspectioncompany VEFUTAS as o fMay 1,2008. In
addition, the authorities decided not to renew the decree banning agricultural exports which had
constrained agricultural production.                  Also, on June 27, 2008 the government adopted a
comprehensive public financial management (PFM) reform plan. The plan is supported by
Guinea's development partners and provides the blueprint to achieve measurable progress in
budget preparation, execution and oversight.

 15.       However, the food and fuel price increases are threatening the fragile path towards
macroeconomic stabilization. The increases in food prices and the pass-through effects o f the
increases in oil prices at the pump by 63 percent on April 1, 2008 have resulted in an
acceleration o f inflation since the beginning o fthe year to May 2008, when the rate peakedat 25
percent. Since then, due to the government's adoption o f mitigating measures and an austere
macroeconomic policy stance, the indication i s that the annual inflation rate has declined (inJune
by 0.4 percent). The end o f the year inflation rate is now estimated to be 15 percent, revising
earlier projection o f 10 percent. The price hike i s also projected to increase the external current
account deficit by about 4.3 percent o f GDP. Rising import prices for food and crude oil led to a
widening in the country's trade deficit and to a decline in the import cover to less than 10 days,
down from around 20 days in2006.

 16.       The price increases are also challenging the government's efforts to achieve the 2008
fiscal targets. Risingworld fuel prices are gradually eroding the tax margin on the fixed pump
price and fiscal revenue on top o f the impact o f the currency appreciation on the revenue base.
Furthermore, the reduction o f customs duties on rice imports during June-October 2008,
combined with the impact o f rising food and fuel prices, will make it difficult to maintain public
service delivery at plannedlevels. As a result, the target for the primary fiscal balance under the
PRGF-supported program has been lowered by 0.2 percentage points to 3.5 percent o f GDP to
make room for a policy response to the food and fuel price crisis. There is an additional risk that
continued inflationary pressures could motivate a demand for higher civil service wages.
Already, following unrest inthe military, the government accommodated the repayment o f wage
arrears to soldiers and decided to postpone the implementationo f the petroleum price adjustment
formula until end-November 2008, following the earlier 63 percent price increase in April 2008.
The challenge for the government is to pursue macroeconomic stabilization while also managing
demands for compensation for the price increases.




'
   Through the April 1, 2008 increase, the government restored temporarily the normal petroleum taxation that had been
suspended in early 2007. Since then, however, world prices of oil have continued to increase and the authorities decided to
postpone the automatic adjustment o f pump prices to end-November 2008, due to the risks tied to hrther domestic price
increases in the present fragile social context. The impact of this postponement on government revenue in 2008 is about 0.3
percent o f GDP.

                               MACROECONOMIC FOR2008-10 OUTLOOK

17.     The changes in international prices will continue to pose a challenge for
macroeconomicstability in Guinea. The global economic prospects for traded goods suggest
that Guinea will continue to be subjected to highfuel and food prices for the next few years. The
terms o f trade are expected to decline for Guinea up to 2009 as imported fuel and food prices
continue to accelerate faster than export commodity prices. Only in 2010 i s Guinea projected to
show slight gains in its terms o f trade (see Table 3 o f this attachment). Crude oil prices are
forecast to rise by 52 percent in2008. Eventhough the price i s then expected to fall by 2 percent
in 2009 and another 7 percent in 2010, the price in 2010 will still be almost double the 2005
price. The outlook for rice i s equally worrisome: the international price i s expected to rise by 99
percent in 2008 and will be 1.7 times the 2005 price by 2010. Similar outcomes are forecasted
for sugar and wheat.

18.     Key macroeconomicobjectives underlyingthe government's medium-termstrategy
as detailed in the PRSP I1 and the IMF-supported PRGF program are to continue
stabilizing the economy through fiscal and monetary policies and to unlock Guinea's
economic potentialby facilitating private sector involvement and pushingthrough governance
reforms. In this regard, two sectors, agriculture and mining, are central for Guinea's economic
growth and development.          Agricultural expansion i s a key medium-term objective, given its
importance for poverty reduction,* food security and employment. Guinea's considerable mineral
endowments will continue to support the balance o f payments and output growth, through large
foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows which are financing a massive expansion in bauxite
production. The large FDI inflows are also expected to provide new opportunities for private
sector growth through enhanced linkages between miningand local firms.

19.     The medium-term macroeconomicframework for 2008-10 projects real output to
grow by 4.7 percentannually through 2010, compared to the 2005-07 average o f 2.4 percent,
reflecting continuous macroeconomic stabilization, the pursuance o f structural reforms
improving governance, and the impact o f the large FDI inflows. The main stimuli behind the
projected growth include the strong increase in FDI in mining and an increase in public
investmentfocusing on priority sectors (education, electricity andwater).

20.       Fiscal policy in the medium term will be geared towards improving the domestic
primary fiscal balance from 3.7 percent of GDP in 2007 to 4.2 percent of GDP by 2010.
This is expected to be achieved through increased revenue mobilization efforts as the
government aims to achieve macroeconomic stability while also expanding investment spending
to support the implementation o f the PRSP 11. Several measures to improve the tax
administration are being implemented, foremost the review o f the mining code in conjunction
with the code for non-mining investment and the building of capacity at the Ministry of
Economy and Finance (MEF) to assess tax declaration o f mining companies. In addition, the
custom administration i s being strengthened, made subject to a comprehensive performance
contract, and assisted in revenue collection by the international import pre-inspection company
VERITAS. The government also aims to protect priority expenditure programs, particularly
those which contribute to poverty reduction, through better budget preparation, execution and
control procedures.          To that effect, as indicated in paragraph 14 o f this attachment, the
government has recently adopted a medium term public financial management reform plan.
Continuous prudent fiscal policy will assist monetary policy in lowering inflation and ensuring
that the domestic public debt i s at a sustainable level. This will provide scope for expanding
private sector credit and contribute to lower domestic interest rates. This fiscal stance, combined
with prudent monetary policy, would lead to a reduction in the inflation rate to 7.0 percent in
2010 from 12.8 percent in2007 (and an estimated 15 percent in2008).

21.       The measures adopted by the government to respondto the price shocks have put
an additional burden on an already tight budget and balance of payments situation. The
customs duties reductions on rice imports result in revenue losses relative to what could have

been collected had the tariffs been maintained at the level o f 12.75 percent. The MEF estimates
that the loss in 2008 will be approximately GNF12 billion (or US$2.5 million) when valued at
actual prices seen in the first half o f the year.g Inaddition, the cost o f basic service delivery i s
projected to increase by an estimated GNF18 billion (US$4 million), o f which GNF 14 billion
(US$3 million) i s accounted for by the higher cost o f fuel. As a result, the government's
financing requirements for 2008 amount to US$152 million (see Table 4 of this attachment).
Additional debt reliefandbudget support pledged since the beginning o f the year are expected to
close the financing gap in 2008. Guinea received better than expected terms under the January
2008 Paris Club agreement that resumes bilateral debt relief in the context o f the PRGF
arrangement.      The World Bank, AfDB and BADEA have provided supplemental interim
assistance under the HIPC Initiative on an exceptional basis. Guinea has also obtained an
augmentation o f access to PRGF resources of 20 percent o f quota in2008, which would finance
about a fifth o f the balance o f payment impact. The government i s preparing a revisedbudget for
2008, which incorporates the additional costs incurred due to the fuel and food price shock, the
additionally received external financial assistance, and reductions o f expenditures (US$7.5
million), all o fwhich would close the financing gap for 2008.

22.     A Debt SustainabilityAnalysis (DSA) completed in November 2007 concludes that
Guinea is in debt distress, and would remain at a high risk of debt distress into the medium
term in the absence o f the country's reaching the Completion Point under the Enhanced HIPC
Initiative and benefiting from the Multilateral Debt Reduction Initiative (MDRI).Guinea reached
the Decision Point in December 2000, qualifying for US$545 million (in NPV terms) in debt
relief, and received interim debt relief by all main creditors in 2001-02. After the PRGF went


  This revenue loss is the calculated net results of the originally budgeted revenues at a custom tariff of 12.75
percent on 30,000 tons o f rice per month for the months June 1 to end October 2008 at a price o f US$280 per ton,
C.I.F. Conakry, and the revenues collected at a custom tariff o f now 2.75 percent for same period but at an estimated
import price of US$600 per ton, C.I.F. Conakry.


                                                      - 16-

off-track at end-2002, many creditors discontinued interim relief and the AfDB continued it until
it exhausted resources allocated to that purpose. Only IDA and two Paris Club creditors
continued providing uninterrupted interim relief to date. As a result o f policy slippages and
dwindling debt relief, Guinea has had difficulties servicing its external debt since 2003. IDA'S
HIPC interim assistance to Guinea was increased to 50 percent o f the HIPC debt relief inNPV
terms, but exhausted in May 2008, resulting in the resumption o f Guinea's full debt service
payment to IDA since then (or an additional US$15 million for 2008).

23.      At end-2006, Guinea's public and publicly guaranteed external debt was
US$3,188 million, or 101.5 percent of GDP. In the baseline scenario, several debt burden
indicators are projected to remain above the thresholds for the next 10-12 years." Inparticular,
the NPV o f debt-to-exports ratio i s estimated at 186percent at end-2006, well above the
indicative threshold o f 100percent, and is not projected to go below this threshold until 2020.
However, the ratios o f debt service to export and revenues can fall below the thresholds as soon
as in2008 reflecting both the projectedresumption ininterim HIPC debt reliefby some creditors
and a projected increase infiscal revenues.

24.       The delivery of debt relief under the HIPC Initiative and the MDFU would
significantly reduce Guinea's externalpublic debt. Assuming that Guinea reaches the HIPC
completion point at end-2008, the external debt burdenwould decline to a sustainable level from
that point. The HIPC debt relief would reduce projected annual debt service due to Paris Club
creditors by about three quarters." Upon reaching the HIPC Completion Point, the country will
also become eligible for debt relief under the MDRI, which would write-off all debt obligations
to IDA incurred up to end-2003, and the IMF and AfDB debt obligations incurred up to end-
2004.12 The implementation o f HIPC and MDRIdebt relief at the end o f 2008 would eliminate
about 60 percent o f Guinea's outstanding external debt at the end o f 2008 (in net present value
terms). This would proportionally reduce Guinea's external debt ratios at the end o f 2008, which
would remain well below the policy-based thresholds afterwards.

25.      However, even after benefitingfrom HIPC and MDFU, Guinea's debt sustainability
would remain vulnerable to adverse exogenous shocks (especially from exchange rate
fluctuations) and policy reversals. These conclusions highlight the importance o f a rapid
attainment o f the HIPC Completion Point, sustained implementation o f sound macroeconomic
and structural policies, and a prudent debt strategy, which includes contracting external loans
only on concessional terms. Results o f the public sector DSA indicate that Guinea's domestic
debt i s significant but is expected to decrease over time. The sustainability analysis indicates,
however, that the pace o f public debt reduction may be significantly affected by policy reversal
or exogenous shocks.




loThe thresholdsare based on the empirical finding that low-incomecountries with strongerpoliciesandinstitutionstend to have
a higher debt carryingcapacity. See IDA andIMF, "OperationalFramework for Debt SustainabilityAssessments in Low-Income
Countries-Further Considerations" (IDA/R2005-0056), April 2005.

C.         THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM

                                       THECHALLENGEOFPERVASIVEPOVERTY

26.        According to estimates detailed in Guinea's PRSP 11, the poverty headcount
increased from 49 percent in 2002 to 54 percent in 2005.13 The increase in poverty was
mainly due to political instability, weak macroeconomic performance and poor governance. The
quality o f service delivery, especially in education, health and public utilities, has also
deteriorated. Since 2000, economic growth has not been sufficient to keep up with population
growth. The recent food and fuel price increases have compounded the country's social and
political fragility and have likely further increased poverty. A recent analysis o f the impact of
rising food and petroleum prices suggest that the direct effects o f a 50 percent rise in rice and
petroleum prices (well below the recent price increases, see paragraphs 3 and 15 o f this
attachment) would cause poverty to increase by 2.3 percentage points (1.6 percentage points for
the rice price increase alone).l4

27.        Higher imported food prices negatively affect about one-third of the Guinean
populationthat resides in urban areas (60 percent of which live in the Greater Conakry
area). The rise inprices for imported rice is particularly important for urban households because
it is their main staple food, accounting for around 45 percent o f the daily calorific intake o f the
average household. Figure 1 below highlights the most vulnerable districts within Guinea by
simulating the impact on the poverty headcount index in each district o f a 25 percent increase in
the price o f rice. These estimates suggest that the most vulnerable districts are primarily in
Guinee Maritime (costal Guinea), including the capital city Conakry, and G u i d e Moyenne
(middle Guinea), inthe northwesternpart o fthe country.

28.    Another concern is whether the vulnerable and food insecure population would be
able to pay for the importedrice. The latest Poverty Assessment estimates that 35 percent o f
Guineansregularlyhaveproblem feeding themselves and that the typical poor household spends
19 percent o f its income on rice alone. Recent developments in the food market can only have
worsened food consumption levels and the situation is expected to further deteriorate through the
lean season. Urban food consumption levels recently surveyed for the Greater Conakry area
indicate that 39.5 percent o f households consumed seven or fewer food groups in the 24 hours
precedingthe survey. Some 10.5 percent o fhouseholds consumed five or fewer food groups.

29.    A well balanced and sequenced emergency intervention can provide for effective
and rapid relief to the poor, especially in urban areas. The urban poor households are the
main consumers o f imported rice that i s 25 percent broken, preferring a lower priced imported
rice over the higher priced domestically produced rice. Rapid relief for the urban poor can
therefore be delivered through a lowering o f import prices for rice, as supported by the proposed
operation, in the absence of a more elaborate social safety net. This measure i s complemented
with employment opportunities through work-for-cash programs, which helps stabilize the
income situation o f the poor, and by other measures announced by the government (see
paragraphs 49-5 1o f this attachment). These measures can help bridge the impact o f higher food
prices until an agricultural supply response sets in with the next planting season. Over the
medium-tern, the Government plans interventions to stimulate agricultural production through
agricultural investments and rural infrastructure projects to address bottlenecks, enhance
productivity andincrease rural, and through multipliereffects, urban incomes.

                                  THEPOVERTY        REDUCTION       STRATEGY

30.     The second PovertyReductionStrategy Paper (PRSP 11), issued in August 2007, set
out a number of objectives andprioritiesfor 2007-2010 that address the maindevelopment
challenges in Guinea. The PRSP I1acknowledges the disappointing outcome o fthe first PRSP.
Thus, the objectives o fthe PRSP I1aim at recapturing ground lost over the past five years so that
progress can be made towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The strategy has
three pillars: (i) improving governance; (ii)accelerating growth and increasing employment
opportunities; and (iii)   improving access to basic services. It identifies important economic and
institutional reforms as well as mechanisms to reinforce the democratic process. The choice o f
pillars and reforms derived from a number o f factors, including the experience with PRSP I,the
weak status o f governance in the country, and the need to promote private sector growth in
support o f the overarching commitment to reduce the high level o f poverty in the country.
Special attentionwas also given to the topics o f food security and employment.

31.     The PRSP preparationwas based on a series of extensive consultations conducted
throughout the country. These consultations were characterized by open and frank dialogue
between government and key stakeholders - cabinet ministers, parliamentarians, non-
governmental organizations (NGOs), members o f civil society, the private sector, cooperative
associations, and local authorities and religious leaders.                The consultation culminated in a
national validation congress held in Conakry on August 11, 2007. Radio and television
discussions were an important part o f the communication and sensitization efforts. The
participatory approach built on the open dialogue across all sections o f society, which arose from
the general strike and violent clashes o f early 2007 and led to a new consensus government in
late March2007.

32.     The first pillar recognizes weak governance as a major reason for the lack of
progress in poverty reduction. The key elements o f the government program for good
governance under the first pillar include: (i)      strengtheningthe capacity of democratic institutions;
(ii)continued improvements in public financial management, especially in the management of
natural resources; (iii)improvements in public service delivery through capacity building
(administrative governance); (iv) decentralization o f service delivery; (v) better statistics for
monitoring outcomes; (vi) judicial reform and improving the sanction system; (vii) tackling
human rights abuses; (viii) improving access to information; and (ix) continued strengthening o f
the police.

33.     The second pillar emphasizes the continued implementation of sound economic
policies to attain macroeconomic stability and a more favorable environment for private
sector development. The key objectives o f the government program for sustainable growth
under this second pillar include: (i)     appropriate fiscal and monetary policies, including reaching
the HIPC Completion Point; (ii)support to the productive sectors, and especially agriculture,
through the provision o f inputs, machinery, extension services and training;15 (iii)           investments in
infrastructure for power, roads and information technology; and (iv) improvements in the
investment climate, including through revision o f the legal framework for mining and non-
mining investmentin line with international practices, as well as a better dialogue between the


IsInputsandmachineryare to be providedon acost recoverybasisor through favorable credit terms.


                                                      - 20 -

government and the private sector. Inthis respect, the authorities have also decided to enhance
the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative to improve governance inthe management o f the
country's natural resources and enhance the benefits derived from the sector. As part o f this
effort, they plan to adopt a standard miningcontract and a revisedminingcode.

34.      Under the third pillar investmentsin education and healthand improveddeliveryof
basic services will provide the basis for sustained poverty reductionby enhancing the capacities
of the poor and reducing their vulnerability.       This pillar includes several broad objectives:
expanded basic education and training; expanded health, immunization and nutrition services,
including HN/AIDS prevention and control; increased access to safe drinking water and
sanitation facilities; social protection; and gender equality and empowerment. The key elements
o f the government program under this pillar include: the decentralization o f several services,
construction and rehabilitation o f facilities, subsidies, school feeding programs, improved
curricula, training for teachers and healthworkers, andbetter administration, including improved
statistics for monitoring educational enrollment rates and health outcomes.

35.      The PRSP I1 targets are ambitious, given Guinea's still fragile situation and weak
implementation capacity. The strategy targets a growth rate o f 5-5.6 percent per annum (on
average 2 percent per capita). The IMF-World Bank Joint Staff Advisory Note recommended
that the objectives o f the strategy be refined and updated in the annual reviews o f PRS
implementation, in light o f implementation experience. Such updates could be supported by the
preparation o f sectoral development strategies that would strengthen the link between the current
PRS and achievement o f the MDGs.

36.      A PermanentSecretariatfor the PovertyReductionStrategy,a unit o fthe Ministryo f
Economy and Finance (MEF), coordinates all PRS monitoring activities.              The Secretariat
oversees working groups that monitor economic developments, resource allocations and
expenditures, statistics, survey and census results, community based strategic planning and
monitoring, and communication anddissemination. Monitoring and evaluation is coordinated by
a National Technical Committee. A new household survey was conducted in 2007 and the
results will be available inlate 2008/early 2009.


D.       BANKSUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAM

                          LINKTOTHECOUNTRYASSISTANCESTRATEGY

37.      The proposed operation is consistent with the PRSP I1 objectives. The 2003 CAS
supported the implementation o f the first PRSP with a focus on reforming the institutional and
policy framework, building capacity for service delivery and improving the management o f
public finances. The 2003 CAS included a structural adjustment operation to support critical
reforms to increase fiscal revenues and improve budget management, and envisioned PRSCs
subject to a satisfactory macroeconomic framework and improvements in public expenditure
management. The CAS did not include the proposed operation; however, the operation i s filly
consistent with the objective o f supporting the second strategic priority o f the PRSP 11, namely
sustainable growth, food security andjob creation. Inparticular, the operation would provide the
authorities with needed fiscal space to compensate for the lost revenues resulting from the



                                                - 2 1 -

recently reduced customs duties on rice imports. This support would help mitigate the impact o f
such price increases and contribute to continued basic service delivery for vulnerable groups.

38.     Following the general strike and riots in 2007 which brought to the open deep socio-
economic tensions in Guinea, the country has embarked on a political transition in a context o f
political fragility, with two governments in 15 months (five governments since 2004), and
challenging macroeconomic stabilization in a difficult external environment. Recognizing these
transient circumstances, the Bank i s currently preparing an Interim Strategy Note (ISN) for the
period 2008 to 2010 in support o f the PRSP 11, assuming that the period up to the next
presidential elections in 2010 will help to strengthen the policy framework and therefore the
conditions for a Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) after 2010. The I S Nwill be presented to the
Board before the end o f fiscal year 2009.

                         RELATIONSHIP WITH OTHER BANKACTIVITIES

39.     Several operations are direct complements to the proposed grant. Key among these
i s a proposed parallel Food Price Crisis Response Trust Fund operation to provide additional
financing (US$2.5 million) to Phase I1o f the Third Urban Development Project to implement a
Labor-Intensive Public Works Project in Conakry.               This short-term support will be
complemented by a medium- and longer-term support for relieving the pressure on food prices
through increased agricultural production. To this effect, anEmergency Agricultural Productivity
Support Project (US$5.0 million) is also proposed. This program aims to accelerate the rice
supply response through improved use o f seeds, fertilizer, herbicides and pesticides for the
production o f rice in the next planting season, beginning in October. This emergency project
will rely on the Project Coordination Unit o f the ongoing Village Communities Support Program
for fiduciary oversight and will rely on a national producer organization network to facilitate
rapid distribution o f the required agricultural inputs to targeted farmers. Furthermore, a grant
from the LICUS trust fbnd i s being prepared to support the government's economic reform
program. Activities under the trust fund aim, among others, to: (i)   create fiscal space to finance
urgently needed priority expenditures through priority reforms in revenue administration o f the
customs and mining sectors; (ii)  promote efficiency, transparency and accountability in the use
o f public resources through enhanced public financial management and governance; and (iii)
improve the investment climate and the management o f the mining sector through the
strengtheningo f the legal miningandhydrocarbon investment framework.

              COLLABORATION WITH IME"AND OTHER DEVELOPMENT                PARTNERS

40.     IMFand IDA staffs have coordinated closely on the identificationof the respective
institutions' areas of focus.       The IMF Board concluded the first review o f Guinea's
arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) on July 28, 2008. IMF
and IDA staffs have collaborated closely to assist the authorities in the implementation o f the
country's PRSP, with the IMF taking the lead in supporting the Government on tax reform,
monetary policies and financial sector issues. IDA has focused on supporting policy reforms in
public financial management, reforms in the mining sector to enhance economic governance,
civil service reform, decentralization, private sector development and infrastructure (notably
energy and rural roads).




                                               - 22 -

41.       IDA staff have collaborated closely with other key donors.               The European
Commission (EC) plans to provide budget support in 2008. In addition, the EC has reserved
about 50 million Euros for the period 2008-10 for additional budget support. Public financial
management, including the budget process and procurement, remain a key focus o f EC support.
Inaddition, the ECplans to provide for limitedemergency and food securitysupport. The AfDB
intends to provide US$8 million over the period 2008-10. IDA staffs have coordinated with the
EC and the AfDB, notably on issues o f governance, corruption, PFM and capacity building.

42.       The World Food Program (WFP) supports basic primary education through primary-
school feeding in disadvantaged rural areas, including an incentive scheme for girls (take-home
rations) and seeks to improve health and nutritional status o f women and children through
integrated Mother-Child Health and Nutrition programs. Its current program reaches about
200,000 students. Discussions are under way to scale up these programs in response to the
current food crisis. The WFP also supports the establishment o f a strategic rice stock to improve
food security. UNICEF, jointly with WFP and UNDP, aims to alleviate acute malnutrition
among children o f up to 5 years and expand services via health centers inurbanareas. IFADwill
provide US$545,000 for seed and tools inBasse GuinCe, Moyenne Guinke and Haute GuinCe for
the 2008 growing season. IFAD i s also implementing medium term interventions in the country
for a total o fUS$20 million, incoordination with FAO.

                                         LESSONSLEARNED

43.       Cross country experiencesuggests that governmentsfacing temporary price shocks
shouldseek to maintaintheir expenditureplans, to the extentthat they have access to non-
inflationary and concessional financing, in order to minimize program disruptions and hold
down costs. In the case o f permanent shocks, an adjustment in taxation and spending will be
necessary. In the former case, budget support can help ease the process o f transition. Thus,
development policy grants can be an effective aid mechanism for such a transition in fragile
states such as Guinea. To ensure successfbl implementation, experience from other countries
points to the need to emphasize continuous improvements in public financial management,
adaptation to local implementation capacity, frequent consultations with the authorities, intensive
supervision incollaboration with MEF staff and close collaboration with other donors.

                                   ANALYTICALUNDERPINNINGS

44.      The conclusions and recommendations presented in a number of analytical
documents providedthe foundationfor the design of the proposedoperation. A November
2006 poverty diagnostic, based on data from the 2002 Integrated Household Survey and the Core
Welfare Indicators Questionnaire (CWIQ), provides information on poverty and public service
delivery issues. In addition, a recently prepared policy note examines the impact o f rising rice
and petroleum product prices on consumer welfare and poverty.'6 The note concludes that the
rice price inflation has a significantly more severe impact on the urbanpoor population than on
the rural poor. These analyses are complemented by a recently undertaken Impact Analysis of
Higher Prices on Food Security and Nutrition, issued by the World Food Program. The analysis

highlightsthe severe risk o f malnutrition among Guinea's urbanpoor as well as implementation
difficulties inan environment characterized by weak governance.

45.     Key documents for issues related to public resource management include the Public
Financial Management (PFM, Reform Plan, which was recently adopted by the government to
reform public financial management. This built on IMF technical assistance reports on the status
o f the PFM, the 2007 PEFA Report, a 2007 procurement audit, the 2004 PER and the 2005
corruption survey. These documents have highlighted areas for further strengthening in public
financial management, several o f which are being supported under the planned LICUS Trust
Fundmentionedinparagraph 38 o fthis attachment.


E.      THE PROPOSEDOPERATION

                                DESCRIPTION OFTHE OPERATION

46.     The proposed grant of US$2.5 million would support the Government's Second
Poverty Reduction Strategy by providing the authorities with needed fiscal space to
compensatefor the lost revenuesresultingfrom the recentlyreducedcustomsdutieson rice
imports. This support would help mitigate the impact of international rice price increases and
contribute to continued basic service delivery for vulnerable groups. The grant will be financed
through the Food Price Crisis Response Trust Fund, which was approved by the Board on May
29,2008. The government's recent announcement that the export banon agricultural products i s
no longer ineffect (except for rice for which an export tariff is currently beingconsidered by the
government) i s expected to provide an immediate boost to food production. Inthe medium-term,
the government intends to stimulate agricultural production through a combination of
agricultural investment projects, investments inrural infrastructure, especially rural roads, and an
expansion inthe provision o f extension services.

47.     Consultationson the content of the proposedgrant were carried out with the MEF
inJuly 2008. A prior World Bank mission inApril and June 2008 provided advice on short and
medium term interventions to counter the food crisis. The same mission included an inventory
o f key safety net programs with the aim to verify opportunities for scaling up existing programs,
inparticularfood emergency programs.

48.     The proposed development policy grant meets all the requirements under the
framework of the GlobalFoodCrisis ResponseProgram. Guinea is an IDA-eligiblecountry
which i s a net importer o f both food and fuel.      It is therefore highly vulnerable to price
fluctuations for both commodities. The appraisal mission provided policy analysis and advice to
the Government on feasible pricing responses to the food crisis and on the agricultural growth
strategy to overcome the crisis.

                                             POLICYAREAS

49.     The government has already taken the following actions to mitigate the impact of
the food andfuelpriceincreases:

(i)Supporttoconsumersthroughtheleanperiod:
     .. reduction in rice customs duties from 12.75 to 2.75 percent during the period June 1 to
        end October 2008 to provide for a first reliefto the poor andvulnerable; and
        distribution o ftake-home food rations for children for families o f five or more members.

(ii)Supporttoagriculturalproductionthrough:
     .. emergency support to the 2008-09 season with fertilizers, improved seeds, veterinary
        inputs, repair and maintenance o f agricultural assets; and
        medium- to longer-term support to intensify rice production through investments inwater
        management infrastructure, improved inputs and through activities to diversify crop
        production.


50.     To complementthese measures, the Governmenthas identifieda series of measures
aimedat protectingspecific populationgroups andhas askedfor internationalassistanceto
    .
supportthem:

        establishment o f a food security stock o f 25,000 tons and emergency food assistance
        during the lean season (July-September 2008), the total costs o f which are estimated at
    .   US$28 million    - hding i   s beingsought from UNDP, WFP and UNICEF;
        food assistanceto primary and secondary school students inurbansettings through school
    .   kitchens, and to lactating women through health centers (US$1.1 million)      - funding for
        this assistanceisnot yet identified;
        quick infrastructure improvements for small scale fishery to improve productivity and
        facilitate the stocking o f fish - funding i s being sought from the BID.

51.     Furthermore, the government has implemented specific measures to address the
    .
impactof highpetroleumprices:

        subsidy o f transportation for primary and secondary school students;
        increased scholarships for students; and
    9   increased transport allowance for civil servants.


52.     These measures have reducedthe magnitude of the shock felt by consumers; even
so, inflation has been substantial, especially inurban areas (see Table 5 below). The impact has
been severe particularly in 2008 when the June price o f rice rose by 97 percent over the June
2007 price, and fuel prices increased 63 percent over the same period. Moreover, with the



                                                 - 25 -

exception o f agricultural support, these policies have only partially mitigated the full impact o f
the price shocks.

53.        The customs duties reductions result in revenue losses relative to what could have
been collected had the tariffs been maintained at a level o f 12.75 percent. The Ministry o f
Economy and Finance (MEF) estimates that the loss in 2008 will be approximately GNF12
billion (or US$2.5 million) when valued at actual prices seen in the first half o f the year.17 In
addition, the cost o f basic service delivery increased by an estimated GNF18 billion (US$4.0
million), o fwhich GNT 14billion (US$3.0 million) is accounted for by the higher cost o f fuel.

54.        To alleviate the short-run impact on consumer welfare of rising food prices, the
authorities are currently discussing options to expand ongoing safety net programs for
school feeding, supplemental feeding for pregnant and lactating mothers, and food-for-workhash
programs. The Bank plans to assist in this effort, as mentioned above by providing additional
funding (US$2.5 million) for labor-intensive public works programs through a parallel grant
under the Food Crisis Response Trust Fund. Inthe medium-tern, the authorities will stimulate
food production through a combination o f agricultural investment projects, investments in the
road network and the provision o f extension services. The Bank will contribute to this effort
through the above mentioned Emergency Agricultural Productivity Support Project (US$5 .O
million), for which financing i s sought under the Food Price Crisis Response Trust Fund. The
Bank is also planning to use IDA resources to meet critical agricultural investment needs for a
medium term supplyresponse.

successful implementation (see Annex 1o f this Attachment). The rationale for the selection has
been discussed in the previous section, namely their importance to the program and expressed
government commitment and feasibility. Compliance with the prior actions below as defined in
the Grant Agreement forms the basis for IDA to proceed with the proposedoperation:

a.      The Recipient has reduced customs duties on imported rice, which is 25 percent broken,
        from 12.75 percent to 2.75 to mitigate the impact o f rapidly rising international prices o f
        food; and

b.      The Recipient has issued an administrative instruction (arrzte) which clarifies that there is
        no ban on agricultural exports ineffect inGuinea. However, the export o f rice is exempted
        from this policy until a study on rice exports has been concluded, which i s to inform about
        options o f levying an exports tax on rice re-exports to address inherent distortions in this
        market. In addition, the Minister o f Economy and Finance informs the customs
        administration about this policy stance by issuing a ministerial instruction to the respective
        administrative entities. By way o f a dialogue with civil society and with the help o f mass
        mediathe public dissemination o f this policy clarification is being sought.

56.       The Governmenthas decidedto ban rice exportsuntilan analysisof the rice sector,
which is affected by distortions, is completed. TO address the question o f distortions, the
government will study, jointly with development partners, the benefits o f levying a tax on rice
re-exports within the next four months. Once the study's conclusions are available, the
government will re-align its policy on rice exports with the general policy o f unrestricted
agricultural exports.

57.       The expected outcome of the proposed operation is to enable the poor and
vulnerable population in urban areas to maintain a minimum rice consumptionlevel. The
government's recent announcement that export bans on agricultural products are no longer in
effect would also help ameliorate food security. It i s estimated that the proposed policy measure
will reduce the price o f imported rice by 5-10 percent" compared to prevailing prices in the
absence o f this measure. Details on monitoring and evaluation arrangements are provided in
paragraph 60 and inAnnex 2 o f this attachment.

F.        OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

                                          POVERTYAND SOCIAL IMPACT

58.       The measures supported by the proposed grant are expected to have a significant
positive impact on poverty reduction. A rapid assessment resulting from the recent Bank
mission confirms that the set o f measures undertaken by the Government and detailed in
paragraphs 49 to 51 are the most feasible given the circumstances and will have a fast and
positive impact on Guinea's poor population. In addition, the 2006 Poverty Diagnostic and the
analytical note on the impact o f the rice and petroleum price increases suggest that support for
rice consumption i s pro-poor - with the poor accounting for 54 percent o f the food purchased in
the country and spending 19 percent o f their household income on rice alone. However, while


'*Iti s assumedthat inthe short-termthe price of importedrice i s reducedandsubstitution doesnothavean effect.



                                                           - 2 7 -

the rural poor consume mostly domestically produced rice, the urban poor spend more than half
of their budget for rice on importedrice. By providing the authorities with needed fiscal space to
compensate for the lost revenues resulting from the recently reduced customs duties on rice
imports (25 percent broken), the operation would help mitigate the impact o f such price increases
and contribute to continued basic service delivery for vulnerable groups. The government's
recent announcement clarifying that no export ban on agricultural products i s in effect i s also
expected to provide a boost to agricultural production and thus ameliorate food security.

                                       ENVIRONMENTAL      ASPECTS

59.     The proposed operation is not likely to have significant negative environmental
impacts. The operation does not directly involve any significant physical process that would
impact the environment o f Guinea. However, the operation i s set in the framework o f the
government's broad program to mitigate the impact o f the food and he1price increases which i s
expected to lead to the intensification and expansion of rice production, including through the
use o f fertilizers and pesticides. Potential negative environmental impact o f the government's
program could include soil erosion and water contamination from runoff. The Recipient will be
preparing a pesticide management plan and environmental management framework for the
Emergency Agricultural Productivity Support Project mentioned in paragraph 54 above. These
documents will be publically disclosed and disseminated by the Ministry of Agriculture and, as
such, can be more broadly applied to the Ministry's program o f agricultural intensification.
Although Guinea's policies recognize the need to promote environmental protection, and efforts
are made to mainstream such policies, including for the mining sector, the capacity to implement
such policies remains weak. Incremental fbnding from the GEF financed projects integrated into
the Phase I1 o f the Village Communities Support Program (VCSP) i s supporting capacity
buildingfor environmentalproject screening and increased awarenesso fenvironmentalissues.


                         IMPLEMENTATION,MONITORING EVALUATIONAND

60.     The government has established a Food Emergency Crisis Committee, under the
authority of the Prime Minister and supportedby a technicalunit, to coordinate, monitor
and evaluate its global response to the crisis. Within this broader coordination arrangement,
the administration o f the proposed operation will be the responsibility o f the MEF and the
Ministryof Commerce and Competitiveness. Both form the National Consultative Permanent
Committee for Price Competitiveness. The committee i s charged to monitor the implementation
and the impact o f the tariff reduction on rice prices. Inparticular, the committee has negotiated
with importers a formal agreement which allows for tariff reductions on rice imports against
additional disclosure and monitoring o f import and sales contracts as well as o f margins. If the
agreement i s violated, the granted tariff advantage i s declared void and has to be repaid. The
participation o f importers in the agreement is on a voluntary basis. While there i s no declared
price for rice, a price ceiling o f GNF 190,000 for 50 kilogram o f rice i s targeted.               The
mechanism i s reviewed once a month. Price monitoring i s exercised permanently. The
government will make use o f the latest household survey data o f 2007, and collected price data,
to analyzelg the impact o f the measure on the rice consumption o f the urban poor. The
implementation of this policy will be reviewed by the government in close coordination with

 This willbe done prior to the closingofthe FoodCrisisDevelopmentPolicy Grant slatedfor July 31,2009.

macroeconomic policy framework.

                                                FIDUCIARY      ASPECTS

61.      The Bankhas reviewedthe fiduciary arrangementsinthe contextofthe preparation
of this grant proposal.Following the PEFA (Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability)
assessment o f 2007 and earlier reports (PER, CFAA and CPAR), there are several shortcomings
inthe country's public expenditure management:" (i)                 budget credibility, comprehensiveness and
transparency; (ii)     budget formulation and execution; (iii)          accounting and financial reporting; and
(iv) internal and external oversight (audit).                     The PEFA report indicates that budget
comprehensiveness is weakened by the fact that the budget classification and documentation
provide only a partial view o f expenditure programs. Budget execution suffers because, in some
instances, expenditures were made directly by the Treasury without going through the normal
commitment, verification andpayment process. Lastly, accountability i s reduced by the limited
coverage o f internal audits andthe quasi-absence o f external oversight on the part o f the Court o f
Accounts and Parliament. These findings have also been confirmed in a recent external audit
covering all ministries, which was requested by the authorities in May 2007. A summary o f the
report has been widely published.

62.      To address these concerns,the Governmenthas recently adopteda multiyear public
financial management reform plan." The plan is supported by the IMF, the Bank and other
development partners. It i s organized along five results that the plan aims to achieve: (i)
improved effectiveness, efficiency and transparency o f public resource management; (ii)
improved internal and external resource mobilization with a view to carry out all expenditure
programs and attain fiscal balance; (iii)             reinforced institutional structures at the Ministry o f
Economy and Finance, with a view to improve basic services delivery; (iv) establishment o f a
public financial management framework that is coherent, effective and adapted to the Guinean
needs; and (v) development o f a PFM control system that meets international best practices. The
plan includes actions designed to: strengthen financial regulations in compliance with
international standards; improve the budget process through capacity building for strategic
planning and budgetingin sector ministries and the adoption o f a new budget classification to
better track poverty-reducing expenditures and ensures budget comprehensiveness and
transparency; reform public procurement; enhance budget execution, including through a
strengthened Integrated Financial Management Information System and chart o f accounts; and
strengthen internal and external audit and accountability by providing the chamber o f accounts
with more resources andclarifying its mandate.

63.      The IMF updatedits safeguards assessment of the CentralBank of Guinea (BCRG)
in 2007. The assessment confirmed the existence o f critical weaknesses. The main problems
identified concerned foreign exchange management, the quality o f the internal control, the audit
environment and a lack o f independence o f the BCRG. The authorities have committed to
implementing the 2007 safeguards recommendations. In this respect, the latest IMF review
mission noted important progress since July 2007 in strengthening internal controls and foreign

                                                     AND

64.     The proposed operation would consist o f a single tranche grant o f US$2.5 million to be
available upon effectiveness, anticipated by early August 2008. The grant will follow IDA'S
disbursement procedures for development policy operations.           Once the operation becomes
effective, and at the request o f the Recipient, the proceeds will be deposited by the Bank into a
government account at the BCRG, which forms part o f the country's foreign exchange reserves.
The grant will be disbursed against satisfactory implementation o f the development policy
program andnot linked to any specific purchases. As a due diligence measure, within 30 days o f
receipt the Recipient will provide a written confirmation to IDA when the amount has been
credited to an account available to finance budgeted expenditures ina manner acceptable to IDA.
The proceeds o f the operation would not be used to finance expenditures excluded under the
Agreement. If,after being deposited ina government account, the proceeds o f the grant are used
for ineligible purposes as defined inthe Grant Agreement, the Bank will require the Recipient to
refund such amount promptly upon notice from IDA. Amounts refunded to the Bank upon such
request shall be canceled.

                                   R I S K S AND RISK MITIGATION

65.     The following risks could jeopardize the success of the program supported by the
proposedgrant. First, Guinea remains highlyvulnerable to commodity price changes. Further
increases inworld food and fuel prices may underminemacroeconomic stabilization efforts and
the impact o f the government's program on the poor. Inparticular, rising inflation could create
pressures for civil service wage increases or lead the government to revert to food export bans.
Also, further worsening o f the external environment may lead to increased political and social
instability.  These risks are mitigated through intensive monitoring by the government and
dialogue with donors and, inthe case o f further significant increases infood and fuel prices, may
require additional measures to sustain the fiscal balance and macroeconomic stability. The risk
o f further social and political instability, which could undermine the stabilization efforts, is
mitigated by the broad commitment from Government and the trade unions to the objectives of
the economic program andwillingness o f development partners to support the economic program
with additional financing, incase needed.

66.     Second, the goal o f creating fiscal space to protect critical expenditures could be made
more difficult in the event that revenues and grants fall significantly short o f targets or if
substantial new and unavoidable spending requirements emerge. This risk i s mitigatedby the
government's already demonstrated commitment to protect priority expenditures through
reductions inless essential spending.

67.     Finally, while Guinea may be able to import food (notably rice), the vulnerable and food
insecure may not be able to pay for it. This risk i s mitigated by the fact that several development
partners (including the World Bank) are supporting programs aimed at creating income and
employment opportunities duringthis period o f rising food and oil prices.

                                               Introduction

         1.     The country is facing a price shockcausedby rapidly rising internationalfood and
         petroleum product prices, which undermines the Government's efforts towards
         macroeconomic stabilization, and raises concerns about deepening social tensions in the
         country. The price for a kilogram of imported rice, the main staple food in Guinea,
         increased from June 2007 to June 2008 by 96 percent. Similarly, the price of locally
         produced potatoes and palm oil increased during the same period by about 80 and 64
         percent, respectively.Oil prices at the pump had to be increasedon April 1, 2008, by 63
         percent to compensate for internationalprice rises. Poverty is likely to rise under these
         conditions. Inflation, which was declining last year, is acceleratingand stands at 24.6
         percent at end June 2008. The Government has reacted, and in discussion with civil
         society, stakeholders, and development partners, has developed a programof emergency
         measures, which aims to mitigate the impact of this price shock on the poor and
         vulnerable,but allowsfor remainingon the pathtowards macroeconomic stabilization.

         2.     It is in this context that I am writing on behalf of the Government of Guinea to
         request your approval for a Food Crisis Response Development Policy Grant amounting
         to US$2.5 million to help compensate for revenues lost due to reduction of customs
         duties on rice, a policy the Governmentapplied sinceJune and intendsto apply up to end
         October, throughout the lean period and up to the end of the Ramadan period. The
         Government is of the view that under the given circumstances the customs duty

reductions on rice is an effective and rapidly available policy to mitigate the impact of
rapidly rising internationalcommoditypriceson the income of the poor. The additional
resources help the Government to protect the provision of basic services in 2008, and
help meetingexpectations for better living conditions. In our view, this is essential for
the maintenance of economic and social stability and for the continuous successful
implementation of the government macroeconomic stabilization program. The Food
Crisis ResponseDevelopmentPolicyGrant is part of a broaderstrategy coveringvarious
short-termandmediumtermsupportmeasuresthat are explainedfurther below.

        Macroeconomic Policy Frameworkand Performance in 2007 and 2008

3.       Since taking office at end-March 2007, the Government has adopted important
measuresto stabilizethe macro-economyandinitiatedimportantreforms.We have acted
quickly andresolutelyto restore fiscal discipline, regaincontrol of monetary policy, and
improve transparency and governance. We also decided in May 2007 to launch a short
term recovery programincludingaseries of priority actions aimed at economic, political,
andsocial stabilization,to be implementedby end-2007. Since end 2007 our policiesare
supported by an arrangement under the IMP Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility
(PRGF).

4.       Our macroeconomicpoliciesare basedon the SecondPovertyReductionStrategy
(PRS-II) for the period2007-10, which was adopted and issued in August 2007 after a
broad national discussion. The strategy aims to reverse the upward trend of poverty
observed since 2002 by expanding and deepening the priority actions conducive to
growth andemployment. This PRS-Ilis basedon: (i) improvinggovernance andbuilding
capacity; (ii)accelerating sustainable economic growth that benefits all; and (iii)
developing basic public services, We consider sound macroeconomic management and
expeditedstructural reformsas essentialfor acceleratingprivate sector developmentand
thereby growth. To help to implement the macroeconomicand financial components of
the PRS-II, the government intends to obtain debt relief under the HlPC initiative and
MDRI in order to gain the required fiscal space and be able to refocus on priority
investments.

 5.      The Government took bold action since March 2007 to restore macroeconomic
 stabilityandto providefor sustainable recoveryof growth. Growthreached 1.8 percentin
 2007 andis expectedto mover in2008 to 4.5 percent, up from an average of 2.3 percent
over the period 2001 to 2007. The primary fiscal balance (after grants) reached 3.7
percent of GDP in 2007, up from 3.5 percent in 2006. The primary fiscal balance is
projectedto be 3.5 percentof GDP in 2008. Muchof this improvement is to be reached
due to the strict applicationof monthlyexpenditureceilingsfor line ministrieswithin the
monthly revenue envelope. suspension of automatic debits of treasury accounts by the
Central Bank (BCRG), andprohibitionof extra-budgetaryexpendituresas well as ad hoc
tax or customs exemptions.Fiscalpolicies were complementedby importantpolicy and


                                            2

institutionalreformsat the Central Bank of Guinea, improving the coordinationof fiscal
andmonetary. As a result of these policies, the annual inflation rate could be reduced to
12.8percentby end-2007, downfrom 39.1 percent at the closingof 2006.

6.      However, while the Guinea Franc's effective exchange rate appreciated in real
terms by 44 percent since the endof the strikeof early 2007, the external reserveposition
remained precariouswith less than 10 days of import coverage at end 2007, down from
around 20 days in 2006. Current projections are that the trade deficit will increase in
2008to about 6 percentof GDP, up from 3 percentof GDPin2007. Risingimportprices
for food and crude oil ledto a wideningin the country's trade deficit andto a decline in
the import cover to less than 10 days. Guinea's export revenues could not benefit from
the rise in the international price of commodities as expected. Its main exports, bauxite
and alumina, representabout 60 percentof export revenues. Prices of these products are
typically not determined by international trade but by long terms delivery contracts
within integrated industries. As a consequence, the terms of trade have deteriorated in
2007 by 8 percent andare projectedto deteriorateby another 8 percentin2008.

7.      The current account balance in 2007 was financed mainly by concessional
external project assistance, HIPC interimrelief, a risingflow of foreign directinvestment,
and some arrears accumulation, which were clearedin early 2008 when Guineareached
agreementon adebt reschedulingwith ParisClubcreditors.

8.      The challengefor the Governmentis to pursue macroeconomicstabilizationwhile
having to face an unfavorable international environment and meeting demands for
compensation for the high price increases for basic goods, foremost rice and energy
prices.

          Medium-termMacroeconomicObjectivesand Policiesfor 2008-10

9.      The key medium-tern macroeconomic objectives include the restoration of
sustainable growth, a stable macroeconomic environmmt. which allows for
implementingthe structuralreformagenda, especiallyin the public financial management
area and the mining sector, and a revitalizing of private sector growth. The
macroeconomicframework projects real GDP growth of about 5.0 percent during 2008-
2010, underpinned by strong foreign direct investment in the mining sector and
expansionin agriculture. Plannedinvestment in infrastructureand improvementsin the
business climate are expected to contribute to the growth prospects of the economy.
Inflation will decline to 7 percent only by 2010, given the laggedeffects of rising food
and energy prices, Gross external reserves are programmedto cover about 3 months of
importby 2010.

                                     FiscalPolicy

10.    Macroeconomic stability in the medium term will be underpinnedby continuous
prudentfiscal policies. The medium-termfiscalobjectiveswill aim at increasingrevenue
mobilization, improving the domestic primary budget balance, reducing domestic and
external debt, and reorienting public spending towards infrastructure and poverty
spending.

11.    The Governmentintendsto increasedomestic revenue(without grants) from 14.3
percent of GDP in 2007 to 16.9 percent of GDP in 2010. The increasein tax revenues
will primarily be achieved by expanding the tax base and by improving tax collection,
includingin the mining sector. To this end, the Government will continue reducingtax
andcustomsexemptions, particularlythrough a thoroughrevisionof the investmentcode,
and will modernize the revenue-collecting units and enforce controls over them by
applying performance contracts. To this effect the Governmentcontracted in May 2008
the services of the International Company Bureau Ven'tas to work with the custom
administrationfor the verificationof pre-shipmentvalues.

12.    The Governmentwants to make adecisive break with past practices and aims to
apply increasinglybasic internationalstandards to public finance management (PFM).
For this purpose, a PFM reformstrategy(action plan) for the period2008-10 has been
adopted on June 27, 2008. The plan covers the entire budget cycle, from budget
preparationto submission of the budget review law to the NationalAssembly, execution,
audit andsupervisionprocedures, anddatareporting.

13.     As an immediate action, we are undertaking a review of the functional budget
classification to allow for better identification and tracking of poverty reduction
expenditure. The regular procedurefor executing public expenditure, which now covers
only a small fraction of expenditure, will be reinstated and the use of exceptional
procedures will be limited; in particular, the simplified procedure applicable to
procurementcontractswill beeliminated.

 14.    In addition, the transparency of Government accounting and of the Treasury
balance will be enhanced, The responsibilities of the financial supervision unit, the
GeneralFinanceInspectorate(IGF), andthe General GovernmentInspectorate(IGE) will
be clearly definedand delineated and their performancemore closely monitored. In the
2008 budget we have giventhe IGFandthe IGE the resources they will needto improve
their performance. We will also ensure that the findings and recommendationsof their
reportsarc followedupandwe will publishtheirannual activity report.

15.     Given the importance of the mining sector in Guinea for growth and the fiscal
balance, we are committedto improve the legal framework governingthe investments in
the miningsector. The Governmenthascommittedto adopt two modelcontractsbasedon
international best practices, which govern (i) existing and (ii)new mining operations.

                                     - 34 -

Based on the principles and standards embedded in theses model contracts, the
Government will undertakea review of existing contracts, and harmonize and align them
with international standards. The mining investment code and the code for non-mining
investments will be reviewed in light of these new policies to harmonize the given legal
frameworks for investment incentives.

16.     With the support of our development partners, we expect to improve the financial
situation and the performance of EDG and SEG beginning with 2008. Efforts have been
stepped up to eliminate the fraudulent use of water and electricity. The situation of cross
arrears with the Government will be updated and a settlement plan will be adopted in
2008. To maintain the financial balance for both companies in light of increasinginput
costs, especially energy, the average tariff for services has been increased by 62 percent
in June 2008, without a change in the social tariffs, which cover poor households. In
addition, the ongoing study of the overall policy on electricity and water tariff rates will
be completedby end 2008 with aview to rationalizing the rate structureby 2009.

                        Monetary andFinancial Sector Policies

17.     Monetary policy will be closely coordinated with fiscal policies and reserve
money growth, and will be strictly aligned with nominal GDP growth. The Government
has embarked on a program to strengthen the operationalcapacity of the Central Bank,
following up on the recommendationsof the safeguard assessment update conducted by
the JMF in 2007, and especially improving internal control and audit operations. The
Government intends to present this year to the National Assembly a new Central Bank
law that strengthens the independence of the Central Bank and the transparency of its
operations.

 18.    To deepen the financial sector development and to analyze relevant policy

 19.    Exchange rate flexibility will continue to be a key thrust of Oovernment's external
sector policies as it will facilitate timely adjustments to external developments. The
official exchange rate will continue to be determinedby marketmechanismwhile aiming
to minimize exchange rate volatility. The exchange rate system will remain free from
restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international
transactions.

goal to obtain more fiscal space for urgently ncedcd priority investment for poverty
reductionandimproving basic servicedelivery.

21.     The Government is conscious that the fragile economic balance of the country
requires continuousimplementationof a prudentexternaldebt policy afterreachingHIPC

                          The SecondPovertyReductionStrategy

22.     Our second poverty reduction strategy (PRS-II), which covers the period
2007-10, aims to reverse the upward trend of poverty observed since 2002, and set the
appropriate condition for reaching the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), This
strategy is based on three pillars: (i)   improving governance and building capacity; (ii)
accelerating growth and expanding employment and income opportunities; and (iii)
improvingaccess to basicpublic services.

23.     Improving governance and building capacity. We have recognized weak
governance as a major reason for the lack of progress in poverty reduction. The key
elements of the Governmentprogramfor good governance include: (i)strengtheningthe
capacity of republican institutions; (ii) continued improvements in public financial
management, especially in the management of natural resources; iii)improvements in
public service delivery through capacity building (administrative governance); (iv)
decentralization of service delivery; (v) better statistics for monitoring outcomes; (vii)
judicial reformandimprovingof the sanctionsystem; (viii) tackling humanrightsabuses;
(ix) improvingaccess to information;and(v) continuedstrengtheningof the police.

24.     Accelerating growth and expanding employment and income opportunitles.
Thi8 pillar emphaslzesthe contlnued implementationof sound economic pollciesto
attain macroeconomicstability anda morefavorable environment for private sector
development. The key objectives of the government program for sustainable growth
under this second pillar include: (i) appropriatefiscal and monetary policies, including
reaching the HIPC Completion Point; (ii) support to the productive sectors, and
especially agriculture, through the provisionof inputs, machinery, extensionservicesand
training;' (iii)investmentsin infrastructure for power, roads andinformation technology;
and (iv) improvementsin the investment climate, includingthrough revisionof the legal
framework for mining andnon-mininginvestmentin line with internationalpractices, as
well as a better dialogue between government and the privatesector. In this respect, the
authorities have also decidedto enhance the ExtractiveIndustryTransparency Initiative
' Inputsand machineryare to be providedon a costrecovery basisor through favorablecredit terms.

25.     Improvingaccess to basic public services. Investmentsineducationandhealth
and improved delivery of basic services will provide the basis for sustained poverty
reductionby enhancingthe capacitiesof the poorandreducingtheir vulnerability. Policy
objectives in this regard include: expanding basic education and training, expanding
health, immunizationandnutrition services, includingHIVIAIDS preventionandcontrol,
increasing access to safe drinking water and sanitation facilities, social protection, and
gender equality and empowerment. To realize these objectives, the Government will
pursue decentralization of several services, construction and rehabilitationof facilities,
development of a basic socialnetwork, improvingof curricula, training for teachers and
health workers, and better administration, including improved statistics for monitoring
educationalenrollmentrates andhealthoutcomes.


   THEGOVERNMENT'SFOODAND FUELCRISIS RESPONSEPROGRAM

26.     Given the high level of poverty in Guinea, and the risk of further increasing
poverty in 2008 due to the food and petroleumpriceshocks, the Government established
a high level task force under the leadership of the Prime Minister, comprised of the
Ministers of Economy and Finance, of Commerce, and of Agriculture to lead the
Governmentresponseto the foodandfuel priceincreases,

27.     As one of its first actions in response to the emerging crisis, the Government
decidednot to fully pass through the recent high internationalprices of food and fuel to
consumers. This was achievedby subsidizingtransport for primaryandsecondary school
students and civil servants and by increasing scholarships allowance for students.
Furthermore the Government is working with the World Food Program to expand
existingschool feeding programsinruralandurbanareas. To obtainimmediaterelieffor
the poor andvulnerable, the Governmenthasbegun inJune to reducefrom 12.75 percent
to 2.75 the customs duties on importedrice, which is 25 percent broken, a rice quality
that is primarily consumedby the poorer segments of the populations. The measure is
appliedtemporarily during the so called lean andRamadanperiod, stretchingfrom June
to end October. Jointly with the World Bank, the Government is preparing for a work-
for-cashprogramin Conakry to offer additionalincomeopportunitiesfor the poor.

28.     The Government is also pursuing short to mediumterm measures, which aim to
enhance food security and accelerate the food supply response.Jointly with W,IFAD,
FAO, UNDP and other partners the Government intends to establish a food security
reserve, which couldmeet immediatedemands but also would have a balancingeffect on
supplies and price volatility in Guinea. In addition, the Government has elaborated a



                                            7




                           - 3 7 -

programwith the World Bank to enhancerice growingproductivity by scaling up (i) the
farmer seed multiplication network, (ii) the procurement of 2,000 tons of fertilizer, and
(iii) the distribution of input packages to 80,000 smallholder farmers, which is estimated
to increasericeproductionby 100,OOOtons.

29.     The reduction in customs dutieson importedrice is projectedto lead to a revenue
loss of about US2.5 million and thereby reduce the fiscal space to deliver the planned
level of basic services. The combined fiscal implications of the lost revenues and the
additional costs incurred for basic service delivery deserves serious consideration, in
order to avoidjeopardizing ongoingefforts at macroeconomic and social stability. The
lost revenues from reducing the customs duties in 2008 are significant for a country,
which tries to overcome very fragile economic and social conditions, and which has an
unsustainable high debt burden. Additional resources are needed in order to meet the
commitmentsunder the PRGFarrangementandstay onthe pathtowards macroeconomic
stabilization as well as for maintainingthe deliveryof basicservices.

30.     In this context, the Government seeks external assistanceto mitigate the negative
impact of the recentcustoms duties reductiontakenin responseto escalatinginternational
food prices.

                  The FoodCrisisResponseDevelopmentPolicyGrant

31.     The proposed grant of USS2.5 million equivalent would support a selected
element of the Government response to mitigate the impact of the food price crises in
2008 on the poor and vulnerable by providingneededfiscal space to compensate for the
lost revenues resultingfrom the reduced custom duties on rice imports, applied between
June andend October, 2008. This support would help mitigatethe impact of such price
increasesandcontributeto continuedbasic servicedeliveryfor vulnerable groups.

32.     To support the food supply response, the Government has issued an
administrative instruction(arrtte) written statement, which clarifies that the= is no ban
in Guineaon agriculturalexports following the expiration at end2007 of a temporaryban
imposedin 2007. However, the export of rice is exemptedfrom this policy until a study
on rice exports has k e n concluded, which is to inform about options of levying an
exports tax on rice re-exports to address inherent distortions in this market. The
Government's administrativeinstruction (urrSte) is complemented by an instructionof
the Minister of Economy and Finance (circulaire) informing the custom administration
explicitly about this policy stance. In addition, by way of a dialogue with civil society,
includingthe unions, and with the help of mass media the public dissemination of this
policyclarificationandpolicy stanceis beingsought.

33.     The highlevel steeringcommittee formedfor the responseto the food emergency
crises will report on the implementation of the measures and i s responsible for its
monitoring. The committee will use technical support groups to discharge its steering

responsibility. It will share all respectiveimplementation and monitoringreports with the
Bank.

                                          Conclusion

34.     Macroeconomic and budgetary management during 2008 has been, and will be,
very challenging due to the social and economic implication of high price rises of food
and petroleumproducts. While the Government i s trying to mitigatethe impact of rising
food and fuel prices on the poor and vulnerable, the actions taken have resulted in
revenue losses and increased fiscal costs, undermining the protectionof basic services
when they are most needed. In this context, the continued and enhanced support of our
developmentpartners remains critical inenablingthe Government of Guineato tackle the
poverty situation and hence contribute to maintaining political and socio-economic
stability.

Press ReleaseNo. 08/185
FOR IMMEDIATERELEASE
July 28,2008
IMFExecutiveBoardCompletesFirstReview underPRGFArrangementfor Guinea,
IncreasesFinancialAssistance to MitigateFoodandFuelsPriceImpact, andApproves
US%28.7MillionDisbursement


The Executive Board o fthe InternationalMonetary Fund(IMF) today completedthe first review
o f Guinea's performance under a three-year Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF)
arrangement. The Board also approved an SDR 21.42 million (about US$34.9million)
augmentation inthe arrangement to help Guinea cope with the recent external shocks from rising
food and fuel prices. The completion o f the review enables the disbursement o f SDR 17.595
million (about US$28.7 million), which would bring total disbursements under the arrangement
to SDR 24.48 million (about US$39.9 million), includingpart o fthe augmented amount.

The Executive Board also granted waivers o f non-observance for two performance criteria
related to net international reserves and external payments arrears, on the basis o f remedy
allocations taken, and decided to modify the performance criteria for the next disbursement in
view o f the adverse external shock that Guinea i s experiencing. The Board completed the
country's financing assurancesreview under the arrangement as well.

The three-year PRGF arrangement for Guinea was originally approved by the Executive Board
on December 21, 2007 (see Press Release No. 07/309) in an amount equivalent to SDR 48.195
million (about US78.5 million). With the Board's approval of the augmentation today, the total
amount o fthe arrangement will be equivalent to SDR 69.615million (about US113.4 million).

Following the Executive Board's discussion, Mr. Murilo Portugal, Deputy Managing Director
and Acting Chair, said:

"Guinea's economic stabilization policies were successful in2007. Inflation fell significantly and
the economy began to recover from social turmoil early in the year. The basic primary fiscal
surplusimproved, andthe authorities refrained from recourse to CentralBank financing.

"The large international fuel and food price shock is creating serious challenges to the short term
outlook. The government courageously raised local petroleum prices substantially early in the
year and further measures to ensure the pass-through o f world oil prices are planned for the



                                              - 4 1 -

period ahead. It will be important to target measures to alleviate the impact o f higher food prices
on the most vulnerable.

"To help absorb the effect o f higher food and fuel prices on the balance o f payments and
accomplish the program objectives in 2008, including the rebuilding o f foreign reserves, well-
coordinated economic policies, and the mobilization o f additional external assistance will be
needed. The Fund has augmented financial resources to Guinea's PRGF arrangement. This, in
conjunction with other donors' support, will help inmitigating the impact o f the surge inoil and
food prices.

"A proactive monetary policy will help manage liquidity growth and contain inflationary
pressures. Continued fiscal adjustment can be achieved through improving revenue collection
and containing the budget's exposure to loss-making public enterprises. Non-priority
expenditures need to be curtailed to create the fiscal space for increased pro-growth and pro poor
spending.

"It will be important to accelerate structural reforms to achieve sustained private sector- and
foreign direct investment-led growth andreduce poverty. Efforts to improve the management o f
Guinea's abundant natural resources will help the country benefit from the world wide boom in
commodity prices. The plans to improve public financial management, and to reform the Central
Bank and enhance its independence are also important priorities.

"Continued implementation o f the PRGF-supported program will help pave the way for Guinea
to achieve the Completion Point under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)
Initiative and benefit from the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI). It will be important for
the authorities to strengthen foreign exchange and debt management to avoid the recurrence of
external arrears, and safeguard debt sustainability," Mr.Portugal said.

The PRGF i s the IMF's concessional facility for low-income countries. PRGF loans carry an
annual interest rate o f 0.5 percent and are repayable over 10 years with a 5%-year grace period
on principal payments.

            ATTACHMENT 2: EMERGENCYPROJECT PAPERFORA PROPOSED
       ADDITIONAL FINANCING GRANTTO PHASEI1OF THE THIRD URBAN
         DEVELOPMENTPROJECTAND A GRANT FORAN AGRICULTURAL
                            PRODUCTIVITY SUPPORTPROJECT

A.      INTRODUCTION

 1.     This Emergency Project Paper (EPP) provides a detailed description o f the two
investment grant components o f the Guinea Emergency Food Crisis Response Program
(GEFCRP) described in Section one o fthis document. These include: (i)     an additional financing
grant o f US$2.5 million to the Third Urban Development Project to support a Labor-Intensive
Public Works Program; and (ii)a new grant o f US$5.0 million to support an Emergency
Agricultural Productivity Support Project. The proposed interventions are being undertaken
under the Global Food Crisis Response Program (GFRP), which was endorsed by the Board on
May 29, 2008, and will be financed out o f the Food Price Crisis Response (FPCR) Trust Fund
(TF).

2.      The overarching program objectives, rationale, risks, country context, and links to the
country strategy for the GEFCRP as they relate to these two investment components are
described in detail in the first section o f the GEFCRP document and will not be repeated in this
EPP. The EPP instead provides information specific to each project on appraisal, objectives,
implementation, fiduciary arrangements, and monitoring and evaluation.         Detailed financial
management and procurement assessments covering both components are provided in Annex 1
to this Attachment.


B.      LABOR-INTENSIVEURBANPUBLICWORKS PROGRAM(US$2.5 MILLION)

3.      Objective and Rationale. This component seeks to provide additional financing to the
existing third Urban Development Project to put in place an emergency labor intensive urban
public works program to quickly help the most vulnerable people to gain access to temporary
jobs that will put money directly in the pockets o f those who get such employment. This will
help reduce the effects o f the food price crisis on the poorest consumers in the most vulnerable
areas o f Conakry where unrest i s most likely to occur. The project will use existing
implementation mechanisms o f the parent project - the Third Urban Development Project
(PDU3) - building on its past success and capacity in carrying out private-sector led
implementation o fpublic works programs.

4.      The development objectives o f PDU3 phase I1 are: (a) to improve the provision o f
infrastructure and services inConakry and secondary cities; and (b) to improve the financial and
organizational management o f municipalities in support o f the decentralization process. The
objectives remain the same for the additional financing being requested for this component o f the
emergency project.

5.      The achievement o f this objective would contribute to supporting Government's efforts
inimproving accesso fthepopulation to basic infrastructure services including accessto all-year


                                                 - 43 -

passable secondary and tertiary roads, reduced number o f households flooded every year, but in
particular an increased number o f unskilled people gaining immediate access to temporary
employment during a very fragile time in Guinea. The identification o f the specific secondary
and tertiary roads, sidewalks and drains to be rehabilitated have been based on keeping the
project focused on the very poor and vulnerable people and will be implemented in areas in all
five communes (municipalities) o f the city o f Conakry that are affected badly by flooding and
which have roads that are badly deteriorated. The project aims to rapidly implement works
(drainage, fill in potholes in secondary and tertiary urban roads and rehabilitate sidewalks) in
about 40 neighborhoods within a period o f 6-8 months. This approach permits rapid generation
o f additional employment and income for the poor.

6.       Rationalefor AdditionalFinancing. This operation scales up the existingpublic works
program under the Third Urban Development Project, utilizing a labor-intensive approach within
the existing project modalities to provide quick employment inthese programs inresponse to the
food price crisis.

7.       Current Project Performance. The Third Urban Development Project is a phase I1
APL whichwas approvedby the Board inAugust 2007 with current satisfactory implementation
ratings. The project has beenparticularly successful in improving local government capacity to
mobilize resources and target expenditures toward priority infrastructure and services,
determined in consultation with local populations in Conakry as well as in 10 secondary cities.
However, it must be noted that the city o f Conakry partially fulfilled its commitments for waste
collection and transfer and accumulated arrears o f payment over time. The first phase o f PDU3
started in 2000 using an implementation mechanism that has evolved and been fine-tuned for
over eight years. The original implementing entity has remained in place, thus providing the
project with the expertise gained from many years o f experience managing urbanworks under a
World Bank-financed program. This will provide a known methodology and start-up speed that
will allow this additional financing component to be implemented rapidly with existing
procedures and mechanisms.

8.       Technical. The program will draw on the PDU3 and other in-country expertise, while
also utilizing global best practice lessons from public works programs across Africa (including in
Benin, Central Africa Republic, Burundi and others). The labor intensiveworks are drawn from
existing PDU3 project areas using existing private sector contracting mechanisms. This use o f
existing mechanisms and capacity will allow for quick implementation, eliminating the need to
devise new methodologies or contracting arrangements. However, this means that only about
50% o f the benefits will be transferred directly to participants in the form o f wages. Although
this is not as high as mightnormally be desired inthis type o fprogram (often between 60% and
70%), it i s deemed acceptable considering the greater speed o f response it allows by using
existing PDU3 methodology. It is expected that bids can be let out quickly for all o f Conakry
andthe first contracts signed by late September /early October.

9.      Regarding site selection, a recent audit o f five Conakry communities already identified a
list o f priority secondary roads and drainage for rehabilitation using technical analysis and
participatory methods. The work areas proposed in this program have been selected in
accordance with the following criteria:



                                               - 44 -

            Roadrehabilitation to take place mostly inareas o f Conakry knownto bevulnerable
            to flooding according to recent technical analysis and demanded by communities and
            municipal governments;


        0   Areas where drainage works were previously implemented and can be consolidated
            per recommendation by affected communities.

10.    The proposed project will mostly benefit poor, disadvantaged communities in Conakry
and peri-urban neighborhoods. The project will use labor intensive methodology with execution
primarily through the types o f small and medium enterprises that carry out programs under the
existing projects. The program will finance small works projects over a 6-8 month period. The
project will provide approximately 5300 jobs, o f around 2-3 months each, to unskilledworkers
and direct and indirect benefits to a total population o f around 300,000 people in 40 o f the
poorest neighborhoods in Conakry whose neighborhoods will be targeted for the labor-intensive
works. The program will utilize self-targeting labor hiring techniques by applying a slightly
below-market wage rate in order to attract the neediest to the program and avoid
poachingldiverting individuals from other productive activities. The wage rate will be adjusted
according to the market conditions in the program areas. The targeting specifications will be
included inthe biddingdocuments and used as evaluation criteria.

11.    Implementation Arrangements. The labor intensive public works component o f the
program will be implemented through the Third Urban Development Project (PDU3), a well-
performing APL that just began its second (and final) phase.             Technical implementation
(monitoring and control o f the work) will be handled by the division in charge o f secondary
roads (Cellule de Voirie Secondaire or CVS), a division o f the Regional Directorate o f Urban
and Housing Development for the City o f Conakry. CVS i s the division responsible for PDU3
monitoring and control o f road maintenance operations. It will be responsible for all technical
aspects o f the program and will manage overall works under the supervision o f the Project
Coordination Unit o f the PDU3, and in partnership with the urban municipalities. It has more
than 10years o fexperience managinglabor intensiveurbanroads works under the supervisiono f
PDU3. CVS will recruit two consultants, for a period o f eight months each, to help manage this
component.

12.    Financial Management, Procurement and                      Disbursement Arrangements.
Arrangements will follow the one used for the UrbanDevelopment Project 3. The FMunit o f the
Project Coordinating Unit (PCU) for PDU3 is responsible for runningthe financial management
arrangements and for facilitating the audit o f the financial statements. The PCU i s headed by the
National Coordinator who is also the overall executive officer for all operations under the project
which includes authorization (ordonnateur) o f eligible expenditures under Component 2. The
FM staff is comprised o f the Finance and Administration Director, a Senior Accountant and a
couple o f Accounting Technicians who also take charge o f the administrative hnction in the
PCU. Financial records and all the transactions under the component shall be in accordance with
the guidelines in the financial procedure detailed in Operations Manual which are based on
generally accepted accounting principles. The annual financial statements prepared by the FM
unit of PDU3 are audited annually by an independent external auditor acceptable to the Bank.
The FMunit o fPDU3 will continue to prepare the Interim Un-AuditedFinancial Reports (IFRs)
as part o f the reporting arrangements. The Bank's FM team will continue its supervision and


                                                - 45 -

 provide guidance and support to the project staff and ensure that established financial procedures
 are complied with at all times duringthe life o fthe project.

 13.      Disbursements for the eligible expenditure under this component will be on the same
 framework used for disbursing PDU3 proceeds. As such disbursement will follow the traditional
 (transaction based) disbursement arrangement. Details o f the FM and Disbursement
 arrangements are provided inAnnex 2 o f this Attachment. The labor-intensive urbancivil works
 contracts will generally be below US$lOO,OOO equivalent and will be procured through
 Shopping. The first request for proposals will be subject to prior review by the Bank. All
 subsequent requests for proposals will follow this model and are subject to ex-post review. The
 procurement risk for this component is high(see Annex 3 o fthis Attachment).

 14.      Environmentaland Social: The urbanlabor intensivepublic works program component
 i s being implemented through the implementation arrangements already existing for the Phase I1
 o f the Third Urban Development Project which i s inthe safeguard screening category S2 andthe
 environmental category B. Both an ESMF and RPF were prepared. The parent project became
 effective in January 2008 and the most recent ISR o f June 2008 rated safeguard compliance as
 "satisfactory".    No additional safeguards will be triggered under the additional financing grant.

 15.      Project Development Objectives and Outcome Indicators.                       The development
 objectives o fphase I1o fthe PDU3 are: (a) to improve the provision o f infrastructure and,services
 in Conakry and secondary cities; and (b) to improve the financial and organizational
 management o f municipalities in support o f the decentralization process. The objectives remain
 the same for the additional financing being requested for this component o f the emergency
 project, in that the works will focus on physical infrastructure improvements, but with an
 overarching objective o f generating employment for the poorest and most vulnerable. Outcome
 indicators will be added to capture the expected outcome o f this component as indicated inTable
 1below.

 16.      Monitoringand EvaluationArrangements. The urban labor intensive works program
 will be folded into the existing monitoring and evaluation arrangements for PDU3 Phase 11.
 Monitoring will cover both employment as well as works undertaken (although the latter is not a
 primarydevelopment objective o fthe project.

 17.     Risks and Mitigation Measures. The targeting for the labor-intensive public works
 program may raise sociaVpolitica1 tension in untargeted areas or particular groups being left out
 intargeted areas. This risk is beingmitigatedbythe existence ofan operations manual including
 criteria for appropriate targeting o f beneficiaries and also include performance contracts to
 ensure that wages are set at appropriate levels to target the poorest.

 18.     Implementation capacity i s generally weak reflecting the low levels o f skills within the
 public sector increasing the risk o f supervision overload. The existing PCU could inadequately
 handle the additional demands under the emergency program. Also, there i s a possibility that the
 SMEs have not the capacity to provide services within the required time frame. These risks are
 being addressed by using implementation mechanisms o f PDU3 that have already been tested
 and rated satisfactory. The FMarrangements for the existing PCUs have been fully assessedand
 reinforced. External Auditors have been recruited, the manual o f procedures have been finalized
 and are operational, and competent and experienced staff is onboard. Also two engineers will be
 added to the implementing agency to manage the new component and the Bank will increase
 supervision intensity.

 19.     ImplementationPeriod. Works are expected to start in late October 2008. Preparation
 o f request for quotations (for works under US$lOO,OOO) and biddingdocuments (for works over
 US$lOO,OOO) are already underway. Works will be carried out in phases in different areas and
 expected to continue for about 7-8 months.


 C.      AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY SUPPORT PROJECT(US$5.0 MILLION)

 20.     Background:Guinea, inthe middleo fthe traditional West African "rice belt", has a long
 history o f low input traditional paddy production and a diversified set o f production
 environments, each o f which has a different mix o f issues in terms o f potential benefits to the
 intensification o f production (see Table 3 below).          Only about 5 percent o f producers use
 improved seed varieties and the use o f fertilizer i s even less. A concerted effort is needed to
 increase the productivity o f these systems.

21.      Hillside rice makes up over 60 % o f estimated paddy area. The other, "non-hillside"
production systems (numbers 2-4 in Table 3) should all be thought o f as "partially irrigated" or
"partial water control" systems, even when improved water control is not used inthat system. In
some o f these systems it may be possible over time to develop full or nearly full water control,
which can allow for paddy yields o f up to 5 or 6 tons per hectare (or more) when usingimproved
seed and substantial doses o f concentrated nitrogen-rich fertilizers such as urea (as regularly
demonstrated at the Office du Niger inMali). Thus, if all the "improvable areas" (from the 2001
Small Scale Irrigation study) were actually improved and producing, for example, an average o f
3 or 4 tons per hectare, total national rice production could be substantially increased and the
most environmentally negative and low-yielding hillside sites could be left permanently fallow
or changed to other, less erosion-prone crop uses.

22.      Objective and Rationale: This objective o f this component i s to increase rice yields by
30% on 1,000 hectares o f irrigated rice during the 2008-09 dry season (contre-saison, i.e.
November 2008      - March   2009) and 35,000 hectares or rain fed rice during the 2009-10 cropping
season (June-October 2009).          This will result in an additional 70,000 tons o f paddy rice
production - about a 10% increase in overall production increasing smallholder incomes and
                                                                 -
increasingthe availability o f locally-grown rice. To achieve this objective three sets o f activities
are envisioned:

         (i) fortheproductionof 2000tonsof improvedandcertifiedseedduringthe
            Support
         2008-09 rainy and contre-saison through a scaling up o f the existing farmer seed
        multiplication network and the purchase, treatment, and stocking o f the seed for
         distribution duringthe 2009- 10cropping season;

         (ii)Purchase o f 2000 tons o f fertilizer and20,000 liters o fherbicides andpesticides;

         (iii)Distribution o f input packets (seed, fertilizer, herbicide/pesticide) though the existing
         farmer organizationnetworks and support for advisory services necessary.


23.      Through these activities, this component aims to deliver immediate benefits while
simultaneously preparing the groundwork for a longer-term support to crucial agriculture-related
institutions

24.      Technical. The appraisal mission held extensive discussions with representatives o f the
Ministry to assess the technical and economic feasibility o f the Government's proposed Food
Security Programparticularly centering on the following issues:

         By laying out a food security strategy that covers the period 2008-2015, the proposed
         actions underthe strategy present a good balance between addressing immediate needs on
         an emergency basis and tackling the more structuralproblems o f the sector inthe medium
        run.

         Crop budgets, jointly prepared by the counterpart team and the appraisal mission team,
         indicate that technology packages proposed under the strategy need to include a
         combination o f improved seed and fertilizers as response o f traditional varieties to
         fertilizer application does not appear to be financially attractive at current fertilizer
        prices. This implies that besides fertilizer availability, domestic seed multiplication
         capacity i s a critical factor determining the feasible scope o f Government's food security
    .   program, at least inthe short run.

         Crop budgets also indicate that pay-offs from proposed technology packages are
        particularly attractive in mangrove systems, followed by "bas-fonds" and plains based
         systems and ultimately hillside rain-fed systems. This implies that efforts aimed at
        improving water management will need to constitute a critical element o f the proposed
         food security program. At the same time, given that hill-side rain-fed systems make up
         64% o f Guinea's paddy production systems, there i s a need for further analysis on how to
        boost the financial feasibility o f improvedtechnologies under these conditions.

25.    The project was designed to specifically address the Government's Food Security
Program. Four strategic choices were weighed as a part o fthis process:

       (i) versusinfrastructure: Althoughinvestmentinwatermanagementinfrastructure
           Inputs
       i s a necessity to increase rice productivity in Guinea in the medium to longer term,
       immediate investments in improved inputs and better cropping practices will have a
       substantial payoff- particularly for smallholders - inthe short run,

       (ii) versusotherfood crops: Althoughfooddiversificationisanimportantelement
            Rice
       o f a longer run food security strategy in Guinea, the focus o f this emergency intervention
       is on rice productivity given the importance o f rice in household consumption and its
       share inoverall production patterns

       (iii)Emergency implementation versus sustainable implementation mechanism: A
       decision was taken to make sure this would not be simply a `one-off emergency effort -
       to that end, the implementation arrangements and design rely on sustainable institutional
       structures and lay the foundation for more sustainable input distribution going forward.

       (iv) 2008/09 versus 2009/10 cropping season: A decision was made to focus on the
       preparation o f the 2009-10 cropping season. Given that the 2008-09 cropping season is
       already well underway inputs could not be procured and distributed to farmers intime to
       have a real impact on yields and production this cropping season given the absence o f
       organized input distribution systems. To prepare for the 2009-10 season it i s urgent that
       seed multiplication activities begin now. The purchase o f these seeds will provide an
       immediate boost to smallholder incomes inthe 2008/09 season.

       (v) Producer organizations versus individual smallholders: Approximately forty percent
       o f smallholders are members o f producer organizations. In the absence o f functioning
       private sector input distribution systems and limited access to rural finance, and in the
       presence o f weak and non-transparent public distribution channels, a decision was made
       to focus on organized smallholders as an entry point to building a sustainable and
       transparent system.

26.    Implementation Arrangements: The agricultural productivity component is a new
project but relies on the Project Coordination Unit o f the existing World Bank-fundedVillage
Communities Support Program (VCSP) for management o f all fiduciary matters The VCSP has
a strong track record in overall project and financial management for the existing project.
Overall coordination and technical responsibility for the component rests with the National
Directorate o f Agricultural Advisory Services (SNPRV) which has already managed a successful
seed multiplication system under previous World Bank and other donor financing.
Implementation will be carried out by technical services o f the Ministry o f Agriculture and the
National Confederation o f Producer Organizations which benefits from funding and technical
assistance from other donors active in the sector (AFD and EU). Specific responsibilities are
outlined in the attached action plan. Operating funds will be transferred to relevant technical
departments o f the Ministry o f Agriculture on the basis o fbudgeted work programs acceptable to



                                               - 50 -

the Bank and approved by a steering committee composed o f Ministryo f Agriculture, producer
organizations andprivate sector members.

27.      The project will focus its interventions on Guinea's three major rice producing areas -
lower Guinea, Upper Guinea and Forest Guinea. The project will work through the
Confederation Nationale des Organisations Paysannes de G u i d e (CNOP-G) and its member
federations and unions.     The CNOP-G will be responsible for the distribution o f the input
packages. Inputs will be sold to members on a "cropping-season" credit basis where the terms,
conditions, and procedures will be defined in the operations manual. Recovered funds will be
used to capitalize a revolving fund for the purchase o f inputs in future seasons. The management
and use o f this fbnd, including annual audit procedures, will also be defined in the project
operational manual.

28.      To ensure that the poorer fanners benefit from the project, inputswill only be available to
smallholders with a minimum number o f hectares. The exact methodology and criteria will be
established as part o f the project operational manual. Additionally, each beneficiary will only
have access to an input package sufficient for half hectare to ensure the largest possible number
o f farmers are covered.

29.      Financial Management, Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements: As noted
above, financial management, procurement and disbursement will be handled by the Project
Coordination Unit (PCU) o f the VCSP. This i s the second phase o f a highly successful APL
program - it was approved by the Board in July 9, 2007 and became effective on March 26,
2008. The PCU has implemented an action plan for strengthening its financial management
capacity (selection o f a new external auditor, recruitment o f a procurement assistant and an
additional accountant, installation o f updated project software and training o f all staff on the use
o f the software). It will be incharge o fpreparing the financial statements andmaintaining sound
systems and procedures acceptable to the Bank.

30.     The Director General o f the SNPRV will be the authorizer (ordonnateur) o f expenditures
o f Component 3 given his prime responsibility in executing and monitoring annual activity
programs and related budgets. He will approve related commitment documents and warrants.
Proper and accurate records will be kept for all component-related expenditures following the
generally accepted accounting principles. The annual financial statements prepared by the
financial management unit o f the VCSP shall be audited annually, in accordance with the
international standards on auditing, by an independent auditor acceptable to the Bank. The
financial management unit o f the VCSP will also prepare quarterly Interim Un-Audited Financial
Reports (IFR). The Bank's financial management team will continue to monitor the agreed risk
mitigation measures, and ensure the project i s supported by intensified supervision.
Disbursements for eligible expenditures under Component 3 shall be made under existing
disbursementarrangements for the VCSP. The FMstaffthe VCSP will be incharge o fpreparing
payments to suppliers o f CNOP-G (seeds, fertilizers etc.). CNOP-G will manage revenues from
the sales according to a procedures manual approved by the steering committee and satisfactory
to the Bank.

31.     Small civil works will be procured, mainly for rehabilitation, and suppliers for small
goods contracts selected, mainly for motor bikes and office furniture and equipment. Larger


                                               - 51 -

contacts for goods are planned for fertilizers and pesticides which will be procured through
international competitive bidding.

32.       Environmentaland Social. From an environmental and social safeguard standpoint, the
Guinea Emergency Agricultural Productivity Support Project is a Category B project. This
suggests that environmental and social impacts o f the project, for the most part, will be minimal,
site-specific and manageable to an accepted level. This emergency operation triggers two
safeguard policies: the Environmental Assessment Policy (OP 4.01) and the Pest Management
Policy (OP 4.09), based on program objectives to increase agricultural production and
productivity with the provision o f certified seeds and fertilizers to rice producers. The required
safeguards document - a combined Environment and Pest Management Plan - will be submitted
to the Bank within 90 days of signingthe legal agreement.

33.       ProjectDevelopmentObjectivesand OutcomeIndicators:The development objective
o f this component i s to increase smallholder rice productivity on 35,000 hectares. This project
will support the production o f 2000 tons o f certified seed through a smallholder seed
multiplication network and provide input packages and technical assistance to 70,000
smallholders to increase their productivity. Outcome indicators are noted in the results
framework.

35.       Risks and Mitigation Measures: The risk o frequiredinputs not available intime due to
low in-country stocks is being mitigated as the operation targets the 2009-10 cropping season
and the 2008/09 dry seasonto allow sufficient time for inputs to be produced andprocured. Also,
to mitigate the possibility o f the program not being sustainable after close o f project, efforts will
be made to ensure sustainability. Risks remain, but the food crisis situation presents window o f
opportunity to try innovative approach that could also make a difference over the longer term.

36.       There is a risk o f a lack o f transparency in the targeting o f beneficiaries but it is being
mitigated through the full participation o f the National Federation o f Producer Organizations

(CNOP-G) and its member federations and unions in the process. There is also a risk that
achievements are not sustained after close o f project. This risk i s being partially mitigated by
relying on, and building the capacity in, existing government structures and producer
organizations for implementation.

37.    There is also a risk that the PCU o f the VCSP2 will not unable to adequately handle the
additional financial management demands under the emergency program. To mitigate this risk,
anadditional accountant will be recruitedon a consulting basis for the duration o fthe emergency
project.

38.    ImplementationPeriod: The project will be implementedover a 19-monthperiod from
September 2008 to March 2010. A detailed action plan is attached below.

ANNEX 1:FINANCIALMANAGEMENTAND DISBURSEMENTARRANGEMENTS


Summaryof FinancialManagementAssessment

1.       Financial management assessments were carried out in accordance with the Financial
Management Practices Manual issued by the Financial Management Board on November 3,
2005. The objective o f the assessments was to determine whether the financial management
(FM) arrangements for phase I1o f the Third Urban Development Project (PDU3) which will
apply to Component 2, and the FM arrangements for phase I1 o f the Village Communities
Support Program (PACV2) and the National Confederation o f Farmer Organizations (CNOP-G)
for Component 3 are sufficient to ensure: (1) the funds are used only for the intendedpurposes in
an efficient and economical way; (2) the preparation o f accurate, reliable and timely periodic
financial reports; and (3) safeguard the implementing entities' assets.

2.       The FM team assessed the capacity o f the PCU o f the PDU3 and the FM unit o f the
PACV2, and established that the existing FMarrangements (validated by the recent effectiveness
declarations o f the respective projects on December 10, 2007 andMarch 26, 2008) are adequate
and appropriate for the implementation o f Component 2 and Component 3 respectively. Action
plans for strengthening FM capacity were fully implemented prior to the effectiveness o f the
second phase o f each o f these APLs. The respective heads of the FM units have previous
experience in World Bank FM procedures and the accountants supporting them also have good
experience and competence in accounting. The FMprocedures manuals and accounting software
(SUCCESS platform) are already in place. This framework provides a robust FM system that
fulfills the minimumfiduciary requirements.

3.       Given their role in implementing Component 3, the FM capacity o f the Confederation
Nationale des Organisations Paysannes de Guide (CNOP-G) was also assessed. It was noted
that the CNOP-G i s well staffed with both a senior and ajunior accountant, however the overall
FMsystem is inneed o f some improvements andupdates (e.g. purchase o f accounting software,
update o fpolicies andprocedures, and training o f accountants). These activities are being funded
with the assistant of the European Union which has a technical assistant inplace. They will be
further supported through Component 3. At the level o f its member organizations (regional
federations and unions o f producer organizations), procedures for procurement, inventory
management and delivery o f inputs, and cash recovery (from sales o f fertilizers, seeds etc.) are
not well documented. A procedures manual will be developed for component 3 within 60 days
o f effectiveness and will include a simplified manual o f procedures for the CNOP-G and its
member organizations. The CNOP-G produces annual financial statements. The FY 2006
auditor's opinion was qualified and the related shortcomings on accountingprocedures are being
addressed. Minor internal control weaknesses were also identified and these are being addressed
inthe procedures manual.

4.       The conclusion o f the assessments i s that the financial management capacity o f the
PDU3, the PACV2, and the CNOP-G meet the World Bank's minimum requirements under
OP/BP 10.02 and are therefore adequate to provide, with reasonable assurance, accurate and


                                              - 59 -

timely information on respectively the status o f Component 2 and Component 3 as required by
the Bank.

5.       As indicated above, in the longer term, the FM capacities o f CNOP-G and its regional
members will need to be strengthened by updating the accounting arrangements, providing
training, and developing a simplified procedures manual. Considering the existing FM
arrangements, the overall residual control risk is moderate for the PDU33, moderate for FM
unit of PACV2 and substantial for CNOP-G and its regional members. The PDU3 and the
PACV2 will be the budget management and accounting centers for Component 2 and
Component 3 respectively. For Component 3, the CNOP-G and its regional member
organizations will maintain satisfactory controls over the procurement and distribution o f inputs
and collection o f cash receipts. Their capacity will be strengthened with a procedure's manual
and training to carry out these functions adequately. All duties and procedures will be carried out
inaccordance with an operational manual satisfactory to the Bank and approved bythe Steering
Committee.

Strengths

6.      The FM units o f the PDU3 and the PACV2, as the main budget management and
accounting centers, are composed o f qualified and experienced staff. Both entities have FM
procedures manual and software inplace that can be relied upon to produce accurate and timely
financial reports. Their recent declaration o f effectiveness is evidence that they have
satisfactorily implemented their respective action plans. The CNOP-G i s now well staffed to
meet the fiduciary requirements. It has useful experience inmanaging donor funds (FIDA, AFD,
EU, etc.) through various bank accounts. It operates its FMactivities by usinga FMmanual and
its 2006 financial statements have been audited, resulting in a qualified opinion as a result o f
shortcomings relatedto accounting procedures, a weakness that i s presently being addressed.

ImplementingEntity/Staffing

7.      The FMarrangements for the grants for Component 2 and Component 3 would be based
on the existing framework under the on-going PDU3 and PACV2 respectively. Under the
guidance and responsibility of their respective overseeing ministries, their FM units will be
responsible for financial management and for preparing audits o f account with systems and
procedures acceptable to the Bank. The CNOP-G and its regional member organizations will
manage the (i)   procurement o f seeds, and inventory and distribution o f fertilizer and seeds and
(ii) recoveryfromthesaleofinputs.
    cost

8.      A training program will be drawn up to continue to strengthen fiduciary management
capacity. Training i s mainly conducted through the World Bank's local or sub-regional training
institutions (CESAG and ISADE inDakar).The CNOP-G and its regional members will require



                                                    - 62 -

a consultant to update their accounting system (installation and customization of software,
update o fpolicies andprocedures andrelated training).

Work programsandbudgets

10.     The budget preparationprocess and its monitoring are clearly defined and documented in
the FM manuals o f the two FM units and the CNOP-G. Each FM unit will develop Annual
Work Programs and Budgets (AWPB) and will send them to the Steering Committee and Bank
for review. For Component 3, the National Directorate for Advisory Services will consolidate
the work programs and budgets o f the technical departments involved in implementation
(including the CNOP-G) and submit the approved AWPB to the PACV2 FMunit for the transfer
o f funds.

AccountingPoliciesandProcedures

11.     Accounting standards applied by the two FM units and CNOP-G are similar to the
International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) issued by the Public Sector
Committee o f the International Federation o f Accountants (PAC-PSC). Any significant
difference will be adequately disclosed and explained in the notes o f the financial statements.
The FM units will prepare their project financial statements for auditing. A computerized
financial management system i s place at the two FM units. Both units use a satisfactory
accounting package capable of producing all the accounting and financial data required,
including financial statements, bank reconciliation statements, and all financial reports, such as
the Interim Un-Audited Financial Reports (IFRs). The books o f accounts also are maintained
electronically inthis software.

Internalauditing

12.     The Public Sector Internal Audit Bodies o f Guinea will retain the right to carry out any
internal reviews at the levels o f the FM units o f PACV2 and PDU3 and CNOP-G. They would
carry out reviews o ftransactions from time to time, based on their mandate.

Internalcontrol

13.     As stated above, the CNOP-G needs anupdated accounting systemand improvedinternal
control procedures.    This work is on-going under EU funding.        Regional organizations o f
CNOP-G involved in the distribution of inputs, management o f stocks, and cash recovery from
sales will also need to strengthen the FM procedures in place to ensure robust internal control
arrangements. These procedures will be documented inthe simplifiedprocedures manual.

FundFlows andDisbursementsarrangements

14.     The amounts and percentages to be financed through the trust fund are detailed for each
component in Table 2a and 2b below. The grant for Component 2 will be disbursed over a 13
month period (September 2008 through September 2009). The grant for Component 3 will be

Use o f statements o f exDenditures (SOEs)

15.     Disbursements for all expenditures will be made against full documentation, except for
itemsclaimed under the Statement o f Expenditures (SOE). For Component 2, SOEswill be used
for payments claimed under contracts for: (a) works in an amount inferior to US$500,000; (b)
goods in an amount inferior to US$250,000; (c) consulting firms in an amount inferior to
US$lOO,OOO; and (d) individual consultants in an amount inferior to US$50,000 as well as small
equipment, office supplies and training. For Component 3, SOEs will be used for payments
claimed under contracts for: (a) works in an amount inferior to US$250,000; (b) goods in an
amount inferior to US$250,000; (c) consulting firms in an amount inferior to US$200,000; and
(d) individual consultants in an amount inferior to US$lOO,OOO as well as small equipment,
office supplies and training. Documentation supporting all expenditures claimed against SOEs
will be retained by each FMunit and made available for review when requested by IDA during
supervision missions and by project external auditors. All disbursements are subject to the
conditions o f the Financing Agreement and the procedures defined inthe Disbursement Letter.

Designated account and FundsFlow Arrangements

16.     The PDU3 and the PACV2 will each maintain and manage a Designated Account in US
Dollars with respective equivalent in current accounts in Guinean Francs. The grant proceeds
will be deposited in these Designated Accounts. Funds will be used to make payments to


                                                      - 64 -

suppliers in the respective contract currencies. Interest income received on these accounts will
be deposited to a separate account o f the Government. The revenues received by CNOP-G and
its regional members from sale o f inputs will be deposited in a separate account. Related
procedures are documented inthe CGOP-G's manuals.

17.    The Designated Account in US dollars would be opened by each FM unit in a reliable
commercial bank on terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank. The authorized allocations
would be US$1,250,000 and US$2,000,000 respectively for Component 2 and Component 3.
The respective allocations will cover about six months o f eligible expenditures. The Designated
Accounts will be replenishedthrough the submission o f Withdrawal Applications on a monthly
basis and will include reconciled bank statements and other documents as required until such
time as the borrower may choose to convert to report-based disbursements. The Recipient may
also choose to pre-finance project expenditures and seek reimbursement from the Bank as
needed.

18.    Upon grant effectiveness, the Bank will deposit the initial advance into each o f the
Designated Accounts upon receipt o f Withdrawal Applications from the Grant recipient. The
Accounts will be used for all payments inferior to twenty percent o f the authorized amounts for
the respective Components 2 and 3, Replenishment o f the Accounts will be on a monthbymonth
basis. Designated Accounts remaining inactive for six consecutive months risk being considered
for closure and the balance o f advance therein refunded to the Bank. Further deposits by the
Bank into the Designated Accounts will be made against withdrawal applications supported by
appropriate documents.

Financial Reporting and Monitoring

19.    The FM units o f PDU3 and PACV2 will be responsible for the overall financial
management reporting o f Component 2 and 3 respectively. They will produce interim un-audited
financial reports (IFRs) on a quarterly basis, and the annual financial statements requested. The
accounting software already installed at each FM unit level will provide these financial reports.
The CFO o f each FMunit would make sure that these are produced and transmittedto the Bank
on time for review, as requested by related reporting procedures o f the existing FMmanuals. The
reporting format and procedures documented in the FM Manual are composed o f financial
reports such as (i) sources and uses o f funds by funding source and nature o f expenditures; and
(ii) offundsbycomponents/activitiesoftheproject.
    uses

20.    IFRs and annual financial statements will cover all activities financed through each
Component (2 or 3). The annual financial statements will be subject to external audit as
described below. The two FM units are required to produce, not later than June 30 o f the
following borrower fiscal year, audited annual financial statements. The World Bank staff will
provide implementation support to the FM units during desk reviews, supervision missions or
through seminars inorder to improve the quality o f IFRs (InterimUnauditedFinancial Reports).

ExternalAudit Arrangements

21.      External independent auditors hired from the private sector will be expected to audit the
financial activities o f the individual respective Components in accordance with International
Standards on Auditing or other standards that are acceptable to the Bank. Each implementing
entity (the PDU3 PCU inthe case o f Component 2 and the FMo f the PACV2 for Component 3)
will be responsible for the preparation the annual financial statements and present them to the
auditors. Audited project financial statements are expected to be submitted by the Grant
Recipient to the Bank within six months after end o f the financial year to which they relate. The
CNOP-G internal control review will be included in the overall Component 3 audit report. In
addition to the opinion on Financial Statements, the CNOP-G internal control review will put
emphasis on implementation o f procedures for inventory and delivery management and cost
recovery from sales o f inputs.

Financingconditions and legalcovenants

22.      Dated covenants: A dated covenant will be included in the Grant Agreement for the
development o f a Project Implementation Manual for Component 3. A simplified procedures
manual to strengthen the FM arrangements o f the CNOP-G and their capacity to establish and
manage a revolving fund will be included as a component o f this procedures manual. The
manualwill be submittedto the Bank for review within 60 days o f effectiveness.

23.      Leaal Covenants: The following standard financial management covenants would be
stated in the Financing Agreements: the Borrower (i)to be compliant with all the rules and
procedures required for disbursements in each Segregated Designated Account for each
Component (2 or 3); (ii)to maintain the financial management system including records,
accounts and preparation o f related financial statements inaccordance with accounting standards
(IAS or IPSAS) acceptable to the Bank and to be audited; and (iii) prepare and furnish to the
                                                                                     to

Supervisionplan

24.    Given the urgency o f the GFCRP operational response needed, Component 2 and
Component 3 will require intensive supervision arrangements o f the financial management to
ensure the FM system i s inthe whole robust and intandem with fiduciary requirement o f OPBP
10.02. Risks will be assessed and mitigated accordingly during the formal supervision which
shall be at the interval o f six month for the Components 2 and 3. The intensity o f supervision
may reduce with time if risks are considered to be modest and under control. The FM team in
Guinea will factor this demand indevelopinghevising the Country Financial Plan for Guinea for
FY09 andsubsequent years.

Conclusion

25.    The FMassessmenttogether with the suggested mitigation measures confirm that the FM
arrangements for Components 2 and 3 respectively are robust enough and comply with the
minimum requirements under OPBP 10.02. The overall FM risk is rated Moderate for

ANNEX 2: PROCUREMENTARRANGEMENTS


General

1.    Procurement for the proposed project would be carried out in accordance with the World
Bank's "Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated May 2004 and
revised October 2006; the "Guidelines: Selection and Employment o f Consultants by World
Bank Borrowers" dated May 2004 and revised October, 2006, and the provisions stipulated in
the Legal Agreement. The various items under different expenditure categories are described in
general below. For each contract to be financed by the Grant, the different procurement methods
or consultant selection methods, the need for pre-qualification, estimated costs, prior review
requirements, and time frame are agreed between the Borrower andthe Bank inthe Procurement
Plan.

2.    For the quick delivery o f results and to facilitate project implementation, rapid and
simplified procurement procedures will be used in response to the new framework for rapid
response contained in OP8.00, Rapid Response to Crises and Emergencies, o f the World Bank's
Operational Manual. When agreed to by the Bank, for goods and works this may consist o f
shopping or direct contracting; engaging the services o f qualified suppliers or contractors already
mobilized and active in the emergency area; using lists o f pre-qualified contractors with good
track record to whom periodic invitations are issued; using N C B with accelerated bid times not
below 15 days; and applying Bank provisions on the use of bid-securing declarations and the
elimination or waiving o fbidbond or bidsecurities for small contracts.

3.    For Consultants this may include single-sourcing consulting firms, where it presents a clear
advantage over competition. Firms may be selected which are already working in the area and
which have a proven track record on similar assignments or may be selected through the method
o f Consultants' Qualification (CQS).

Component2: Labor-intensivepublicworks

4.    Procurement o f Works: This component will be implemented through additional financing
to the ongoing Third Urban Development Project and will consist o f small labor-intensive civil
works for drainage, spot improvement o f urban roads, and pavement repair in five Districts o f
Conakry. The difference between this activity and the ones in the ongoing project i s the
stipulated large labor content o f the works contracts, with the aim o f providing cash payments
rapidly to low-income people o f Conakry. Contracts below an estimated value o f US$lOO,OOO
equivalent will be procured through Shopping, involving the comparison o f at least three
quotations from qualified contractors. Civil works contract o f US$lOO,OOO and above will be
procuredthrough NCB, usingbiddingdocuments satisfactory to the Bank.

5.    A list o f qualified small contractors will be prepared, from which the ones to be asked for
quotations will be selected, depending on their interest inparticipating inthe competition for the
District concerned. The request for quotations (RFQ) for Shopping will include the requirements



                                                - 68 -

for the use o f labor-intensive methods, technical specifications, and the form o f contract. The
first RFQ to be disseminated for this component will be subject to prior review by the Bank.
Subsequent RFQs will follow the same format as the first and will be subject to ex-post review.
The works contracts will contain clauses for measures against fraud and corruption, if
determined to have occurred during the selection process and or having occurred during the
execution o f the contract.

6.     Procurement o f Goods: Goods procured under this component consist o f motorbikes,
computers, and office supplies. All are estimated to cost less than US$lOO,OOO            and will be
procured through Shopping, involving the comparison o f at least three quotations from qualified
suppliers.

7.     Procurement o f Consultant Services: The works contracts will be procured - and their
implementation managed       - by the secondary roads unit (Cellule de Voirie Secondaire) with
assistance from the technical units of the city government o f Conakry. These agencies are
implementing a similar component in the ongoing Third Infrastructure Development Project.
Two additional engineers will be recruited through competition in the secondary roads unit for
this component. The external auditor who has been auditing the accounts of the Third
Infrastructure Development Project will also do the audits for the additional financing under an
addendum to hiscontract.

8.     Individual Consultants will be selected through the comparison o f at least three CVs.
Contracts with individual consultants estimated to cost US$lOO,OOO or more will be subject to
prior review by the Bank, as well as all terms o f reference regardless o f the value o f the contract.
Inexceptional cases andwith the prior approval ofthe Bank, singlesource selection maybeused
inaccordance to the provisions o fthe Consultant Guidelines.

Component3: AgriculturalProductivitySupport

9.     Procurement o f Works: Small civil works will be carried out under this component will
include the rehabilitation o f approximately 250 hectares o f water management structures in for
prefectures for dry-season seed and paddy production. Contracts estimated to cost less than
US$lOO,OOO will be procured through Shopping, involving the comparison o f at least three
quotations from qualified contractors. Contracts with an estimated value o f US$lOO,OOO
equivalent and above will be procured through NCB, using documents satisfactory to the Bank.
No works contract will exceed a value o fUS$500,000 per contract.

10. Procurement o f Goods: Goods procured under this component will mainly consist of
fertilizers, herbicides, vehicles and motorbikes, computers, and office furniture and equipment.
Contracts estimated to cost less than the equivalent o f US$150,000 will be procured through
Shopping, involving the comparison o f at least three quotations from qualified suppliers. Goods
contracts o fUS$150,000 or more will be procured through NCB, usingdocuments satisfactory to
the Bank. Goods contracts o f US$250,000 and above will be procured through ICB, using the
Bank's standard bidding documents, and will be subject to prior review. Procurement from
IAPSO may be used for vehicles and office equipment with the prior agreement o f the Bank.
Seeds will be purchased from seed multipliers who have been designated in advance by the
National Federation o f Producer Organizations, without competition.


                                              - 69 -

11. Procurement o f non-consulting services: Non-consultant services procured under the
project include a limited number o f study-tours, surveys and surveillance. They will usually be
procuredby direct contracting.

12.   Selection of Consultants: The services o f consulting firms will be sought to identify
improved mechanisms for the reliable supply o f agricultural inputs and for external audits.
Consulting firms for contracts estimated to cost less than US$lOO,OOO may be selected by using
the method o f Consultants' Qualifications. Auditors may be recruited through Least Cost
Selection. The short list o f consulting firms for services estimated to cost less than US$50,000
may consist entirely o f national consultants. All consulting contract with firms estimated to cost
US$200,000 or more are subject to prior reviewby the Bank.

13. Individual Consultants will be selected through the comparison o f at least three CVs.
Contracts with individual consultants estimated to cost US$50,000 or more will be subject to
prior review by the Bank, as well as all terms o f reference for firms and individual consultants
regardless o f the value o f the contract. In exceptional cases and with the prior approval o f the
Bank, single source selection o f firms or individual consultants may be used inaccordance to the
provisions o f the Consultant Guidelines.

14. The Project will enter into agreements with Government and/or donor supported
institutions for specific implementation support. As no competitive process would be possible,
the Project would only fund incremental costs. In addition, where capacities are weak, the
Project may enter into contractual arrangements with NGOs for certain aspects o f
implementation (beneficiary training, participatory analyses, etc.).

15.   Operating Costs: The Project will fund incremental operating costs o f the implementing
agencies. Normally, shoppingprocedures would apply.

16. The procurement procedures and SBDs to be used for each procurement method, as well as
model contracts for works and goods procured, are presented in the Project Implementation
Manual.

Assessment of ProcurementCapacity

17. Procurement Reforms: InJuly 1996 the Government o f Guinea launched a reform program
to improve the transparency and efficiency o f Guinea's public procurement. The first phase o f
reforms resulted in (i)   the enactment o f a revised Government Procurement Code; (ii)the
publication o f documents (including regulations, implementation decrees; standard bidding
documents, and general conditions), and (iii)the introduction o f a computerized tracking
procurement system. Following the 2002 Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR) the
Bankapproved an IDFGrant to support phase 2 o fthe reforms, aiming at (i) corruption;
                                                                               fighting
(ii)strengthening transparency andcompetition, andincreasingquality andefficiency. Itwill
specifically help improve the efficiency, quality and transparency o f Guinea's procurement
system and strengthen Guinea's national, and institutional, procurement management capacity.




                                               - 70 -

Activities under Phase 2 have been implemented slowly and are expected to be completed by the
end of2008.

18    Component 2: Labor-intensive public works.            The institutional arrangements for
   I

procurement will be the same as for the ongoing Third Infrastructure Development Project. The
procurement performance o f this project has been satisfactory. Due to the nature o f the small
labor-intensive contracts - and their dual objective o f infrastructure rehabilitation and
employment generation - the procurement risk for this component is high. Collusion could take
place among the selected contractors during the selection; major delays may occur in the
selection o f contractors and the implementation o f contracts; and payments may not reach the
intended beneficiary workers at the planned rate and in a timely manner. The agreed mitigating
measures are: (i)   periodic meetings with the contractors to sensitize them about their expected
performance and sanctions in case o f infringements, and to assist them in contract
implementation; and (ii)an impact evaluation will be carried out by the City Government o f
Conakry near the end o f the project to determine the technical and financial results o f this
component.

19. Component 3: Anricultural productivitv support.          The institutional arrangements for
procurement will be the same as for the ongoing Village Communities Support Program - the
second phase of a 12-year APL program.. The procurementperformance o f this project has been
satisfactory.

ProcurementPlan

20.   The Borrower, at appraisal, developed procurement plans for project implementation which
provide the basis for the procurement methods. These plans were agreed between the Borrower
and the Project Team on August 20 and 21, 2008 and are available in the project's database and
in the Bank's external website. The Procurement Plan will be updated in agreement with the
Project Teams as requiredto reflect the actual project implementationneeds.

Frequencyof ProcurementSupervision

21.   Inadditiontothepriorreview supervision tobecarriedout fromBankoffices, the capacity
assessment o f the Implementing Agency has recommended two supervision missions per year to
carry out post review o fprocurement actions.
