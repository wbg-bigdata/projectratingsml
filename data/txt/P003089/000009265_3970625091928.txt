MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE INTERNATIONAL
DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO
THE REPUBLIC OF ZAIRE FOR A
HIGHER EDUCATION RATIONALIZATION PROJECT
1.        The following report on a proposed development credit to the Republic of
Zaire for SDR 8.5 million (US$11.0 million equivalent) is submitted for approval.
The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms and would assist in financing a
project which, within the framework of the Government's structural and seetoral
adjustment programs, would help improve the cost-effectiveness of higher education
resources while improving management and quality of education.
2.        Background.  Two ministries have responsibility for development of the
education system - one for primary/secondary and the other for higher and university
education. Development at each level has been seriously hampered in recent years.
Constraints include: (a) over 32 p.a. population growth, with burgeoning social
demand; (b) severe financial limitations; (c) lack of sector strategy; (d) weak
management; and (e) deteriorating educational quality and physical facilities.
Enrollment growth has far surpassed the absorptive capacity of the system causing
quality deterioration and widening inequities among regions and establishments.
Moreover, due to its economic circumstances, Zaire's public financing allocation to
education has declined in real terms to be amongst the lowest in Africa. This
critical situation has been compounded by lack of a comprehensive strategy for
education, and poor management with little exploitation of basic statistics and
inefficient use of scarce resources. Recognizing this critical state of affairs, the
Government introduced a two-phase reform program.  Phase I is supported by Credit
1519-0-ZR ($9.0 million FY85) for strategy development, planning, management and
quality improvement for primary/secondary education.
3.        Second-phase measures are designed to meet the following problems specific
to higher and university education: (a) rapid enrollment growth, from about 28,000 in
1981 to 41,000 in 1986, with inadequate absorptive capacity; (b) public financing
limitations, as higher education already accounts for over 40% of the education
budget; (c) poor management and inefficient use of resources; (d) deteriorating
educational quality and physical resources; (e) costly external inefficiency, with
unemployment of some graduates alongside shortages of trained specialists; and (f)
institutional and regional disparities. To help training at this level respond
better to national manpower requirements, a UNDP-financed Study of Human Resources
Development in Zaire is underway with the Bank as executing agency. This study,
which is expected to be ready about June 1988, would provide a basis for preparation
under the project of a strategy for development of higher education. Following
organizational reform in 1981, greater authority was given to three Executive Boards
(Conseil d'AdministratiDn) for the Universities, Higher Technical Institutes (HTI)
and Higher Pedagogical Institutes (HPI) respectively. This institutional framework
would facilitate reform of the sub-sector and the fact that teaching personnel have a
status separate from the civil service is also favorable. In addition, the
Government has already taken initial rationalization measures through reduced
expenditure on student support in 1986/87.
4.        Project Objectives.  The main objective is the formulation and adoption of
a long-term higher education strategy geared to the training needs of the economy.
In addition, and while awaiting adoption of this strategy, the project would support
independently justified, high priority measures. These measures are justified by the
urgent need to halt very serious decline in management so that existing scarce
resources are used more efficiently, and in educational quality so that minimum
acceptable teaching/learning standards are at least maintained. Firstly, they would
emphasize building up a statistical base on personnel, students, financing and
auxiliary services, and training management in their application for more
cost-effective operations. Secondly, they would emphasize upgrading/training of key
teachers in some disciplines considered sub-standard, development of a basic research
capacity in higher education (a sine qua non for any worthwhile system) and provision
of some basic library and scientific teaching materials considered a prerequisite to



avoid more sprious deterioration. It is also expected that through these measures,
an improvement in internal effeciency would be made.
5.        Project Description.  To meet these objectives, the project would comprise:
(a) improving adminhstration/manageuent; (b) upgrading teaching/learning; (c)
strategy development; and (d) priority teaching materlais. bpecalLst services
required would be about 7 staff/years of foreign experts supported by about 67
staff/years of local expertise, mainl; for analysis and training related to elements
(a), (b) and (c) for which local research assistants would also be recruited. Local
experts would be available among the higher education establishments and local
consultant agencies. About 226 staff/years of training would be provided in Zaire
and 46 staff/years abroad. This is mostly in-service training as improved management
and education quality in the immediate future must derive from upgrading existing
managers and teachers; however, it is expected that improved pre-service training in
management and other relevant disciplines will emerge from reformed programs to be
introduced. The project would benefit the whole higher education sub-sector,
including the three Universities of Kinshasa, Lubumbashi and Kisangani together with
the 32 Technical and Pedagogical Institutes and the Higher Education Ministry through
strengthened statistics and analysis for improved management, financial procedures
and strategy development, in addition to training of key administrators and
teachers. Specific support would be given to improve efficiency of the Intendance
CGnOrale (the service responsible for physical facilities and logistics for higher
education), to establish research capacity at the universities and to provide badly
needed library replenishment and teaching materials at the universities and 10
selected institutes.
6.        Regarding administration/management, the project would provide: (i)
analysis for more efficient utilization of administrative and teaching staff,
improved logistics and maintenance, and updating and training in statistics; (ii)
management training for key administrators in budgeting, personnel management and
academic administration; and (iii) analysis for improved financing procedures,
leading to proposals for complementary financing (especially from the private sector)
and cost-recovery through increased fees, evening courses and student loans. Under
teaching/learning, it would provide: (i) upgrading/training of 128 selected HTI and
HPI teachers in French and science subjects and 450 secondary teachers in French and
mathematics, as well as excellence scholarships for meritorious needy students; (ii)
development of university research, documentation and publications through training
40 selected research graduates; strengthening the Zaire University Press; basic
replenishment of selected libraries, and training librarians; (iii) improved teaching
in medicine, agriculture, nutrition and in the HPIs, and introduction of pilot
post-graduate courses in accounting and management; and (iv) analysis for improved
internal efficiency. Strategy development proposals far the medium- and long-terms
(including location planning for higher education establishments) would be prepared
on the basis of the analyses undertaken, and geared to evaluated training needs for
economic and social development. Concerning priority teaching materials, the project
would replenish seriously run-down stocks in about .13 establishments, emphasizing
basic science materials. Efficient project administration would be ensu;red through
a small Project Coordination Unit (PcU) detached from the Planning Ditectorate of the
higher education ministry for the duration of the project. This PCU staffed by a
Director, Coordinator and Accountant, is necessary to implement the wide range of
activities, which involve many independent institutes. A Management Committee will
overview project implementalon and a Studies Steering Comnittee would monitor quality
of analyses undertaken in the project.
7.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  Following Bank assistance to improve
primary/secondary education (Credit 1519-0-ZR), the proposed project would bring the
higher education sub-sector within the adjustment framework supported by the Bank,
which emphasizes improved management and expenditure rationalization. Programs of
public outlays for higher education would be coordinated with the public expenditure
programming system being introduced by the Government as part of its structural



-3-
adjustment program; related technical assistance would be provided to the Department
of Plan under an IDA project being prepared at present. Finally, the project
responds to a specific Government request to assist it in improving the higher
education system to train leaders for overall national development, to service the
education sector itself, and to undertake relevant scientific research.
B.        Agreed Actions.  (a) A three-year public expenditure program covering the
total education sector would be agreed by December 31, 1988 as well as procedures for
the annual rollover of the program and adequate amounts annually budgeted accordingly
for higher education would be made promptly and regularly available to cover
expenditures. (b) Proposals for a long-term higher education strategy would be
fivaalized for review and comment by the Association by July 31, 1990 and a strategy
adopted by the Government not later than October 31, 1990; enrollments in higher
education would not exceed specified limits agreed between the Government and IDA
until this strategy has been agreed and adopted. (c) Government will continue its
policy of not subsidizing higher education students for their lodging, food and
transport, and submit for IDA review a program for cost-sharing improvements by June
30, 1988, for application starting in academic year 1988/89, and annual progress
reports thereon by July 31 of 1989 and following years. (d) Government will send to
IDA by agreed dates: (i) results of studies on staffing inventory and utilization of
administrative and teaching personnel, and on student flow and graduate employment,
followed by annual reports showing imprcvements made in each case; (iU) yearly work
program and report of previous year's activities; and (iii) recruitment program for
experts and fellowship trainees. The issue of low civil service remuneration which
is a factor explaining poor performance in all sectors is being analyzed in the Human
Resources Development Study (paragraph 3) and forms part of the Government's
adjustment program. The results of this analysis relative to higher education
personnel would be taken into account in preparing the development strategy for the
sub-sector.
9.        Justification.  In developing a long-term strategy tor higher education,
the project would address key institutional, managerial and policy constraints
hindering efficient development of higher education. It would also improve
efficiency in the sub-sector resulting in better use of human, physical and financial
resources, as well as improve educational quality with graduate output more
responsive to Zaire's socio-economic needs.
10.       Risks.  The risks involve uncertainty concerning the Government's sustained
commitment to make the institutional and policy modifications required, weak
execution capabilities of the agencies involved, possible continued pressure for
rapid enrollment increase and poor student conditions, which can complicate
adjustment. The issue of low civil service remuneration may also continue to cause
low morale, if not treated. To offset these risks, Government assurances have been
given (see above), and both central and institutional authorities have been closely
involved in project preparation and policy dialogue. A program for project execution
has been agreed (Technical Annex, Schedule 1). A Management Committee and Studies
Steering Committee have also been established in the PCU to improve implementation
and monitor quality. In addition, initial reform measures already taken, such as
public expenditure containment for student support, give a reasonable expectation
that the Government will sustain the reform effort. IDA would contribute 90% of
project costs, to minimize the risk of delays for lack of counterpart funds.
11.       Recommendations.  I am satisfied that the proposed Credit would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed Credit.

REPUBLIC OF ZAIRE
Higher Education Rationalization Project
TECHNICAL ANNEX
SECTION A: DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The Project
1.        The project is designed to meet critical weaknesses in higher education
linked to poor overall management, academic shortcomings, lack of a comprehensive,
coherent strategy and some serious shortages of teaching materials. It would
comprise four main components as follows, discussed in detail below: (a) improving
adminiseration/management - US$1.9 million (16%); (b) upgrading teaching/learning -
US$7.0 million (57Z); (c) strategy development - US$0.4 million (3%X; and (d)
priority teaching materials - US$2.1 million (17%). Operating costs for project
administration (US$0.8 million (7%)) would also be covered.
Institutional Framework
2.        The higher education sub-sector consists of the three Universities of
Kinshasa, Lubumbashi and Kisangani (1986 enrollments, 7,000, 6,000 and 3,000), 18
Higher Technical Institutes - HTI (14,000) and 14 Higher Pedagogical Institutes - HPI
(11,000). Following organizational reform in 1981, authority was decentralized to
the establishments with increased responsibility defined also for three Consells
d'Administration, or Executive Boards (for the Universities, UTI and HPl), for the
Department of Higher and University Education and other concerned ministries. This
was meant to encourage self-financing and meet problems of administrative
inefficiencies and bureaucratic delays associated with overcentralization following
establishment of UNAZA (National University of Zaire) in 1971 which combined the
three universlties to be administered under one Rectorate. 1/ Each establishment
has an Academic Council and Management Council responsible for academic and
administrative affairs, respectively. The present organizational structure is
considered appropriate but administrative operations remain inefficient due to
delayed and cumbersome decision-making, lack of application of regulations and some
overlapping among various ministries concerned - Higher and University Education,
Finance, Plan, Public Service.
Rationale and Issues Addressed
3.        Key problems would be addressed by the project within the existing
institutional framework. These problems are compounded by rapid enrollment growth
beyond the absorptive capacity of the system and severe financial limitations
emerging not only from the country's economic circumstances but also because of above
aferage (over 40%) allocation of the education budget to higher education.
Accordingly, proposals for a long-term strategy would first take account of these
factors through closely gearing development of higher education to manpover training
needs of the economy. To meet financing constraints, emphasis would be placed on
t=tionalization of the system, more efficient use of human and physical resources and
1/  Universite Lovanium (Catholic), Universite  officielle de Lubumbashi (Government)
and Universite de Kisangani (Protestant) established in 1954, 1955 and 1963,
respectively.

development of complementary financing and cost-recovery and containing enrollment
growth to training needs. This would include location planning of establishments
based on well-defined criteria, deployment of administrative and teaching personnel
in accordance with efficiency-related norms and raising non-public funds through u-
participation in financing.
4.        While awaiting programmed devei-.pment based upon the long-term strategy,
some urgent problems independently justitied would be addressed by this project.
Interim measures would accordingly be undertaken to address weaknesses in educatio X
administration/management and in educational quality as their postponement would
render redress more difficult still. Administration weaknesses concern especially
costly overstaffing and inequalities among administrative and teaching personnel,
lack of adequate and relevant management information and statistics, inadequate
logistical services and poor maintenance as well as shortcomings in modern training
for key personnel responsible for management and maintenance functions linked to the
above. Accordingly, results of studies started early in the project on staffing
inventory and to establish efficient staffing norms for administration and teaching
personnel, would be used for staff redeployment and annual reports would be provided
for IDA review and comment showing improvement made.
5.        Teaching/learning weaknesses which the project would address include
especially, poorly trained teachers in French, mathematics and pure science in
secondary schools and the higher institutes, as well as in medicine and agriculture
in the universities, heavy internal/external wastage among students, almost
non-existent research capacity in higher education together with lack of adequate
library stocks and publication possibilities related thereto, and severe shortages
basic scienri teaching materials. A large proportion of in-service training would
undertaken as improved management and education quality in the immediate future must
derive from upgrading suitably qualified existing managers and teachers; in the
medium-term, it is expected that improved pre-service training in management and
other relevant disciplines would emerge from new or reformed programs to be
introduced.
6.        Financial limitations also adversely affect educational quality and while
more comprehensive means of raising non-public funds are being studied, a program
cost-recovery improvements, including increasing in real terms the 'minerval' fee
paid by students from the present Z 1,000 p.a. (about $10 equivalent), would be
introduced from academic year 1988/89 (Schedule 4 of the Draft Credit Agreement).
Cost-recovery has two aspects: (i) subsidies for welfare services; and (ii)
cost-sharing of teaching services. Subsidies for students' lodging, food and
transport have been discontinued from academic year 1986/87.  These welfare
expenditures represented up to 15 percent of the higher education current budget
before discontinuation.  Maintaining this policy in spite of students'
dissatisfaction is therefore an important step. The 'minerval' fee paid by students
was doubled ir nominal terms between 1981-82 (Z 500) and 1983-84 (Z 1,000). If fu"
collected, the minerval proceeds would represent 4.9 percent of student costs. An
acceptable target would be to increase the minerval up to the point where it would
cover current no2-salary expenditures, i.e. 19 percent of the current budget. A r,
increase from Z 1,000 to Z 3,000 in constant prices would permit an intermediate
coverage of about 15 percent by 1989-90.

7.        At project completion, a strategy for rational development of higher
education Into the start of the next century should be in place as part of the
overall structural adjustment program emphasizing improved management and
rationalization of expenditures in the sub-sector. Future development would be
geared accordingly to the training needs of the economy as evaluated in the ongoing
Human Resources Development Study. The public investment program for the sector
would be based upon the location map for higher education establishments, prepared as
part of the development strategy. Three-year public expenditure programs updated in
an annual rollover approach, would be based upon efficient staffing ratios and staff
deployment introduced under this project (Sections 3.03 and Schedule 4 of the Draft
Credit Agreement). Additionally at project completion, institutional weaknesses in
management and quality as outlined in paras. 4 and 5 above should have been
corrected. Thus, an up-to-date management information system and more efficient
physical facilities maintenance should be in place and the required training
undertaken for their application. From upgrading/training of almost 600 secondary
and higher institute staff, improved quality in teaching of French, mathematics and
science should emerge together with institutionalization of this re-training
process. Finally, a basic Zairian research capacity should have been established at
the universities where a corps of trained national researchers would have the
required publications capacity, and basic library stocks would have been provided.
Details of Project Components
8.        This is mainly a technical assistance and training project for
rationalization of higher education. Specialist services required would be about 7
staff/years for 27 short-term foreign experts supported by about 67 staff/years for
about 150 local experts, mainly for analyses and training related to elements I, II
and III below, for which local research assistants (79 staff/years) would also be
recruited.  Terms of reference for all experts and for studies to be undertaken have
been prepared and discussed with the Government. Fellowship training would comprise
about 226 staff/years for training of some 1,450 Zairians at home and 46 staff/years
to train about 100 Zairians abroad and the training program (Schedule 2) has also
been prepared and discussed with the Government. Support is provided for priority
teaching materials for 13 establishments. For project administration, about three
and one-half staff-years of expert services for a Zairian Project Director and three
staff-years each of services for a specialist Project Coordinator and Accountant are
included. The project would be implemented over a four-year period. With support
under a PPF, the Project Director recruited in advance of effectiveness would
expedite project start-up, through elaboration of first-year work and training
programs and establishment of administrative procedures for recruitment of experts
and trainees, and early appointment of Management and Steering Committees (Schedule
1). During the first year, key studies for the higher education development strategy
and the training program would be started. The strategy studies would be completed
about the end of the second year when the training program would also be well
advanced. In the final year, strategy proposals would be presented to and adopted by
the Government and the training program would be completed. The project would
establish the basis for preparation of a broad multi-donor effort in education.
9.        Project details are given below for the four elements included.

III. STRATEGY DEVELOPMENT FOR HIGHER EDUCATION
From the results of the study on Human Resources Development in Zaire
(expected in June 1988) and other relevant training/employment studies undertaken,
evaluation of long-term training requirements in higher education would be
elaborated. In addition, an analysis of admissions to the higher education system
would be made, criteria for location planning would be set and a national location
map for higher educational establishments would be prepared. This would require two
short-term specialists in economics and planning of higher education (total 9
staff-months) assisted by three qualified counterparts (total 48 staff-months) and
survey assistants (total 138 staff-months). The Studies Steering Committee would
lead the preparation of a synthesis of all the studies undertaken under the project

the higher education system would be elaborated. These proposals would be discussed
nationally in a major seminar, including top level Zairian authorities concerned aad
Zairian and foreign specialists.
IV. PRIORITY TEACHING MATERIALS
The project would provide badly needed basic science teaching materials f
13 establishments throughout the country (see map). These establishments comprise
the Universities of Kinshasa, Lubumbashi and Kisangani, the National Pedagogical
Institute, the Higher Technical Pedagogical Institute and the Interdisciplinary
Development Center (CIDEP) in Kinshasa, the Higher Pedagogical Institute and the

SECTION B: PROJECT ADMINISTRATION AND IMPLEMENTATION
Crganization
10.       Because of the coordination necessary for the above wide range of
activities, which concern a number of establishments of independent nature throughout
the country, a Project Coordination Unit (PCU) would be temporarily detached from the
Planning Directorate of the Ministry of Higher and University Education (DHUE) for
the duration of the project to ensure efficient project implementation. This would
beaa small unit comprising a suitably qualified Zairian Project Director assisted by
an expert Project Coordinator suitably qualified and experienced in project
tmplementation, a project Accountant and support staff. To expedite decision-making,
tne PCU would have maximum autonomy under the authority of the Secretary General of
the DiUE.  Assistance for procurement of teaching materials included in the project
.&uld be provided through contracting a specialist agency. A Management Committee
--d Studies Steering Committee would be appointed, all PCU staff would be in post,
--d a Special Account and Project Fund would be opened as a condition of
:-fectiveness (Section 5.01 of the draft Development Credit Agreement).
iractions
11.       The PCU would ensure coordination of all project activities in association
-Jth other concerned Departments and agencies, and liaison with the Association on
--' matters involving execution. Its main functions would include: (a) preparation
?nd implementation of its annual budget and work/training programs and ex-post
evaluation of previous year's activities; (b) selection and recruitment of
experts/agencies financed under the project and selection, recruitment and placement
of fellowship trainees and organization of training seminars on the basis of
nominations from the Administrative Councils; (c) puz:hase and installation of
equipment and materials required for project implmentation; and (d) maintaining
independent and satisfactory project accounts and stock control and their adequate
preparation for required annual audit (Section 4.01 of the draft Development Credit
Agreement).
12.       The Management Committee would meet quarterly, chaired by the DHUE
Secretary General (or delegate), to review and approve the annual budget, work and
training programs, evaluation and audit reports and advise on any implementation
difficulties. It would have a representative from the Presidency, Departments of
Finance, Plan and the Public Service, and the Administrative Councils of the
Universities, the Higher Technical Institutes and the Higher Pedagogical Institutes.
The Studies Steering Committee would comprise three Zairian higher education
specialists (one of whom would be chairman) and three renowned foreign higher
education specialists - in economics and management of education, sciences and
-pedagogy. It would meet twice yearly to monitor/advise on the quality, coherence and
relevance of all analytical work undertaken in the project. During preparation of
the final synthesis of all studies undertaken and strategy proposals for the medium-
d long-term development of higher education, its guidance would be particularly
portant.

Special Account and Project Fund
13.       To offset difficulties in project lmplementation caused by required
disbursement for numerous, small, separate expenditures and scarcity of foreign
exchange, an IDA Special Account and a revolving Project Fund would be established
the Bank of Zaire to be operated by the PCU. At Government request, IDA would
withdraw from the Credit and make an initial deposit in the Special Account of
US$500,000 to be used for IDA-financed items. Thereafter and upon Government
request, IDA would replenish this account with amounts equal to payments made
therefrom for eligible expenditures. These requests would be supported by
documentary evidence or SOEs, whichever is applicable, of payments made from the
account of goods and services. The Project Fund would be opened prior to Credit
effectiveness with an initial deposit of US$20,000 equivalent to be used for
Government-financed items. At the start of each following calendar quarter, furti
deposits equivalent to at least US$45,000 would be made by the Government (Section
3.01 of the draft Development Credit Agreement).
Procurement
14.       Equipment and vehicles (13 percent of total) would be procured under
international competitive bidding; library books would be procured by the most
economic means following selection of texts and negotiation with the publishers
regarding copyright. The Government would provide satisfactory information to IDS
availability of suitable accommodation to house all these items, appropriate
specifications provided in bid documents for library books and on satisfactory
arrangements for their safe-keeping and annual stock control of all these items, as
prerequisite for contract approval. Goods which cannot be grouped into bidding
packages of a value of at least US$100,000 equivalent and miscellaneous items of a
value of less than US$10,000 equivalent after grouping may be procured through
competitive bidding and shopping respectively, as described in paras. 3.3 and 3.4 ui.
the "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" published by the
Bank in May 1985. Consultants for the project shall be selected in accordance with
principles and procedures satisfactory to IDA on the basis of the "Guidelines for "
Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing AgeLn.,
published by the Bank in August 1981.
