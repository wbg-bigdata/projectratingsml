THIRD BOMBAY WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
LOAN. CREDIT AND PROJECT SUNMARY
Borrower:        India, acting by its President.
Beneficiaries:   Government of Maharashtra (GOM) and Bombay Municipal
Corporation (BMC).
Amount:          Bank Loan:  US$40.0 million
IDA Credit: SDR 105.5 million (US$145.0 million equivalent)
Terms:           Bank Loan:  Repayment over 20 years including five years'
grace, at applicable rate of interest.
IDA Credit: Standard
Relendint        From Government of India (GOI) to GOM as part of central
Terms:         assistance to states for development projects, on terms and
conditions applicable at the time, for relending to BMC at
8.75Z rate of interest, with repayment over 25 years,
including 5 years grace.
Proiect          The project would:  (a) provide an increment of 455 million
Description:   liters of water per day to help reduce Bombay's current
deficit; (b) expand Bombay s sewerage system; tc) provide
site specific sanitation and water supply facilities to
serve the needs of the urban poor; and (d) further strengthen
the operational efficiency of BHC's Water Supply and
Sewerage Department (WSSD) in areas including revenue
collection, financial planning and audit controls, and water
vaste and leakage reduction. The project would have the
following main impact: water shortage would be reduced from
present 36% to 18% of demand, and with particular benefit
to the poor, who are less able to afford privately-owned
facilities; investment and operational designs and improve-
ments in leakage detection, repair, and financial management
capacity. In addition, BMCIWSSD, as a well-run public
utility under full municipal control, would provide sector
leadership in the Region through the demonstration of
increasingly efficient financial management and operation
to other conurbations. Project risks are considered low
because this would be the third Bank operation in the water
supply and sewerage sector in Bombay and would be executed
by BMC, which is staffed with well-qualified and experienced
personnel. However, the project provides for additional
professional and training support to enable BMC to further
refine and strengthen its project management capability.

THIRD BOMBAY WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. THE WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE SECTOR IN INDIA
Sector Organization and Development
1.01    While the Central Government formulates policy guidelines and
provides technicaL assistance State Governments in India have primary
responsibility for development of water supply and sewerage facilities. They
execute their responsibilities through various departments of government and
agencies which, in turn, may delegate part or all of their duties to local
authorities. In certain cases, legislation has been enacted to permit
municipal authorities or other agencies to assume the entire responsibility
for planning, design, construction, operation and maintenance of water supply
and sewerage services within their jurisdiction.
1.02    Since the early 1950's, State Governments have endeavored to meet
the increasing sector demands caused by rapidly expanding populations
and unprecedented rates of urban growth. However, competing demands for
resources by other sectors, inadequate management and planning skills,
shortages of key materials and equipment, as well as foreign exchange
constraints, have resulted in only 1Z to 3% of public expenditure being
invested in the sector, prior to 1975. This situation continued during the
Fifth Plan (1974-78) and the two subsequent annual Plans (1978-80), leading
to inadequate levels of water supply and sewerage service. Investment for
urban water supply and sewerage during the Fifth Plan averaged Rs 1100
million per year, or about 1.52 of the total Plan investment; the
corresponding figure for the rural areas was Rs 750 million, or about 1.0% of
the total Plan investment.
National Population Service Levels
1.03    Although these investment levels did result in improvements in the
sector, they were still inadequate to achieve substantial progress in overall
service levels in view of the rapidly increasing population. Thus in 1980,
it was estimated 1/ that in India about 287 million people, 42% of the total
population, had access to reasonably safe drinking water and that only 43

-2-
million (6% of the population) were covered by sanitation services. These
figures were among the lowest levels for all develcping countries.
Governments' Sectoral Policy
1.04    The Government of India (GOI) recognized the importance of raising
these service levels and adopted the concepts of the International Drinking
Water Supply and Sanitation Decade. The following targets were established
to be achieved in India by 1990:
-   Urban and rural water supply:  100% coverage
-   Urban waste disposal:  80Z coverage
-   Rural sanitation:  25% coverage
These are ambitious targets and imply providing water supply to about
410 million people and sanitation services to around 210 million people
during the 1980's. In 1985 prices, this program of invesuLnent may possibly
cost US$17 billion (Rs 22,300 crores) and the cost of operating and
maintaining these assets is estimated around Rs 5,000 crores oer year. In
response to these targets, GOI has greatly increased the amount of funds
available to the sector. Thus in the Sixth Plan (1980-85), 4Z of the total
Plan provision has been allocated to the sector. Under this Plan, the rural
sector receives an average of Rs 4,300 million per year, about 2.2Z of the
Plan. The urban water supply and sanitation sector will receive an average
of Rs 3,500 million per year, or about 1.8% of the Plan. These figures
represent approximately four times the investments made in the individual
sectors under the previous Plan, and reflect the importance which COI
attaches to the Decade program. The increased emphasis on the rural sector
is particularly evident. The Seventh Plan (1986-1991) allocation to the
sector is Rs 6,522 crores and higher than that of the Sixth Plan.
1.05    While these investment levels do represent substantial increases, it
must be recognized that the Decade goals (as stated above) are unlikely to
be reached fully by 1990.  Studies 1! have shown that there will still be a
substantial shortfall in funds and that lack of sufficient qualified manpower
also will be a constraint. The existing institutional problems also are
likely to limit the rate of growth which can be achieved in the sector.
Equally important in sustaining the achievement of the targeted service
levels is the efficient operation and maintenance of the systems. This
aspect has always presented a serious challenge to the responsible
authorities, and institutional strengthening and intensive training of
personnel at all levels in the sector will be needed to achieve the required
standards.

1.06    The magnitude of the Indian water supply and excreta disposal problem
emphasizes the importance of minimizing the cost of developing, operating and
maintaining these facilities. Progress is being made by GOI in collaboration
with UNDP and the World Bank in int;:ducing less costly facilities and the
development of low cost technologies for drilling. and pumping ground-water.
However, the most significant reductions in cost are likely to derive from
improved operation and maintenance of facilities, and the greater control of
leakage from the water distribution systems which could reduce the investment
required for new production facilities by Rs 5,000 - 7,000 crores, or about
25Z.
Performance in Previous Bank Operations
1.07    The Bank Group's involvement in the water supply and sewerage sector
in India began in 1974 with a US$55 million Credit for the First Bombay Water
Supply and Sewerage Project. Since then, the Bank has made available nine
Credits totalling US$643 million for water supply and sewerage projects and
provided a further US$200 million for water supply and sewerage as part of a
broader program of infrastructure development in urban areas. Three projects
have been completed: the First Bombay Water Supply and Sewerage Project, for
which the Project Performance Audit Report has been issued, financed water
transmission, distribution and treatment facilities and expansion of the
sewerage system in the Creater Bombay area; a US$40 million Credit for Uttar
Pradesh which supported the construction of water supply and sewerage
facilities for five large towns and provided safe piped water to a number of
smaller towns and villages; and a US$48 million credit for the Haharashtra
Water Supply and Sewerage Project providing expanded water and sewerage
services to large municipalities and a number of smaller communities
throughout the State. On-going projects cover water supply and sewerage for
the city of Bombay, and the states of Punjab, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu
and Kerala. Rural water supply schemes were also included in the two Haryana
Irrigation Projects.
1.08    The physical works financed by the Bank Group have been implemented
satisfactorily, aLthough moderate delays in implementation have been
encountered in most projects. Efforts to reduce costs through the judicious
selection of service standards and the use of lower-cost technical options
have been increasingly successful. Several programs to develop, test and
promote low-cost sanitation technologies have been undertaken by state
governments and by the World Bank/UNDP Technology Advisory Group financed
first under UNDP CLO/78/006, and then continued under UNDP CLO/INT/81/047.
The major concern on the physical side has been the unsatisfactory standards
in the operation and maintenance of completed facilities, which is directly
linked to institutional and financial issues.
1.09    Past projects have not been fully successful in achieving
institutional, financial or economic goals. The Bank shares the GOI's
concern over this, and is collaborating with GOI through the Central Ministry
of Urban Development and the relevant State Governments in a review of past
performance. This review has revealed that many of the initiatives agreed
under past projects have not been fully or successfully implemented. These
failures have contributed to inadequate cost recovery, and thus
under-financing of operations and maintenance. The difficulties appear to



-4-
have resulted from several interrelated problems. First, the initiatives
themselves were ambitious. Second, the reforms and the detailed operating
procedures needed to implement them have not been thoroughly developed or
adequately presented. Third, realistic schedules needed for implementing new
procedures have not been planned or coordinated with the training and
technical assistance needed to facilitate the changes.
1.10    Furthermore, strong public opposition to tariff increases and
metering of consumption has arisen from the traditional concept held by
consumers that water and sewer services are a "public good" which should be
provided free of charge, while Government has argued for subsidies for the
poor. Nonetheless, there is a growing recognition amcng policy makers that
in order to extend water and sanitation services to the majority of the
population, a large porcion of the needed funds must be generated through
direct user charges.
1.11    Given the preceeing issues, the Bombay Water Supply System is one of
the better managed operations in India. Major objectives under the First
Project were achieved and the Water Supply and Sewerage Department (WSSD),
operating under the Bombay Municipal Corporation (BMC), has performed well in
meeting its financial obligations, and is currently providing more than half
of its investment needs (in addition to covering its operating costs) from
internal cash generation. The WSSD has developed plans to overcome service
deficits, has been following up on training, and is generally striving to
maintain its performance goals. However, WSSD is trying to catch up with a
backlog of work under its investment program. WSSD's difficulties in
implementing projects on schedule stem largely from its outmoded procurement
procedures, which are being modified and improved along lines recommended by
IDA. Under the ongoing Second Project, WSSD is also developing a project
monitoring system (PMS) to provide management information on a contract-by-
contract basis for physical works progress, and for capital and reimbursable
expenditures. A costing system for the existing Bhandup complex (Bombay's
major water supply) also is being developed to provide essential operational
costing data. Both systems are being designed to improve the project
implemeutation and operational management performance of WSSD, and will
become increasingly useful management tools for WSSD as the Bombay water
supply system expands both in size and complexity.
Bank's Sector Objectives
1.12    The Bank Group's goals in the sector are:  to support the central
and -state go-.ernments' overall objective of extending water and sanitation
services to a majority of the population and to assist in improving the
efficiency of sector operations and distribution of services. In pursuit of
these goals, Bank projects have: (a) supporred institutional development
and the formation of semi-autonomous water supply and sewerage authorities;
(b) encouraged the financial viability and managerial efficiency of sector
institutions through the adoption of commercial style accounting systems and
controls; (c) assisted in the formulation of tariff policies to promote
equitable access to, and conservation of water, and to help finance
operations; and (d) fostered th. reevaluation of design standards and the
adoption of lower cost technologies.



_-5_
1.13    The growing acceptance by the GOI of the fundamental objectives
incorporated in the Bank's sector program suggests that there is a
substantial potential to achieve improved sector performance over the medium
to long term. Persistent supervision of ongoing projects and strengthened
sector policy work will be required to achieve this performance. But it must
be recognized that the attitudinal and institutional adjustments underway in
the sector will take time, and that project objectives need to be formulated
accordingly. Follow-up projects and the extension of projects to other
States will be needed to maintain continuity and consistency in the sector
policy dialogue and to pursue the issues now being identified in more detail.
At the same time, more active participation by central government agencies as
policy intermediaries for dissemination of sector policies and experiences to
the different State Governments is envisaged for the future.
II. THE SECTOR IN BOMBAY
General
2.01    Continuous population increases and dynamic economic growth in Bombay
has created a demand for water supply and sewerage service that is still not
satisfied. The gap between supply and demand will widen unless the
facilities are expanded as proposed under this project which serves the area
within Bombay Municipal Corporation's jurisdiction (BMC). The BMC is part of
the Bombay Metropolitan Region (BMR), which is a legal planning jurisdiction,
in the State of Maharashtra. As the third largest state in India,
Maharashtra has an area of 306,000 Km2 and an estimated population of around
60 million. Bombay is the capital city of Maharashtra State and the Largest
city in India. It has the largest port and industrial center in the country,
and accounts for about 30Z of India's industrial production. The original
Bombay city limits were extended in 1951 and 1958 to include areas designated
as 'Suburbs' and 'Extended Suburbs' creating what is referred to as Greater
Bombay or Bombay City, which is administered by BMC and now extends to some
440 KW. Today, Greater Bombay has a population of about 9.3 million, as
compared to a BMR population of about 11.6 million.
Sectoral Priorities in the Bombay Metropolitan Region
2.02    Sustained development in Bombay is paralleled by equal emphasis being
placed on balanced growth in the secondary towns in the State of Maharashtra;
a major statewide water supply project is currently under preparation for
which Bank assistance may be sought.  The Seventh Plan (1986-91) anticipates
that for the BMR some 34% of total public investment will be in the transport
sector, 25% in shelter, and 24% in water supply and sanitation. Hence, these
three sectors are the focus of priority in the BMR, comprising 83% of
budgeted plan outlays. With the recent launching of the IDA-financed Bombay
Urban Development Project, and the proposed Bank financing of this Third
Water Supply and Sewerage Project, the mix of BMC investments in the shelter
and water supply sector will be consistent with these BMR sectoral priorities
(para 5.02).

Institutional and Financial Background
2.03    The Bombay Municipal Corporation is responsible for the provision of
many local services including water supply, sewerage and sewage disposal
within Bombay. BMC has been able to maintain considerable autonomy in the
provision of services but the GOM, on the other hand, is able to introduce
legislation to control BMC activities should this be necessary.
2.04    During the preparation of the First Water Supply and Sewerage
Project, a separate Water Supply and Sewerage Department (WSSD) of BMC was
established in the interests of efficiency and to improve the provision of
water supply and sewerage services throughout the Bombay metropoLitan area.
The organization and operation of the USSD is more fully described in
paragraphs 4.01 through 4.03.
2.05    Since it became a separate accounting entity in BMC, the WSSD has
established separate funds and accounts, and has been preparing financial
statements using commercial accounting principles. The financial performance
of the WSSD since 1975 has been very good. Over the past five years it has
realized operating surpluses sufficient to finance about 50X of its capital
investments; it has maintained strong liquidity positions; and it has rates
of return in excess of its average cost of borrowing. The financial position
and performance of WSSD is more fully covered in paragraphs 5.04 through
5.14.
Populaticn
2.06    The 1981 census, which was undertaken by district wards, provided a
fresh base for population projections in addition to the data available from
previous studies. Projections through 2001 were developed by Tata Consulting
Engineers during the preparation of the Feasibility Report for this
project. 1/ The 1981 population of Greater Bombay of 8.23 million was used
as a data base and projected tiirough year 2001 using predicted growth factors
by wards. Since the 1951 census the overall population in Bombay has
increased at an average rate of around 3.4% per annum. However, when taken
on a ward by ward basis there are marked variations in growth rates between
city and suburban wards. In the city wards the percentage growth rate
appears to be reducing whereas the suburban figures indicate an increasing
trend in recent years compared with the 1970's. This terdency is consistent
with the apparent migration of popuLation to the suburbs from the more
densely populated city wards and the conversion of tenements from residential
to commercial use. It is considered that suburban population will continue
to grow in the medium term despite Government of Maharashtra (GOM)
restrictions on the development of new industries. Population figures of
10.75 and 12.78 million are forecast for years 1991 and 2001 respectively
representing annual growth rates of 2.7% for the period 1981-1991 and 1.7%
for 1991-2001. The corresponding growth rates for the BMR are substantially
higher, at about 5%.

Water Demand
2.07    It can be seen from the population projections that an increase of
some 2.5 million people in Bombay is anticipated during the decade through
1991 when the proposed project would be commissioned. The main increase in
population is expected in the low income groups occupying tenement and slum
accommodation with relatively low water demands, since lack of storage and
continued intermittent supply hours will minimize any increase in per capita
demand. Domestic demand has been assessed on the basis of sample surveys in
1977 and 1984 for various housing categories, resulting in the following
average per capita demand figures for the housing categories surveyed.

2.08    Based on the above survey the overall average domestic per capita
demand is estimated around 180 lcd in 1991 rising to about 190 lcd in year
2001, after allowing for modest per capita demand increases (about 1% per
year) in domestic consumption for all categories of consumers on account of
continuing improvement in living standards. The industrial and commercial
demand represents about 28% of the net water demand; this demand is based on
historical data and is increasing at about 2% per annum.

Composition of Water Demand and Availability
2.09    The present and projected patterns of water demand and availability
are summarized in Tables 2.2 and 2.3 and shown graphically in Annex 2.

2.10    From Table 2.2, it can be seen that the anticipated water demand is
expected to increase by 2.6X per annum through 1991 and thereafter at 22
annually and that without the Third Project the water deficit would increase
to around 31% in 1991. After commissioning this project, the deficit would
reduce to about 18% of the total demand; Table 2.3 indicates that per capita
domestic water availability would increase to 137 lcd. This, however, would
still represent a deficit of about 24% of the average domestic demand
estimated at 180 lcd, at that time; this could only be reduced by curtailing
the demands of commerce and industry on which Bombay's prosperity is largely
founded.

Water Supply Sources
2.11    Bombay has relied traditionally on obtaining its water supplies from
upland surface sources, commencing with the development of Vihar lake which
was brought into use in 1860, followed by the commissioning of Tulsi
reservoir in 1879. Later, towards the end of the 19th century as the water
demand of the city increased, BMC developed the Tansa reservoir thus ensuring
adequate supplies until around 1944. At that time BMC sanctioned the
commencement of work on the Vaitarna scheme and the lower Vaitarna reservoir
was commissioned in 1957. Following an unusually dry year in 1966 BMC
obtained approval from GOM to construct an intake on the river Ulhas; this
was commissioned in i967 and yields 91 mld. The Upper Vaitarna reservoir was
completed around 1972, raising the total water availability for BMC to around
1565 mld (344 mgd) (see Map IBRD 18974).



-10-
2.12    In order to safeguard future supplies, BHC instituted an
investigation in 1964 to determine future sources of supply. The appointed
committee recommended the development of the Bhatsai scheme to provide a
conjunctive use source for potable and irrigation water supply. This scheme
is designed to supply, ultimately, 1,365 mld (300 mgd) of potable water to
BMC (in three tranches) and a further 455 mld (100 mgd) for irrigation use.
Construction of this impounding reservoir is being carried out in three
stages; the first stage was completed in 1979 when the first tranche of
455 mld (100 mgd) was released to BMC. This provided the source water for
the First Bombay Water Supply and Sewerage Project (Credit 390-IN). Dam
construction is now sufficiently advanced to enable the second tranche of
455 mld (100 mgd) to be released to BMC as soon as the works on-going under
the Second Project are complete (estimated 1986187). The appraisal mission
obtained confirmation that the Bhatsai Dam would be completed on schedule by
1989 to provide the third and final tranche of 455 mld (100 mgd), on which
this project is based. Nevertheless, assurances were obtained at
negotiations that this increment of supply from the Bhatsai Dam would be
available for the project. Thus the gross potable water availability for BMC
at that time will be around 2,930 mld (645 mgd) compared with an estimated
gross demand at that time of about 3,568 mld (785 mgd).
Future Water Source Development
2.13    The Central Design Organization (CDO) of the GOM Irrigation
Department has previously carried out Master Plan Resource studies to meet
the anticipated water demand of the Bombay Metropolitan Region (BMR) through
2001. The Bombay Metropolitan Region Development Authority under the GOM's
Department of Urban Development is responsible for physical planning and
investment programming in the BMR and overall regulation of land use. The
Water Resources Management Board of BMRDA has elected to develop the
following basins:
Seventh Five Year Plan (1985-1989):
- Middle Vaitarna Project (potable use by BMC)
- Kalu Project (potable use by BMC and irrigation use)
Eighth Five Year Plan (1990-1995):
- Gargia Scheme (potable and irrigation use)
Detailed investigations have been undertaken by CDO for the Middle Vaitarna
and Kalu schemes; the Gargia scheme investigation has not yet commenced.
These alternatives were further studied at feasibility level within the
Bombay Water Supply and Sewerage Project (Bombay III) study undertaken for
BMC by Tata Consulting Engineers in 1983. This study compared Middle
Vaitarna, Kalu and Cargia developments. It concluded that, based on capital,
operation and maintenance costs, as well as land acquisition, population
relocation and other social considerations, the Middle Vaitarna Project would
provide the least cost development for the next water source for BMC. The
estimated net yield from this source would be around 390 mld (after taking
into account a reduction in yield of the existing Lower Vaitarna reservoir
resulting from overall Vaitarna basin development). This scheme would



-1l-
complete the logical developmen, of the Vaitarna basin (Upper and Lower
Vaitarna reservoirs are already in use by BMC). The Vaitarna scheme is
planned to be operational by 1994 and could be commissioned progressively, as
the dam is raised, since the existing conveyance and Bhandup treatment
facilities could be used initially to deal with the additional supply. In
1994 the water demand of BNC is estimated around 3700 mld (see Annex 2); the
Middle Vaitarna scheme would increase water availability to about 3320 mld
thus further reducing the shortfall at that time to about 10%. In the event
that population and water demand continue to increase as predicted then the
development of the Kalu scheme (with an estimated yield to BMC of around 500
mld) would be needed before year 2000 in order to meet the suppressed water
demand and prevent any unacceptable deterioration in water service levels.
Sewerage, Waste Water Disposal and Sanitation
2.14    The sewerage facilities in Bombay date from about 1865; the original
Worli outfall was completed in 1880 when sewage from within the city was
conveyed to Lovegrove and thence to the sea through the Worli outfall.
The present system was established in 1905 and subsequently the sewerage
conveyance system was extended to newly developing areas and treatment
facilities were provided at Bangaga, Dharavi and Dadar. In an effort to
provide a service for the rapidly growing population, extensive relief
measures were sanctioned in 1948 but these measures which were rapidly
overtaken by industrial and commercial development and population growth,
did little to improve the situation. The need for system improvements was
further increased by two extensions of BMC's boundaries in 1951 and 1958.
2.15    Subsequently, various studies were undertaken during the period
through 1979 when a Sewerage Master Plan was developed 1/ to provide a basis
for the treatment and disposal of Bombay's wastewater through yea: 2005.  The
recommendations of this report provide the basis for the implementation
started under the First Bombay Water Supply and Sewerage Project
(Credit 390-IN) and continued iG the on-going Second Bombay Water Supply and
Sewerage Project (Credit 842-IN).
2.16    The First Project originally included about 130 km of conveyance
sewers, the construction of seven pump stations, rehabilitation of nine
existing pump stations and improvements to existing sewage treatment works.
Due to budget constraints this component of the project was re-defined and
reduced to about 50 km of conveyance mains, rehabilitation of one existing
pump station and construction of eight new pump stations providing sewage
collection and conveyance over about 50% of BMC area. The treatment and
disposal facilities, however, remained inadequate.

-12-
2.17    The Second Bombay Water Supply and Sewerage Project set out to
rectify this situation by the inclusion of conveyance, treatment and disposal
facilities in the five drainage areas of Colaba, Malabar and Worli, Chembur,
Harve and Mahim. This system is designed for year 2005 flows and the
conveyance network will extend coverage to over 902 of the properties in the
BMC area. The sewerage component in the Second Project when completed in
1987 will provide the following service facilities:
Colaba Area - Discharge of effluent into Bombay harbor through a 1.2 km long
outfall pipe after preliminary treatment by screening and grit removal
(42 mild).
Malabar and Worli Zones - Disposal of effluent from these areas to the
Arabian Sea through a 3 km ocean outfall after screening, grit removal and
chlorination at Lovegrove Treatment Plant (800 mld).
Chembur Zone - Disposal to Thane Creek after preliminary treatment consisting
of screening and grit removal. (Aerated Lagoons proposed for biological
treatment at this site have been deferred for subsequent implementation after
1990 when operating experience has been obtained from similar fulL scale
trial lagoon facilities under construction at Versova site) (582 mld).
:arve Zone - Disposal to Malad Creek after preliminary treatment by screening
and grit removal. As stated above, the Versova experience will be used to
determine appropriate design/construction parameters for biological treatment
facilities proposed at Chembur and Malad sites (411 mld).
Mahim Zone - Disposal to the Arabian Sea through a 3 km ocean outfall after
screening, grit removal and chlorination at Bandra Treatment Plant (800 mld).
On completion of the facilities in 1987, about 65% of the waste flow will be
discharged to the sea and the balance flow to tidal creeks after screening.
2.18    A sanitation component has been undertaken in the on-going Second
Project by BMC, in parallel with the sewerage facilities described above, to
provide improved sanitation to urban fringe areas not covered by the sewerage
facilities. This component, undertaken by the Slum Improvement Cell of BMC
included public latrine facilities, surface drainage and provisions for the
disposal of domestic sullage water. This program is being further expanded
in the Bombay Urban Developr.ent Project which is providing land
infrastructure services and slum upgrading benefitting around one million
persons classified as urban poor.
2.19    Further water service improvements and sanitation facilities which
will directly benefit slum dwellers would be provided under the proposed
project.

III. THE PROJECT
Project Objectives
3.01    This project is part of a continuing program to improve further BMC's
project implementation and operational performance; and to expand the water
supply and sewerage facilities for the city of Bombay, to keep pace with
increasing demand from population growth and expansion of industrial and
commercial activities. The objectives of the Third Bombay Water Supply and
Sewerage Project would be to:
(a) Continue and expand on the efforts of previous projects in improving
sector efficiency through improvements in project management,
procurement, billing and collections, and leak detection and repair
in the WSSD;
(b) Expand water supply and sanitation facilities for the urban poor by
(i) providing the water delivery capability in support of the Bombay
Urban Development Project, which will be benefitting some 1 million
persons classified as urban poor; (ii) providing suction tanks
and pumping arrangements for slum colonies on high ground;
(iii) providing tubewells and extensions of mains to other slum
areas; and (iv) providing improved sanitation facilities in fringe
areas of the city;
(c) Increase the supply of water to the Bh5 area by 455 mld to a total
of 2930 mld, compared to an anticipated demand of some 3568 mld in
1991. After allowing for commercial, industrial and other uses and
losses, this would increase the average per capita availability to
137 lcd for the 10.75 million population projected for 1991;
(d) Expand the sewerage conveyance facilities in isolated developed areas
of the city which are not already served; and
(e) Evaluate operating experience and develop appropriate design criteria
and technical options for future investments in sewage treatment in
Bombay and other parts of India.
Rationale for Bank Support
3.02    The rationale for continued Bank support to the BMC/WSSD investment
program rests on the contribution that the Bank can make to the achievement
of key sector objectives, particularly in the areas of improved operational
performance and project implementation capability. Bank involvement during
project preparation has helped give more emphasis to the following specific
project objectives:
(a) improved detection and repair of leaks and waste reduction through
the introduction of new technologies (e.g., noise correlation
equipment);



-14-
(b) improved water revenue collection efficiency through improved
customer records and associated management reporting;
(c) strengthened project planning and control, using network based
management systems for more timely and lower cost implementation
of project components;
(d) improved procurement performance through prequalification of
contractors and suppliers for all major contracts;
(e) follow-up and assessment of the operational performance of
alternative sewage disposal systems (lagoons and sea-outfalls) with a
view to establishing appropriate design parameters for use in future
investments in Bombay and elsewhere in the region; and
(f) expansion of sector training programs focusing on operations and
maintenance and construction management.
3.03    Bank participation in the project preparation process has also
ensured that aLl major engineering components were analyzed for cost
effectiveness and designed in sufficient detail. Appraisal was delayed for
about one year partly on this account. A major quantifiable saving which was
achieved during this year, through an expanded search for lower-cost
engineering designs, was in the tunneling component of the project where
estimated costs were reduced by about US$8 million, or 15Z of the cost of the
component as originally designed. However, to ensure construction of the
3000 m transmission system at least cost, certain contracts, currently
scheduled for surface construction, may include an alternative for tunnelling
for the purpose of obtaining realistic cost comparisons, including the cost
of land acquisition and human settlement relocation.
3.04    BMC/WSSD also has the potential for providing sector leadership in
the region by demonstrating effective approaches to financial and operations
management. Over the longer term, the Bank will increasingly assist in
disseminating the lessons Learned by the emerging competent cadre of BMC/WSSD
staff.
3.05    It is noteworthy that the WSSD is in fact a department under the BMC
and therefore under full local (municipal) government control. As such, WSSD
is the most promising local government water supply undertaking in South Asia
and provides an interesting counter-point to the prevailing trend in the
region of removing the water supply function from local government control.

Project Description

83 trucks, four wheel drive vehicles, buses and other vehicles for
project implementation and operations.
Cost Estimates
3.07    Cost estimates (base costs in December 1985 prices) for the project
are sumrarized on page 19 in Table 3.1. Cost details and the proposed Bank
Group financing share are detailed in Annex 4 on a concract by contract
basis.
3.08    The overall project cost is estimated at US$304.3 million including
US$20.6 million equivalent in customs duties and taxes. The cost estimates
are considered to be reasonable and are based on WSSD's and its consultants'
estimates (adjusted to December 1985 base) prepared after the completion of
the detailed design and tender documents for the major project components.
The base costs reflect WSSD's experience of the on-going Second Bombay Water
Supply and Sewerage Project and other similar externally financed recent
projects in India. In view of the extensive preparations already undertaken
by WSSD and its consultant, and since detailed engineering of major
components has already been completed, the allowances included for physical
contingencies have been minimized; 10Z has been added for civil works with
the exception of the distribut.Lon tunnels and Panjrapur Treatment plant where
a figure of 15% has been adopted in view of the greater degree of uncertainty
of these major components. A 10% physical contingency has also been included
for the supply of materials and equipment resulting in an overall weighted



-17-
average of 10.4Z on the base cost. To provide for inflation through the
expected dates of project completion, the following price escalation rates
have been used; for local expenditures, 72 for 1985/86, 7.5Z from 1986/87
through 1989/90 and 52 thereafter, and for foreign expenditures 7.5Z in
1986187, 8Z from 1]87188 through 1989/90 and 5% for 1990/91 and onwards.
3.09    The project implementation period of 7-1/2 years is based on Bank
experience in implementing similar projects in the sector. However, WSSD
is aiming to implement the project in 6-1/2 years and this would reduce the
overall project cost by about US$21.4 million. The effect of earlier
completion would enable WSSD to optimize its financial objectives (para
5.17).
Project Financing
3.10    Annex 16 presents the project financing plan fcr FY86 through FY95.
A Bank Loan of US$40 million and an IDA Credit of US$145 million is proposed
for the project. This would provide for about 65% of total project costs,
net of taxes and duties. The Loan and Credit would be made to the Government
of India, who would make the proceeds available to the Gonernment of
Maharashtra in accordance with GOI's standard arrangements for developmental
assistance to the States of India. Assurances were obtained at negotiations
that the COM will lend funds to the WSSD for not less than 60% of annual
capital expenditures, with WSSD covering 40% of annual capital expenditure
from operating revenues. These funds would be lent to the WSSD from GOM for
a 25-year term, including a five-year grace period on principal repayment, at
an interest rate of not less than 8.75%.
Status of Project Preparation
3.11    As already mentioned (para 3.08), USSD and its appointed consultants
have already completed satisfactory designs and draft tender documents for
the major water supply components of the project. All major contracts have
been identified and the site investigation for the two distribution tunnels
totalling 9 km in length (E Moses Road to Malabar and Futka to Sewree) has
been completed. The contracts are listed in Annex 4.
3.12    Prequalification of firms for major contracts including Panjrapur
Treatment Plant, pumping plant, tunnelling and pipelaying contracts has been
completed.
Land Acquisition
3.13    It is not anticipated that land acquisition will present major
problems on this project since most of land required has been obtained by BMC
during the on-going Second Project. For exemple pipeline easements for the
trunk transmission system have already been acquired and the formation
preparation works have been carried out. BMC already has commenced
negotiations for the purchase of several small parcels of land required for
reservoirs at Malabar and Raoli and extensions at Panjrapur Treatment Plant
site. BNC brought to negotiations satisfactory evidence confirming that
outstanding land purchase arrangements had been completed.

Technical Assistance
3.14    Financial and Management.  Financial and management technical
assistance for this project will cover four important areas: project
management; computerized billing and collections; the strengthening of
financial audit procedures; and computerized modeling of WSSD financial
operations. The project management assistance is described in para 4.04;
the improvement to computerized bilLing and collection is described in para
5.09; and the strengthening of audit procedures is described in para 5.22.
3.15    The WSSD used the services of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) in
modeling WSSD finances during the preparation of this project.  As part of
this project, TCS will assist the WSSD in refining the model and assisting
with its continued operational use in the WSSD. The model would be
structured for use on a microcomputer within the office of the Additional
Chief Accountant.
3.16    Engineering.  The project also includes technical ass.Stance to BMC
to support: (a) improved leak detection technology; (b) a review of the
operational performance of the aerated lagoons at Versova; and (c) an
economic analysis of re-cycling wash water at potable water treatment plants.
3.17    Leak Detection Technology.  The assistance in connection with
improved leak detection technology would complement the BMC staff training
(both in country and overseas) and provide exposure to the latest
technological developments in this very important aspect of water supply
operational management with a view to reducing the system losses and
unaccounted for water. Over the past few years WSSD has made a substantial
effort to minimize water losses and has been routinely carrying out a leak
detection and waste control program. The entire distribution system is
divided into 540 sub-zones each of 250-300 connections. Each sub-zone is
monitored on a 3-year cycle, leaks are located, repaired and systematically
recorded. Owing to network valving arrangements in parts of the old system
in the city and the continued need to provide a supply on an intermittent
basis, it is difficult to apply waste metering techniques and determine
losses on a quantitative basis but in some suburbs with modern network
systems, losses of 15-20% have been reported following waste metering
analyses. Transmission system losses are particularly low (typically less
than 1Z) and leaks are easily identified and quickly repaired since these
mains are laid mostly above ground and are of welded construction.
3.18    Following the introduction of noise correlators and other recent
technological developments it is anticipated that the overall distribution
system water loss may be progressively reduced from the present estimate of
around 22% to about 20% in 1991 and to 18% by year 2001.
3.19    Operational Performance of Aerated Lagoons.  As mentioned previously
(para 2.17), full scale trial aerated lagoons comprising two parallel
treatment systems are under construction at Versova site to provide
biological treatment of sewage from the Versova drainage basin prior to
discharge into Malad Creek. It is expected that these facilities will be
commissioned in 1987. Technical assistance will be provided within the
proposed project to assist WSSD in evaluating the operating performance and



-20-
appropriateness of these treatment systems in order to determine criteria for
subsequent investment in this sector in Bombay (to complete the facilities at
Bhandup, Chembur and Malad which were deferred from the on-going project) and
to provide guidelines for use elsewhere in India.
3.20    Re-cycling Wastewater at Potable Water Treatment Plants.  On
commissioning of the water supply component in this project, WSSD will
increase the supply of fully treated water to around 2930 mld (compared with
a demand of about 3570 mld at that time); major facilities at Bhandup and
Panjrapur will provide treatment for about 95% of this total. Washwater used
during the treatment process at that time could account for as much as 150
mld. It is therefore proposed to provide technical assistance to enable WSSD
to carry out an economic analysis of the possible benefits to be obtained
from re-cycling filter washwater and clarification discharges. In view of
the continued unsatisfied water demand in Bombay this could possibly reduce
the deficit to around 141 from the 18% shortfall estimated in 1991 and impact
on future resource developments in the sector.
3.21    About 120 man months of local consultant services and about 5 man
months of expatriate consulting services will be provided to WSSD under the
categories outlined above together with micro-computer support facilities.
Further details are given in Amnex 20.
Procurement
3.22    All major equipment supply and civil works would be awarded on the
basis of international competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with Bank
Group guidelines, with the exception of contracts referred in para 3.25
beLow. In evaluating the bids for equipment and materiaLs, local
mannufacturers participating in international bidding would be given a
preferential margin equal to 15% of the c.i.f. costs of rho competing
imports, or the existing rate of customs duty, whichever is lower. A
preferential margin of 7 1/2% would be allowed for local contractors in
evaluating civil works bids. It is likely that the majority of contracts for
equipment and materials supply and all contracts for civil works (with the
exception of Panjrapur Treatment Plant turnkey contract and cement mortar
lining contracts) would be won by local contractors.
3.23    The value of civil works and materials and equipment contracts to be
awarded under ICB procedures is estimated, -.-spectively, at the equivalent of
US$131 million and US$54 million, totalling US$185 million. Procurement
arrangements are summarized in Table 3.2.

3.24    The Panjrapur Treatment Plant contract would be bid as a turnkey
contract against a performance specification combining the evaluation of the
supply of equipment with the civil works to determine the least cost; for
this purpose operating costs would be capitalized to compare alternative
offers. BMC and its consultant are completely familiar with water treatment
plant bidding and evaluation procedures having previously bid similar
contracts against performance specifications when equipment and civil works
contracts were evaluated separately.
3.25    Civil works contracts with an aggregate value of US$56.4 million
equivalent would be awarded on the basis of local competitive bidding (LCB)
procedures acceptable to the Bank, since these are all relatively small
contracts which could not be combined into larger coatracts and which world
not attract international bidders. These contracts would be for laying
distribution mains, supplying and laying sewers, construction of small sewage
pump stations, staff quarters, and provision of improved water service and
sanitation facilities for the urban poor. The LCB procedures are
satisfactory, and are described in para 3.29. Minor contracts for electrical
and lifting equipment and pumping plant not exceeding US$200,000,
individually, and aggregating to not more than US$1.0 million, which are
readily available locally, and the fabrication of steel pipes with a high
labor content where international contractors are not competitive with Indian



-22-
bidders would also be awarded under LCB procedures. The total estimated
value of these contracts is about US$7.4 million equivalent.
3.26    Prior review by the Bank of invitations to bid and of proposed awards
and final contracts would be required for (a) all ICB contracts, (b) alL
civil works LCB contracts over US$500,000 and (c) all material and equipment
supply LCB contracts over US$200,000. Thus more than 902 of the total
estimated contract vaLue would be subject to Bank review. Nevertheless every
effort will be made to group contracts, in the interests of efficiency and to
reduce the total number.
3.27    BMC have already appointed consultants, 1/ who are acceptable to the
Bank, to assist WSSD with project preparations. These same consultants were
engaged to assist in the implementation of the ongoing project and their
performance has been satisfactory. Retroactive financing from March 1, 1985,
not exceeding US$250,000 is recommended for project related expenditures for
consulting services for (a) the preparation of detailed designs,
(b) preparation of tender documents and (c) evaluation of prequalification
of contractors for water supply components of the project.
3.28    Prequalification of Contractors and Suppliers.  In order to avoid
delays caused by post qualification of bidders which has occurred on the
on-going Second Bombay Project, all major contracts will be bid among
experienced prequalified contractors. Draft prequalification documents have
already been reviewed by the Bank. Prequalification for the following major
contracts has been completed; Pise Pumping Plant, Panjrapur Treatment Plant,
Transmission pipeline Majwade-MGL/EEH junction, Futka-Sewree and E Moses
Road-Ruparel College distribution tunnels, Panjrapur Pump Station civil works
and pumping plant. These contracts amount to Rs 144 crore, or about 402 of
estimated project cost.
3.29    Local Procurement Procedures.  The local procurement procedures (LCB)
adopted by WSSB have been reviewed and found satisfactory; foreign bidders
will not be precluded from bidding under these procedures. The findings are
summarized as follows:
(a) Tender documents are based on the same general conditions of contract
as used in ICB contracts;
(b) Contractors are registered on the basis of their past performance,
solvency and ability to deliver in the category and scale of work
for which they applied for registration;
(c) Tenders are invited by public advertisement;
If Tata Consulting Engineers, Bombay, India in association with Binnie and
Partners, London, United Kingdom.



-23-
(d) For civil works, WSSD issues priced tenders and invites contractors
to offer plus or minus percentages on scheduled rates. In such cases
the scheduled rates are updated annually. Documents prepared by
consultants (generally for larger contracts) are issued with unpriced
Bills of Quantities;
(e) Selected tenders are sometimes invited for urgent or specialized
works;
(f) Tender validity is usually 120 days and bids must be accompanied by
a tender guarantee;
(g) Tenders are opened publicly by a representative of the Additional
Chief Accountant; bids are scrutinized by the concerned department
and evaluation reports are presented for award recommuendation
decisions by the tender committee;
(h) No price negotiations are allowed or take place after the bids are
received. Typically the time required from advertisement to award
decision is about 6 months with a further 2-4 months for the signing
of a contract; and
(i) WSSD has now adopted prequalification procedures for the supply of
equipment and civil works under LCB procedures. In such cases,
priced bids are called only from selected bidders after scrutinizing
and reconciliation of the firms' technical proposals. A period of
two months is usually allowed for this type of invitation.
Implementation Schedule
3.30    Schedules for the design, procurement and construction of the project
are shown in Annex 5. Two schedules are presented; one based on a 7-1/2 year
implementation program which corresponds to the Bankwide 8 year sector
disbursement profile, on which project costs and financing have been
predicated, and the second based on a 6-1/2 year accelerated implementation
program assuming that the project is executed more efficiently and with fewer
delays thaa in the past. These programs take into account that WSSD and its
consultant have already prepared detailed designs and draft tender documents
for the major water supply components of the project, and are proceeding to
complete the prequalification of contractors for major contracts prior to
Negotiations.
3.31    Some tenders could be invited before Credit/Loan effectiveness, and
the initial contract for the purchase of steel plates for the fabrication of
transmission pipeline materials could be placed in early 1987. Completion of
the entire project is expected by December 31, 1993 based on the extended
implementation period, but one year earlier if this accelerated program is
achieved.

Disbursements
3.32    The proposed Bank Group funds of US$185 million would be disbursed
in 8 years. An estimated disbursement schedule is shown in Annex 7. The
amount of disbursement by category is shown in Table 3.3.
Table 3.3: DISBURSEMENT BY CATEGORY

3.33    No disbursements would be made against administrative costs, taxes
and duties in India, or against contributions to projects financed under any
other IDA Credit. Disbursements would be fully documented, except for those
on small civil works contracts under US$500,000, and equipment and material
contracts under US$200,000, for which disbursements would be made against
certified statemcnts of expenditures (SOE). Supporting documentation for
items disbursed against statements of expenditure would be retained by WSSD
and made available to IDA staff for review on request. Such expenditures
would be audited annually by BMC municipal chief auditor.
3.34    The estimated disbursement pattern shown in Annex 7 is consistent
with the standard Bankwide disbursement profile for the sector. Steps have
been taken to prevent delays in project execution by (a) the use of
retroactive financing for critical preparatory activities; (b) consultants
acceptable to the Bank are already appointed and are working on final designs
and tender documents, and (c) prequalification of contractors for major
contracts. The ability of WSSD to execute major water supply components,
which comprise the major part of this project, is well established; this is
confirmed by the performance on the on-going project for this activity when
compared with the sewerage components. Some of the proposed work forms part



-25-
of a series of repeater contracts (e.g. major pump and transmission main-
laying contracts) and accelerated disbursement within the estimated profile
shown in Annex 7 should be possible.
Operational Action Plan
3.35    There are a number of interrelated project activities to be
undertaken by WSSD with a common aim to improve its operating efficiency and
financial viability. These are discussed elsewhere in this Report and,
because of their importance, have been grouped into an Action Plan. The
components of this Plan were discussed during project appraisal and the
timing of their implementation reviewed and agreed during negotiations.
Progress on this Plan would also be reported in iSSD's normal quarterly
reports and annually reviewed and updated in a manner satisfactory to the
Bank Group. Assurances to this effect were obtained at negotiations. The
Plan contains the following elements:

assurances were obtained at negotiations that such information would be
reported to the Bank for review within six months of the end of each quarter.
WSSD would continue to report to the Bank for about five years after project
completion, and would be responsible for preparation of the project
completion report.
IV. PROJECT ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
Water Supply and Sewerage Department
4.01    BMC, the beneficiary, established under the Bombay Municipal
Corporation Act, 1888 is the largest Municipal Corporation in India. The
council of 140 elected representatives is responsible for the provision of
aLl municipal services including water supply, sewerage and sanitation in
Greater Bombay to more than 8 million people. BMC maintains considerable
autonomy in the provision of services by amendments to the 1888 Act which
have been effected by GOM legislation.
-4.02    A separate Water Supply and Sewerage Department (WSSD) of BMC was
established in 1973 by an official order of the Municipal Commissioner and is
responsible to the BMC Standing Committee for the planning, development,
operation and maintenance of water supply, sewerage and sewage disposaL
services. These services were previously the responsibility of several
Connittees and Departments.



-28-
4.03    The Municipal Commissioner, appointed by COH, is the principal
officer of BMC and retains overall responsibility for WSSD assisted by a
Director of Engineering Services and the Deputy Municipal Commissioner,
Special Engineering (DMC(SE)). The Municipal Commissioner has traditionally
been a senior civil servant from the Indian Administrative Services with wide
experience in state and local administration. WSSD is organized into five
separate sections (See Organization Chart, Annex 8) for management purposes -
water supply projects,severage projects, common services engineering, and
hydraulic engineering, each headed by a Chief Engineer. The finance and
administration section is headed by the Additional Municipal Chief
Accountant. All five section heads are responsible to the DMC(SE).
Project Management
4.04    Project management on the Second Water Supply and Sewerage Project
has been weak, particularly with respect to the sewerage component of the
project. The interrelationship of activities on both the on-going and
proposed projects are complex and improvement is needed in systems and
procedures to continually monitor and relate project schedules, costs and
technical performance. Specifically there is a need to provide early
recognition of problems to identify critical activities, alert persons
responsible for action, and then to follow-up antil problems are resolved.
To achieve this the WSSD intends to establish a special project management
cell under the direction of an experienced consultant, who will serve as a
project planning and control coordinator, as part of the technical assistance
component of this project (para 3.14). This project management assistance
would be in support of the section heads of WSSD, and would not supercede
their current responsibilitieis. An outline job description for the project
planning and control coordinator appears in Annex 9. This coordinator was
appointed in August 1986, and the project management cell formed in September
1986, in accordance with the Action Plan.
Project Implementation
4.05    The project components would be implemented by the respective Water
Supply and Sewerage Project Departments who are already completely familiar
with similar project components which are on-going in the Second Project.
4.06    For the preparation of designs, Lender documents, tender reviews and
supervision of major water supply components, WSSD will be assisted by local
consultants (already appointed and acceptable to the Association). The
design and supervision of the sewerage component, which extends the sewerage
service coverage in small isolated areas within the Municipal limits, will be
undertaken by WSSD Sewerage Project Section. Water service facilities for
the urban poor will be dealt with by the Hydraulic Engineer's section, which
is also responsible for distribution system extensions, cement mortar Lining,
metering and improved leak detection and waste control. The provision of low
cost sanitation facilities in the fringe areas of Bombay will be undertaken
by BMC Sanitation Cell in collaboration with the Sewerage Project Section.
The procurement of materials for both water supply and sewerage components of
the project will be undertaken by the Common Services Section.



-29-
4.07    The WSSD also needs to deveLop a program for the efficient and timely
replacement of worn out assets for which a specific cash account will be
established (para 5.19). To achieve this end, a plan must be drawn up by
ISSD involving the financial planners and the technical staff responsible for
carrying out a renewals program. Therefore WSSD will prepare a comprehensive
renewals program, by end-1986, and thereafter review its implementation on a
regular basis (para 3.35).
Training
4.08    The training provided under the proposed project will extend and
continue the programs already initiated in the First and Second Projects.
The BMC Training Establishment at Borivili under the direction of BMC Civic
Training Institute and Research Center, is already functioning and courses in
cathodic protection and sewer cleaning have already been held. Training
manuals have been prepared by BMC covering a wide range of water supply and
sewerage operational requir.ments.  These manuals take cognizance of existing
facilities elsewhere ir -.aia and make use of material provided by British
Water International (formerly National Water Council). These are listed in
Annex 19.
4.09    The facilities and training to be provided under the proposed project
include:
(a) the development of Dadar Sewage Pump Station as a sewerage research
and training center;
(b) extension of Borivili Training Institute to provide student
residential accommodation;
(c) provision of workshop, laboratory, hydraulic and audio visual
equipment at Borivili Training Institute;
(d) the continued support of overseas training of BMC personnel to
increase job skills and improve operational and management
efficiency. Under the proposed project a total of 51 BMC personnel
would receive overseas training with the major emphasis on financial
and construction management, operation and maintenance, wastewater
control and instrumentation system operation. A training program is.
being prepared for Bank review, and will be finalized and implemented
on or before December 31, 1986, according to the Action Plan;
(e) the continued support of training of BMC officers at various training
institutes in India including the Indian Institute of Technology, the
National Institute for Training in Industrial Engineering and the
National Productivity Council; and
(f) training of BMC personnel at Borivili Training Institute and Research
Center.
Insurance
4.10    Assurances were obtained at negotiations that materials and equipment
for the project will be insured and that all other public utility risks will



-30-
continue to be borne by internal Insurance Funds. Assurances were also
obtained at negotiations to ensure that the existing separate Fire/Accident
and Third Party insurance funds of WSSD in respect of other risks will be
maintained by annual contributions by WSSD in accordance with principles
agreed for the Second Bombay Water Supply and Sewerage Project and which are
acceptable to the Bank.
V. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
BMC Capital In istments
5.01    The project is part of GOM's investment program during the Seventh
Five-Year Plan (1986-91). For the Bombay Metropolitan Region (BMR) the
Spventh Plan anticipates some 342 of total investment needs in the transport
sector, 252 in shelter, and 241 in water supply and sanitation. These three
sectors are the focus of priority in the BMR, comprising 83% of budgeted plan
outlays. The Seventh Plan calls for about 68% of the BMR investment funds in
water supply and sanitation to come from COM sources, including IDA
additionality. It anticipates more than 50Z of the funds for shelter to come
from private investment (which is noticeably optimistic), and about 75% of
the funds needed for transport to come from the GOI.
5.02    A summary analysis of BMC capital investments is shown in Annex 10.
During the last ten years (1975-84) water supply and sewerage amounted to 53%
of BMC's total investment. While some 762 of BMC's investment was in the
areas of water supply and sewerage, shelter, and traffic management, the
investment in shelter was a relatively small 72. However, the recent
launching of the IDA-financed Bombay Urban Development Project (BUDP)
substantially improves the mix of BMC sector investments. With the BUDP and
this Third Water Supply and Sewerage Project, the BMC sector investments for
1985-95 are projected to comprise about 37% water supply and sewerage, 27%
shelter and 15% traffic operations. This is consistent with the priorities
of the Seventh Plan.
5.03    The BMC investments projected for 1986-91 would be within the present
financial capacity of the corporation. Recurrent annual costs for water
supply and sewerage investments in the BMC amount to only about llZ of
capital investment costs, and are entirely covered by direct charges to
consumers. The additional BMC general revenue requirements for the annual
recurrent costs of the increased shelter investments will amount to only
about 71 of current revenues. For analysis purposes other investments were
projected to remain at past levels. However, if they were to be increased
materially, especially in education or traffic operations, substantial
increases in property tax or other general revenues could become necessary
to cover annual recurrent costs.
WSSD Financial Position and Performance
5.04    The WSSD became a separate accounting entity within the BMC in 1974,
as a condition of Credit effectiveness of the First Bombay Water Supply and
Sewerage Project. Separate funds and accounts were established for the WSSD
in 1975, and the Department began reporting its financial position and



-31-
resuLts of operations using commercial accounting principles beginning in
1979. The performance of WSSD in implementing its accounting systems,
including some computerization, has been impressive. Also, the financial
performance of WSSD since 1975 has been very good.
5.05    Annexes 11 through 14 present summary historical financial statements
for the WSSD. Included are statements of financial position, income and
expenditures, sources and applications of funds, and working capital. Table
5.1 presents key indicators of WSSD's financial performance for fiscal years
ending 1981-85, derived from the financial statements.
5.06    Covenant Under Second Project.  Under the Second Project the WSSD
must maintain tariff levels to generate annual cash surpluses to cover at
least 33% of its capital expenditures in any year, and at least a 40% average
in two years. The WSSD is expected to satisfy this covenant for the fiscal
years ending March 31, 1985 and 1986. However a tariff increase of about 30%
will have to become effective during FY86 to satisfy the covenant in FY87,
and to meet the projected financial performance under the proposed project
(para 5.15). The WSSD has prepared a proposal for this tariff increase for
BMC approval. As part of an Action Plan (para 3.35), the WSSD has taken the
necessary administrative action toward the implementation of this tariff
increase.

5.07    Departmental Liquidity.  The liquidity position of WSSD has been
consistently good over the past five years. Its quick asset ratio has
averaged 2:1 and has been stable. This would indicate that the WSSD has
been readily able to convert its working capital into cash to cover current
liabilities. This in fact has been the situation, even though almost half
of WSSD's customer receivables at March 31, 1985 may have represented old,
disputed billings. Nonetheless, if this disputed amount was not considered
the quick asset ratio would still be noticeably good in FY85, approximating
1.8:1.



-33-
5.08    Customer Receivables.  The WSSD has made imp nvements over the past
five years in reducing its customer receivables relativce to billings, but
they still remained significantly high at FYE85, amounting to some 49% of
billings. In effect the average age of customer receivables has ranged
between 6 and 8 months over the past five years. In iY78 customer
receivabLes were about 39% of billings, and the Bank obtained assurances from
WSSD on the Second Water Supply and Sewerage Project that customer
receivabLes would be reduced to not more than 20% of billings by March 31,
1984. This target proved unrealistic given the timing of biLling and
collecting on a quarterly basis, but the 49% figure is undesirable
nonetheless.   The underlying problem has to do with a lack of established
policies and procedures for writing-off doubtful or disputed accounts, rather
than with poor collection of billings in the year they are due. Indeed,
WSSD's annual collection efficiency was betweei 75% and 80% in FY85. The
objection to not writing-off doubtful accounts is that it could overstate
WSSD's n2t income in any given year, and as tne doubtful -ccounts have
accumulated it is beginning to overstate the WSSD's liquidicy position.
Hence, as part of an Action Plan (para 3.35), the WSSD will develop and
implement a write-off policy for doubtful or disputed customer accounts by
March 31, 1987, and accordingly for the fiscal year ending March 31, 1988,
the WSSD will charge off accrued customer receivables with appropriate
current or prior-period adjustments to the accounting records.
5.09    Billing and Collections.  WSSD billings are performed by the data
processing department of BMC. The system of computerized billings is well
controlled and operated. However, no routine reports are prepared to aid
in monitoring and following up on delinquencies. As part of this project,
technical assistance will be provided (para 3.14) to develop computer
programs to zutomatically produce monthly delinquency reports, and to
automatice  y print reminder letters to customers whose bills are over 30
days in a. ears. As part of an Action Plan (para 3.35), the WSSD will employ
consultants, by December 31, 1986, to provide technical assistance to develop
and implement these computer programs. It is projected that this enhancement
of the billing and collection system will increase collection efficiency to
85Z by FYE88.
5.10    Departmental Debt.  Table 5.2 summarizes the long-term debt position
of WSSD for FYE84, and the estimated position for FYE85. A more detailed
schedule of WSSD's historical and projected debt appears in Annex 17. Over
the past five years WSSD's debt to equity ratio has ranged between 0.26 and
0.30, which represents a relatively low level of debt compared to equity
:apital, and is indicative of WSSD's ability to sustain substantially higher
debt levels to finance capital works expansion.

5.11    Operating Surpluses and Rates of Return.  The WSSD has consistently
generated operating surpluses over the past five years. During this time it
has had a working ratio ranging between .54 and .64, leaving ample cash
available each year to fund debt service and depreciation actually charged.
Also, sufficient operating cash surpluses have heen available each year to
finance capital works. To date these annual surpluses have been sufficient
t-o enable WSSD to finance an average of about 60Z (compared to the 40Z
requirement) of its annual investment outlays under the Second Water Supply
and Sewerage Project. However, this has occurred largely because WSSD)'s
investment program proceeded slower than anticipated.
5.12    Annual operating performance of the VSSD over the past five years has
yielded satisfactery Rates of Return on fixed assets averaging about 10.1Z.
These Rates of Return were based upon net fixed assets that were revalued in
1975, but not thereafter. A revaluation of fixed assets during FY81-85 would
have reduced the Rates of Return to an estimated average of about 6.5X. This
would still have been a satisfactory level, in view of the average cost of
borrowed funds for WSSD being only about 4Z during' the past five years.
5.13    Revaluation of Assets.  The WSSD revalued its fixed assets in 1975 to
allow for more realistic depreciation charges reflecting the replacement cost
of the aseets. The assets were to be revalued at regular intervals in the
future using a general price index for India. However, the periodic
revaluations have not been done. The GOI has stated that accounting for and
reporting fixed assets at replacement value does not conform to generally
accepted accounting principles in India. Hence, for purposes of establishing
cash reserves for planned rehabilitation or replacement of WTSSD plant and
equipment, WSSD will notionally revalue fixed assets annually, using an
appropriate index. This eas recorded in the Agreed Minutes of negotiations.
Depreciation amounts calculated on these asset replacement values would then
be the basis for deposits to a specific cash account to be used for asset
rehabilitation and replacement (para 5.19).

5.14    Tariffs.  Table 5.3 summarizes the current WSSD tariff structure for
water and sewerage. Some 75Z of billed water and sewerage revenue comes from
metered charges, with charges to industrial and commercial users amounting to
about 54Z of total billed revenue. About 402 of the rateable value of
properties in Bombay is accounted for by industrial and commercial
properties. Thus, when both metered and unmetered charges are considered,
industrial and commercial users are paying at least six times the amount
domestic users are paying for a liter of water. At current water consumption
levels, the average monthly domestic water and sewerage bill amounts to about
Rs 20. Even for a relatively affluent domestic consumer the bill would not
exceed about Rs 35 per month. A Rs 20 monthly bill would approximate 2Z of
an average family income, suggesting that higher domestic tariffs would still
be affordable. Indeed in the nearby towns of Kalyan and Dombivli, domestic
consumers are paying Bs 5/10,000 liters, compared to the Rs 3 charged in
Bombay. Presently, the overall effective tariff rate in Bombay amounts to
about Rs 19/10,000 liters. An economic analysis (para 6.10) estimates that
the average incremental cost of water under this project will be about
Rs 29/lo,000 liters, assuming 12% opportunity cost of capital. Hence,
effective tariff increases of about 30X in FY86, 401 in FY88 and 40% in FY92
will be needed to bring average incremental revenues in line with costs. The
weight of these increases is likely to fall on domesic consumers. Hence, it
will become important for the WSSD to also consider the relative tariff
implications for low income and high income households.
WSSD Financial Projections
5.15    Annexes 11 through 14 present summary projected financial statements
for the WSSD, extending to FY95. Included are projected statements of
financial position, income and expenditures, sources and applications of
funds, and working capital. The assumptions underlying the projections are
presented in Annex 15, and should be viewed as an integral part of the
projected statements. Table 5.4 presents key ir.dicators of WSSD's projected
financial performance, derived from the projecr.s.d financial statements.
These indicacors have been included in the monitoring criteria to be used
during supervision of the project (para 3.36 and Annex 6). For comparison
purposes, some of these same indicators also are used in the presentation of
WSSD historical financial performance (Table 5.1).

5.16    The projected financial statements indicate noticeably satisfactory
performance for the WSSD, predicated on tariff increases of about 40Z each
enacted in the years in which works are commissioned (FY88 and FY92) for both
the Second and Third Water Supply and Sewerage Projects. The liquidity
position of WSSD is projected to remain very sound, with large cash balances
accumulating. These balances will be needed as contributions to a specific
cash account (para 5.19), for the periodic replacement or rehabilitation of
capital assets. The remaining unrestricted cash in WSSD should be limited so
the quick current ratio does not exceed 2:1. Collection efficiency is
expected to increase to 85Z as a result of technical assistance to improve
the computerized monitoring and follow-up of customer billings (para 5.08).
This would have a direct impact on improving the average age of customer
receivables to under four months. Debt service coverage is projected to
remain satisfactory, reaching a relatively low but safe level of 2.3 in FY93,
and improving thereafter. The Rate of Return on assets also is projected to
remain satisfactory, averaging about 9.1Z during FY86-95.

5.17       Financial Impact  of Early Project Completion.   The WSSD plans  to
implement this project in six and one half years, compared to ehe seven and
one half year impLementation period used for the financial appraisal. Early
completion would reduce total investment costs some 72, or Rs 278 million,
and would have a noticeable effect on the amount of accumulated cash
surpluses in WSSD and on its Rates of Return. The financial impact of the
earlier completion of the project is shown in Table 5.5. If the early
completion of the project is realized, the WSSD would have an estimated
Bs 333 crores extra in accumulated cash at the end of FY93. Early completion
of the project also could enable the WSSD to realize an average Rate of
Return on assets of 9.8Z during the project implementation period.

5.18    Internal Cash Generation.  The projected financial performance of
WSSD (para 5.15) is predicated on WSSD continuing to satisfy the Cash
Generation Covenant used in the First and Second Projects. Assurances were
obtained at negotiations that WSSD would continue to maintain tariff levels
to ensure that internal funds are available to cover at least 33Z of its
capital expenditures in any year, and at least a 40% average in two
consecutive years. Also, to minimize the effects of any project
implementation delays on the effectiveness of the covenant, assurances also
were obtained that the cash generation percentages in any year would apply to
either actual annual capital expenditures, or to a stipulated plan of annual
expenditures, whichever would be greater. The stipulated plan of annual
expenditures corresponds to the Bank-wide 8 year disbursement profile, which
was used as a basis for the financial appraisal of the project.
5.19    Management of Cash Surpluses.  The WSSD will be generating
significant and necessary cash surpluses during the implementation of this
project, and thereafter. However, this surplus will be needed for the
planned replacement or rehabilit&tion of capital assets (para 4.07), and for
additional capital investment. To ensure that the surpluses are being
allocated prudently, assurances were obtained at negotiations that the WSSD
would establish a specific cash account for the periodic replacement or
rehabilitation of capital assets, effective for FYE87, and that all annual
operating surpluses (after meeting 40% of capital expenditure from operating
revenues, and allowing for sufficient unrestricted cash to maintain a quick
current ratio of not more than 2:1) would be deposited in this account, until
the accumulated deposits equal accumulated depreciation charges. This is
projected to happen in FY94. Thereafter, annual deposits equal to annual
depreciation charges would continue to be made to this cash account. It was
understood and recorded in the Agreed Minutes of negotiations that the
depreciation charges for this purpose would be based on asset values that
would be notionally revalued annually.



-39-
Debt Ceiling Restriction
5.20    Currently the BMC has a statutory debt ceiling which limits total
debt to twice the rateable value base of real property. Projected BMC/WSSD
borrowing from GOM for this Project would cause BHC debt to exceed this
ceiling in FY87. The matter has been discussed by BMC with the GOM, and
assurances were received that necessary statutory amendments to Chapter 6 of
the Bombay Municipal Corporation Act would be made to allow the debt ceiling
to be raised to four times the rateable value base, only applicable to the
WSSD borrowing. As part of an Action Plan (para 3.35), the WSSD will take
necessary administrative actions toward the timely enactment of the
statuatory amendment.
Accounts and Audits
5.21    The accounts of WSSD are well designed and are audited annually by
The Municipal Chief Auditor of BMC. His report is prepared and submitted to
the BKC, and forwarded to the Bank normally within six months of the fiscal
year end. In recent years the reports have been complete, have addressed
important financial and operational issues, and have appeared to be
independent and reliable. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the
annual report of The Municipal Chief Auditor will continue to be forwarded to
the Bank within six months of the end of WSSD's fiscal year.
5.22    The Office of The Municipal Chief Auditor is a large-scale operation
within BMC, coiprising more than 500 people addressing all BMC budgets.
While the work and the reports of the office has been commendable. its audit
programs and procedures have not been formally reviewed or updated since the
early 1970's. Since that time the BMC has expanded its use of computers in
maintaining financial records, and advances have been made in the auditing
field. Hence, a technical assistance component has been included in this
project (para 3.14) to finance a "peer review" of the office of The Municipal
Chief Auditor by an independent firm of public accountants. Such a review
would address:
(a) Updating and documenting audit policies and procedures for the
various accounts within BMC, including those of the WSSD. Such
updating would specifically include procedures for auditing
computerized records, and would include delineation of duties among
juniors, seniors, supervisors and higher levels within the office;
and
(b) Designing ard documenting policies and procedures for the
preparation, review and maintenance of audit workpapers.

VI. ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL BENEFITS
Health Benefits and Environmental Impact
6.01    Water supply service in parts of the Bombay municipal area is
available only for periods between 4 and 8 hours during the day. Production
capacity is unable to match demand, with the present shortfall estimated
around 30% of the latent demand. To properly allocate available resources it
is necessary for sections of the distribution system to be intermittently
isolated and unpressurized. This creates conditions whereby polluted
groundwater could be drawn into the system. This potentially nullifies the
treatment and sterilization process carried out by BMC prior to water
distribution. BMC is aware of this potential danger and regularly tests the
water in the distribution system to deal with such occurrences.
6.02    A high priority of BMC is to increase the water supply production
capability to progressively extend the hours of water service availability
throughout the system. A major component in this project addresses this
issue by the provision of a further 455 mld of fully treated water from the
Bhatsai source, so that by the time the project is complete the shortfall
will have been reduced to about 18Z of the projected demand. The project
also includes provisions to: (a) improve leakage detection and repair;
(b) improve operations by the introduction of a telemetry information and
system control module; and (c) study the re-cycling of wastewater from
potable water treatment plants. These cmponents are all designed to improve
service levels and availability leading ultimately to the provision of a
continuously pressurized distribution system delivering safe hygienic water
at all times.
6.03    Bombay's wastewater collection and disposal system which is being
implemented under the on-going Second Project has been designed and built
progressively for a pLanning horizon in year 2005. The additional water
supplies will therefore not adversely contribute to Bombay's wastewater
disposal problems to any appreciable extent. Minor extensions to the sewer
conveyance system are included in the proposed project to serve in newly
developed areas. Wastewater treatment processes will also be further
reviewed to decide future investment options and determine the most cost
effective technologies for pollution control.
Impact and Benefits for Urban Poor
6.04    The current population of 9.4 million, in BMC's supply area, is
expected to grow to about 10.75 million in 1991 when the project will become
fully operational. Some 50Z of this population is estimated to have
household incomes below the Bombay absolute poverty level of Rs 875 per
month.
6.05    The health impacts of inadequate water supply, sewerage and
sanitation service levels fall most heavily on the urban poor since they are
generally less able to afford privately owned facilities such as ground water
storage tanks, pumping systems and on site disposal systems to compensate for



-41-
the deficiencies in the municipal system. It is acknowledged that in order
to provide significant health benefits, improved water service fa-ilities
must be accompanied by adequate sanitation facilities and sound hygienic
practices. The water supply and sanitation components in this project will
provide improved services to around 5.3 million of Bombay's urban poor in
addition to the site service improvements provided in the on-going Bombay
Urban Development Project (Credit 1544-IN). Sanitation improvements include
on-site human waste disposal, public toilets and ablution facilities. Site
specific components included in the project provide suction tanks and pumping
systems for slum colonies on high ground, development of well water for
flushing purposes, tubewells and mains extensions in slum areas, and
sanitation facilities in fringe areas of the city. These provisions will
directly benefit the urban poor and complement the provision of latrine
blocks, surface and sullage water drainage and the provision of standpipe
water services being provided under the on-going Second Project.
6.06    Importantly, about half the total incremental volume (320 mld) of
-production water being provided by the project, reserved for domestic use,
will directly benefit those living in poverty by increasing the per capita
amount of drinking water available and extending the hours of service. Thus,
about 5.3 million of the poor will receive direct benefit from this project.
Indirect benefits would include improved job opportunities for the poor from
commercial expansion and industrial growth resulting from the additional
water made available under the project. About US$120 million of the total
project cost (about 40% of the project cost) would benefit the urban poor.
Least Cost Solution
6.07    The engineering studies, undertaken for the development of the third
tranche of water supply from the Bhatsai source, and the Bank participation
in the project preparation review process have ensured that all major
engineering components were analyzed for cost effectiveness and that least
cost solutions have been adopted. Project appraisal was delayed for about
one year on this account. A major quantifiable saving which was achieved
during this year, through an expanded search for lower-cost engineering
designs, was in the tunnelling component of the project where costs were
reduced by about US$8 million or 15% of the original estimated cost of this
component.
6.08    Studies undertaken at feasibility level identified the Middle
Vaitarna Reservoir as the least cost development to provide the next water
source for Bombay. Present value capital, operation and maintenance costs of
alternative proposals were compared and sensitivity analyses were carried out
using 8, 10 and 12% discount .ates in the final selection of the present
scheme.
Economic Analysis
6.09    The long-term marginal cost for water has been estimated using the
long-runi average incremental cost (AIC). Price distortions are judged to be
of minor significance except for wages paid to unskilled labor. Thus the
analysis has been carried out considering labor cost at the nominal wage rate
and at a shadow wage rate equal to 70% of the nominal rate. Annex 18



-42-
provides data relating to incremental water sold, and incremental costs and
revenues. All calculations refer to constant 1986/87 prices. The revenue
streams in the calculations include future changes in tariffs, in real terms,
which have been planned by the borrower.
6.10    Table 6.1 summarizes the findings of the economic analysis.  The AIC
of water under this project ranges between Rs 24 and Rs 32 per 10,000 liters,
using both market and shadow labor prices, and discount rates of 8% to 12% to
represent the opportunity cost of capital. Presently, the WSSD tariff
structure has metered rates of Rs 3/10,000 liters for domestic consumers and
Rs 20 to Rs 60/10,000 liters for commercial and industrial users. Taking
into account both metered and non-metered water charges, the present overall
effective water rate presently amounts to about Rs 19/10,000 liters. This is
below the AIC range for this project, which is relatively high because the
incremental water increases will involve substantial increases in pumping and
trunk transmission compared to present water supplies. Hence, tariff
increases have been planned in the years in which capital assets are
commissioned for both the Second and Third Projects. With these increases
the average incremental revenue upon commissioning of this project will be
about Rs 31/10,000 liters (in constant 1986-87 prices), which compares
favorably with the AIC's at the 12Z discount rate.

6.11    The project is justified on the basis of quantifiable economic
returns.  Rates of return have been calculated using revenues as a measure of
benefits. Costs have been adjusted for wage distortions and revenues have
been calculated using the highest real tariffs to be in effect. The economic
rate of return thus calculated amounts to 12.3%. When full market prices for
wages were used the rate of return was reduced to 10.9%. In either case the
t-conomic rate of return for this project compares favorably wich other
prujects in the water supply sector. In addition, the calculated rates of
return actually tend to understate the real economic rate of return for the
project, since unquantifiable benefits such as health improvements are
excluded.
Risks and Safeguards
{
6.12    This is a compl-!x and extensive project including major pumping and
treatment facilities, conveyance works and tunnels associated with the



-43-
development of the 455 mld water supply component. However, these works are
to a large extent similar to components in tne Second Project with which WSSD
and its consultant are now completely familiar in their execution. The main
problems which have arisen in the past are the lack of project coordination,
particularly on the sewerage component of the on-going project and delayed
implementation due largely to: (a) BMC's cumbersome procurement procedures;
(b) design changes during project execution; and (c) over ambitious
construction schedules.
6.13    In the proposed project, safeguards have been taken to prevent a
recurrence of these difficulties by: (a) the prequalification of contractors
for major contracts before inviting priced bids; (b) determination of least
cost solutions and preparation of detailed designs for major components prior
to project appraisal; (c) determination of reliable cost estimates based on
detailed designs; and (d) the adoption of the 8 year Bank-wide sector
disbursement profile to determine the implementation schedule and cost
inflation allowance. WSSD will also establish a project management cell
under the direction of an experienced consultant who will serve as a project
planning and control coordinator to work with the departmental chief
engineers to strengthen WSSD's management performance on both the on-going
and proposed projects.
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED, ACTIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01    BMC brought to negotiations evidence that the purchase of the
remaining portions of the land required for the project had been
substantially completed (para 3.13).
7.02    The following agreements and assurances were obtained at
negotiations:
(a) GOM will make water available from the Bhatsai reservoir as required
for the project (para 2.12);
(b) GOM will lend funds to WSSD for at least 602 of annual capital
expenditures includin- the proceeds of the Loan/Credit, for 25 years,
including a 5 year grace period, at an interest rate of not Less than
8.75%. (para 3.10);
tc) BMC will discuss and review progress on the implementation of an
agreed Action Plan satisfactory to the Bank to improve operational,
institutional and financial performance and enable BMC/WSSD to comply
with the agreed targets. The Action Plan would be reviewed and
updated annually between WSSD and the Bank (para 3.35);
(d) WSSD will submit, within six months from the end of each quarter,
performance and program measuring according to agreed monitoring
criteria (para 3.36);



-44-
(e) BMC wiLl adequately insure materials and equipment used in the
project and WSSD will maintain its existing separate Fire/Accident
and Third Party Insurance (para 4.10);
(f) BKC will revise tariffs or take other means as necessary to ensure
that at least 40X of capital expenditures are provided from
internally generated funds of the WSSD (para 5.18);
(g) WSSD will establish a specific cash account, effective FY87 for the
periodic replacement of capital assets (para 5.19); and
(h) BIC will have the accounts of WSSD audited annually by the Municipal
Chief Auditor of BhC, and will forward the audit reports to the Bank
within six months of the end of WSSD's fiscal year (para 5.21);
7.03    The signing of subsidiary loan agreements, satisfactory to the Bank,
between COM and BMC would be a condition of Loan/Credit effectiveness.
7.04    Since satisfactory agreement was reached on the issues outlined in
this report, the proposed project constitutes a suitable basis for Bank Group
support to the GOI. A Bank/IDA blend providing a Bank Loan of
US$40.0 million and an IDA Credit of SDRs 105.5 million, equivalent to
US$145.0 million is proposed.
7.05    Retroactive financing from March 1, 1985, not exceeding US$250,000
is reco -ended for project related expenditures for consulting services.

THE THIRD BOMBAY WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
Project Description
History of the Water Supply and Sewerage Systems
Water Supply
1.      Bombay's first piped water system was constructed in the mid-19th
century to serve commercial and residential areas in the southern portion of
Bombay island near the harbor and the Fort. Subsequent rapid expansion of
commerce and development of industry caused a northward expansion,
accompanied by development and reclamation of land from the sea to form the
Greater Bombay area (440 km2).
2.      Vihar Lake (Map IBRD 18974) was Bombay's first source of water and
was brought into use in 1860 to provide a 24-hour supply for an 8-year period
until water demands out-stripped supply. This lead to the development of the
Tulsi reservoir, which was brought into use, on completion of its dam and
gravity main, in 1879. In 1883 further increases in demand for water
prompted Bombay Municipal Corporaton to develop the Tansa reservoir which was
the first of the more distant, and more expensive, sources of water located
on the mainland.
3.      There was no further shortage of water until 1944 when BMC sanctioned
the beginning of work on the lower Vaitarna project which was completed in
1957. However. extension of the Corporation's boundaries in that year once
again led to an increase in the city's water demand and the Upper Vaitarna
scheme was started in 1965. After an unusually dry year in 1966 GOM
permitted BKC to extract water from the Ulhas river for which works were
compLeted in 1967.
4.      In 1964 a special committee appointed by BMC to investigate new
sources of water for Bombay recommended construction of a dam across the
Bhatsai river to ultimately provide 1,365mld for Bombay (in three tranches of
455mld) and 455m1d for irrigation. The Bhatsai dam is under construction and
the source water for BMC and irrigation use is being made available in
stages. The first tranche of 455mld for Bombay was released in 1979
(providing water for the First Bombay Water Supply Project) and dam
conetruction was sufficiently advanced by the end of 1984 for the second

ANNEX 1
Page 2
tranche of 455 mld to be taken by BMC on completion of the Second Bombay
project (estimated 1986/87). Although it has been necessary to strengthen
the Bhatsai Dam with additional masonry buttresses following recent
earthquake activity, the implementing agency (GOM Irrigation Department) has
given an assurance that the third and final tranche of 455 mld will be
available before 1991 (the estimated earliest date of commissioning the
proposed project.)
5.      The present yields 1/ obtained by BMC from its various water sources
are summarized as follows:
Yield                Cummulative
Source                  in mld (mgd)      Yield in mld (mgd)

Vehar Lake                 50 (11.0)             67  (14.8)
Tansa Lake                421 (92.6)            488 (107.4)

(tranche 1)               455 (100.0)         2,020 (444.4)
6.      On completion of the on-going Second Bombay Water Supply Project in
1986/87 the cimmulative yield will increase by a further 455mld (lOOmgd),
being the second tranche of the Bhatsai supply, to a total of around 2475mld
(544 mgd). Subsequently this figure would increase to 2930mld (644 mgd) on
completion of the works proposed under this project when the third and final
tranche of the Bhatsai supply reserved for BMC is fully utilized.
Sewerage
7.      Sewerage facilities in Bombay date back for more than 120 years; the
original Worli outfall was completed in 1880 and sewage within the city was
conveyed to Lovegrove and thence to the sea through the Worli outfall. In an
effort to provide a service for the rapidly growing population, extensive
relief works were sanctioned in 1948 but these measures, which were rapidly
overtaken by industrial and commercial developments and population growth,
did little to improve the situation and the need for system improvements was
increased further by an extension of BMC's boundaries in the 1950's.
8.      Subsequently various studies were undertaken during the period
through 1979 culminating in a report by consulting engineers, Metcslf and
1/ Based on design criteria using monscon inflows having 95% reliability.

Eddy Inc (USA) in association with Environmental Engineering Consultants
(India) which provided a sewage treatment and disposal plan for Bombay
through 2005. This report is the basis for treatment and disposal systems
being implemented in the on-going Second Bombay Water Supply and Sewerage
Project (Credit 842-IN).
Works Under the First and Second Projects (IDA Credits 390-In and 842-IN)
Water Supply
9.      In the late 1960s GOM proceeded with design and construction of the
Bhatsai dam and a report, issued in 1971, identified the least cost means of
improving Bombay's water supply to an acceptable level over a ten year
period. The iirst stage of this program became the first IDA assisted Bombay
Water Supply and Sewerage Project (Credit 390-IN) and the second stage
(together with sewerage works) was supported by the second IDA Bombay Water
Supply and Sewerage Project (Credit 842-IN).
10.     The first project included full treatment of Bombay's existing water
supply and augmentation of the supply by 455mld available from the first
tranche of the Bhatsai source.
11.     Water reLeased from the Bhatsai dam augments the flow of the river
over its course to the Pise Weir, 48 km below the dam. The weir, constructed
under the first project, allows the ultimate allocation of Bhatsai water
(1365 mld) to be pumped from the river. The first stage of the Pise pumping
station lifts 455 mld from the river and conveys it, via 7.65 km of 2,235 m
main, to settling tanks at Panjrapur. After chemical coagulation and settle-
ment the water is repumped into trun. mains which also carry water from the
Vaitarna reservoirs.  The blended water flows to Mulund where all of the
water from BMC's multiple sources is chlorinated, prior to further treatment
at the Bhandup Treatment Plant which has a capacit,- of 1900 mld. Treatment
at Bhandup comprises pre-chlorination, flocculation, settlement, filtration
post-chlorination. Treated water is pumped from the plant's clear water tank
to a 245 ml balancing reservoir, from which it flows by gravity to 18 exist-
ing distribution reservoirs and thence to consumers.
12.     Because of the delays experienced on the first project and steeply
rising costs in the mid 1970's it was decided to reduce the scope of the
project. Due to the continuing growth in population, the water available
from the first project was unable to meet the continued increase in demand.
It was therefore decided to proceed immediately with the Second Bombay Water
Supply and Sewerage Project (Credit 842-IN) to maintain the water service
levels at that time and to re-include distribution extensions, (curtailed
from the First project). The Second project included the following water
supply components.



-48-
ANNEX 1
Page 4
Pise Intake and Pumping System
13.     Pise pumping station was enlarged, as planned during its original
design, to accommodate new pumps capabLe of lifting a further 455 mld of
water from the river and conveying it to the existing treatment plant site at
Panjrapur (a distance of about 7.65km).
Panjrapur Treatment Plant and Pump Station
14.     As originally envisaged, pretreatment facilities at Panjrapur were to
be used to settle Bhatsai river water so that it couLd be effectively
chlorinated and distributed prior to completion of the Bhandup treatment
plant. With the development of the second stage of the Bhatsai supply fil-
ters are being added at Panjrapur together with post-chlorination and pH
control, thus providing a complete treatment system for 455 mld of water from
Bhatsai river when commissioned in 1986/87. Additional treated water vari-
able speed pumps are being installed at Panjrapur under the Second Project so
that on comissoning, 455 mld will be fully treated,pumped to Yewai balancing
reservoir (described below) and gravitated to supply Bombay; and 455 mld raw
water will be repumped from Panjrapur, blended with Vaitarna water and
treated at the Bhandup works before delivery to the city.
Yewai Hill Balancing Reservoir
15.     P 117 ml balancing reservoir is currently under construction at Yewai
Hill, about 1 km from Panjrapur to even out varying rates of demand and also
provide a reserve to supply against power or system failures.
Transmission Mains
16.     The Second Project included a 2235 - diameter raw water main from
Fise to Panjrapur water treatment plant. Treated water mains are provided
from Panjrapur to Yewai Balancing Reservoir (2235m diAmeter) and a 52.5 km
length of 2345 mm diameter main from Yewai to Kings Circle (Futka Tank) via
the Eastern Express Highway (EER). The transmission system across Kasheli
Creek is by means of a 3.5 m diameter tunnel which is presently under con-
struction. The capacity of this tunnel is also sufficient for the second and
third tranches of the Bhatsai supply.
Distribution Reservoirs, Mains and Tunnel
17.     Twelve service reservoirs together with inlet and outlet connections,
distribution system extension and a 4km inlet tunnel from Dr. E. Moses Road
to Malabar Hill reservoir are included in the on-going project designed to
improve the storage capacity to about 5 hours supply and provide more equi-
table and reliable water distribution.

ANNEX I
Page 5
Miscellaneous Ancillary Works
18.     Miscellaneous ancillary works including booster pump stations,
instrumentation and the cement mortar lining of the old Tansa mains (built
around 1890) are also included in this project.
Sewerage
19.     On completion of the on-going works, sewage treatment and disposal
facilities will be provided in the following five drainage zones.
Mslabar - Primary treatment and disposal by submarine outfall
to Bombay harbour.
Worli -   Preliminary treatment at Lovegrove and disposal by
submarine pipeline to the Arabian Sea.
Chembur - Biological treatment in aerated lagoons at Bhandup
and Chembur and disposal to Thane Creek.
Harve   - Biological treatment in aerated lagoons at Malad
and Versova and disposal to Malad Creek.
Mahim   - Preliminary treatment at Bandra and disposal by submarine
pipeline to the Arabian Sea.
20.     The ongoing project includes sewerage collection and conveyance
components in each of the five drainage zones including pump stations, force
mains,trunk and branch sewers and tunnels designed to enable some 90% of
properties in the Greater Bombay area to have access to adequate sewerage
facilities on completion of the project in 1987. However due to cost
over-runs and design and implementation delays, aeration lagoons at four
sites have been deferred for future construction by BMC after obtaining
operating experience from the full scale trial lagoons at Versova which are
retained in the on-going project together with preliminary treatment
facilities at all four sites.
Works under the Proposed Project
Water Supply
21.     On completion of the First (in 1979) and Second (in 1986/87) IDA
assisted water projects, the total gross water supply availability for Bombay
will be about 2475mld (544 mgd) compared with an estimated demand around
3000mld (660mgd) in 1986 which is expected to reach 3568 mld (7,5 mgd) in
1991 (the earliest date by which the proposed project could be commissioned)
and some 4350 mld (957 mgd) by year 2001. Further details are presented
graphically in Annex 2 which also shows that the anticipated population over
the same period is expected to total 10.7 million by 1991 and around 12.8



-50-
ANNEX 1
Page 6
million in year 2001. Annex 2 demonstrates the need for the further develop-
ment of additional water supplies for Bombay, as soon as possible, just to
maintain the present service level. The proposed project which is described
below is designed to provide an additional 455mld (lO0mgd) of fully treated
water service to all categories of consumer, improve the period of service
(although intermittent supply in many areas will still be inevitable), extend
the distribution faci'.ities and provide improved services to the urban poor.
Pise Intake Pump Station
22.     The existing Pise intake and pump station structures are adequate to
accommodate the necessary additional pumping equipment which would be
provided to lift the final 455mld (100 mgd) tranche of Bhatsai water from the
river for treatment at the Panjrapur Treatment Plant.
Panjrapur Treatment Plant and Pump Station
23.     A second treatment plant of 45'mld (100 mgd) capacity will be built
at Panjrapur to provide a complete treatment system. The existing pump
station at Panjrapur will be extended and additional pumping equipment
installed to pump treated water to the existing Yewai balancing reservoir so
that on completion of the proposed project 910m1d (100 mgd) of fully treated
water will be conveyed to Yewai for onward transmission to supply and 455mld
(100 mgd) of raw water will be pumped for blending with Vaitarna water and
treatment at Bhandup.
Transmission System
24.     The project includes the third 2235mm diameter raw water transmission
pipeline, 7.65km long, from Pise to Panjrapur and a treated water main of the
same size from Panjrapur pump station to the existing Yewai reservoir.
Various alternatives have been considered for the transmission of treated
water from Yewai to the city. Only a single main can be accommodated in the
land already acquired from Yewai to Kasheli under the Second Project. A
3000 L diameter surface pipeline, 15km long is proposed over this section
from the Yewai master balancing reservoir to the upstream end of the existing
Kasheli Creek tunnel. This pipeline is sized to accommodate the 455mld (100
mgd) supply in this project with surplus capacity for a similar future
supply, since, when the next supply for Bombay is commissioned (following
construction of Middle Vaitarna reservoir) it will be necessary to deliver a
total of 1365mld (300 mgd) of treated water from Panjrapur Treatment Plant to
supply the city from Yewai reservoir. The conveyance route from the down-
stream side of the Kasheli crossing to the junction of Mulund Coregaon Link
Road and Eastern Express Highway (MCL/EEH), a distance of some 9km, was
originally proposed in trmnel in view of the heavily urbanized development in
the area. This was subsequently modified, and following agreement by the
Highway Authority, a conventional buried pipeline, 3000 mm diameter and
12.2km long, will be laid along the route of the Eastern Express Highway. A



-51-
ANNEX 1
Page 7
3.3km connection main of 1800mm diameter will also be provided from the
MGL/EEH junction to Bhandup reservoir.
Distribution and Storage
25.     The project includes the provision of additional storage facilities
at Borivili, Malabar, Worli and Raoli totaling 144m1, 12.8km of reservoir
inlet/outlet mains, cement mortar lining of 33.3km of existing mains to
improve their carrying capacity and distribution system extensions totaling
49km in sizes between 150 and 1800mm diameter. Distribution studies have
demonstrated the need to reinforce the trunk distribution systems to the
Malabar Hill and Sewree areas of the city since the existing tunnel/pipeline
systems are not adequate to accommodate the flows anticipated under the
proposed project. In view of the heavily congested urbanized developmenc in
these areas and the multiplicity of existing services, bored tunnelling is
the only feasible construction technique which may be safely adopted. Two
distribution tunnels, each 3000mm diameter, are therefore included in the
project totalling 9km in length. One tunnel will extend the E. Moses
Road/Malabar Hill tunnel (which is being constructed under the second
project) by some 5km towards Bandra and the second 4km long tunnel will
provide a link from the existing Futka tank to the Sewree area.
Miscellaneous Works
26.     Since the existing low head pump at Bhandup are no longer able to
meet the demand at Malad and Borivili by direct pumping, higher head pump
units will be installed at Bhandup to raise all Bhandup water to the Bhandup
master balancing reservoir in order to gravitate the supply to the Malad and
Borivili areas.
27.     The project also incLudes pumping plant at Raoli, metering, vehicles,
instrumentation and staff quarters at Agra for Panjrapur Treatment Plant
operatives.
Sewerage
28.     The proposed project includes minor extensions to the sewerage system
isolated developed areas not covered by the works in the on-going project,
including conveyance systems and pump stations.
Site Specific Facilities in Slum Areas
29.     Additional water in slum areas and the provision of suction tanks and
pumping facilities for slum colonies located on high ground at Shivaji Nagar,
Baiganuadi and Chembur will be provided under the project together with the
provision of well water for flushing purposes and drilling of tube wells
within the Greater Bombay Municipal Area.

ANNEX 1
Page 8
Sanitation
30.     The project includes a low cost sanitation component to provide pour
flush latrine facilities in outlying fringe areas of the Greater Bombay
metropolitan area.
Middle Vaitarna Scheme-Preliminary Engineering
31.     The project also includes the preliminary engineering studies and
site investigations for the Middle Vaitarna scheme which has already been
identified as the least cost development to provide the next water source for
Bombay.
Technical Assistance
32.     The project includes technical assistance to support the following
activities: (a) reduction of waste in the distribution system; (b) project
management; (c) auditing; (d) examination of the economics of recycling
washwater from potable water treatment plants; (e) improving the efficiency
of water and sewerage revenue collections; and (f) review of operating
experience at Versova aerated lagoons.
33.     The principal water supply, sewerage and sanitation components are
scheduled in Annex 3.

THIRD BOMBAY WATER AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
Project Planning And Control Coordinator
Position Description
1.     The Project Planning and Control Coordinator must have demonstrated
knowledge of project planning and control techniques using network-based
management systems, including PERT and CPM. The coordinator also should have
demonstrated experience in designing and implementing such systems ir con-
struction projects of coparable size and complexity as the proposed Third
Bombay Water and Sewerage Project.
2.     The Coordinator will be assigned fuLl time to the BMC for the dura-
tion of the Third Water and Sewerage Project and will report directly to the
GNC Municipal AdministrL -.
*  3.  The Coordinator will establish and supervise a project planning and
control cell within the WSSD. This cell wiLl comprise from 3 to 5 full time
staff repesenting appropriate engineering, financial and administrative
disciplines. This staff will be assigned from within the WSSD with the
approval of the Coordinator.
4.     If the Coordinator is from a consulting firm with support resources
in project planning and control, it is expected such resources would be drawn
upon from time to time as required and agreed to by the Municipal
Administratol.
5.     Major responsibilities of the Coordinator will include:
(a) Working with project engineers and contractors to develop a project
Work Breakdown Structure (WBS). This structure will serve to
identify individual work packages upon which subsequent network
activities will be based. The WBS also will serve as the basis for
a companion cost monitoring system to be developed by WSSD;
(b) Developiug PERT networks for controlling project schedules, based
upon the WBS, to be used as a basis for project monitoring, reporting
and control. These networks should include selected miiestone events
to facilitate project control;

(c) Developing and documenting forms and procedures for monitoring
project schedules. The reporting system should be on a reporting-
by-exception basis whereby detailed reports should be supplied only
when activities are deviating from planned schedules. Reporting for
current activities should be on a monthly basis, with those current
activities, which are on the critical path, being on a weekly basis;
(d)  Updating the critical path of project activities on a monthly basis,
and notifying project engineers when their activities fall on the
critical path and require weekly reporting;
(e) Updating PERT network as necessary on a quarterly basis;
(f)  Assessing weekly and monthly progress reports to determine problem
areas, their likely impact on initial project performance;
(g)  Assessing alternative courses of corrective action and reco mmending a

INDIA
THIRD BOMBAY WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
Major Assumptions Underlying Financial Projections
Revenues
1.      A tariff increase of 30X will become effective in FY 1986 to sar;sfy
the financial covenant of the Second Project. Additional tariff increE _s of
40Z each will become effective in the years in which works are commissioned
under the Second and Third Projects, FY 1988 and FY 1993.
2.      Table A depicts the daily water demand and supply patterns upon which
revenue calculations have been based. Transmission and distribution leakage
is assumed to be 23%.
3.      Table B depicts the areas in Bombay to be sewered.  New sewerage
connections are assumed to be provided in the suburbs over a four year period
beginning in FY 1988, which will result in increased revenue due to the
method of assessment changing from a rateable value basis to metered
consumption.
4.      Tables C and D depicts the annual water and sewerage charges that
will be derived from the assumee water demand and supply patterns, and from
the assumed expansion of sewerage connections.  An increase of Rs 50 million
per year has been assumed for the rateable value base.
5.      Table E sufmarizes assumed revenues, based upon current tariffs,
derived from the assumptions of Tables A through D.
Operating Costs
6.      Table F depicts assumed direct operating costs.  An inflation rate
of eight percent per annum has been used for operating costs based upon the
observed historical rate, after isolating the effects of salary grade revi-
sions. The additional water available on commissioning for the Second and
Third Projects will affect operating costs. These effects have been taken
into account in the appropriate years. The additional costs relate to power,
staff and other additional requirements for water and sewage services. Addi-
tional power consumption and chemicals are based on units required for the
increase in water supply. Additional staff requirements have been provided
for, and grade revision for staff salaries has been included in FY 1985.

7.      Depreciation of fixed assets is based on the straight-line method,
using a 40 year asset life.
Working Capital
8.      Minimum cash requirement is assumed to be two months operating and
capital expenditures.
9.      Accounts receivables, other than those from customers, are assumed to
represent three months of advanced capital expenditures. Customer accounts
receivable are predicated on collection efficiencies of 77X in FY 1985, 80Z
in FY 1986, 83Z in FY 1987, and 85Z thereafter.
10.     Inventory and stores are assumed to be 1OZ of capital expenditures
and 25Z of annual expenditures for chemicals and repair parts.
11.     Accounts payable is assumed to represent two months of capital
expenditures, direct operating costs and administrative expenses.
