Project was reviewed for Quality at Entry and Quality Assurance Group. While quality at entry was
evaluated as highly satisfactory, the quality of supervision in 2000 was deemed to be unsatisfactory. As a
result of this review, the project team adopted certain changes in supervision strategy, reverted the
negative tendencies in implementing the project, which allowed to achieve the stated project objectives.

3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry

3.1 Original Objective:

The objective of the Project was to improve management of solid waste through measures which would
improve environmental quality, contain contamination of ground water and create new financial
arrangements for recovery of the cost of solid waste services.

The project objective was clear and realistic. It was in line with both national priorities and the Country
Assistance Strategy of 1994, and was based on extensive field visits jointly conducted by Latvian and
World Bank specialists.

3.2 Revised Objective:

The project Objective was not revised

3.3 Original Components:

Component                                               Cost;             Rating
Remediation of existing landfill                        $3,400,000.00        S
Technical and operational improvements                  $7,100,000.00        S
Gas collection and energy production                    $7,300,000.00        S
Managerial improvements                                 $1,600,000.00        S

3.4 Revised Components:

The project was not restructured and the substance of components was not revised. However, the specific
activities were adjusted to reflect the changing circumstances in order to achieve the project objectives. For

example, in order to comply with EU-Regulations, the Government decided that more stringent rules should
be applied to prevent leakage of untreated leachate into groundwater. Therefore, lining of the energy cells
with polyethylene membrane was included in addition to the already planned clay liner. Moreover, the
project was able to finance construction of more energy cells than originally planned (seven, rather than
only four).

3.5 Quality at Entry:

QAG reviewed the project quality at entry and judged it to be highly satisfactory.

4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs

4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
The Project has achieved all its stated objectives. The Project has resulted in a state-of-the-art municipal
solid waste management facility, and has already demonstrated how an obsolete and environmentally
problematic site can be converted into an environmentally sound facility providing services at an affordable
cost for inhabitants of Riga. The current cost to customers is about US$ 14.5/ton, compared with about
US$ 30/ton if a traditional waste disposal site meeting Western-European standards would have been built.
(See more under Section 4.4)

Other important results of the Project include arresting ongoing ground and surface water contamination,
treatment of collected leachate to a level, which in some cases is even higher than the background values for
surrounding surface water, and the large reduction in emission of greenhouse gases. Over the lifetime of
the Project, calculated at 25 years, the estimated reduction of Carbon Dioxide (CO ) equivalent is about 5.5
                                                                                     2
million tons. At appraisal this figure was estimated to be 5.85 million tons.

4.2 Outputs by components:
The main outputs of the Project by component are as follows:

i) Remediation of existing disposal site: The dump, which has been in use since 1965, has been completely
remediated, covered by soil, and revegetated. Leachate from that part of the landfill, which earlier drained
into the groundwater, is now collected and treated in accordance with both Latvian and international
regulations.

ii) Technical and operational improvements to meet "western" sanitary landfill requirements:          These
improvements include lining the bottom of the energy cells to enable complete collection of leachate;
treatment of the leachate; collection of landfill gas containing methane; and burning the methane to reduce
the emission of global warming constituents.

iii) Establishment of a sorting line for separation of recyclable materials and arranging for storage of
separated material as well as hazardous waste: This activity has been subcontracted to a company linked
to "Green Point" organization, which operates on the site with mobile sorting equipment. This company
has contracted all the remaining scavengers, who now have employee status and are paid on a monthly
basis, working several days a week on shift system. In parallel, the major waste hauling company
promotes waste separation at source - more than 5000 containers for various types of sorted waste (e.g.
glass, plastic, organic waste, paper, metals) are placed throughout Riga. Such a practice significantly
contributes to delivery of "cleaner" waste and to extended lifetime of the energy cells.

iv) Establishment of a modern waste management technology based on energy cells for enhanced



                                                      - 3 -

degradation of easily biodegradable waste: The energy cells (designed to be 10) are being gradually phased
in, and the last one will become operational in 2007. At the completion of the Bank supported activities, 7
energy cells have been implemented, as compared to only 4 cells according to the SAR, which indicates that
the implementation actually is ahead of schedule.

v) Collection of landfill gas: Landfill gas with a methane content of about 50% or more is collected from
both the old waste pile and the newly established energy cells. The collection of gas from the energy cells
is gradually increasing, and the amount is on par with the forecast made at appraisal. There are 166 gas
wells on the old waste pile, of which only approximately 120 function as expected. Therefore, the gas
collection from the old waste pile is below expectation due to a number of problems with installed gas wells
as well as collection pipes. Getlini Eko's own staff, after training under the SIDA financed technical
assistance, have started to restore malfunctioning gas wells and will during 2005 establish new wells to
replace those which are not repairable. As a result of research in the framework of the technical assistance,
29 wells have been revitalized, while 16-20 wells will be closed and replaced by new ones, equipment
procured under the loan.

vi) On-site generation of electricity by use of gas engines with direct delivery to the grid: Since the gas
yield in energy cells is steadily increasing, it is expected that the 5MW capacity of the Electricity
Conversion Unit (ECU) will be reached during 2006, even without all designed cells being connected to it.
Therefore, the management of Getlini Eko will need to make a decision on increasing the capacity of ECU
to at least 7 MW in the near future, as the procurement and installation of additional gas engine/s will take
about one and a half year. However, Getlini Eko will be in position to finance this investment from its own
resources. The capacity might need to be even further increased to utilize the forecasted amount of landfill
gas, but it should be left to Getlini Eko management's decision if this additional investment is justified with
regard to expected sale of electricity beyond the capacity of 7 MW.

vii) Technical and Managerial assistance through twining arrangements to enable the staff of the landfill to
efficiently operate the waste processing system and to achieve maximum revenues from generated landfill
gas and the separated by-products: Twining arrangement was financed by SIDA, and the partners of
Getlini Eko were Nordvästra Skånes Renhållnings AB (NSR) and Sweco. During the Project the twining
partners helped Getlini Eko in these particular areas. The original arrangement was extended until June
2004 to allow for additional work in solving the problems of nonfunctional gas wells in the old landfill.

Furthermore, the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) provided technical assistance during
the first part of Project implementation, assisting Getlini Eko in reviewing detailed design documents and
tender documents. The CIDA consultants also provided advice regarding the physical implementation and
supervision for the initial phase of the Project. Since the technology of gas collection was very new, it took
time and effort to apply this advice in practice.

4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
The economic analysis of the Project, in particular the net present value (NPV) and the economic rate of
return (ERR) is derived from the financial cost-benefit analysis, with several adjustments on both the cost
and the revenue sides. On the cost side, VAT payments on the investments have been excluded, as has the
subsidy payment to the Stopinu Pagasts community. On the revenue side, three sets of adjustments have
been made. First, the sales of electricity have been valued at the import parity price of LVL 13.00/MWh
(US$ 24.07/MWh) which are significantly below the financial price (US$63.61/MWh). Second, the
intangible environmental benefits in the form of captured methane gas have been factored in. Full details of
the assumptions and calculations, as well as a comparison with the SAR are presented in Annex 3, Part 1.
Third, the cost savings from not closing the Getlini site as a result of the project have also been added to the



                                                      - 4 -

benefits stream. Without the project, following the Cabinet of Ministers Decree passed at the beginning of
the project preparation, the Getlini site would have been closed and a new site developed.                The
corresponding costs, amounting to investment costs of US$ 4.02 million and post-closure operational costs
of US$ 0.99 million from 2004 onwards, were therefore avoided by the project which enabled waste
management operations to continue at the Getlini site. These costs savings, however, were not taken into
account at appraisal in the economic and financial analysis of the project.

In large part because of these cost savings, the result of the economic analysis is more favorable than that
at appraisal: the ERR is 18.45% against the 15% shown in the SAR, while NPV at a discount rate of 10%
is US$ 6.5 million.

A sensitivity analysis similar to that for the FRR assuming a 25% increase in waste disposal fees and in the
import parity price for electricity, improves the ERR to 20.44%. Increased waste disposal fee and
electricity tariffs are very likely to become effective as of 2006 and the financial and economic performance
of the Project would then improve further.

4.4 Financial rate of return:

conducted from two perspectives: either from the company's point of view or from the Riga City Council
perspective. The former is comparable to the SAR financial analysis, while the latter is comparable with
the ICR economic analysis presented in section 4.3.

The financial analysis from the company's point of view is based on the company's cash flow projections,
corrected for the pre-project situation. This means that operating costs and revenues from the disposal
operation before the start of project implementation need to be deducted from the respective expenses and
revenues streams. The cost stream includes the investments in the Project and the continuing annual
investments assumed at the level of US$ 250,000, as well as the investment in the 2 MW generating
capacity. A residual value of 15% of the project's investment has been introduced in year 2025. Full
details of the assumptions and the calculation, as well as a comparison with the SAR are in Annex 3, Part 2
.

The results of the analysis show that the financial rate of return is 9.85%. The NPV at 10% is almost zero
(negative US$ 198,000). This compares to SAR estimates of 11.93% FRR, and NPV at 10% discount rate
was estimated to be US$ 2.13 million. There are various explanations for the lower FRR relative to SAR
estimates: the principal factor is the delay in the start of normal electricity production which substantially
reduced the income from electricity sales during 2003. As indicated in the analysis of the SAR, the FRR
was particularly sensitive to this variable, as a one year delay in electricity benefits was shown to reduce
the FRR by 2.06% from 11.93% to 9.87%. The other reason for the lower FRR is the fact that operational
and administrative costs were clearly underestimated; there has been a dramatic "catching-up" phenomenon
in wages, salaries and cost of services since 1997. Another but minor negative factor is the disappearance
of sorted waste as a source of additional revenues; it was estimated at US$ 200,000/year in the SAR. A
positive factor is the higher price paid for electricity sold to Latvenergo, at an actual price of US$
63.61/MWh compared to US$ 48.15/MWh at appraisal (actual of LVL 34.35/MWh compared to LVL
26.00/MWh at appraisal).

A sensitivity analysis has been carried out, assuming an increase in benefits. In fact, the probability of
both higher electricity sales prices and increased waste disposal tariffs seem quite high. Discussions with



                                                       - 5 -

staff of Getlini Eko, as well as with the Public Utilities Commission and the Riga City Public Service
Regulator have confirmed the likelihood of both higher electricity sales prices to Latvenergo and increased
waste disposal tariffs. Regarding the waste disposal tariffs, which are currently invoiced on the basis of
cubic meters, new tariffs are likely to be introduced towards end-2005 or early 2006 in conjunction with
invoicing based on measured weight, rather than on eye-estimated volume which has been the practice so
far. It has therefore been assumed that both prices would increase by 25% to be applied from 2006
onwards. The calculation based on these increases shows that the FRR would increase from 9.85% to an
estimated 12.36%, and the NPV at 10% would contribute US$ 3.6 million to the company's long-term
results. Finally, assuming a discount rate of 6% rather than 10%, since 6% is closer to the opportunity
cost of capital observed during that period, would result in a positive NPV of US$ 8.3 million.

To be comparable with the ICR economic analysis, we have also performed the financial analysis from the
Riga City Council point of view, instead of the company point of view. Practically, this means that the cost
savings resulting from not closing the Getlini site in the "with-project" situation are added to the stream of
benefits. From the Riga City Council point of view, the FRR becomes significantly higher at 21.95%, and
the NPV using the 10% discount rate comes to US$ 6.5 million. The Financial internal rate of return
(21.95%) is higher than the economic internal rate of return because the financial price of electricity is
significantly higher than the economic price. The environmental benefits which accrue late in the project
are too discounted to compensate for the lower economic price of electricity.

4.5 Institutional development impact:
Institutional development impact is substantial. The project triggered the creation of a Procurement Unit
(PPU) in Riga City Council and the establishment of a new company Getlini Eko for implementation of the
Project and subsequent operation of the landfill. Both entities at the end of the project are mature and fully
up to the tasks they have been entitled to perform: the Loan and GEF Grant proceeds have been fully
disbursed and Getlini Eko operates without losses and meets the strict environmental standards. The PPU
has gained experience and capacity to implement complex large scale projects, which is of high value to
Riga City Council, which is involved in implementation of a number of projects, especially those financed
by EU structural funds.

The years of project implementation proved that creation of a new company can be a slow and painful
process, requiring a lot of effort and patience before the first results start to appear. In that respect, a
twining arrangement with a Swedish partner was very useful - both in technical and managerial terms.

5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome

5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:

There were no factors outside Government or implementing agency's control which would have negatively
affected project implementation.

5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:

There were two issues subject to Government control which negatively affected practical implementation of
the Project right after formal effectiveness. First, during preparation and early stages of implementation,
the relationship between Riga City and Stopinu Pagasts, where the Getlini site is located, was strained.
This prevented effective decision making and implementation of adopted decisions. The second, the
management of the newly created Getlini Eko and the Getlini-2 company, the old operator of the landfill,
failed to work together productively.          To aggravate the situation, in the beginning of project
implementation, the management team of the newly created Getlini Eko was not committed to the Project.


                                                      - 6 -

Both these factors delayed implementation for almost 2 years. The Government through its Ministry of
Environment and Ministry of Economy, stepped in and undertook decisive actions in order to streamline
implementation. The Government's interventions helped to resolve the disagreements between the two
municipal governments, as well as to find qualified individuals to manage Getlini Eko. As soon as the
detailed design was finalized and the right skill mix for the Getlini Eko team found, implementation became
smooth. However, the Project closing date had to be extended for 18 months to allow for completion of the
works.

The Government also modified the relevant legislation so that the Getlini Eko could sell the "green" energy
it is producing to the electricity grid at a tariff equal to average sales prices.This contributes to profitable
operation of Getlini Eko.

5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:

At early stages of implementation, the management team at Getlini Eko was not fully committed to the
project: the procurement decisions, which had to be taken in close cooperation with PPU were significantly
delayed. At one point the management of the company intended to abandon the agreed technical solutions
and to opt for mechanical waste sorting and waste incineration. After the Government intervened and
replaced the management, the implementation of the Project and operations at Getlini Eko substantially
improved, which allowed for achievement of the stated project objectives.

5.4 Costs and financing:

The overall cost, including contingencies, at appraisal was US$ 24.35 million, of which US$ 19.56 million
was allocated for investments, and the remaining cost for interest during construction and operational costs
for Getlini Eko. Despite the fact that the Project encountered additional costs in order to comply with EU
regulations, there were no cost overruns. The Project has also managed to include both more costly
investments for groundwater protection (polyethylene liner) and construction of several additional energy
cells, which originally were not foreseen for financing by the Project funds.

6. Sustainability

6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:

The sustainability is rated as highly likely. At the end of the Project, Getlini Eko is a profitable company
with a competent management team. To date, Getlini Eko has been able to secure a steady stream of waste
to be delivered to landfill.      The waste stream will be increasing over the next few years, as the
environmental authorities will not be extending operational licenses to small and inadequately equipped
landfills around Riga. This however, will require additional effort on the part of authorities in charge of
environmental compliance enforcement, so that illegal dumping of waste is prevented.

The Project team is confident that the Office of the Riga City Public Service Regulator will be adjusting the
tariffs in a timely manner so that these reflect real cost of waste handling and allow for continued
sustainable operations of Getlini Eko. Similarly, the Government is committed to support production of
"green" energy, and the existing tariffs are favorable to the company. It is also very likely that if needed,
additional land adjacent to the Getlini site can be acquired, so that already made investments in machinery,
buildings and infrastructure can be further utilized above the current calculated lifetime of about 25 years.

The financial situation in Getlini Eko is good enough to attract private sector investors, should such a
decision be made by its shareholders.

6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:

There was no need for any specific transition arrangements, as the site had been in regular operation since
Project implementation started in 1998.

7. Bank and Borrower Performance

Bank
7.1 Lending:

Bank's performance in identifying and helping Latvian counterparts to prepare the Project was satisfactory.
The proposed method for management of solid waste was new for Latvia and only minimal expertise was
available from similar operations abroad.        The Project team confirmed the economic, financial and
environmental viability of the Project but did not foresee all possible risks, in particular, institutional and
social. In the event difficulties that emerged were resolved as part of the implementation support efforts.

As mentioned above, the Quality Assurance Group rated the Project quality at entry highly satisfactory,
which only proves that not all the potential issues can be identified during preparation, especially in the
country with dynamically developing legal system and economy.

7.2 Supervision:

Based on the advice of the Quality Assurance Group which rated supervision as unsatisfactory in 2000, the
overall supervision effort is satisfactory. The Project Team took into account QAG recommendations, and
was able to support implementation effectively toward successful completion. As a direct recommendation
of QAG, the problems of scavengers were addressed, and most of them are now employed by a contractor
in charge of sorting the waste in the landfill.

Bank management, representing both Sector and Country departments, on several occasions paid visits to
Latvia in an effort to help the project team in streamlining implementation.

7.3 Overall Bank performance:

Based on the above, the overall Bank performance is rated as satisfactory.

Borrower
7.4 Preparation:

Government of Latvia was fully committed to the project, as the solid waste management has been one of
its top environmental priorities since early nineties. The Municipal Solid Waste Management Project was
conceived as the first regional waste management facility in a nation wide solid waste management program
"500-", which called for the establishment of an efficient waste management system with only few modern
landfills, and aimed at closure of nearly 500 small non-sanitary dump sites. In order to implement the
"500-" program, the Government, acting through its Ministries of Environment and Economy was the
driving force in preparing the Project

7.5 Government implementation performance:

During implementation Government remained highly committed to Project objectives and was instrumental



                                                     - 8 -

in resolving the emerging problems.

7.6 Implementing Agency:

Over the years of implementation, the performance of implementing agency, the Riga City Council and that
of Getlini Eko significantly varied from time to time. Two sets of management teams at Getlini Eko had to
be replaced in order to secure commitment for achievement of original project objectives. The Project team
maintains that had more skilled individuals been appointed to manage the Getlini Eko from the beginning,
the project implementation process would have been smoother and possibly no extension of the closing date
would have been needed.

7.7 Overall Borrower performance:

The overall Borrower performance at the end of project is rated as satisfactory.

8. Lessons Learned

Political Problems during Project Preparation and Implementation.
The rivalry between the two municipalities, the Riga City and the Stopinu Pagasts, was an impediment
during Project preparation, and unfortunately continued during the first years of implementation. While the
political problems seemed to be sorted out just before negotiations, these problems resurfaced again during
the first phase of implementation, and resulted in substantial implementation delays and negative press. It
became evident, that the negative press coverage to a large extent was orchestrated by the management
operating the Getlini site before the Project was approved and implementation started. This also had the
result that neighboring residents complained about the Project design as well as the creation of Getlini Eko,
which at that time was about to take over the ownership of the site and operational responsibility from the
former operator company Getlini-2.

Given this lesson, the team would recommend for future projects in a similar situation, to make greater
efforts to achieve political consensus at the grass-root level. It should be mentioned, that this experience
was very helpful in the preparation of the second waste management operation in Latvia, the Liepaja
Region Solid Waste Management Project. Among other things the following actions were initiated as a
requirement for starting preparation: (a) a consensus among all municipalities in the Liepaja Region to
establish a common regional waste management facility, (b) immediate launching of information campaign
for the public, and repeated meetings in all the municipalities; (c) establishment of a special office in
Liepaja City in order to provide information about the project; and (d) on a permanent basis a member of
the Ministry of Environment was assigned to participate in the preparation activities. As a result of these
actions that project has not encountered any problem at all, and has not received any bad publicity.

Managerial Problems during first phase of Implementation.
As mentioned earlier, the appointment of management team by Riga City Council, could have been done in
a more efficient way.      The profiles for different managers were clearly elaborated in the Business
Development Plan for Getlini Eko, but unfortunately not followed. Clearly, the Bank could have taken a
stronger position when reviewing the staff, but thought it was an issue for Riga City Council. Given the
results from the first years of implementation, the appointment of leading staff should be done in time for
negotiations.

Adherence to national design standards
Additional difficulty in the starting phase of the project was caused by differences between Latvian and



                                                      - 9 -

Swedish detailed design standards, because the engineering consultant prepared the drawings in accordance
with the latter. As a result, Latvian authorities were reluctant to issue the construction permit, as the
designs did not match the requirements of respective Latvian standards. Therefore, in order to avoid
misunderstandings and delays, it is important that both Bank teams and consultants have a full
understanding of valid national design and construction requirements before the actual design process
starts.

            1. Background

            Latvia decided in 1998, based on the national environmental plan, to finance a
            project that would introduce a more efficient and sustainable solid waste
            management in Riga. The World Bank has provided loan and grant financing for
            needed investments. A grant financing agreement between Sida, Riga City
            Council, Getlini Eco Ltd and the Latvian Government was signed in February,
            1998.

            2. Project goal

            The project goal has been to develop Getlini disposal site into a modern facility
            with minimum impact on the surrounding environment. The Sida financed project
            components have involved investments in leachate treatment, technical support
            and institutional development.

            3. Results

            According to the grant financing agreement the project should have been
            completed by end of 2003 but the agreement had to be extended with one year in
            order to finalise all activities.

            a) Treatment of leachate, SBR, performed by YIT VMT

            YIT was contracted in 2001 for the construction of a leachate treatment facility.
            The project has faced some problems and misunderstandings. The expected
            COD-levels can for example not be fulfilled since the initial idea that only leachate
            from the new part of the site would be treated was changed. The incoming flow
            has further turned out to be less than what the treatment facility was designed for.
            Also the construction of the inlet has been problematic where the directions from
            YIT were not followed, which resulted in the inlet being rebuilt two times.
                                              - 16 -

- 17 -

Problems have been corrected and the facility was handed over to Getlini Eco in
June 2004. Getini Eco will receive support from YIT during the guarantee period.

b) Technical assistance NSR, start 2000

The TA-part has worked well all through the project. NSR has been a much
appreciated discussion partner and has assisted Getlini Eco within a number of
areas, e g recycling and handling of hazardous waste. The combined training
both in Sweden and Latvia is considered to have been valuable. NSR has also,
during 2004, supported the training of staff on optimisation of gas extraction,
which will have a direct positive impact on Getlini Eco's economy.

c) Managerial assistance Sweco, start 2002

This component has experienced a lot of changes and the results are not as
good as expected. Changes within management during project implementation
are partly the reason for the weak outcome. The original idea of management
support changed into support to the development of plans on how to optimise the
gas extraction (in close co-operation with NSR).

d) General

The project results have been mixed, some parts have worked very well others
poorly. The changing of project officers within Sida more or less every year has
decreased Sida's management capacity. The support from the World Bank has
been positive in following-up also Sida funded components at times when Sida's
involvement has been low.

Management within Getlini Eco has been changed three times during the course
of the project, something which also has effected the project implementation. The
present management team seems to be very competent and there are reasons to
believe that Getlini Eco will continue to develop in a positive way.

Annex 3. Economic Costs and Benefits

     Part 1 - Economic Rate of Return (ERR)

     Section 1 contains a resume of the analysis and conclusions of the SAR, including the major
     assumptions; and section 2 deals with the revised economic analysis based on project costs,
     excluding taxes and duties and incremental benefits due to the project. Up to the year 2004, the
     figures are actuals, thereafter forecasts until the year 2025. All figures are expressed in US$ at the
     uniform exchange rate of LVL 0.54 to US$ 1.

     Section 1 ­ The SAR (chapter 5, section D and Annex 13)

     The Economic Rate of Return (ERR)
     Total project costs were derived from the project feasibility study prepared by Sweco Consultants
     and consisted of capital costs, capitalized recurrent costs during implementation, as well as design,
     training and technical assistance.        Investment costs included physical contingencies only.
     Recurrent costs were also calculated by the Consultants; these were only capitalized up to the year
     1999 and shown as a separate cost stream afterwards. Adjustments were made for VAT and social
     welfare taxes on wages and salaries. Project costs so calculated for the Option 4 retained (gas
     used for electricity generation) amounted to US$ 19,627 million.

     The Project's benefits were sub-divided into two categories: tangible and intangible benefits.
     Tangible benefits include revenues from landfill gas collection, incremental revenues from
     improved sorting and global environmental benefits from reduced emissions of methane. The
     revenues from gas production were valued at international or border price for electricity and
     incremental sales of recovered waste materials were estimated at US$ 100,000. Values for global
     environmental benefits were derived by using internationally accepted values for carbon dioxide
     emissions and converted into methane equivalents by using a factor that reflects the respective
     impacts of the two as greenhouse gases.

     Intangible benefits consist of ground- and surface water protection, occupational and health
     improvements as well as a positive aesthetic and odor impacts through the covering of the landfill.

     The ERR analysis for the base-case of Option 4 -- the investment option selected for
     implementation based on extraction of LFG and generation of electricity -- showed an internal rate
     of return of 15% when including the global environmental benefits, and 4% when these benefits
     were excluded. A sensitivity analysis was carried out to test the robustness of the Project against
     variations in investment costs and benefits; the results showed the project to be relatively
     insensitive to these changes, with the ERR decreasing with at most one or two percentage points
     for increases in costs or decreases in revenues. The worst result, an ERR of 11% was calculated
     for the case where benefits were delayed by one to two years after the completion of the
     investments; but this event was considered unlikely to occur.

     The Net Present Value (NPV)
     The calculation of the NPV discounted the cost-benefit streams at 10% and compared the various
     options. As with the ERR, Option 4 showed the highest NPV and this calculation also confirmed
     the relative lack of sensitivity to increases in costs and the sharp decrease of returns in case the
     start of revenues is delayed by one or two years.

         Conclusion

Both the ERR and the NPV calculations, when taking into account the global environmental benefits of the
project, showed good rates of return and confirmed the choice of Option 4 among the four options analyzed
in the feasibility study. Delays in the generation of benefits were identified as the most critical events
affecting the rates of return.

Section 2 - The ICR

 The analysis is summarized in Table 4 and the results are based on the following assumptions:

                          component                            assumption
 Period covered                                                The analysis is carried out over 25 years, from
                                                               2000 to 2025, as in the SAR (from 1998 to
                                                               2022).
 Economic costs                                                These are the financial costs, Table 3
                                                               excluding Value-added tax and the subsidy
                                                               payment to Stopinu Pagasts.
 Economic benefits                                             These include incremental financial benefits
                                                               from waste disposal, as calculated for the FRR
                                                               in Table 3, and electricity sales at the import
                                                               parity price, currently LVL 13.00/MWh (US$
                                                               24.01/MWh). Furthermore, the Project has
                                                               resulted in incremental cost savings in regard
                                                               to avoided investment and operational costs,
                                                               due to the fact that closure and post-closure
                                                               costs could be avoided.
 Environmental benefits                                        These benefits consist of the reduction of
                                                               methane gas emissions, which are equal to
                                                               projected LFG extraction volumes. The bulk
                                                               of LFG will be consumed in the ECU, with
                                                               any excess being flared. The equivalent
                                                               quantities in CO have been calculated
                                                                                2
                                                               separately and valued at US$ 2.73/ton of CO .
                                                                                                              2
 Residual value                                                Taken at 15% of the project investment



         The results of the analysis are more favorable than those estimated at appraisal: the ERR is
         18.45% against the 15% shown in the SAR, while the NPV at 10% discount rate is US$ 6.5
         million. The reason for the increased ERR is that the cost savings attributable to the project
         (investment and operational costs for remediation and post-closure of the Getlini site were avoided
         as a result of the project) have been included in the economic analysis for the ICR, but were not in
         the ex-ante analysis reported in the SAR. The actual savings are as follows: investment costs US$
         4.02 million, and operational costs for post closure operation US$ 0.99 million from 2004 and
         onwards.

         A sensitivity analysis similar to that carried out for the FRR ­ a 25% increase in waste disposal

              fees and in the import parity price for electricity ­ improves the ERR, to 20.44%. Increased waste
              disposal fee and electricity tariffs are very likely to become effective as of 2006 and the financial
              and economic performance of the Project would then improve further.

Part 2 ­ Financial Rate of Return

            Section 1 contains a short resume of the analysis and conclusions of the SAR, including the major
            assumptions; and section 2 deals with the financial analysis based on actual Project expenditures
            and income up to the year 2004 and on forecasts until the year 2025. The SAR resume is in US$,
            whereas the figures of section 2 are expressed in LVL, the currency in which the annual accounts
            are published; where appropriate conversion into US$ is made at the agreed standard exchange rate
            of LVL 0.54= US$ 1.00.

            Section 1 ­ The SAR (Chapter 5, section F and Annex 14)

            The Financial Rate of Return (FRR)
            Total project costs were derived from the Project preparation study prepared by Sweco Consultants
            and consisted of capital costs, capitalized recurrent costs during implementation, as well as design,
            training and technical assistance.                  To these were added physical and price contingencies.
            Recurrent costs were also calculated by the Consultants; these were only capitalized up to the year
            1999 and shown as a separate cost stream afterwards. Project costs so calculated amounted to
            US$ 19.983 million, rounded to US$ 20.0 million; this figure excludes interest during construction



                                                                     - 27 -

      and recurrent operational costs.

      The Project's estimated incremental revenues consisted of the sale of electricity, generated from the
      recovered landfill gas, and incremental sales of recovered waste materials, estimated at US$
      100,000. Electricity sales were calculated on the basis of estimated landfill gas production,
      converted into electricity using standard conversion factors. This production was valued at the
      price of US$ 48.148/MWh, a special concessionary price for renewable energy fixed by
      Government at the time. Finally, the residual or salvage value of the investment was assumed at
      15% of the investment, excluding design, training and technical assistance.

      The FRR analysis for the base-case scenario showed a FRR of 11.93%. This rate was considered
      satisfactorily for an environmental protection project, in particular as no increase in tariffs or
      disposal fees was necessary to achieve this return.

      A sensitivity analysis was carried out to test the robustness of the Project against variations in
      costs and benefits; the results are summarized in the table below:

                                                                     REVENUES
                COSTS                       Revenues-15%             Base Case              Revenues
                                                                                           +15%
Investment +10%                                7.98%                   10.50%                     13.39%
Recurrent costs + 10%                          8.63%                   11.39%                     14.55%
Base Case                                      9.21%                   11.93%                     15.05%
Revenues delayed 1 year                        7.63%                    9.87%                     12.37%



      In the base-case scenario the delay in revenues by one year, assuming all investments have been
      carried out, has the biggest impact on the FRR, reducing it from 11.93% to 9.87%. The 10%
      increase in costs, respectively investments and recurrent costs, has a much smaller impact and even
      these results were considered acceptable. Even the worst scenario -- all investments realized,
      revenues delayed by one year, coupled with a 15% drop in overall electricity sales -- reduced the
      FRR to 7.63%; however, the probability of this event occurring was considered to be low. The
      best scenario of unchanged costs and a 15% increase in electricity prices was considered to have a
      reasonable probability; the FRR in that case would be 15.05%.

      The Net Present Value (NPV)

      The NPV is the present value of future cash flows from the Project, minus the initial investments.
      It represents the contribution of an investment to the value of the firm and the NPV is considered
      the primary decision making tool of financial management in the private sector. For this reason its
      calculation was included in the analysis, using a discount rate of 10%. Applying this discounting
      procedure to the cost-benefit flows resulted in a positive NPV; and indicated that the investment
      would yield a positive return over the cut-off rate of 10% and would contribute US$ 2.13 million
      to the value of the company.

      Conclusion of the SAR

      The FRR and the NPV analyses of the Project carried out during appraisal indicated that in the

base-case scenario the environmental protection project would yield a satisfactory financial rate of
return and a NPV, equivalent to what could be expected from a normal productive investment.

The sensitivity analysis, incorporating increases in costs and reductions in benefits, indicates that
the Project would be particularly sensitive to a one-year delay in benefits after the initial
investments have been made. An increase of investment costs by 10% would also have a strong
negative impact on the returns from the Project, but this event was considered to be of lesser risk,
as relatively high physical contingencies had been incorporated in the cost estimates.

Section 2 - the ICR

Financial Rate of Return

Two sets of financial analysis can be conducted depending on whether one adopts the perspective
of the company managing the Getlini site, or that of the owner, the Riga City Council. The
difference between the two approaches is whether or not the cost savings attributable to the project
(the investment and operation costs avoided as the Getlini site remains open) is taken into
consideration or not. From the company's perspective, the cost savings are not taken into account,
and in this case, the ex-post/ICR financial analysis is comparable to the analysis conducted ex-ante
in the SAR. By not taking into account these cost savings, the ICR financial analysis is not strictly
comparable to the economic analysis. To make it comparable, the cost savings attributable to the
project need to be taken into consideration, and correspond to the financial analysis from the point
of view of the Riga City Council. Both sets of analysis have been performed, and we present in
greater detail and in the Table 3 the financial analysis from the company's point view.

The calculation from the company's financial perspective is summarized in Table 3 and uses the
standard comparison of project costs and incremental benefits which can be attributed to the
Project -excluding, as explained above, the costs savings attributable to the project (i.e., the
investment and operation costs avoided as the Getlini site remains open). The analysis has been
carried out over a 25 year period from 2000 ­ 2025 (in the SAR the period was from 1998 to
2022).

The Project's costs are summarized in Table 1 and include the realized investments, including
taxes and duties, as well as all technical assistance and interest paid during construction. The
figures have been derived from PPU statistics and show total costs of US$ 21,805,800.

As for operational, maintenance and administrative costs, the base figures have been derived from
the audited accounts of Getlini Eko for the years 2000 to 2004 and from projections for the period
2005-2025 made by Bank staff, in conjunction with Getlini Eko.             The detailed cash flow
projections are shown in Table 2 and are discussed in Part 3 below.

As the present costs include the continued operation of the site as a landfill operation, the
pre-project costs of the year 1999 associated with this activity have been excluded from project
costs.

Benefits consist of the waste disposal fees, sale of sorted waste and revenues from electricity
generated from LFG and sold to Latvenergo; details are provided Part 3, Section 2 below. As the
pre-project operational costs of 1999 have been deducted from Getlini Eko's projected operational
and administrative costs, so the revenues from waste disposal fees and from sorted waste for 1999


                                            - 29 -

have been excluded from the benefit streams. Fees for waste disposal will no doubt be recalculated
on a tonnage basis during 2005 and new tariffs would become operational by early 2006; however,
the current fee structure based on cubic meters has been used in this exercise.

Project design and detailed engineering started in 1998, but implementation proper commenced
only in 2000. The project costs for 1998 and 1999, a total of only US$ 603,300 representing cost
of detailed project design have been added to the investments of the year 2000.

The main assumptions used in the FRR calculation are summarized below. There is no provision
for inflation, so all figures are expressed in 2005 constant terms.

Time span of calculation                        25 years from 2000 to 2025.
Costs                                           Investment costs as per the project accounts; an amount
                                                of LVL 135,000 (US$ 250,000) has been added each
                                                year from 2005 onwards to cover additional investments.
                                                For 2006 a further LVL 810,000 (US$ 1.5 million) has
                                                been provided for the purchase of an additional 2 MW
                                                capacity energy conversion unit.
                                                Direct and administrative costs have been increased in
                                                real terms by around 5% per year, rounded from 2010
                                                onwards.
Benefits                                        Quantities of disposed waste for 2005 are likely to
                                                remain at 2004 levels, thereafter they are assumed to
                                                increase by around 5% to 2009, and then to remain
                                                constant at 1.3 million m until 2020.
                                                                         3


                                                Electricity revenues are based on the most recent LFG
                                                extraction projections by Getlini Eko, valued at the
                                                current average sales price of electricity, as specified in
                                                the Latvenergo convention (LVL 34.35/MWh or US$
                                                63.61/MWh).
                                                Revenues from sorted waste are actually less than before
                                                project implementation and have been ignored in the
                                                analysis.
Residual value                                  Assumed at 15% of the total project costs of US$ 21.8
                                                million and debited to the year 2025.
Exchange rate                                   Fixed at LVL 0.54 to the US$ throughout.



      The results of the analysis show that the financial rate of return is 9.85%. The NPV at 10%
      discount rate is almost zero (negative US$198,000). This compares to SAR estimates of 11.93%
      FRR, and NPV at 10% discount rate of US$ 2.13 million. There are various explanations for the
      lower FRR (and NPV): the principal factor is the delay in the start of normal electricity production
      which substantially reduced the income from electricity sales during 2003. As indicated in the
      analysis of the SAR, the FRR was particularly sensitive to this variable, as a one year delay in
      electricity benefits was shown to reduce the FRR from 11.93% to 9.87%. The other reason for the
      lower FRR is the fact that operational and administrative costs were clearly underestimated; there
      has been a dramatic "catching-up" phenomenon in wages, salaries and cost of services since 1997.
      Another but minor negative factor is the disappearance of sorted waste as a source of additional
      revenues, estimated at US$ 200,000/year in the SAR. A positive factor is the higher price paid for
      electricity sold to Latvenergo, with an actual price of US$ 63.61/MWh compared to US$
      48.15/MWh at appraisal (actual of LVL 34.35/MWh compared to LVL 26.00/MWh at appraisal).


      Discussions with staff of Getlini Eko, as well as with the Public Utilities Commission and the Riga
      City Public Service Regulator have confirmed the likelihood of both higher electricity sales prices
      to Latvenergo and increased waste disposal tariffs. To the extent that Getlini Eko's present sales
      price is the average of Latvenergo's domestic sales prices, the company is bound to benefit from



                                                 - 31 -

                         any local tariff increase.

                         Regarding the waste disposal tariffs, which are currently invoiced on the basis of cubic meters,
                         new tariffs are likely to be introduced towards end-2005 or early 2006 in conjunction with
                         invoicing based on measured weight, rather than on eye-estimated volume which has been the
                         practice so far. It has therefore been assumed that both prices would increase by 25% to be
                         applied from 2006 onwards. The calculation based on these increases shows that the FRR would
                         increase from 9.85% to an estimated 12.36%, and the NPV at 10% would contribute US$ 3.6
                         million to the company's long-term results. Finally, assuming a discount rate of 6% rather than
                         10%, since 6% is closer to the observed opportunity cost of capital observed during that period,
                         would result in a positive NPV of US$ 8.3 million.

                         To be comparable with the economic analysis, we have performed the financial analysis from the
                         Riga City Council, the owner's, point of view, instead of the company point of view. Practically,
                         this means that the cost savings resulting from not closing the Getlini site in the "with-project"
                         situation are added to the stream of benefits. From the Riga City Council's point of view, the FRR
                         becomes significantly higher at 21.95%, and the NPV using the 10% discount rate comes to US$
                         6.5 million. The Financial internal rate of return (21.95%) is higher than the economic internal
                         rate of return (18.45%) because the financial price of electricity is significantly higher than the
                         economic price. The environmental benefits which accrue late in the project are too discounted to
                         compensate for the lower economic price of electricity.

assumptions; and section 2 deals with the financial cash flow projections using audited figures up to 2004
and forecasts until the year 2020. The SAR resume is in US$, whereas the figures of section 2 are
expressed in LVL, the currency in which the annual accounts are published; where appropriate conversion
into US$ is made at the agreed standard exchange rate of LVL 0.54 = US$ 1.00.

Section 1 ­ The SAR (Chapter 4, section E and Annex 7)

The financial analysis of the company is covered in Annex 7 of the SAR and in various tables. Major
assumptions include a price of electricity of LVL 26.00/MWh (US$ 48.18/MWh) and the capitalization of
operational costs during construction. On the expenditure side figure the Project Costs, Operational and
Maintenance and Administration costs of the modern landfill site. Also included were interest and principal
payments of the loans from the World bank and from Riga City Council; company taxes were then at 25%
after a 5 year tax holiday, against 15% to-day without tax holiday.

The results of the analysis in constant terms are shown in Appendix 3, Annex 7 of the SAR. They indicate
comfortable positive cash flows over the entire period, resulting in a cumulative cash flow of nearly US$
19.0 million by 2019 (LVL 10.2 million). The various ratios are all favorable, but the cash flow is to a
large extent constituted by depreciation, while the cash flow after loan repayment drops to very low levels
at the height of loan repayment.

The SAR projections indicated that the company would be able to create a cash flow sufficient to repay the
loans to the World Bank and to RCC, but that overall profitability remained low, primarily as a result of
the assumption that waste disposal tariffs would not be increased and that the project would be
self-financing from the sale of electricity produced with the extracted LFG.

Section 2 ­ The ICR

Table 2 shows the actual cash flows for the years 2000 to 2004, as well as the cash flow forecast for the
period 2005 to 2025. The main assumptions are summarized in the table below: all figures are in LVL
2005 prices and no allowance has been made for inflation.

 Component                                  Assumption


 Quantities of waste                        For 2005 at same level as 2004, some 1.1 million m to increase by
                                                                                                  3


                                            around 5% per year until a level of 1.3 million m has been reached by
                                                                                             3

                                            growth of waste production.

                                           These changes have not been introduced in the analysis.
 Electricity production                    Depends on LFG extraction: Getlini Eko forecasts have been reviewed
                                           by Bank and Getlini Eko staff and a new, higher extraction forecast has
                                           been agreed to.
 Installed energy conversion capacity      At this stage the installed capacity is 5.25 MW, which gives a
                                           maximum production of 41,391 MWh, irrespective of LFG extraction
                                           (the balance will be flared). In 2006 a new engine of 2 MW will be
                                           installed, operational in 2007, which will increase the production to a
                                           maximum of 57,159 MWh.
 Electricity sales                         Fixed at empirical 90% of production.
 Electricity price                         At present and according to the Latvenergo concession the price is the
                                           average sales tariff of LVL 34.35/MWh (US$ 63.61/MWh), to be
                                           applied over 8 years. In view of the inevitable tariff increases of the
                                           next few years, it has been assumed that the present price will be
                                           extended after the expiry of the 8 year concession.
 Recovered waste                           This has been entered at a nominal LVL 1000/year (US$ 1852), but
                                           may well increase as the company opens a sorting area for residents at
                                           the landfill site.
 Costs, operational and administrative     These have been increased by around 5% until 2009 and rounded to
                                           LVL 1.4 million thereafter.
 Other costs                               Primarily the traditional support to Stopinu Pagasts
 Grants                                    Grants received for the project will be written down over a 15 year
                                           period; this accounting procedure increase profits on paper, but not in
                                           real or monetary terms.
 Depreciation                              Increases from LVL 622,000 (US$ 1.15 million) in 2004 to LVL
                                           700,000 (US$ 1.30 million) by 2008.
 World Bank                                Interest and principal calculated on the basis of a 4% interest rate; there
                                           are likely to be fluctuations in these amounts, but in any case the loan
                                           would be repaid by 2016.
 Riga City loan of US$ 6 million           This loan has been converted into equity during 2004.
 Investments                               It has been assumed that Getlini Eko will continue to invest LVL
                                           135,000 (US$ 250,000) per year in energy cells; in addition an amount
                                           of LVL 810,000 (US$ 1.5 million) has been budgeted in 2006 for the
                                           purchase of the 2 MW capacity energy conversion unit.

The forecast shows that the company will be profitable throughout, even after elimination of the grant
write-down of LVL 218,174/year (US$ 404,026). Cash flows will be more than sufficient to cover interest
and principal payments to the World Bank; the conversion of the RCC loan into equity contributes to this
favorable result. The cumulative cash flow would reach almost LVL 30 million (US$ 55.6 million) by
2025; however, this is a long period and lots of events may influence the figures in a negative way. The
most sensitive of these factors are the extraction of LFG from the energy cells, hence electricity production
and the price at which electricity can be sold to Latvenergo.

The table below summarizes the main financial ratios and enables a comparison with the SAR estimates
(the ICR projection goes to 2025, when the ratios have further improved).

 Net profit after interest and taxes, % revenues                  20%      31%        32%       32%

While the cash flow ratios before and after loan repayment are roughly similar, the debt service ratio is
more favorable than projected at appraisal. Depreciation represents less of a share of cash flows than at
appraisal, which is a positive trend, as more cash flow is internally generated. The healthier financial
situation of Getlini Eko at present is also reflected in a higher gross margin as % of revenues, lower
working ratios and above all, much better profit margins.

The present cash flow analysis indicates a strong improvement of the company's financial situation and
outlook compared with appraisal forecasts. The principal reasons are an increase in waste disposal tariffs,
which had been kept constant at appraisal; a higher price paid by Latvenergo for electricity generated by
landfill gas; and the conversion of the RCC loan of US$ 6 million (LVL 3.24 million) into equity. Negative
factors are the virtual disappearance of sorted waste as a source of income and much higher than
anticipated operational costs. Overall, it appears that the project has enabled Getlini Eko to generate
healthy cash flows which on the one hand enable the company to comfortably cover loan repayment to the
World Bank and on the other hand provide resources for future investments.
