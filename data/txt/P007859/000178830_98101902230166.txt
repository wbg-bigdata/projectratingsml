INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF PARAGUAY
FOR THE FOURTH LIVESTOCK CREDIT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Republic of Paraguay for the equivalent of US$10.0 million to help fi-
nance the Fourth Livestock Credit Project. The Loan would have a term of 25
years, including 5 years of grace, at an interest of 8% per annum. The pro-
ceeds of the proposed Loan would be re-lent to the Central Bank's Fondo
Ganadero under the same terms and conditions. The Government would bear
the foreign exchange risk.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic mission visited Paraguay in September, 1973 and again
in February, 1974. The resulting economic report (299a-PA) was distributed
on May 10, 1974. A summary of Country Basic Data is attached as Annex I.
3.        Paraguay is a predominantly agricultural country of about 2.4 million
inhabitants, located in the flat tropical heartland of the South American con-
tinent. After a long period of political and economic turmoil following the
Chaco War (1931-1935), the country's economy recovered in the 1960s and achieved
an average annual growth of 4.6% per annum.during 1962-72. Output growth proved
insufficient to provide adequate employment opportunities, but continued emi-
gration to neighboring Argentina helped to contain the growth of population,
eased the unemployment problem and permitted an improvement of almost one-fifth
in per capita income during the decade. Although per capita income in 1970
was less than one-half of the South American average, its distribution was
about the same as that of the continent. Literacy rates appear to be higher
than those for countries at a similar stage of development notwithstanding
below average educational facilities.
4.        Paraguay is a landlocked country and conducts most of its world
trade through Argentina and Brazil. The high cost of shipping its products
to the nearest seaports has delayed the country from taking full advantages
of its agricultural and labor resources and determined the nature of its
export trade. Paraguay specializes in the production of agricultural and
livestock goods with high unit values. In addition to world market fluctua-
tions, a significant part of the country's exports are dependent on supply
and demand fluctuations in neighboring countries. Paraguayan economic pros-
pects appear to be favorable, however, over the longer term. Extensive areas
of unused land suitable for agropastoral and forestry production provide op-
portunities for large scale colonization and expanded production. Technolo-
gical improvements, now underway, are expected to increase substantially the
productivity of land already under cultivation. The country's vast water



-2-
power resources are expected to provide a plentiful source of cheap energy
and foreign exchange earnings. Additional transportation facilities are
expected to enhance further the competitive position of Paraguay's products
in world markets. Finally, the deepening of agricultural and forestry products
processing industries is expected to continue raising the value-added content
of Paraguayan exports.
5.        Economic growth accelerated in the 1970s. Between 1969 and 1973,
overall output increased at an average rate of 5.5% per annum and, despite a
setback in 1971 resulting from adverse weather conditions, the aggregate pro-
duction target set by the 1971-75 Development Plan was met in 1973. The
Paraguayan economy responded quickly to the stimulus provided by rising world
demand for its export products during the period. The supply response was
facilitated by earlier investments in transportation, official assistance to
mechanize agriculture, and the reinforcement of fiscal and credit export in-
centives. Export earnings boomed between 1969 and 1973, easing the foreign
exchange constraint to growth and boosting domestic savings and investment.
6.        Government investment spei: .ing in the last three years lagged behind
the targets set by the Development Plan. The country's investment rate in-
creased, however, thanks to greater investment outlays by the rest of the
public sector and by the private sector. The decline in Government invest-
ment expenditures was caused by the completion of some lumpy infrastructural
projects as well as by budgetary stringencies during most of the period.
7.        The fiscal situation deteriorated in the early 1970s. Despite the
expansion of output and trade, Government revenues remained almost stagnant
in the face of growing current expenditures. To deal with this situation the
Government made key personnel changes in the tax and customs administration
and introduced a number of revenue measures. At the CIAP Country Review held
in January, 1972, the authorities established targets for fiscal improvement
in 1972 and 1973 aiming to restore Goverrunent savings to the peak levels
achieved in the past. The fiscal situation deteriorated further in 1972, but
improved markedly in 1973, when the revenue targets established two years
earlier were met and Government recourse to Central Bank financing ceased.
This was made possible by Government's actions to increase certain taxes and
to improve the performance of the Income Tax and Custom Administrations, as
well as by an upsurge in imports, which helped to increase revenues from
import duties.
8.        While the strengthening of external demand for Paraguayan products
gave considerable impetus to output growth in the 1970s, increased export
prices and world inflationary conditions broke Paraguay's impressive record
of price stability. The consumer price index, which in the second half of the
1960s increased at an average annual rate of 1.3%, rose by 5% in 1971, 10% in
1972 and 13% in 1973. Wholesale prices, however, increased faster last year
(33%) largely reflecting price hikes in internationally tradeable commodities.
9.        Government efforts to curb inflation followed a three-pronged
approach: measures to control domestic prices of exportable foodstuffs



-3-
(particularly beef), strict control over real wages, and increased fiscal
effort to mop up purchasing power. At the same time, disincentives to im-
ports of consumer foods were maintained while applying a liberal policy of
duty exemptions towards imports of capital goods and transport equipment.
Although they helped to contain price rises, these policies failed to break
the inflationary impulse. Beef price and marketing controls, removed since
February 1974, proved to be largely ineffective as the system of export
quotas associated with them created speculative expectations on the part of
ranchers and led to scarcities in the domestic market. Government incomes'
policy depressed real wages in urban areas (particularly those of public
servants), but real wages in the countryside increased rapidly under the
influence of rising export prices and labor shortages at harvesting time.
The improvement in the Central Government financial situation in 1973 and
the elimination of the overall fiscal deficit contributed, however, to cool-
ing off the economy.
10.       Given the Paraguayan economy's relatively small size and large
degree of openness, anti-inflationary policy is likely to be only partially
effective so long as worldwide inflation persists. The Government strategy
to contain inflation has been by and large correct, except for the beef price
policy followed until recently. As long as fiscal, monetary and incomes
policies continue in their present form, domestic inflation should subside.
Inflationary prospects, however, have become somewhat more threatening as a
result of the increase in world petroleum prices. In recent months the price
of oil landed in Asuncion trebled, which caused retail prices of petroleum
products to double. It is expected that the price hike will trigger a first
round increase of some 3% in the consumer price index, but its impact over
the year is likely to be considerably greater.
11.       As of December 31, 1973, Paraguay's outstanding and disbursed ex-
ternal public debt repayable in foreign currency was US$106 million, compared
with a total of US$97 million a year earlier. The Bank Group share in the
former total was US$28 million as compared with a level of US$25 million a
year before. In 1973, net public medium and long-term external debt is es-
timated to have increased at a somewhat higher pace as a consequence of the
upturn in investment experienced during the year.
12.       Paraguay contracted new external obligations amounting to US$115
million in 1968-72, over 60% of which were contracted with bilateral credit
agencies. Of the remaining 40% the Bank Group provided the largest share
(18%), with roughly a blend of 50% IDA funds and 50% of IBRD funds. In addi-
tion, new loans disbursable in foreign currency but repayable in local cur-
rency were contracted with the IDB for a total of US$64 million. The rhythm
of new external commitments is expected to accelerate in 1974 as a result of
certain bunching in the preparation of projects amenable to external financing
as well as greater availability of counterpart funds following recent improve-
ments in domestic resource mobilization.



-4-
13.       Despite Paraguay's impressive export performance in 1972-73 and the
promising prospects for 1974-75, the country will continue to need substan-
tial inflows of external assistance in order to attain its growth and employ-
ment objectives. Additional capital inflows will also be required to finance
the increase in Paraguay's import bill resulting from the recent increases in
international oil prices. The oil import bill, which in 1972 was about US$8
million or 11% of imports of goods, is expected to climb to some US$30 million
in 1974, which would be about 20% of the total imports. However, since Paraguay
has obtained the bulk of its foreign capital needs on concessionary terms and
since its exports are expected to continue increasing at high growth rates,
the country's creditworthiness is not expected to be impaired by the recent
changes in oil prices.
14.       The debt-service ratio remained within the range of 10% to 16%
in 1968-72 and declined in 1973 to 14.4% of exports of goods and nonfactor
services. While the country's debt service ratio is expected to increase in
the coming years, it is unlikely to exceed 10% in the remainder of the decade
provided that additional capital is contracted on terms comparable to those
of the recent past.  The Bank Gro.` s4hare in the debt service amounts to
about 5% of the total and in 1973 represented 0.8% of exports of goods and
nonfactor services. Under these circumstances, and while the country ought
to continue meeting its capital requirements on at least as favorable terms
as it enjoyed in the past, Paraguay remains creditworthy for a limited amount
of IBfRD lending. However, given Paraguayts limited foreign exchange earnings
and debt servicing capacity, its relative poverty, and development performance,
Paraguay has a continuing need for some financing on IDA terms.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN PARAGUAY
15.       Paraguay has received US$48.3 million (net of cancellations) in
Bank loans and IDA credits. Of this amount, US$21.8 million has been in
the form of six IBRD loans, while five credits totalling US$26.5 million
have been from IDA resources. As of June 30, 1974, the Bank held US$16.3
million, including US$2.5 million undisbursed, and IDA US$26.3 million, in-
cluding US$5.1 million undisbursed. On a sectoral basis, Bank Group assist-
ance to Paraguay has been 50% for agriculture, 39% for transportation, and
11% for education. Execution of Bank Group-financed projects has, on the
whole, been satisfactory. There has been a delay, however, in disbursing
the loan for the Second Highway Maintenance Project, as the fiscal situation
forced the Government to reduce the highway maintenance budget; this has now
been corrected since the Government has appropriated sufficient funds in the
1974 Budget for this purpose.
16.       Thus far, IFC has made no loans or investments in Paraguay.   It is
studying an integrated forestry project which could have a significant im-
pact on Paraguay's foreign exchange earnings. Annex II contains a summary



- 5 -
of Bank loans and IDA credits as of June 30, 1974, and notes on the execution
of ongoing projects.
17.       In FY74 the Bank Group did not make any new loans or credits to
Paraguay. In FY75 the lending program consists of the proposed loan, a credit
for a Small Farmer Credit and Rural Development Project, also under considera-
tion today, and a highway project, the appraisal of which is being completed.
Also highway maintenance, preinvestment, and agro-industry projects are being
prepared. These may be ready for consideration by the Executive Directors
during the next two years.
18.       In lending to Paraguay, the Bank Group tries to assist the Govern-
ment in achieving four major objectives. These objectives are interdependent
and complementary; hence, it is not possible to rank them in order of priority
or importance. One objective is to spread the benefits of growth more wide-
ly than before and, more particularly, to attack directly the problem of rural
poverty. A second objective is to help Paraguay expand output, including
exports, by investing in projects that directly or indirectly make large con-
tributions to production and employment. A third objective is to bring about
institutional improvements in the management of the economy and in the devel-
opment of public financial intermediaries. A fourth objective is to transfer
sufficient external resources on relatively concessionary terms (Paraguay
continues to be treated as a blend country) to complement Paraguay's domestic
savings and provide the necessary funds for maintaining an adequate level of
economic and social investments in a framework of sound domestic finances
and a viable balance of payments position. In keeping with the latter objec-
tive, Paraguay would, as a "blend" country, receive Bank and IDA financing.
19.       While the last objective primarily influences the magnitude of the
Bank Group's program in Paraguay, the other three jointly determine its struc-
ture. The Fourth Livestock Credit Project is designed to help expand the
production of beef, thus strengthening the balance of payments by increasing
beef exports. Loans/credits for rural development are designed to help ease
the rural poverty problem; basically, the Bank Group would work in consoli-
dating existing colonization settlements, a strategy which is consistent with
promoting better resource utilization and which complements the role of other
international lenders, notably IDB and AID, in the small farmer field. Loans
for highway and highway maintenance are designed both to transfer resources
to Paraguay and to help expand the country's paved road network, which is
considered crucial for expanding agricultural output, and to consolidate the
Bank Group's ongoing efforts to strengthen the highway maintenance organization.
Lastly, Bank Group assistance for agro-industry is to help increase the pro-
cessing of agricultural products destined for export, raise employment and
expand marketing outlets, particularly for small farmers. Lastly, Bank Group
financing of power development is designed to transfer resources to Paraguay
on suitable terms and to help increase the country's exports.

PART III - THE LIVESTOCK SUBSECTOR IN PARAGUAY
20.       Agriculture dominates the Paraguayan economy and is likely to con-
tinue to do so for the foreseeable future because of the country's factor
endowment, its lack of most other natural resources (excepting hydroelec-
trical energy) and the limited size of the domestic market. The proportion
of population engaged in agriculture has remained steady at about 60% during
the 1967-72 period. Agriculture's contribution to GDP was 31% in 1972.
Within agriculture, crop production contributes 58% and is the most important
sub-sector, followed by livestock with 30%, and forestry with 12%. Agri-
cultural exports provide about 91% of the country's foreign exchange earnings,
with beef exports accounting for about 35%.
21.       The livestock industry is based on a national cattle herd of 4.5
million head, 0.6 million pigs, 0.4 million sheep and goats and 6.9 million
fowl. Livestock production is dominated by beef, which accounts for almost
half of the sub-sector's output. Some 900 large commercial farms with more
than 500 cattle per ranch produce more than 50% of the beef. The lands they
occupy are either unsuited for czul arion or, if suited, there is at present
no economic justification for their use for crop production. Extensive live-
stock operations are likely to prevail in these areas for the foreseeable
future. Second in importance is pig production (22%), followed by milk and
eggs (each about 11%), and poultry (2%). Non-beef livestock production is
almost exclusively concentrated in small and medium-size mixed farms where
a considerable part of the output is for subsistence. The total area under
pasture is 14.8 million ha. of which about 40% is in the Eastern Region and
60% in the Chaco. The number of cattle in the Eastern Region was 2.7 million
in 1972 with a density of 2.1 ha./head and in the Chaco 1.8 million with a
density of 4.6 ha./head.
22.       The Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock (MAG) is responsible for
policy formulation and administration of supporting services for the sector.
The most important functions of MAG are: agricultural development, technical
education, research and extension, agricultural credit and cooperatives, agri-
cultural statistics and land reform. Most of the agricultural education and
research is provided by the National University at Asuncion. The Institute
of Rural Welfare (IBR) is responsible for land tenure, land reform and colo-
nization programs. Credit is provided by the Banco Nacional de Fomento (BNF),
the Fondo Ganadero (FG) of the Central Bank (CB), and the Credito Agricola de
Habilitacion (CAH). Other institutions assisting the livestock subsector
include the National Service for the Control of Foot-and-Mouth Disease
(SENALFA) and a National Program for Livestock Research (PRONIEGA).
23.       Three problems limit the growth1 of the livestock industry:  (a)
low extraction and conception rates; (b) inadequate and insufficient provision
of long-term investment credit; and (c) until recently, inadequate sector po-
licies. The low extraction rate is the result of poor ranch management, which
is reflected in low weaning performance, high mortality and slow maturity.
The low conception rate is attributable mainly to the lack of minerals in the
soil, which causes deficient animal diets.



-7-
24.       As far as credit is concerned, the main problems limiting the
growth of the sector are institutional. Although FG has, with Bank Group
support, become the major source of long-term credit for livestock, it is
still not adequately structuxred to effectively reach the small and medium
size producer. Since its early stage, FG's efforts were mainly directed to
assist large ranchers. With the exception of a few Mennonite cooperatives,
medium and small entrepreneurs were left out, mainly because of FG's limited
staff and highly centralized administration. Although BNF has assisted medium
and small ranchers with credits totalling 0 200 million (US$1.6 million) per
year between 1968 and 1972, the resources to finance long-term livestock invest-
ments still are insufficient. The commercial banks only accomodate the short-
term credit needs of low risk producers.
25.       As far as policy is concerned, the sector growth has been limited,
to a certain extent, by inadequate beef price and marketing policies, as
well as inadequate tax policies. Given the importance of livestock in the
economy, Government's policies with respect to livestock prices and marketing
play a decisive role in the pattern of economic growth. During 1973 and the
first two months of 1974, the Government pursued price policies designed to
arrest inflation, which caused serious distortions in the market mechanism
thus adversely affecting the ranchers' incentives to invest. On February 26,
1974, however, the Government lifted domestic beef price controls, abolished
the regulation by which the export quota was set as a fixed proportion of the
volume of beef consumed domestically, returned to the traditional global export
ceiling, and introduced an export surtax of 0 2,000 (US$16) for each head of
cattle slaughtered for export. The tax will remain flexible and is intended
to curtail somewhat the recently fairly high profit margins of the livestock
industry for the benefit of the domestic consumers so long as this is possible
without unduly reducing producers' incentives to expand investment and without
creating economic incentives to export illegally.
26.       Livestock taxation is not structured so as to help promote produc-
tivity, specialization and intensive land use. The Government is aware of
this and is considering the possibility of introducing a presumptive income
tax on agriculture. With the support of AID, a cadastral survey will be
initiated soon, which will inventory, identify and define all land holdings
including owners and/or possessors. In addition, with the assistance of the
UNDP and OAS, the Government is already working on several studies which would
help to determine soil productivity conditions in different parts of the
country. The proposed tax would provide for heavy taxation of farms operating
below their potential level of productivity.
The Bank Group's Approach
27.       The Bank Group lhas been actively involved in Livestock Development
in Paraguay since 1963. The main objective of the three livestock projects
previously financed was to accelerate the rate of growth of the subsector
by financing on-farm investments and technical assistance.   In view of the
importance of the production objectives and the limited initial administrative
capacity of the lending institution, these projects focused mainly on assist-
ing the larger producers. While tLe projects are successful in meeting their
stated objectives, a change in the Bank Group's approach is now required to



-8-
spread its benefits more broadly to medium and small size producers. The
Bank Group's approach in the sector, therefore, would be to assist the Govern-
ment to overcome the aforementioned problems and to meet newly defined goals.
First, it would seek to improve farm management practices which can bring about
better extraction and conception rates; in so doing it would finance paddock
subdivisions and other forms of infrastructure needed under a more sophisticated
farm management system; and it would help remove physical constraints--water
availability, soil fertility, animal disease, etc. Second, it would foster the
development of public credit institutions and enhance their assistance to med-
ium and small livestock producers. This would be accomplished by increasing
the amount of lendable funds, by decentralizing the operations and by increas-
ing the technical staff of FG. Thirdly, it would seek improvements in live-
stock subsector policies, including the maintenance of adequate investment
incentives, inter alia through a review, at the end of 1974 of the Government's
beef marketing and pricing policies.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
28.       The proposed project would De the fourth Bank Group operation for
livestock development in Paraguay. In 1963 a US$3.6 million IDA credit fi-
nanced the first stage of a program to improve and expand cattle production.
This was a pilot farm-credit operation aimed at improving 200 ranches (222
were actually financed) principally through construction of fences to sub-
divide pasture lands, a water supply system for each subdivision, corrals,
spray and immersion baths and other facilities needed for the proper care of
cattle and the prevention of disease. The project was completed successfully
and, as a consequence, in 1966 IDA granted a second credit, this time for
US$7.5 million, for its continuation and expansion. It was envisaged that
the project would cover some 360 ranchers, including at least 60 of the
original participants (491 were financed). The second project was also suc-
cessful and in 1969 the Bank made a US$4.3 million loan and IDA a US$4.3
million credit, to help finance the third stage of the cattle development
program.  The Third Project is about one year behind schedule due to slow
demand during the 1970-72 period. All funds, however, have now been com-
mitted. When the project is cormpleted, the cattle development program
initiated in 1963 will have helped to finance about 1,500 on-farm investment
nuans benefiting about 1,000 ranchers.
29.       The preparation report for this project was completed in August of
1973. Subsequently, a Bank financed consultant assisted the technicians of
FG on its preparation. The project was then appraised by a Bank mission in
October of 1973. Negotiations were held in Washington from May 6 to 14,
1974. They were completed on July 2, 1974.
30.       A project appraisal report entitled, "Paraguay - Fourth Livestock
Credit Project" (No. 346a-PA - dated July 19, 1974) is being circulated
separately to the Executive Directors. The main features of the project are
summarized in Annex III hereto.



-9-
Project Description
31.       In a departure from previous projects, new features have been added
to this loan: lending to small farmers and cooperatives and the financing
of investments in sheep, dairy, pig, and poultry production. The project
would support the Fondo Ganadero lending program over a three-year commitment
period. Specifically the loan would help finance: (a) investments for on-
farm development for livestock production; (b) purchases of machinery for
land clearing; and (c) technical assistance for training. On-farm investments
would consist of breeding stock (37% of project cost), pasture establishment
(28%), fencing (13%), buildings and stock handling facilities (8%), water
facilities (7%), machinery and others (5%). For land clearing and water
development purposes, the project would finance the purchase of machinery--
a few contractors are expected to receive these types of subloans. The
project would finance a total of 6 man-months of specialized consultant
services for technical assistance.
Subloans for Cooperatives and Individual Medium and Small Farmers
32.       About 14 subloans would be made to 10 colonies, mainly Mennonite
settlements working together as communities. Some have already received credit
under the Third Livestock Project. The colonies are situated in the Chaco
(Filadelfia, Menno, Loma Plata) and in the Eastern Region (Friesland, Volendam,
Sumnmerfield, etc.) and are organized on a cooperative basis with a central
administration that handles matters related to collateral, repayment, tech-
nical assistance (particularly on animal health), and marketing. There are
about 400 settlement colonies in Paraguay; however, only 10 of them are
equipped to handle livestock investment at the present time, the others are
mainly involved in crop production. Each subloan would cover approximately
60 farms with an average of 120 ha. each.    Some colonies already have a
well-established pattern of production based on beef and dairy. In addition
to the members of the cooperative, some 200 individual farmers owning about
120 ha. each would receive subloans for on-ranch investment. The total number
of cooperative and individual smaller farmers receiving subloans, therefore,
would be 1,040. Total investment in this category is estimated at about
¢ 405 million (US$3.2 million).
Subloans for Large Farmers
33.       Approximately 467 properties in the Eastern region, averaging 1,500
ha. each, would make on-ranch investments to improve their productive capacity.
Some of these properties have already received financial and technical assis-
tance under previous Bank Group projects, particularly for basic on-ranch in-
vestment such as fences, water points and corrals. This would be supplemented
by pasture improvements, paddock subdivision, water supply, as well as the im-
plementation of improved cattle management practices. Total investment in
this category would be ¢ 1,738 million (US$13.8 million).
34.       About 185 ranches, with an average of 5,800 ha. each, would be
financed in the Chaco (a sparsely populated and semi-arid region of Paraguay).
Main investment items would include fencing, water supply (principally small



- 10 -
dams), farm machinery, establishment of improved pastures and purchases of
breeding heifers and bulls. Average investment per ranch would be about 03.9
million (US$31,000). Total investment in this category would be ¢725.7
million (US$5.7 million).
Subloans for Sheep, Dairy, Pigs and Poultry
35.       The proposed project would finance investments in sheep, dairy, pig
and poultry production. Beneficiaries would be smaller farmers who farm either
individually or on a cooperative basis (average farm size about 120 ha.). The
investment cost of this component of the project has been included under sub-
loans for cooperatives and individual medium and small farmers (para 32).
Subloans for Machinery Contractors
36.       To assure that sufficient machinery would be available for land
clearing (forest and bush) and water development, the project would finance
heavy machinery units for contractors. It is expected that about three such
subloans totalling 9 29 million (US$230,000) would be made.
Technical Assistance
37.       The project would finance the cost of contracting an internationally
recruited specialist for a total of 6 man-months. He would train FG techni-
cians to promote and supervise investments to improve small farmer pig,
poultry, and dairy production. In addition, FG will be assisted by two UNDP
financed specialists in nutrition and fertilization.
Project Cost and Financing
38.       Total project cost, US$23 million equivalent, would be financed as
follows: the Bank would finance 43% (US$10 million equivalent), which repre-
sents the foreign exchange component; sub-borrowers would finance 24% (US$5.4
million equivalent); and the Central Bank's Fondo Ganadero would finance the
remaining 33% (US$7.6 million equivalent--financed with accumulated surpluses
and reserves of the three previous projects). Although in the aggregate
sub-borrowers would contribute about 24% of total project cost, the indivi-
dual producer contribution would be determined in accordance with the amount
of the loan. Small ranchers, defined as those eligible to receive subloans of
less than ¢ 630,000 (US$5,000) equivalent per individual beneficiary, would
contribute 15% of their investment cost. Large ranchers, defined as those
eligible to receive subloans of more than ¢ 630,000 (US$5,000 equivalent)
would contribute 25% of their project cost. Although under the Third Livestock
Credit Project all sub-borrowers contributed 15% of investment cost, improved
financial conditions of sub-borrowers, brought about by higher beef prices,
justify increasing the share of large ranchers under this project.



Relending Terms
39.       Subloans would be granted to ranchers for periods of not less than
5 years or more than of 12 years, including up to 4 years of grace. Within
these limits and on the basis of the repayment capacity of sub-borrowers,
the Fondo Ganadero will determine the terms for each subloan. In the case
of machinery contractors, subloans would be for a period of up to five years,
including one year of grace. Subloans exceeding US$100,000 equivalent in-
dividually or together with any subloan to the same beneficiary would require
prior Bank approval.
40.       To avoid erosion of funds by inflation and to promote better re-
source allocation, an indexing mechanism would be introduced to assure posi-
tive interest rates. Subloans made under the project would bear a real in-
terest rate of 6% annually. The principal outstanding would be adjusted
annually on the basis of the consumer price index published by the Central
Bank.
Marketing
41.       Except for small quantities of beef pork, mutton, poultry and milk,
which would be produced for the domestic market, incremental production would
be exported. The prospective long-term growth in the international demand
for beef make it likely that the incremental production can be exported pro-
fitably. These demand conditions also indicate that pork, mutton, and poultry
production would be easily absorbed in the domestic market as they are appro-
priate substitutes for beef.
Procurement
42.       The items to be financed are varied and spread over a four-year in-
vestment period, and are therefore not suitable for bulk procurement through
international competitive bidding. In most cases, major investments such as
land clearing, pasture establishment, fencing and water facilities would be
undertaken by the sub-borrowers themselves or by small local contractors.
Goods required for such works would be obtained through local commercial
channels, which are satisfactory. International suppliers of the imported
items are well represented in Paraguay, competition is adequate and service
reasonable. Breeding stock to be imported would come mostly from the border-
ing areas in Brazil with similar climatic conditions; imported heifers from
Brazil are usually of better quality than those available in Paraguay.
Disbursement
43.       With the Fondo Ganadero's commitments extending over three years,
its disbursements would spread over about four years and the loan is expected
to disburse in four and a half years. Bank disbursements would be made for
57% of amounts disbursed by FG for individual subloans. For consultancy
services, the Bank would disburse the actual foreign exchange cost. Disburse-
ments would be made against a certificate of expenditure. The documentation



- 12 -
for such expenditures would not be submitted to the Bank for review but would
be retained by FG and made available for inspection by the Bank during the
course of supervision missions. Bank disbursements for long-term investments
would be the equivalent of: ¢ 174 million (US$1.4 million) for investments
undertaken by small ranchers, individually or collectively through colonies
or cooperatives; 01,060 million (US$8.4 million) for investments carried out
by large farmers; and ¢ 22 million (US$0.2 million) for medium-term investments
bv machinery contractors. Bank disbursements for consultancy services would
amount to ¢ 2 million equivalent (US$20,000). No funds could be reallocated
to another category from the category of loans to small ranchers.
The Lending Institution
44.       As under the Third Project the Fondo Ganadero under the jurisdict-
ion of the Central Bank would administer the proposed Fourth Livestock Credit
Project. FG would be managed by a coordinating committee consisting of: (a)
a senior staff member of CB as chairman; (b) one representative of BNF; and (c)
the head of FG's Technical Division. The coordinating committee would be
responsible for subloan approval and any major policy decisions.
45.       In 1969 Fondo Canadero was established within CB to formalize and
continue the operations of a coordinating committee which had been responsible
for the administration of the First and Second Livestock Projects. At end
1972, FG's livestock loan portfolio was 02,532 million (US$18.7 million), or
about 61%, of balances outstanding to the subsector. This compared with 0676
million (IJS$5.4 million) or 17% held by commercial banks and 0865 million
(US$6.9 million) or 22% held by BNF. Lending by FG in 1972 totalled 0690
million (US$5.5 million), of which 0350 million (US$2.8 million) represented
loans of 12 years maturity for on-ranch investment under the Bank Group's
projects. The remaining 0340 million (US$2.7 million) represented loans of
two to five years maturity to ranclhers to retain heifers. This was financed
from funds generated by the credit project.
46.       By September 30, 1973, FG had received a total of US$17.0 million
of IDA and Bank funds. Collected debts from the defunct ex-Banco del Paraguay
kept as capital by FG amounted to US$1.3 million equivalent and accumulated
surpluses were US$4.3 million. However, since the Government passed on to FG
the foreign exchange risk, FG incurred liabilities in relation to outstanding
balances from two US dollar devaluations, equivalent to US$3.1 million, which
have reduced the above surpluses accordingly. Arrears amount to 4% of sub-
loans disbursed to fanners but all are considered collectable.
47.       Under the third project the institutional arrangements provided for
FC to administer the project and approve sub-loans, and the National Develop-
ment Bank (BNP), through a Special Livestock Division, to provide technical
and banking services in accordance with the provisions of an operating agree-
ment. This agreement expired on June 30, 1974 and the Government then assigned
FG the full responsibility for executing the project and transferred BNF's
Special Livestock Division to FC. Under the proposed project, therefore, FG
would provide banking facilities as well as technical services, through a
Technical Division, to appraise sub-loan applications on the basis of detailed



- 13 -
investment programs, including farm plans, income and expenditure estimates,
cash flow projections and incremental returns. To provide these services, FG
would employ its own technicians, open field offices, and handle loan trans-
actions.
Special Assurances and Undertakings
48.       In order to widen the range of operations and lending to small
producers, assurances were obtained from the Government that: (a) the tech-
nical project staff would be increased from 21 in 1973, to 40 within 24 months
of the date of the Loan Agreement; (b) an adequate number of project officers
would be stationed in FG branches; (c) the Fondo Ganadero would contract a
Paraguayan technician to prepare and supervise a training program for project
technicians and to prepare a simple farm management accounting system to be
adopted by sub-borrowers; (d) FG would increase by 15 the number of vehicles
available for project technicians, in addition to covering all reasonable
cost for offices and travel. Also, to prevent market distortions from re-
emerging, assurances were obtained that: (e) the Government and the Bank will
review the effects of present livestock policies before the Government would
decide on those for 1975, and, in any event, (f) the Government will pursue
livestock policies in such a manner that it will encourage exports and afford
efficient livestock producers a reasonable opportunity to secure a financial
rate of return of at least 15 percent on new investment under normal conditions
of production.
Economic Benefits and Justification
49.       The project is consistent with Paraguay's strategy of export pro-
motion. The potential increase in beef exports arising from the project at
full development would be about US$14.0 million, representing about 10% of
total exports in 1972. In addition, incremental fiscal revenues arising from
the project at full development would amount to about US$2.3 million per year,
which with the passage of time and tax rate adjustments are likely to increase
further.
50.       The project would also support Government efforts to transfer tech-
nology to extensive livestock producers. Through the combination of financial
and technical assistance at the farm level, the project would lead to wider
adoption of improved livestock production methods required to make more inten-
sive use of the country's large natural grassland resource.   Furthermore, the
project would help to increase lending to medium and small producers and to
fill the gap in long-term credit for livestock development.
51.       The project's overall rate of return to the economy is estimated at
20%. If world market prices for beef drop by 10% or 20% from those projected,
the rate of return would be 18% and 16% respectively. Secondary benefits of
the project have not been taken into account. The financial rates of return
are 24% for beef production in the Chaco, 17% for beef production in the



- 14 -
Eastern Region and 26% for mixed operations including pigs, poultry and dairy-
ing. They should be more than adequate to assure incentives to prospective
investors under the project to undertake the intended investments.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
52.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Republic of
Paraguay, the draft Project Agreement between the Bank and Central Bank of
Paraguay, the report of the committee provided for in Article III, Section
(4) (iii) of the Articles of Agreement, and the text of a resolution approving
the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
53.       The draft Loan Agreement and the draft Project Agreement contain
provisions to reflect the various arrangements described in Part IV above and
conform substantially to the pattern of previous agreements for livestock
credit projects.
54.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECONNENDATION
55.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

Loan 396       First Road Project, US$6.0 million and US$2.2 million,
Credit 12      October 1961 and December 1964
Work financed by the Bank Group for improving a road between
Asuncion and Encarnacion was completed satisfactorily in March 1970. The
German Contractor liochtief claims that it is entitled to US$11.1 million
more than the US$9.6 million it has received for its work under the contract.
For some time Hochtief tried to resolve its claim through direct negotiations
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

with the Paraguayan Government. In June 1972, Hochtief altered its approach
and attempted to settle its claim by invoking the arbitration clause of the
contract. The Government, however, has not yet appointed its representative
on the arbitration panel as called for in the arbitration clause, and Hochtief
has asked for Bank assistance in bringing the Paraguayans to arbitration.
We have advised the Governiment of the Bank's interest in having the parties
to Bank-financed contracts adhere to the disputes provisions of such contracts
and have advised hochtief that, under the circumstances, its most appropriate
course of action would be to pursue and exhaust the judicial remedies which
are still open to it under Paraguayan law for establishing the arbitral
tribunal.
Loan 620       Third Livestock Project, US$4.3 million, IBRD and
Credit 156     US$4.3 million, IDA, June 25, 1969.
The USS4.3 million from Credit 156-PA was fully disbursed by
January of 1973. The funds provided by Loan 620-PA were fully committed by
January 31, 1974. The project was about one year behind schedule due to
slow disbursements during the 1970-72 period.
Loan 652        Second Road Maintenance Project, US$6.0 million,
January 9, 1970.
The project comprises provision of maintenance and shop equipment,
improvement of the maintenance organization and its operations, and training
of personnel. Road maintenance is gradually improving as a result of the
project, approximately 70% of the provision for equipment has been disbursed
but further procurement was delayed pending the provision of adequate local
funds to operate the extra equipment. These funds are now available and will
enable the remainder of the equipment to be procured in 1974. In this event,
the project should be completed by the end of 1974, approximately one year
behind schedule.
Credit 347      Secondary Education Project, US$5.1 million, December 22, 1972.
After a seven-month delay due to a recess in both houses and an
ensuing backlog of pending legislation, the Credit Agreement was ratified
by the Congress on September 14, 1973, and the Association declared it
effective on October 30, 1973. Key staff of the project implementation unit
have been appointed and, at this stage, no special problems are envisaged
for the proper carrying out of the project. Since the Government met CIAP's
1973 fiscal targets, the second tranche of the Credit, which was conditioned
on the Government meeting these targets, has been released.

FOURTH LIVESTOCK CREDIT PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower and Guarantor:   Republic of Paraguay
Beneficiary:              Central Bank's Fondo Ganadero
Amount:                   US$10.0 million equivalent
Terms:                    Repayable in 25 years, including 5 years of grace,
at 8% interest per annum.
Relending Terms:          The Government would bear the foreign exchange risk
and would relend under a Subsidiary Loan Agreement
acceptable to the Bank, the loan proceeds on the
terms of the Bank loan to the Central Bank's Fondo
Ganadero. Fondo Ganadero, in turn, would grant
subloans to ranchers for periods of a maximum of
twelve years, including up to four years of grace,
and for up to five years to contractors. The in-
terest rate on subloans would be 6% per annum and
would be levied on adjusted outstanding balances.
This adjustment would be made in accordance with
the increase in the consumer price index computed
by the Central Bank.
Project Description:      The project would support a lending program over a
three year commitment period. It would help finance:
(a) investments for on-farm development for livestock
production; (b) purchase of machinery for land clear-

Procurement
Arrangements:             Goods and services will be procured on the local
market by recipients of subloans, in view of diversity
of items to be procured and the need to achieve
compatibility with individual farm needs.
Consultants:              The project would finance one internationally re-
cruited expert to train technicians to promote
and supervise investments to improve small farmer
pig, poultry, sheep, and dairy production.
Rate of Return:           The Project's overall rate of return to the economy
is estimated at 20%.
