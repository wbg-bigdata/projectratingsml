FOURTH LIVESTOCK CREDIT PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a Livestock Credit Project for which a Bank
loan of US$10 million equivalent is proposed. The loan would support a
three-year lending program by the Paraguayan Central Bank's (CB) Fondo
Ganadero (FG) for long-term investments in livestock production to be made
by large farmers (about 652) and smaller individual farmers and/or colonies/
cooperatives of smaller farmers (about 1,040). In addition, about three
machinery contractors and specialized consultancy services (about 6-man
months) would be financed. Government would be the borrower and bear the
exchange risk. A coordinating committee consisting of one representative
of the CB, one of the Banco Nacional de Fomento (BNF) and one of the FG
would administer CB's FG.
ii.       This would be the Fourth Project the Bank Group has financed for
livestock production in Paraguay since 1963 (47-PA, 86-PA and 156-PA/620-PA
for a total of US$19.7 million equivalent). All three Projects have been
executed satisfactorily, although the Third is about one-year behind schedule
due to slow progress in the 1970-1972 period. Repayment performance of sub-
borrowers is good with only 4% of outstanding sub-loans due in arrears.
iii.      Paraguay's agricultural sector employs about three-fifths of the
country's active labor force and contributes almost one-third to the GDP. The
sector's production covers 93% of the domestic demand and provides, in addi-
tion, 91% of the country's total export with beef being responsible for 35%.
Agricultural imports amount to about 11% of the total import bill. In terms
of output, the sector's performance for both crops and livestock has improved
over the course of the last decade; its annual average growth rate increased
from 2.5% between 1962-1970 to 4.3% for the 1969-1972 period (compared to
5.3% for the entire economy).
iv.       Paraguay is sparsely populated, having a density of only 6 per km2
Extensive livestock farming will be the main land use in large areas for
many years to come since much land has little or no alternative use possibili-
ties. Land distribution is very skewed. About 96% of the total number of
farms are of less than 100 ha but more than half of these smaller farms
are concentrated in the central provinces surrounding Asuncion, known as
the "minifundia" zone which covers less than 4% of the total area. At the
other extreme, 76 extensive livestock farms in the Chaco and 106 farms in the
Eastern Region account for more than 14 million ha or 36% of the whole country.
This skewed land distribution pattern results in a very high concentration of
.    cattle kept by a few large farms.  The lands covered by such large farms are
either unsuited for cultivation or, if they are suited for cultivation, there



is at present no economic justification for their use for crop production.
Extensive livestock operations will prevail in those areas in the foreseeable
future. Furthermore, population pressure is very low and infrastructure is
almost non-existent. Government is making efforts to solve the problem of
"minifundismo" by providing settlers with 20-ha plots and issuing land owner-
ship titles to squatters. This problem is the subject of another Project
proposed for IDA finance. The importance of livestock production to the
country's balance of payments is one of the main reasons for supporting this
Livestock Credit Project. The proposed Project would assist Government efforts
to provide investment credit to commercial livestock producers through CB's
FG. Small livestock farmers are serviced by BNF through an IDB loan, but the
proposed Bank loan would also attempt to reach smaller farmers, particularly
those grouped in colonies/cooperatives which until recently have had very
limited access to institutional investment credit. This drive toward smaller
farmers would be supported through decentralization of some Project technicians,
who would operate from field offices instead of from only one office in
Asuncion, as is the case at present.
v.        Under the Project some 652 sub-loans would be made to large farmers
(more than 1,500 ha each), while a total of about 214 sub-loans would benefit
some 1,040 smaller farmers with individual holdings of about 120 ha. The
former group would contribute 25% of on-farm investment cost, while the latter
would contribute only 15%. The real interest rate charged would be 6%. Out-
standing sub-loan balances would be adjusted annually based on the changes in
the consumer price index. A minimum of 14% of the loan amount has been allo-
cated to serve the smaller farmers benefitting from the Project.
vi.       Total Project cost would be US$23 million equivalent.  The proposed
loan of US$10 million equivalent would cover the estimated foreign exchange
cost, or 43% of Project cost. Sub-borrowers contribution would amount to
24% of Project cost and the remaining 33% would come from accumulated sur-
pluses and reserves of the CB's FG.
vii.      Procurement would be through normal commercial channels rather than
through international competitive bidding since the range of items to be fi-
nanced under the Project is very diverse and spread over a four-year invest-
ment period and therefore, is not suitable for bulk procurement. International
suppliers of the imported items are adequately represented and competition is
satisfactory.
viii.     The financial rates of return are estimated to range from 17% to
26%. The overall economic rate of return is estimated at 20%. During nego-
tiations appropriate assurances were obtained, providing a suitable basis
for a Bank loan of US$10 million equivalent for a term of 25 years, including
five years of grace.

FOURTH LIVESTOCK CREDIT PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      A Bank financed consultant visited Paraguay in July/August 1973 to
help complete preparation of a Fourth Livestock Credit Project for investments
by: (i) livestock farmers; (ii) livestock cooperatives; (iii) machinery con-
tractors; and to provide some technical assistance. The Project would help
to expand an on-going lending program for the livestock sector which has been
supported by three Bank Group financed Projects since 1963. The proposed
Loan would be for US$10.0 million.
1.02      In addition to livestock credit, the Bank Group has made one other
loan for agriculture to Paraguay: Loan 55-PA for US$4.5 million net of cancel-
lation for agriculture and road building machinery and equipment in 1951. The
First Livestock Project was financed through a US$3.6 million Credit in 1963
(47-PA), followed by the Second Livestock Project through a US$7.5 million
Credit in 1966 (86-PA) and the Third Livestock Project through a US$8.6 million
Credit/Loan in 1969 (156-PA/620-PA). Project execution under all three Proj-
ects was satisfactory, although the Third is about one year behind schedule
due to slow lending during 1970-1972. However, all funds have now been com-
mitted. A Small Farmer Credit and Rural Development Project for an IDA credit
to develop three Government settlements has been appraised and processed
simultaneously with the Fourth Livestock Credit Project.
1.03      Agriculture, including livestock, is the most important sector in
Paraguay's economy and Government has been encouraging investments in the
sector by providing financial and technical assistance. The Banco Nacional
de Fomento (BNF) is the main source of agricultural credit, although, in its
livestock lending, it concentrates on smaller producers. The three Bank/IDA
livestock credit Projects have served mainly larger commercial farmers and
have become by far the most important source of medium- and long-term invest-
ment credit for livestock production in the country. BNF has been using IDB
funds to provide credit to smaller livestock farmers, but as these are insuffi-
cient to meet the demand, the proposed Project has been designed to help cor-
rect this deficiency by extending Project lending to include smaller livestock
producers.
1.04      This report is based on the findings of an appraisal mission to
Paraguay in October 1973, consisting of Messrs. K.W. Berg, J.J. Bazo, D.N.S.
*   Evans, D. Parbery, A. Uhlig (Bank), and P. Bono (FAO/CP).

II. BACKGROUND
A. General
Area, Population and Land Use
2.01      Landlocked Paraguay has an area of about 407,000 km2 (Map) and a
population of some 2.4 million. Thus, the average population density is only
about 6 per km2. The Paraguay River divides the country into two distinct
regions: the flat drier Western Region, or Chaco, with low and variable
rainfall (about 700 mm per year) and the more humid (about 1,500 mm) Eastern
Region with flat to rolling topography. The Chaco, comprising three-fifths
of the country, is a vast, sparsely populated, poorly drained alluvial plain
covered with semi-arid tropical forest and grassland which has no alternative
use to extensive livestock production under present conditions (para 2.05).
On the other hand, eastern Paraguay, covering two-fifths of the country, con-
tains about 90% of the population and most of the crop land but also has dense
tropical rain forest. About three-fifths of the cattle population is concen-
trated in the Eastern Region, while the Chaco contains the balance, two-fifths.
Of the total land area, only 2.3% or about 1 million ha is used for crop pro-
duction. Another 37% or 15 million ha is grassland, 59% or 24 million ha is
in forest and 2% or 1 million ha is declared urban or waste land.
The Economy
2.02      Despite a satisfactory growth rate of the economy of 4.6% per annum
during the 1962-1972 period, Paraguay's per capita GDP remains low, about
US$315 eequivalent in 1972.   However, growth accelerated over the 1969-1972
period when it averaged 5.3% per annum. The main contribution to the improved
performance came from the agricultural sector, which during the 1960s barely
kept pace with population growth (2.6% per annum) but generated substantial
surpluses during the 1969-72 period. About 62% of the total income is concen-
trated within the upper 20% income bracket of the population, while the share
of the lowest 20% income bracket is only about 4%. Inflation, as measured by
the consumer price index during the 1960s, was low but, as in many countries,
it has not become a problem, accelerating to 10% in 1972 and 13% in 1973;
wholesale prices, however, rose faster during the year (33%) (para 5.07).
Agriculture in the Economy
2.03      The country continues to be dependent on agriculture which contri-
butes 31% to GDP, followed by commerce and finance with 25%, and manufacturing
and mining with 17%. In 1972 agricultural production was made up of 58% from
the crop sub-sector, 30% from livestock and 12% from forestry. The sector met
93% of domestic demand for agricultural products and, in addition, accounted
for an exportable surplus of US$78 million representing more than one-third
of total output, or about 91% of the country's total exports; 40% of which
comes from the livestock sub-sector. Imports of agricultural products comprise
about 11% of the country's total import bill. The sector employs 60% of the



0                                     - 3 -
total labor force, distributed between cropping, 49%, livestock, 5% and forestry,
6%. In terms of output, the sector's performance in both crop and livestock
production has improved considerably in the course of the last decade, in-
creasing its average annual growth rate from 2.5% between 1962-1970 (crops,
2.9%; livestock, 1.9%) to an average growth rate of 4.3% for the period
1969-1972 (crops, 4.8%; livestock, 3.3%). The most important crops are corn,
soybeans, sugarcane, cassava, tobacco, bananas, cotton and sweet potatoes.
Most of the production increase has come from new areas planted with wheat,
rice, soybeans and sugarcane, rather than from increased yields which have
tended to stagnate or decline. The most important export crops are tobacco,
vegetable oils, oilseeds, essential oils, cotton and coffee which together
account for 86% of the crop exports. Major agricultural imports are wheat
and wheat flour.
2.04      The livestock industry is based primarily on an estimated 4.5 mil-
lion head of cattle, 0.6 million pigs and 7 million poultry. Slaughtered
cattle contribute almost half of the livestock sub-sector's output, while
pigs contribute about one-fifth. Cattle slaughtering has not risen signi-
ficantly since 1960 and the livestock sub-sector's increase in output is
due mainly to an increase in pig and poultry production, but there has pro-
bably been a buildup of the cattle herd. About 87% of livestock exports are
beef, which have been growing in value by 24% annually between 1968 and 1972,
due to both an increase in volume, at the expense of domestic consumption,
and rising prices. Dairy products are the only significant livestock im-
ports (Annex 1).
Land Tenure
2.05      Land distribution is very skewed.  About 96% of the total number
of farms are of less than 100 ha but more than half of these smaller farms
are concentrated in the central provinces surrounding Asuncion, known as
the "minifundia" zone which covers less than 4% of the total area. At the
other extreme, 76 extensive livestock farms in the Chaco and 106 farms in
the Eastern Region account for more than 14 million ha or 36% of the whole
country (Annex 1). This skewed land distribution pattern results in a very
high concentration of cattle kept by a few large farms. The lands covered
by such large farms are either unsuited for cultivation or, if they are
suited for cultivation, there is, at present, no economic justification for
their use for crop production. Extensive livestock operations will prevail
in those areas in the foreseeable future. Furthermore, population pressure
is very low and infrastructure is almost non-existent. The previous Bank/IDA
financed Projects have provided investment credits in areas where such
conditions prevail. The proposed Project (Chapter III) would continue this
policy but lending activities would be expanded so as to include also smaller
farmers.
2.06      The problem of "minifundismo" is attacked by Government through
distributing land for new settlements and providing squatters with land
_ itles which entitle them for institutional credit. In 1963, Government
enacted an Agrarian Statute and established the Institute of Rural Welfare
(IBR) to implement reforms. The Agrarian Statute made provision for: (i)



- 4 -                                              0
the expropriation of part of large holdings (latifundia) exceeding 10,000 ha
in the Eastern Region and 20,000 ha in the Chaco on which the permanent
improvements represent less than 50% of the land value; (ii) the prevention
of the further fragmentation of minifundia and their amalgamation into
viable units; (iii) colonization on both public and private lands; and (iv)
the regularization of leasing and share-cropping agreements and of the
position of "squatters."   IBR's policy has been to concentrate on the
legalizing of the position of squatters and the establishment of colonies on
unused state lands for settlers coming from the overcrowded minifundia areas
and for Paraguayans returning from Argentina and Brazil. Since its inception
and up to September 1973, IBR has established 248 such colonies involving the
settlement of over 40,000 families on 2.8 million ha of land. During the
10-year period IBR purchased 600,000 ha, mostly from the state, and 30,000 ha
were expropriated; the latter representing only about 1% of land distributed.
During the same period, 17,000 families have been settled on 0.7 million ha
(mostly in the departments bordering on Brazil) under private colonization
schemes approved by IBR under the terms of the Agrarian Statute (Annex 2).
B. Agricultural Credit
General
2.07      Institutional credit to the agricultural sector in Paraguay is
controlled by the Central Bank of Paraguay (CB) within the terms of the
General Banking Law. Banking institutions subject to the General Banking
Law are the state-owned Banco Nacional de Fomento (BNF) and 10 commercial
banks. Additionally, there is the Fondo Ganadero (FG) which was created
in 1969 within CB to administer the Bank/IDA financed livestock Projects.
Banco Nacional de Fomento (BNF)
2.08      BNF is the most important source of credit to the agricultural sector;
it has provided 50% of total institutional credit to the sector over the period
1969-1972, but its role is less significant as a source of credit to the live-
stock sub-sector. From 1969 to 1972, BNF's lending to the livestock sub-sector
totalled 0 1,280 million (US$10 million), an average of 0 320 million (US$2.5
million) per year compared with an average of 0 1,542 million (US$12 million)
per year over the same period for the non-livestock sub-sector. Most of
BNF's lending for livestock is for small producers under the Integrated
Program for Agricultural Development (PIDAP). Furthermore, since 1971 it has
administered the Fondo Rotativo, a revolving fund of 0 100 million (US$0.8
million) which it received as a loan from CB and out of which it provides
short-term (eight to 18 months) credit for purchase of fattening stock and
retention of breeding heifers. The principal, although not exclusive, bene-
ficiaries under Fondo Rotativo are borrowers from the Bank/IDA financed
livestock credit Project. From the commencement of Fondo Rotativo in April
1971 to October 10, 1973, loans totalling 0 146.3 million (US$1.2 million)



5
had been made. Until June 30, 1974, BNF provided technicians and vehicles for
the FG and disbursed loans on FG's behalf for which it receives an annual com-
mission equivalent to 1% of outstanding loan balances. These services are now
undertaken by CB's FG itself.
Commercial Banks
2.09      Of the 10 commercial banks operating in Paraguay, eight are affili-
ates of foreign banks. All have their principal offices in Asuncion where
there are also 17 branch offices; there are 26 other branch offices located
in 14 towns outside the capital. Historically commercial banks have been
reluctant to finance investments in general agriculture because of what are
considered to be unduly high risks. However, since 1969 commercial bank
lending to the livestock sub-sector has been quite significant although most
of it has been of a short-term nature for fattening. During the period
1969-1972 commercial banks lent 0 5,811 million (US$46.1 million), an average
of 0 1,453 million (US$11.5 million) per year. This represented 66% of all
lending to the sub-sector totalling 0 8,734 million (US$69.3 million) during
the period compared with 15% or 0 1,280 million (US$10.2 million) at an annual
average of 0 320 million (US$2.5 million) lent by BNF and 19% or 0 1,643
million (US$13.0 million) for an annual average of 0 411 million (US$3.3
million) lent by FG. Interest rates on livestock lending are at the CB
permitted maximum of 12%, but various additional commissions ranging as high
as 8% per annum are also charged. The banks report that demand for fattening
loans is very buoyant, but lending is restricted to established customers who
are able to provide adequate collateral, usually in the form of real estate.
Fondo Ganadero (FG)
2.10      FG was established in 1969 within CB to formalize and continue the
operations of a coordinating committee which had been responsible for the
administration of the First and Second IDA financed livestock Projects. FG
is now now the principal source of medium- and long-term credit to the livestock
sub-sector and at end 1972, with a livestock loan portfolio of 0 2,352 million
(US$18.7 million), held 61% of balances outstanding to the sub-sector. This
compared with 0 676 million (US$5.4 million) or 17% held by commercial banks
and 0 865 million (US$6.9 million) or 22% held by BNF. Lending in 1972
totalled 0 690 million (US$5.5 million), of which 0 350 million (US$2.8
million) represented loans of 12 years maturity for on-ranch investment under
the credit Project. The remaining 0 340 million (US$2.7 million) represented
loans of two to five years maturity granted from the Complementary Fund which
is financed from funds generated by the credit Project.

III. PROJRCT PERFOBMANCE UNDER PREVIOUS BANK/IDA LOAN/CREDITS
3.01      IDA has financed on-farm investments for livestock production and
foreign technical assistance since 1963 when the First Livestock Project (IDA
Credit 47-PA) was signed. This credit financed US$3.6 million, or 60% of total
Project cost (US$6.0 million equivalent), while Government and participating
ranchers contributed 20% each. Government contributions came from collections
of old debts of the defunct Banco del Paraguay. The Project was administered
by the CB which, in turn, used the banking services of the BNF to carry out
operations related to the rancher sub-loans. A three-man coordinating com-
mittee was made responsible for sub-loan approval, consisting of a representative
of the CB (chairman), of BNF and an expatriate technical director. Sub-loans
were made to ranchers for up to 80% of investments covering fencing, corrals,
water points, dips and other facilities required for better management. Sub-
loans were at 9% interest and for terms of 12 years including four years grace.
There was also a category of sub-loans for contractors to acquire heavy equip-
ment for the excavation of wells and ponds. These sub-loans were also made
at 9% interest and for terms of up to five years. This First Project
was executed on schedule and financed 222 sub-loans to farmers, five sub-
loans to machinery contractors and the cost of a foreign technical director.
The Project financed almost exclusively beef production and a few sheep.
3.02      The Second Project (Credit 86-PA) for US$7.5 million was signed in
1966. Total Project cost was US$12.5 million equivalent of which IDA financed
60%, Government contributed 15%, again out of old debt collections from defunct
Banco del Paraguay, and ranchers contributed 25%. This Project continued fin-
ancing the same activities as the First Project, but included other types of
Investments as well such as drainage works, pasture improvements, purchase of
breeding animals, farm buildings, sanitary control and laboratory equipment
for commercial production of vaccines, mainly for foot-and-mouth disease
control. Interest rates, terms of loans and other conditions were the same
as in the First Project. A total of 491 sub-loans were made to livestock
farmers, plus eight sub-loans to machinery contractors and the Project con-
tinued financing a foreign technical director. The Project proceeded on
schedule.
3.03      The Third Livestock Project is financed partially through IDA
(Credit 156-PA) for US$4.3 million and the Bank (Loan 620-PA) for US$4.3 mil-
lion, both signed in 1969. Total Project cost was estimated at US$14 million
out of which 60% was financed by the Credit/Loan, 25% by Government through
further old debt collections and accumulated surpluses of the first two Pro-
jects and 15% by ranchers. Except for the lower contribution to investment
cost by ranchers, interest rates and terms of sub-loans were the same as under
previous Projects. The Loan/Credit Agreement provided for the establishment
of a Fondo Ganadero (FG) under CB to administer the Third Project as well as
the two previous ones and for BNF to create a livestock project division to be
seconded to FG to appraise and supervise sub-loans.  In addition to financing



-7-
items similar to those under the two previous Projects, the Third Project
included finance for dairy production, but very little has actually been
financed for this purpose. Until September 30, 1973, 523 sub-loans for a
total of US$11.4 million had been executed and the balance of Credit/Loan
was committed in early 1974, about one-year behind schedule due to slow
disbursements during the 1970-1972 period.
3.04      Farm development plans approved under the three Projects up to
October 30, 1973, total 1,236 plus an additional three sub-loans to cooper-
atives (Annex 2) for a total of 234 members. A total of nearly 10 million ha
(about two-thirds of the country's pasture area) carrying about 2.5 million
head of cattle (slightly more than half of the national herd) are owned by
farmers included in these farm development plans. The average size of
sub-loans has been close to US$20,000 for each of the three Projects. About
30% of sub-loans were repeaters to the same sub-borrower.
3.05      In the first two Projects, considerable emphasis was given to fi-
nancing basic farm infrastructure. Ninety-seven percent of investments
financed were made for fences, water supply and corrals in the First Project,
62% in the Second and 38% in the Third. Pasture improvements financed,
limited to less than 1% in the First Project, increased to 10% in the Second
and to 21% in the Third. The Third Project also finances an evaluation of
the impact of the First and Second Project which is being undertaken by a
consultant. Preliminary technical results based on a 450-farm sample are
now available indicating that participating farmers improved their farm
infrastructure as follows:
Farm Infrastructure             Pre-Development  After Development  Difference
Percentage of farms with
-  Corrals                          68                  99             +31%

Average pasture field             1,528 ha               702 ha
3.06      Some 65,000 ha of pasture was improved, mainly through the establish-
ment of Guinea grass  (Panicum maximum var. Colonial) on cleared jungle land.
The total area of cultivated pasture per property has increased from 0.2% to
2.0% and the usable area, through cleaning and weeding of bush, has increased
from 79% to 83%.   Pasture improvement has been undertaken particularly in
the Eastern Region, affecting 50% of the farms financed; improved pasture in-
creased to 4.6% of the total area under pasture as compared with 2.0% for all
sub-borrowers financed under the First and Second Projects.  Economic results
are not yet measured but these improvements are expected to have led to higher
rates of return from farm investments. In the Chaco, about 29% of the



properties have already benefitted from Project financing. Collection of
principal and interest due has been good with only 4% in arrears, none of
which is considered uncollectable.
3.07      The main objective under the three Projects previously financed by
the Bank Group was to obtain the largest impact of production in the shortest
time at minimum cost. While administrative arrangements were designed
accordingly, a change is required now to give emphasis to smaller individual
farmers and cooperatives. With a small staff and centralized administration,
only a relatively small number of sub-loans have been made (para 5.05). All
sub-loan applications were received in the main and only office located in
Asuncion and staff field visits concentrated only on supervision. This
centralized nature of operations is probably one of the main reasons for the
rather large average size of sub-loans and the small number of beneficiaries
(about 1,000) during the past 10 years of Projects operations.
IV. THE PROJECT
A. Definition
4.01      The Project would support a lending program over a three-year commit-
ment period. It would help finance investments for on-farm development for
livestock production including mainly breeding stock (37% of Project cost),
nasture establishment (28%), fencing (13%), buildings and stock handling facili-
ties (8%), water facilities (7%), and machinery and others (5%). Sub-loans for
on-farm investments would be made for periods of up to 12 years including up
to four years of grace. Investments would be made by about 1,692 farmers of
which about 1,040 would operate smaller livestock farms (average size about
120 ha) and about 652 would have large units (1,500 to 6,000 ha). The Project
would also finance the purchase of machinery for land clearing and water
development works by a few contractors who would receive sub-loans for a
five-year period. Furthermore, the Project would finance a total of 6 man-
months of specialized consultant services. Government would be the borrower
and the Project would be administered by CB's FG under the direction of a
coordinating committee comprising a representative of the CB (chairman), one
representative of the BNTF and one representative from the FG, who would be
the head of the technical staff. Total Project cost is estimated at 0 2,900
million (US$23.0 million) and the Bank contribution would be US$10.0 million
equivalent, or 43%, covering the estimated foreign exchange cost. Local con-
tribution would consist of US$5.4 million (24%) from sub-borrowers and the
remaining US$7.6 million (33%) equivalent would come from accumulated sur-
pluses and reserves from the on-going lending program of the three previous
Projects in CB's FG.

4.03      Large farmers of more than 4,000 ha would be financed mostly in the
Chaco where extensive livestock farming predominates.  However, settlement
cooperative/colonies with about 120 ha for each settler are also located
in the Chaco. Smaller individual farmers (also 120 ha) and large farmers
with about 1,500 ha would be promoted mainly in the Eastern Region. About
three sub-loans to machinery contractors are also expected to be made.
The proposed investments have been tested in three illustrative models.
4.04      The composition and size of the proposed Project have been based on:
(i) the estimated credit demand by both smaller and large farmers for on-farm
investments; (ii) the capacity of existing and newly recruited technical
staff to process sub-loan applications and supervise outstanding sub-loans; and
(iii) the extent to which the technical staff can be decentralized. Excluded
from Project financing would be investments for livestock production in the
three settlement colonies of Mallorquin, Repatriacion, and General Stroessuer
(ex-Pastoreo) since they are covered by another Project.

B. Detailed Features
Smaller Farmers, Colonies and Cooperatives
4.05      About 14 sub-loans are expected to be made to 10 colonies, mainly
Mennonite settlements working together as communities (Annexes 2 and 3). Some
have already received credit under the Third Livestock Project. The colonies
are situated in the Chaco (Filadelfia, Menno, Loma Plata) and in the Eastern
Region (Friesland, Volendam, Sumerfield, etc.) and are organized on a coopera-
tive basis with a central administration that handles matters related to
collaterals, repayment, technical assistance (particularly on animal health)
and marketing (Annex 4). There are about 400 settlement colonies in Paraguay
but the above 10 are the only organized livestock settlement colonies suitable
for on-farm investments at the present time; the others are mainly crop
producing. Each sub-loan would cover approximately 60 farms with an average
of 120 ha each. Some colonies already have a well-established pattern of
livestock production oriented toward beef and dairy. Products are marketed
directly in Asuncion. In addition, some 200 farmers also owning about 120 ha
each but not grouped in cooperatives or colonies would receive sub-loans for
investments. Both cooperative and individual farmers would receive sub-loans
for on-farm investment covering some 1,040 properties. Total investment for
this type of sub-borrower is estimated at about ¢ 405 million (US$3.2 million).
Project financing would concentrate on farmers who have not so far received
financial and technical assistance from either FG or BNF.
4.06      On-farm investment would consist of fencing, water supply, construc-
tion of small cowsheds, establishment of improved pasture (about 20 ha per
120 ha farm), and purchase of breeding stock (cows, sows and poultry).  In-
creased cattle production would be derived from increased weaning rates (55%
to 70%) and decreased adult mortality (5% to 2%).  Total investment per farm
would be approximately 0 389,000 (US$3,087).
Lg>e Farmers in the EastrnL_e gion
4.07      Approximately 467 properties, averaging 1,500 ha each would make
on-farm investments to improve their productive capacity. Some of these
properties have already received financial and technical assistance under
the First, Second or Third Project, particularly for basic on-farm invest-
ment such as fences, water points and corrals. This would be supplemented
by pasture improvements, further paddock sub-division and water supply as
well as the implementation of improved cattle management practices. Optimum
utilization of improved pastures, particularly those newly established in
the fertile jungle areas ("monte"), would require the purchase of additional
breeding stock. Before development, each property would typically have an
average cattle population of 477 animal units (210 cows) with an output of
72 animals per year. No dairying is envisaged. Total investment for this
type of sub-borrowers would be ¢ 1,738 million (US$13.8 million).



4.08      On-farm development would consist of fence construction, establish   /
ment of water supply, dips and corrals, sheds and, in certain cases, purchaseX
of some fgrmachinery   d e_cigment.  The establishment of 200 ha of improvGdl
pastures per farm would be financed and investments per farm would total ¢ 3.7
million (US$29,300) to be carried out in two years. In total about 90,000 ha
of pasture would be improved by approximately 450 farmers. Weaning rates are
expected to increase from 45 to 60% and adult mortality to decrease from 5%
to 2%.
Large Farmers in the Chaco
4.09      About 185 farmers, with an average of 5,800 ha each, would be fin-
anced in the Chaco.  Main investment items would include fencing, water
supply (principally small dams), farm machinery, establishment of improved
pastures and purchase of breeding heifers and bulls.  Average investment per
farm would be about 0 3.9 million (US$31,000). Total investment for this type
of sub-borrowers would be 0 725.7 million (US$5.7 million). The increase
in production would result mainly from improved weaning rates, from 45% to
65%, and decreased adult mortality, from 4% to 2%. Some of these farms would
already have an improved infrastructure, especially in terms of corrals, water
supply and, to a limited extent, sub-division of paddocks. A considerable
effort in herd management would be needed to optimize the utilization of
present and past investment. The improved pasture (130 ha per farm) establish-
ed under this Project would be used mainly for weaner calves.
Dairy, Sheep, Pig and Poultry
4.10      Although the First, Second and Third Project included investments
for sheep production and the Third Project included dairying as well only a
few such sub-loans have actually been made because large farmers who are rais-
ing cattle on a very extensive basis have little incentive for such special-
ized investments. Under the proposed Fourth Project, however, sub-loans would
also be made to smaller farmers who are more acquainted with and dependent
upon activities other than beef cattle raising, such as sheep and dairy pro-
duction. In addition, investments in pig and poultry production would also be
eligible for financing under the Project. Beneficiaries would be smaller
farmers who farm either individually or on a cooperative basis (average farm-
size about 120 ha). This type of lending would require considerable promotion-
al work and technical assistance following FG decentralization whereby field
staff would take up semi-permanent offices in the field. Nevertheless, only
small amounts are expected to be lent for such production.
Machinery Contractors
4.11      To assure that sufficient machinery would be available for land/
clearing (forest and bush) and water development, the Project would also |
finance a few                        for                 It is expected that
about three such sub-loans would be made, totalling 0 29 million (US$230,000)
of investment.



-12-
Consultancy Services
4.12      The introduction of lending to smaller farmers (120 ha) for pig,
poultry and dairy production and research on pasture improvement, particularly
the use of phosphatic fertilizers, requires the initial assistance of inter-
nationally recruited specialists. Therefore, provision for one expert for a
total of 6-man months has been included in the proposed loan. He would train
technicians to promote and supervise investments to improve small farmer pig,
poultry, sheep and dairy production. In addition FG is assisted by two UNDP
financed specialists in nutrition and fertilization.
C. Cost Estimates and Financing
Cost Estimates
4.13      Total Project cost is estimated at 0 2,900 million (US$23.0 million),
of which 43%, or 0 1,258 million (US$10.0 million), would be foreign exchange.

4.14      An overall price contingency allowance of 10% for on-farm investments
includes price contingencies for machinery (only 5% of Project costs) and
equipment (about 10% of Project costs), calculated on the cumulative basis
detailed below, together with lower allowance for the other components (notably
breeding stock and labor) where prices are not expected to rise to the same
degree.  Machinery and equipment costs are expected to rise as follows:  14%
in 1974; II% in 1975; and 7.5% thereafter.  The following investments and con-

Financing
4.15      Total Project cost, amounting to ¢ 2,900 million (US$23.0 million),
would be financed as follows: sub-borrowers would contribute 25% of invest-
ment cost, with the exception of smaller farmers and/or colonies/cooperatives,
whose contribution would be only 15%. Such beneficiaries would be defined as
those receiving sub-loans of less than ¢ 630,000 (US$5,000) per individual
beneficiary who would not be permitted to receive more than one sub-loan of
less than ¢ 630,000 (US$5,000) during any five year period without the prior
permission of the Bank. Not less than 14% of the loan amount would be allo-
cated for such small sub-loans (less than US$5,000 equivalent). In the aggre-
gate, sub-borrowers' contribution would amount to 24% or 0 678 million (US$5.4
million)). The Bank loan would cover 43% or ¢ 1,258 million (US$10.0 million),
which represents the estimated foreign exchange component. Government would
on-lend the Bank's contribution to CB's FG on the same terms and conditions
as received from the Bank without additional cost to CB's FG. The balance,
33% or 0 964 million (US$7.6 million), would be financed by FG from accumulated
surpluses and reserves of the three previous Projects (Annex 5). During nego-
tiations, assurances were obtained on these matters. The financing plan for
individual components of the Project is summarized as follows:

4.16      Government would be the borrower and bear the foreign exchange risk.
The Bank loan would be at the standard interest rate and repayment would be
made over a period of 25 years, including five years of grace. The Project
cash flow projections indicate that repayment of the Bank loan as indicated
above would be appropriate (Annex 5). As a condition of effectiveness Gov-
ernment would enter into a subsidary loan agreement with CB. Assurances
were obtained on these matter. A Project Agreement would be entered into
between the Bank and CB.
D. Procurement and Disbursement
Procurement
4.17      The items to be financed for approximately 1,692 farmers through-
out Paraguay over the four-year investment period are varied and would not
be suitable for bulk procurement through international competitive bidding.
In most cases, major investments such as land clearing, pasture establishment,
fencing and water facilities would be undertaken by the sub-borrowers them-
selves or by small local contractors. Goods required for such works would be _
obtained through local commercial channels, which are satisfactory. Inter-
national suppliers of the imported items are adequately represented in Paraguay,



*                                     - 15 -
competition is adequate and service reasonable. Breeding stock to be imported
would come mostly from the bordering areas in Brazil with similar climatic
conditions, imported heifers from Brazil are usually of better quality than
those available in Paraguay.
Disbursement
4.18      With FG's commitments extending over three years, its disbursements
would spread over about four years and Bank disbursement is expected to cover
four and a half years. Bank disbursements would be made for 57% of amounts
disbursed by FG for individual sub-loans against statements of expenditures.
For consultancy services, the Bank would disburse the actual foreign exchange
cost. Disbursements would be made against a certificate of expenditure. The
documentation for such expenditures would not be submitted to the Bank for
review but would be retained by FG and made available for inspection by the
Bank during the course of supervision missions. Sub-loans would represent up
to 85% of the cost of new investments financed by sub-borrowers whose individual
investment sub-loan would be less than 0 630,000 (US$5,000) and up to 75% for
all other investments financed. The Bank would disburse up to the amount
allocated for each category, representing the estimated foreign exchange cost
(para 4.13). Bank disbursements for long-term investments would be the equiva-
lent of: 0 178 million undertaken by individual smaller farmers and/or
smaller farmers colonies/cooperatives; 0 1,060 million by large farmers; and
0 22 million for medium-term investments by machinery contractors. Bank dis-
bursements for consultancy services would amount to 0 2 million equivalent.
A schedule of estimated Bank disbursement is given in Annex 6. In the event
expenditures under any category (except the lending category for smaller farmers)
provided for should decrease, the amount of the loan allocated to such category
and no longer required could, at the request of the borrower, be reallocated to
another category if this could be justified, otherwise it would be cancelled.
No funds could be reallocated to another category from the lending category
for smaller farmers.
V. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
General
5.01      In 1963 and 1966, IDA partially financed (total US$11.1 million) two
Projects which provided long-term on-farm credit for livestock production.
The Projects were administered by CB (Annex 7), which used BNF for technical
and banking services. Sub-loan approvals were made by a coordinating committee
composed of CB and BNF representatives and an expatriate technical director.
When, in 1969, IDA and the Bank approved the Third Project (total US$8.6 mil-
lion), a Fondo Ganadero (FG) (Annex 8), under the jurisdiction of CB, was
established legally to hold and manage Project funds. Furthermore, BNF
Project technicians were organized in a livestock project division. All other
* arrangements remained the same (paras 3.01 through 3.03).



-16-
Capital and Resources
5.02      By September 30, 1973, FG had received a total of US$17.0 million
of IDA and Bank funds. Collected debts from the defunct Banco del Paraguay
kept as capital by FG amounted to US$1.3 million equivalent and accumulated
surpluses were US$4.3 million. however, CB insists that its FG should carry
the losses incurred due to two US Dollar devaluations. Consequently, FG will
incur liabilities equivalent to US$3.1 million in respect of IDA funds re-
ceived, reducing the above surplus accordingly. Arrears amount to 4% of
sub-loans disbursed to farmers but all are considered collectable.
Administration of Proposed Project
5.03      The operating agreement between FG and BNF expired on June 30, 1974
and CB decided to permit FG to employ its own technicians, open field offices,
handle loan transactions, and thus sever its ties with BNF under vhich the
latter provided technical and banking services. As under the Third Project
FG, under the jurisdiction of CB, would administer the proposed Fourth Live-
stock Credit Project. FG would be managed by a coordinating committee con-
sisting of: (i) a senior staff member of CB as chairman; (ii) one representa-
tive of BNF; and (iii) a representative of FG who would be the head of the
livestock project division. The coordinating committee would be responsible
for sub-loan approval and any major policy decisions. During negotiations
assurances have been obtained on this matter. FG intends to take over former
BNF technicians working under the Project.
Loan Procedures
5.04      CB's FG would provide banking and technical services to appraise
sub-loan applications on the basis of detailed investment programs includ-
ing farm plans, income and expenditure estimates, cash flow projections and
incremental returns. Sub-loans exceeding US$100,000 equivalent by itself
or together with any sub-loan to the same beneficiary would require prior
Bank approval. On-farm investments under the Project would include the pur-
chase of breeding cattle, but this portion would be limited to a maximum of
45% of total on-farm investment costs. If, in special cases, a higher portion
would be justified, FG would finance additional breeding stock out of funds
from the complementary line of credit for up to five years. This line of
credit was introduced during the Third Project in order to make use of FG's
accumulated surpluses and to assist Project beneficiaries in financing addit-
ional stock purchases or at retentions. During negotiations, assurances
were obtained on these matters. Fattening of young steers is normally fi-
nanced by commercial banks and adequate resources are available (para 2.08).
Technical Assistance
5.05      In order to widen the range of operations and lend to smaller farmers,
FG would increase the number of technical Project staff from about 21 in 1973
to 40 as follows:  a total of 28 would be a condition of effectiveness; a total
of 34 would be reached within 12 months of the date of the loan agreement; and W
a total of 40 within 24 months of the date of the loan agreement. Some project
technicians would be stationed at FG branch offices to be opened where they would



- 17 -
accept and process sub-loan applications and from where they would also super-
vise on-farm investments and assist farmers in the application of improved
management practices (para 3.07). Furthermore, FG would contract a Paraguayan
technician acceptable to the Bank who would prepare and supervise: (i) a
training program for Project technicians concentrating on economic evaluations
of proposed on-farm investments and the transfer of technological improvements
at the farm level; and (ii) a simple farm management accounting system to be
adopted by all sub-borrowers as a means of improving management standards.
Assurances were obtained on these matters.
5.06      FG would also increase transport facilities to permit more travel-
ling by technicians working under the Project. Besides covering all reasonable
costs for offices and air travel, it would provide Project technicians with
a total of not less than 15 four-wheel drive vehicles; five of which would be
acquired within six months of the Loan Agreement; and cover all fuel and
maintenance costs for such vehicles. Assurances were obtained on these
matters.
Interest Rates
5.07      Inflation, as measured by the consumer price index during the 1960s,
was low but, as in many countries, it has now become a problem, accelerating
to 10% in 1972 and 13% in 1973; wholesale prices, however, rose faster during
the year (33%), The consumer price index was influenced by controlled beef
prices which were in effect for the October-December period; prices on the
free market were considerably higher. Beef price controls for local consump-
tion have been removed since and the consumer price index is likely to acce-
lerate in 1974, also due to other factors such as oil prices (para 2.02).
This has made the real interest rate charged under the Third Project negative;
the nominal interest rate was 9%. Therefore, an indexing mechanism would be
introduced to assure a positive interest rate, and to avoid capital erosion.
Sub-loans made under the Project would bear a real interest rate of 6% an-
nually. The principal outstanding on sub-loans would be adjusted annually
on the basis of the general consumer price index as issued by the CB; interest
would be levied on the adjusted principal amounts. Assurances were obtained
on these matters during negotiations.
Sub-loan Terms
5.08      Cash flows of typical investments under the Project indicate that
the following repayment periods for sub-loans would be appropriate but in no
case would a sub-loan for on-farm investment under the Project be made for a
period of less than five years. Sub-loans for on-farm investment would be for
periods of up to 12 years including up to four years of grace, but FO would
decide such sub-loan terms in each case on the basis of farmers' repayment
*    capacity resulting from the cash flow projections; i.e., there would not be



- 18-
a standard sub-loan term of 12 years for all sub-loans as in the past. Sub-
loans to machinery contractors would be for a period of up to five years
including up to one year of grace. During negotiations assurances were
obtained on these matters.
Accounts and Audit
5.09      The FG accounts, which are well maintained, are audited by the Audit
Division of CB and by the Superintendent of Banks. During negotiations as-'
surances were obtained that FG accounts would be audited by independent auditors
satisfactory to the Bank. The audited accounts and the auditor's report would
be submitted to the Bank within four months of the close of each financial year.
VI. PRODUCTION, MARKETING AND SUB-BORROWERS' BENEFITS
Production
6.01      Incremental production generated from investments financed under
the Project would consist mainly of beef and, to a lesser extent, of pork,
poultry, milk and eggs. This would be consistent with Government's National
Development Plan which aims at increasing exports and raising the standard
of living which would be supported particularly by promoting pork, poultry
and milk production. At full development, it is estimated that farmers would
produce incremental amounts resulting from Project financed investments of
about: 14,000 tons of beef (carcass weight), 600 tons of pork, 56 tons of
poultry, 3.4 million litres of milk and 3 million eggs per year, representing,
in relation to the country's present total production, 14%, 1%, 3%, 4% and
1OZ, respectively.
Marketing and Prices
6.02      Beef is by far the most important export item within Paraguay's
economy (35% of total export). Slaughterhouse facilities for exports have
been expanded and modernized to meet requirements of beef importing countries
(mainly USA and EEC). In view of the rising world demand for beef, there
should be no difficulty in marketing additional production. Internal marketing
is generally satisfactory for channelling the produce from the farmer to the
market, but, owing to difficult transport conditions in the hinterland, mar-
keting costs are relatively high. Live cattle move to slaughterhouses on the
hoof and by trucking in about equal proportion. The average distance involved
is about 200 km and losses reach 13 kg per animal liveweight.
6.03      All pig and poultry production is consumed internally, but local an-
nual consumption is only 4.5 kg and 0.8 kg per capita, respectively. Domestic
milk production satisfies only 90% of internal demand. Significant amounts
of powdered milk and cheese are imported to meet the very modest per capita



-19 -
consumption of about 27 litres of milk, 1.9 kg of cheese and 0.2 kg of butter
per annum. The incremental Project financed pork, poultry, egg and milk would
be produced by relatively small farmers already having some production and
market outlet for these products. Marketing would be a small-scale operation,
selling direct to the local consumer with only a fraction of the produce enter-
ing regional marketing channels. Rising internal demand is expected to absorb
easily such incremental production.
6.04      Most agricultural commodity prices are set by market forces.  Unitl
1971, producer prices for cattle were generally low in relation to production
costs under prevailing techniques. Farm-gate prices were about 0 20 per kg
liveweight (US$0.16/kg), making cattle production under traditional methods
a rather marginal economic operation with annual net returns to total investment
(including land) barely exceeding 2%. However, from 1971 onwards cattle prices
rose by 110% to about 0 43/kg (US$0.33/kg) and even higher, thus substantially
increasing cattle production revenues and creating a very favorable climate
for additional investment. Similar price trends have been experienced for pigs
and poultry, but their pre-1971 price levels were more remunerative than those
for beef. Price increases since, however, have averaged only 29%. This, and
the fact that prices of feed inputs used for their production have risen about
twice as fast as the output prices, has lowered considerably the comparative
advantage of these commodities versus beef and other production lines. The
milk price is about 0 13/litre (US$0.10) and has remained stable over the
last 10 years. Since dairy production is based largely on feedgrains which
have experienced a rise in prices of about 50% since 1970, production has
become less attractive and will remain so unless the fodder base is changed
from feedgrains to pasture.
6.05      Taxation on livestock producers is insufficient to help promote
productivity, specialization and intensive land use. The Government is aware
of this situation and it is considering the possibility of introducing some-
time in the future a presumptive income tax on agriculture. With the support
of USAID, a cadastral survey will be initiated soon, which will inventory,
identify and define all land holdings, including owners or possessors thereof.
Also, with the support of the UNDP and OAS the Government is already working
on several studies which will help to determine soil productivity conditions
in different parts of the country. The proposed tax would provide for heavy
taxation of farms operating below their potential level of productivity. The
tax would be determined on the basis of the average productivity expected
from the different types of soils of the property, expressed in annual beef
production per ha. When the minimum potential productivity (which varies
with different types of soils) would not be reached, the basic land tax would
be multiplied by the corresponding taxation factor. Progress on this matter
would be followed-up through discussions between Government and the Bank.
6.06      Rising world market prices for beef had a negative effect on
domestic beef consumption (para 2.04 and Annex 4, para 2). To prevent further
declines in domestic consumption of beef and control inflation, Government
established export controls and fixed domestic beef prices.  These measures,
however, resulted in market distortions and, as a result, in February 1974,



-20
Government lifted domestic beef price controls, discontinued the regulation
by which the quota on beef exports was tied to a fixed proportion of beef
consumed domestically, returned to the,traditional global export quota, and
introduced an export surtax of ¢ 2,000 (US$16) for each head of cattle slaugh-
tered for export.  Government intends to keep the tax rate flexible in order
to maintain an appropriate level of supply for local consumption without
unduly weakening farmers' production incentives or encourage illegal exports
to neighboring Brazil. During negotiations assurances were obtained that,
before deciding on measures for 1975, the Government and the Bank review
the effects of relevant policies for the livestock sub-sector so as to en-
courage exports and afford efficient livestock producers a reasonable op-
portunity to secure, under normal conditions of production, a financial rate
of return of a least 15% on new investment.
Sub-borrowers' Benefits
6.07      Based on expected investment cost, yield and price assumptions,
three illustrative investment models (Annex 12) have been worked out to
analyze the financial benefits expected from different items to be financed
under the Project. The financial rates of return are estimated to be about
24% for beef production in the Chaco, 17% for beef production in the Eastern
Region and 26% for mixed operations including pigs, poultry and dairying.
They should be more than adequate to assure incentives to prospective inves-
tors under the Project to undertake the intended investments.
VII. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
7.01      The Project would enable CB's FG to continue and expand its
financial assistance for long-term investments in the livestock sector. It
would provide: (i) long-term credit to about 652 large livestock farmers and
1,040 smaller farmers individually or grouped into colonies for investments
in pasture establishment, fencing, buildings, stock handling facilities,
breeding stock and farm machinery; (ii) medium-term credit to a few private
contractors for the purchase of land clearing and water development equipment;
and (iii) financing for technical assistance through specialist consultancy
services. This would complement a long-term lending program which has been
assisted by three previous IDA credits4nd one Bank loan, totalling US$19.7
million, since 1963. Although commercial banks have increased their lending
to the livestock sub-sector, these funds have been made available almost
exclusively on short term. While this-has enabled farmers to engage in
fattening operations, if and when they could buy the stock and had sufficient
pasture available, the shortage of long-term lending funds in the country has
held up needed investments to raise beef production in general and breeding
in particular.
7.02      The proposed Project would assist Government efforts to provide
investment credit to commercial farmers.  It would concentrate particularly on
the increase of beef production for which there is an easily accessible export



.
- 21 -
market and a sizeable production potential. It would mainly benefit large-
and medium-size cattle ranchers who control most of the land resources with
little or no alternative use other than extensive livestock raising.
7.03      At full development, the Project would increase production by about
0 1,774 million (US$ 14 million) annually at current market prices, equivalent
to about 10% of the livestock sub--sector's total output in 1972. Assuming that
present consumption levels would remain unchanged, the incremental production
of beef would be exported, the incremental pork would substitute locally
consumed beef freeing additional beef for export while the incremental dairy
production would substitute imports. Thus, the potential increase in exports
arising from the Project would be in the order of 0 1,774 million (US$14 million)
which would correspond to about 16% of the country's total 1972 exports. This
would improve the country's balance of payments position. Incremental fiscal
revenues accruing to Government at full production per year would amount to
about a US$2.3 million equivalent.
7.04      The Project would also support Government efforts to transfer tech-
nology to extensive livestock farmers through technical assistance and the
introduction of modern techniques such as paddock sub-division, pasture im-
provements, fencing and purchase of improved breeding stock and improved man-
agement. Through the combination of financial and technical assistance at the
farm level, the Project would lead to a wider adoption of improved livestock
production methods required for better utilization of the country's huge
natural grassland resource.
7.05      In providing development credit, the Project would complement
short-term lending by private banks and the IDB assisted long- and medium-
term credit program of BNF which is limited and oriented mainly towards
smaller farmers. Thus the Project would help fill the existing gap in long-
term credit for commercial livestock farmers. A Small Farmer Credit and Rural
Development Project for financing through an IDA Credit has been appraised and
processed simultaneously with the Fourth Livestock Credit Project.
7.06      The economic rate of return has been calculated on the basis of
projected world market prices for beef. For all other inputs and outputs
actual prices have been used, after allowing for taxes and custom fees on
imported items. The Project's overall rate of return to the economy is es-
timated at 20% (Annex 13). If world market meat prices should drop by 10%
or 20% from those projected, the rate of return would be 18% and 16%, respec-
tively.
VIII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMENDATIONS
* .01       During negotiations, assurances were obtained on the following
M rincipal points that the Government would:



- 22-
(i) onlend the loan proceeds at no extra cost to CBts FG and cause
CB's FG to finance up to 75% of investment costs for large
farmers and up to 85% for smaller farmers as defined in para 4.15;
(ii) bear the exchange risk and enter into a subsidiary Loan Agreement
with CB (para 4.16);
(iii) cause CB to nominate a coordinating committee (para 5.03);
(iv) cause CB's FG to appraise sub-loan applications in terms of
incremental return and to assist applicants in the preparation
of farm investment plans which could include the purchase of
breeding stock up to 45% of total cost (para 5.04);
(v) cause CB's FG to send to the Bank for prior approval any applica-
tion for a sub-loan in excess of US$100,000 equivalent by itself
or together with any other sub-loans to the same beneficiary
(para 5.04);
(vi) cause FG to employ technical Project staff of 40, who would
be appointed within 24 months of the loan agreement (para 5.05);
(vii) cause CB's FG to charge an interest rate of 6% per annum.
Principal outstanding sub-loan amounts would be adjusted
annually on the basis of the consumer price index (para 5.07);
(viii) cause CB's FG to make sub-loans under the Project for on-farm
investment for a minimum of five years and not exceeding the
maximum grace and lending periods as indicated in para 5.08;
and
(ix) before deciding on tax measures and export quotas for 1975 review
with the Bank relevant policies for the livestock sub-sector
(para 6.06).
8.02      Conditions of effectiveness of the loan would be that:
(i)  Government has entered into a subsidiary Loan Agreement with CB
(para 8.01 (ii));
(ii) the coordinating committee has been nominated (para 8.01 (iii));
and
(iii) FG has appointed a technical Project staff of at least 28
(para 8.01 (vi)).
8.03      The proposed Project constitutes a suitable basis for a Bank loan
to Government of US$10 million for a tend of 25 years, including five years
of grace.

PARAGUAY
FOURTH LIVESTOCK CREDIT PROJECT
Agricultural Background
General
1.        Paraguay is a landlocked country of 0.4 million km2 astride the
Paraguay river and bounded to the south and to the east by the Parana river.
With a population of 2.4 million, it has a population density of only about
6 per km2, varying greatly between the relatively densely populated center-
provinces around the capital (260/km2) and the hinterland (0.4/km ).
2.        The Paraguay river divides the country into two natural regions:
eastern and western. Eastern Paraguay incorporates 40% of the country and
90% of its population. It has a rolling topography with soils ranging from
reddish brown laterites covered with dense tropical forest in the south and
east, to red and yellow podzolic soils with a subtropical climate and lighter
forest coverage interrupted by extensive savannahs in the north. High annual
rainfall, increasing towards the southeast from 1,200 mn to about 1,900 mm
per year, leads to rapid leaching of soils and to frequent flooding of the
poorly drained low lands. Almost all the country's crops are produced in the
Eastern Region which also supports about 60% of the national cattle herd.
Western Paraguay, commonly referred to as the Chaco, is a vast poorly drained
alluvial plain of mixed material eroded down from the Andes. Rainfall is
considerably less than in the Eastern Region, decreasing from about 1,200 mm
along the Paraguay river to as little as 400 mm at the north-western border
with Bolivia, giving rise to semi-arid bush and grassland vegetation in the
drier zones. Although this region has a considerable area of arable soil,
sparse and erratic rainfall as well as a lack of communication infrastructure
restricts its use mainly to extensive cattle farming. Only a very small area
is cropped. There is also some forest exploitation.
3.        The country's land use pattern is very extensive.  Only some 2% of
the total area is cropped and slightly more than one-third is under natural
grassland, the balance being mostly unexploited forest and land unsuitable
for agriculture (Table 1). This reflects not only the limitations imposed
by climatic and soil conditions but equally reveals a high degree of under-
utilization of the natural land potential. An evaluation of land capabili-
ties indicates that there is scope for an eight-fold increase in the crop
area, largely at the expense of forest while maintaining the area presently
used for grazing. The country's financial and administrative limitations
are the major constraints to development, but the absence of population
pressure in the underutilized areas, the inaccessibility of the hinterland



ANNEX 1
Page 2
Agriculture in the Economy
4.        Agriculture dominates the Paraguayan economy and is likely to con-
tinue to do so for the foreseeable future because of the country's consider-
able agricultural resources, its lack of most other natural resources (except-
ing hydroelectrical energy), the limited size of the domestic market for
industrial products and the country's landlocked position. The proportion
of population engaged in agriculture has remained steady at about 60% during
the 1967-72 period (Table 2). However, agriculture's contribution to GDP
declined from 37% in 1962 to 31% in 1972 because agricultural production
grew less than the output of other sectors. Within agriculture, crop production
contributes 57% and is the most important sub-sector, followed by livestock
with 30% and forestry with 13% (Table 3).
5.        About 60% of the sector's output is consumed domestically, satisfying
some 93% of the internal demand for agricultural products. The remaining
40% of the output is exported, accounting for US$78 million, or 91% of the
country's total export earnings in 1972.  Although mainly of agricultural
origin, exports are diversified; crop and livestock products account for 37%
and 40% of total exports, respectively; forest products contribute about 14%.
Beef is the most important single export item, contributing 35% of total ex-
ports, followed by lumber with 10%, vegetable oils 7%, tobacco 8%, and oilseeds
6%. Agricultural exports grew at an annual rate of about 17% over the 1967-71
period mainly because of both increased volume and higher prices for soybeans,
oils, sugar, beef and hides. Differential growth rates resulted in a rise of
the livestock sector's share in total exports from 30% in 1968/69 to 37% in
1971/72 and a relative decline in forestry exports over the same period from
24% to 16%. Crop exports maintained their relative importance (Table 4).
6.        Imports of food and agricultural raw materials are limited mainly
to wheat, wheat flour, dairy products and some specific varieties of tobacco.
Their combined value has decreased somewhat in recent years amounting to about
US$7 million in 1972. The relative share of agricultural imports in relation
to total imnports declined from 16% in 1968/69 to 11% in 1972, mainly due to
a partial substitution of wheat imports by increased domestic production
(Table 5).
Land Distribution and Tenure
7.        Land distribution in Paraguay is uneven.  About 96% of the total
number of farms are of less than 100 ha. More than half of these small
units are concentrated in the area around Asuncion known as the "minifundia"
zone which covers less than 4% of the total land area. At the other extreme,
76 extensive livestock farms in the Chaco and 106 farms in the Eastern Region
account for more than 14 million ha, or 36% of the whole country (Table 1).
This skewed land distribution pattern results in a very high concentration
of cattle kept by a few large ranches. Available information (Table 6)
suggests that the top one percent of the cattle ranches (with more than 750
head per ranch) own about 55% of all cattle, while on the other extreme the
smaller 90% of ranches with less than 50 cattle each own only about 25% of
the national herd.

ANNEX 1
Page 3
8.        Between 1956 and 1971, the proportion of owner operated farms has
increased from 39% to 61% (Table 1), reflecting the success of the Institute
of Rural Welfare (Instituto de Bienestar Rural--IBR) In providing  quatters
with titles.                                                      H       / ' 
Agricultural Production
9.        Crop production, concentrated largely in the Eastern Region, is based
on the subsistence crops maize and cassava.  These two crops are grown also for
animal feed by small farmers.  Other important crops are sugarcane, bananas,
tobacco, cotton, sweet potatoes, beans, coffee, groundnuts, wheat, rice and
soybeans. Minor crops include vegetables (such as tomatoes), castor seeds,
essential oils, mainly petit grain, tung and mint.
10.       The livestock industry is based on a national cattle herd of 4.5
million head, 0.6 million pigs, 0.4 million sheep and goats and 6.9 million
birds (Table 7). Livestock production is dominated by the beef industry
which accounts for almost half of the sub-sector's output. Some 900 large
commercial farms with more than 500 cattle per ranch produce more than 50%
of the beef. Second in importance is pig production (22%) followed by milk
and eggs (each about 11%) and poultry (2%) (Table 8). Non-beef livestock
production is almost exclusively concentrated in small- and medium-size
mixed farms where a considerable part of the output is for subsistence.
11.       The agricultural sector's performance over the last decade has
been mixed. Annual production had been growing at an average rate of about
2.5% between 1962 and 1970, indicating that per capita growth rate was only
marginal. This trend, however, accelerated during the 1969-72 period, reaching
an average growth rate of 4.3%. Crop production increased somewhat faster than
livestock (Table 3). This has been mainly due to Government efforts result-
ing in more planting of soybeans, rice, wheat and sugarcane. The slight
upswing in livestock output since 1968 is due mainly to an increase in the
production of hogs, eggs and an estimated substantial growth in the livestock
inventory. The cattle industry, the most import single component within the
livestock sub-sector, maintained a low growth rate of about 1.5% annually,
i.e., about one percentage point below the population growth (Table 8).
12.       The most important factors causing the earlier sluggish performance
in agriculture have probably been the depressed agricultural prices prevailing
until the late sixties and the paucity of available technical and financial
support services. Since 1971, however, the increase in farm prices has
resulted in an improvement in the farmers' terms of trade versus the rest of
the economy. Furthermore, the concentration of Government support services
on selected commodity programs and favorable tax treatment of export oriented
agricultural processing industries has given additional support to agricultural
production, although this has been limited to a few products benefitting only
a small number of larger farmers. The application of new technology is pro-
gressing slowly, especially amongst small farmers who depend on intensification
*    of land use as a means to increase their income.

Government Services
13.       The Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock (MAG) is responsible for
policy formulation and administration of supporting services for the sector.
The most important functions of MAG are: agricultural development, technical
education, research and extension, agricultural credit and cooperatives,
agricultural statistics and land reform. Most of the agricultural education
and research is provided by the National University at Asuncion. The newly
established Department of Agricultural Economics and Marketing deals mainly
with the collection and analysis of agricultural production and marketing
statistics. The Institute of Rural Welfare (IBR) is responsible for land
tenure, land reform and colonization programs. Credit is provided by the
Banco Nacional de Fomento (BNF), the Fondo Ganadero (FG) and the Credito
Agricola de Habilitacion (CAH). Other institutions assisting the livestock
sub-sector include the National Service for the Control of Foot-and-Mouth
Disease (SENALFA) and a National Program for Livestock Research (PRONIEGA).
14.       The effectiveness of these services is limited mainly because of
financial and manpower restrictions and inadequate coordination between
the institutions involved. Extension agents are short of transport facili-
ties and have to cover up to 2,500 farmers per technician.
Government Policy
15.       Following recommendations of the national development plan, budget
allocation to the Ministry of Agriculture was increased from 2.3% of the total
budget in 1970 to 7.1% in 1972. The agricultural share of public development
expenditures rose from about 2% in 1970 to 8% in 1972. However, although the
trend is commendable, the absolute amounts expended are often still in-
sufficient in relation to the sector's economic and social importance in the
economy and its development potential. Government policy has concentrated on
export promotion and import substitution as well as on efforts to expand the
agricultural frontier through colonization. Major programs among the former
include the import substitution wheat program and tax incentives to the
agricultural processing industry for expanding and modernizing their facili-
ties to promote export. Aided by the rise in international prices, these
efforts have been reasonably successful as reflected in the improved balance
of payments situation. Beneficiaries of this were, however, mostly the larger
entrepreneurs and the effects on national income distribution have been
minimal. The success of Government colonization programs, designed to reduce
the problems of minifundismo, improve income distribution and curb urbanization,
has been limited because often settlement programs have not been combined
with adequate technical and financial assistance for new farmers to develop
their parcels of land above subsistence levels of operation.

FOURTH LIVESTOCK CREDIT PROJECT
Land Settlements and Cooperatives
General
1.        Land settlement schemes of various kinds have played an important
part in the opening up of Paraguay and the development of its resources.
This Annex examines those schemes which have a bearing on livestock production
in general and the Project in particular. Recent developments in the coopera-
tive field are also reviewed in the context of the proposed Project.
Land Settlement
2.        The Institute of Rural Welfare (Instituto de Bienestar Rural--IBR)
is the organization responsible for planning and executing public settlement
programs. Under the Agrarian Statute of 1963, IBR is required to promote
agricultural, agricultural/forestry and livestock settlement. Whereas holdings
for crop production may not exceed 100 ha and are usually about 20 ha in size,
in livestock settlements they may be as large as 1,500 ha in the Eastern Region
and 8,000 ha in the Chaco. Although IBR's main activity has been in the
Eastern Region where 231 agricultural colonies with an average plot size of
20 ha have been established, it has, during the period since its formation
in 1963 to September 1973, created 17 livestock colonies in the Chaco. These
livestock colonies have 1,216 settlers on a total area of nearly 1.8 million
ha, with an average plot size of about 1,500 ha.
3.        In addition, IBR has, during the same period, approved 60 private
colonization schemes in the Eastern Region. In at least six of these, in-
volving a total of 1,700 settlers on 193,000 ha, the average plot size of
114 ha indicates that livestock production is an important part of individual
farm operations.
4.        A third class of colony is made up of settlements established by
foreign immigrant communities under special agreement with Government. Most
of these have become integrated with and have contributed to the general
development of the areas in which they were founded. Two particular types
of foreign settlement (the Mennonites and the Japanese) have retained their
separate identity and are briefly described below.
5.        Under a law passed in 1921, guaranteeing their rights of self-
government and religions and educational freedom, the Mennonite community
has established colonies in Paraguay, including three in the Chaco and four
in the Eastern Region. Each colony is self-governing and provides its own
health and educational services as well as most of the infrastructure.



ANNEX 2

Because of their strong community spirit and capacity for hard work, these
colonists have survived through years of isolation and depression and are
now reinvesting profits resulting from current high agricultural prices to
increase investments.

In addition to the individual holdings, each colony contains a large separate
farm owned and operated by the community.
7.        Under an agreement between the Governments of Paraguay and Japan,
special arrangements apply to colonies established by Japanese settlers in
the Eastern Region. These are controlled and assisted by the Cooperacion
Publica de Servicio Emigratorio del Japon which has offices in Asuncion,
Encarnacion, Alto Parana, Fram and Iguazu, and is supported by the Japanese
Government and Japanese industrial undertakings. Before leaving Japan,
settlers must pay 10% of the price of the land and undertake to repay the
balance to the Corporacion over eight to 12 years, together with interest
at 5% per annum.

Land Titling
8.        Under the Agrarian Statute of 1963, IBR is also responsible for the
issue of land titles to rural property, not only to new settlers under public
colonization schemes but also to regularize the position of "squatters" who
can comply with legal requirements as to length of occupancy, improvement
standards and the like. During the period 1963 to 1972, some 800 titles were
issued by IBR for livestock holdings; 300 of these were in the Eastern Region
with an average area of 400 ha and 500 in the Chaco, where the average size
was 2,500 ha. Some of these titles covered individual holdings under IBR live-
stock settlement schemes (para 2). A settler in a private colony gets his
title from the original landowner as soon as he has paid for his land in
full.  It is likely that at least 1,000 out of the 1,700 settlers under
private colonization schemes mentioned in para 3 above have definitive titles
to their land.
Cooperatives
9.        Until recently, the cooperative movement in Paraguay had not made
much progress, due largely to lack of any controlling organization, insuf-
ficient technical assistance, and outmoded legislation. In fact, the co-
operative law of 1942 covered only the crop sector and made no provision
for specialized livestock organizations.
10.       In 1972, a new cooperative law was passed (Ley 349) based on similar
legislation in other Latin American countries. At the same time, a Cooperative
Department under a Director General was created in the Ministry of Agriculture,
charged with the responsibility for promoting the formation of cooperatives,
providing them with technical assistance and carrying out the registration,
audit and control regulations specified in the law. There are about 200 co-
operatives in Paraguay at present; of these, some 120 are agricultural pro-
duction cooperatives. Recently, taking advantage of the extension of the new
law to cover livestock undertakings, three cooperatives have been formed for
intensive production of poultry.
11.       The present policy of the Cooperative Department is one of consoli-
dation. Existing cooperatives and applications to form new ones (25 have been
received in the past year) are being carefully screened before they are regis-
tered under the new law and technical assistance to them is being stepped up.
Under the new cooperative law, only producers may be members of a production
cooperative and profits must be distributed in proportion to the capital con-
tribution of each member. Production cooperatives frequently provide for
input purchase and distribution, storage, marketing and credit services.
12.       With technical and financial assistance from USAID, a second-tier
cooperative--Union Paraguaya de Cooperativas (UNIPACO)--handles the purchases
and sales (including livestock sales) of some 25-member cooperatives, and also
acts as a channel for cooperative credit. To date the most successful coopera-
tives have been those operated in the Mennonite and the Japanese settlements



ANNEX 2
Page 4
and the "Minga Guazu" cooperative serving the public colony outside Puerto
Presidente Stroessner. Japanese settlers can obtain technical assistance and
limited production and investment credit (up to eight-year terms) at 5% per annum,
financed through their controlling organization. The Minga Guazu cooperative
is already receiving some foreign technical and financial assistance, notably
Swiss bilateral aid. But all have livestock development programs for which
additional investment credit will be needed.
Project Considerations
13.       Available statistics indicate that approximately 1.8 million head
of cattle, or 40% of the national herd, are owned by some 83,000 farmers with
individual herds in the range 100 to 200 head, often forming part of mixed
farming enterprises. Under the Third Project, the FG has made development
loans totalling ¢ 29.8 million (US$236,000) to three Mennonite colonies.
These loans have been made by FG to the cooperative concerned which on-lends
a part to members and uses the balance to finance development of the community
farm. Experience with this type of lending has been good. Through the use
of a sound cooperative structure, FG has been able to reach a larger number
of small producers without incurring unduly high costs on account of loan
administration or in the provision of technical assistance.
\ 14.        Included in the proposed Fourth Project lending programs about 15
sub-loans to cooperatives which are expected to cover, in all, 900 farmers with
average holdings of 120 ha each. Since the larger and longer established
'  cooperatives may well qualify for more than one such sub-loan during the
Project period, the total number of cooperative borrowers is likely to be 10. The
Fourth Project would also include 300 sub-loans to individual farmers with
holdings of an average size of 120 ha. As shown in para 3 above, about 1,700
new individual livestock holdings in this size category have been created
under colonization schemes during the period of 1963 to 1972. Moreover, as
indicated in para 8, some 1,700 new titles for such individual holdings have
been issued during the same period. W4hen allowance is made for the number of
previously existing and titled holdings, it is clear that the number of
proposed beneficiaries (300) in this category is reasonable.

FOURTH LIVESTOCK CREDIT PROJECT
The Livestock to be Financed under the Project
A. Beef Cattle Production
General
1.        With a cattle population estimated at 4.5 million head and slaugh-
terings in the order of 0.7 million head in 1972, cattle production in
Paraguay constitutes about 5% of Paraguay's GDP meets the entire loeal demand
for beef and provides, in addition, about 35% of the total value of exports.
Beef production for 1972 was around 115,000 tons of which 60% were consumed
internally and 40% were exported.
Cattle Numbers, Trends and Herd Structure
2.        Existing cattle statistics are not reliable and differences between
estimates are substantial. Table 7, Annex 1, gives the latest estimates on
cattle numbers, indicating that the cattle population has increased in the last
three years at a rate of 1.5% to 1.8%. Probably due to increased retention of
breeding stock, the extraction rate 1/ seems to have diminished from 16% in
1970 to 14% in 1972.
3.        The total area under pasture is 14.8 million ha of which about 40%
are in the Eastern Region and 60% in the Chaco. The number of cattle in the
Eastern Region was 2.7 million in 1972 with a density of 2.1 ha/head and in
the Chaco 1.8 million-with a density of 4.6 ha/head.
4.        The national herd, as indicated below, is composed of 39% of breeding
cows and 15% of calves, which reflects a low breeding performance.

The following ranch-size distribution in Paraguay reveals that out of a total
of about 85,000 livestock farms, only some 18,000 (22%) could be considered
as commercial enterprises but their share of production is probable as high
as 85%.

Patteru of Production
5.        Commercial cattle production is carried out in an extensive way,
based mainly on natural grassland, with a minimum investment in ranch infrast-
ructure and management. Favorable beef prices and increased financial assis-
tance by FG and commercial banks have strengthened the industry in recent years
through the construction of fences, corrals, water supply facilities and, to a
limited extent, the establishment of improved pastures. Paddock size in large
commercial farms varies from 200 to 5,000 ha but recently some sub-division has
been carried out permitting better supervision particularly of breeding herds.
The construction of corrals has also been highly instrumental in improving vac-
cination and allow better herd management. Most ranches are involved simultan-
eously in breeding and fattening, particularly in the Eastern Region. General-
ly bulls are kept with the herd all year around; heifers are mated at the age
of three and a half years and weaning takes place at about 10 or 12 months.
Steers are marketed at 3-1/2 to 4-1/2 years at an average liveweight of 440 kg.
6.        Cattle are periodically subject to stress due to seasonal pasture
shortage. Nutritional problems, particularly mineral and protein deficiencies,
are mainly responsible for low herd fertility. Weaning rates 1/ are generally
in the order of 35 to 50%. Calf mortality is variable, ranging from 5% to 3%.
This low weaning percentage is due to high losses of calves between calving and
weaning in the Chaco as a result of poor herd management and low conception
rates 2/. In the Eastern Region, low weaning rates are generally attribu-
table to low levels of mineral intake, principally phosphorus.

ANNEX 3
Page 3
7.        In subsistence and/or small commercial ranches, limited dairying
is carried out in some cases by milking four to 10 cows, generally using family
labor. Lactation production per cow varies from 400 to 1,500 litres and milk
is sold in the form of cheese, being picked up at the farm by middlemen. In
many cases, small commercial ranchers pay the foreman a minimum salary but
allow him to milk a few cows to increase his income. These units often have
some poultry and pig production, mainly for home consumption.
8.        The main cattle diseases are brucellosis, parasitosis, rabies, foot-
and-mouth disease, black leg and anthrax. A nationwide foot-and-mouth disease
campaign is being carried out by the Servicio Nacional de la Lucha Contra la
Fiebra Aftosa (SENALFA). The first stage of this program covers the Eastern
Region and some pilot operations are in progress in the Chaco. Outbreaks of
foot-and-mouth disease have been rare since 1970.
9.        The genetic quality of Paraguayan cattle is poor, but considerable
efforts have been made in recent years to improve the standard by crossing
local criollo cattle with Nellore or Brahman bulls. This practice when asso-
ciated with sound management, has resulted in an increase in carcass weight
and a reduction of slaughtering age.
10.       Fattening is generally done on good natural grassland or on culti-
vated pastures, usually established on fertile forest soils after cutting the
trees and burning the vegetation. Under these conditions, carrying capacity
varies from 800 to 1,000 kg liveweight per year per ha, with an annual output
in the order of 600 kg/ha of liveweight. This production level is maintained
during the first four or five years after clearing, decreasing slowly after-
wards.
Constraints and Perspectives
11.       Constraints effecting the expansion of the beef cattle industry
can be divided into four types: institutional, physical, structural and
fiscal.
12.       Institutional.  FG has become the major source of long-term credit
for livestock. Since its early stage, credit priorities have been assigned to
build up basic infrastructure required for better management practices, but so far
FG has oriented its activities mainly toward the development of large ranches
(with the exception of the assistance given to a few Mennonite cooperatives).
A considerable segment of entrepreneurs has, therefore, been left out, mainly
because of limited FG staff and the highly centralized administration of the
FG as well as the problem of collateral (mainly because of low land value).
The BNF has been rather active in assisting medium to small ranchers with
investment credit to the order of ¢ 200 million (US$1.6 million) per year
disbursed between 1968 and 1972, but the repayment period has generally been
limited to five to six years and little technical assistance has been associa-
ted with the credit. MIore emphasis toward long-term on-farm investment on
medium-size farms and a relaxation of the collateral policy taking into account
O  increased land values resulting from investment would mobilize this segment of
the cattle industry.



ANNEX 3
Page 4
13.       Physical.  The main limiting factor in the Paraguayan cattle industry
remains the low extraction rate, resulting from low weaning performance, high
mortality and slow maturity. Fundamental ranch management practices, including
seasonal concentrated mating, pregnancy diagnosis and early weaning are pro-
gressively being adapted to the Paraguayan environment and applied by more
progressive farmers.  But probably the two most important problems affecting
the cattle industry are the low rate of survival of calves in the Chaco region
and the low conception rates amongst breeding herds in the Eastern Region.
The first problem is caused by excessively large paddocks and extended areas
of bush impeding the control of breeding stock, particularly during calving
time. This could be solved through better herd management once an adequate
infrastructure has been constructed within the ranch. Calving paddocks, better
water supply facilities, paddock sub-division as well as seasonal mating are
essential to avoid high calf losses in the Chaco. On the other hand, this
region has no major problems regarding mineral deficiencies and some of the
soils are of good fertility and average conception rates are satisfactory.
The Eastern Region, however, is affected by a different kind of problem:
soils are acid, generally with low fertility (grassland areas), and phosphorus
deficiency obviously responsible for low conception rates. Supplementation
with phosphorus and microelements such as copper and zinc have led to sub-
stantial increases in calving rates, but this practice is limited by the
intake of the animal and the poor palatability of bone flour. Top dressing
of both natural and cultivated pastures with phosphatic fertilizers would
help to eliminate phosphorus deficiencies in cattle and also stimulate the
growth of tropical legumes (the cheapest and most effective source of protein).
But before embarking on any substantial effort to supply phosphorus to cattle
in such a way, it would be essential to determine the most economical amount
of phosphatic fertilizers to be applied on natural and cultivated pastures,
and the most strategic use of these pastures in relation .to the nutritional re-
quirements of cattle, particularly weaners and breeding stock. Therefore, a
practical series of phosphatic fertilizer experiments on this subject would be
needed in order to determine whether future investments in this field are
justifiable.
14.       Ranch Size and Structure. Large ranches and a lax system of taxation
have in the past not encouraged increased productivity. Decisions regarding
investment in ranch infrastructure and application of appropriate herd manage-
ment techniques are dependent on progressive ranchers. This is particularly
important in the case of Paraguay, where half of the cattle are owned by 1%
of the ranchers. On the other hand, the presence of a high number of sub-
sistence and small commercial farmers, seldom grouped in cooperatives or
associations, makes the task of livestock development extremely difficult.
In this context, the inclusion of a significant number of small- and medium-
size farmers in the proposed Fourth Livestock Project would help to define
the best strategy to strengthen this segment of the cattle industry.
15.       Fiscal.  UTntil February 1974, livestock producers paid only a transfer tax
tax (about US$2.00 per animal equivalent) and a sales tax (about US$4.00 per
animal), both on per head basis.  This had a detrimental effect on productivity



ANNEX 3
Page 5
and specialization, not encouraging intensive land use. Unless a rational
taxation system is introduced, based principally on a land tax indexed by a
productivity factor, it will remain a disincentive to increase the intensity
of pasture utilization. In this context, the Government is considering the
possibility of introducing a system which provides for heavy taxation of farms
operating below their potential level of productivity. The tax could be
determined on the basis of the average productivity expected from the differ-
ent types of soils of the property, expressed in annual beef production per ha.
When the minimum potential productivity (which varies with different types of
soils) would not be reached, the basic land tax would be multiplied by the
corresponding taxation factor. Such a land tax would have to be based on a
analysis of the present and potential productivity of the land, expressed in
terms of physical output of the basic commodities (in this case beef). With
the support of USAID, a catastral survey will be initiated soon. Also, with
the support of UNDP and OAS studies are being undertaken to determine soil
productivity in different parts of the country.
B. Dairy Production
16.        Milk production for 1972 was estimated to be approximately 90,000
tons, mainly from 400 dairy farms concentrated around Asuncion. Limited
production is also carried out in Caaguazu, Misiones and the Mennonite colonies
of the Chaco. In the vicinity of Asuncion there are approximately 12,000 dairy
cows of which 50% are of Holstein-Frisian origin, the rest being criollo or
crossbreeds. Yields from good Holstein cows average 2,000 liters per lactation.
Under good management, conception rates are around 60% to 70%. Feeding is
based mainly on high cost concentrates. The present retail price of milk is
¢ 25/liter (US$0.20) and the ex-farm-gate price, ¢ 13/liter (US$0.11). A
considerable number of producers sell their milk directly to consumers.
17.        Dairy production, despite the relatively good prices, is growing
slowly. It is not keeping pace with the demand because of:
(i) high feeding costs;
(ii) high concentration of dairy production in the surroundings
of Asuncion combined with exceedingly small farm sizes, thus
limiting the feasibility of a milk production system based
on pasture; and
(iii) high cost of imported cows, poor adaptability and breeding
performance, bad management practices, and, as a consequence,
high percentage of dry cows.
O   18.         On the other hand, the Mennonite colonies in the Chaco have a
relatively cheap production system based on the utilization of cultivated
pastures, minimal use of concentrates with breeds well adapted to the local
environment.

19.       Milk processing in Asuncion is done in two plants with a total
capacity of 90,000 liters per day. Only 25% of plant capacity is utilized.
Main products, beside pasteurized milk, are yogurt, butter and sweet condensed
milk. Imports of dairy products into Paraguay from 1969 to 1972 fluctuated
between US$0.5 million and US$0.7 million per year.
20.       The FG has not been active in financing dairy production since the
majority of dairy farms have very limited pasture land to be improved and, con-
sequently, offer little possibility of establishing a low cost system of milk
production. This situation is expected to remain static as long as dairying
is confined to the Asuncion vicinity and is carried out mainly in uneconomic
small units, relying substantially on concentrates.
C. Poultry Production
21.       With a total of 7 million birds in Paraguay, poultry production
supplies approximately 2,200 tons of meat and 27 million eggs annually and
the industry has been growing at an estimated rate of 2% per year. Twenty
percent of the birds are concentrated in commercial enterprises of 10,000 to
20,000 units. The main producing areas are the Mennonite colonies in the Chaco,
the Japanese colonies in the Eastern Region and the surroundings of the city
of Asuncion. Day-old chicks are generally imported from Argentina or Brazil
but some are also hatched locally. Feed concentrates are produced in Paraguay
based mainly on maize, wheat bran, soya and groundnut expeller. The price to
the producer per bird for slaughter is 0 140 (US$1.10). Eggs are marketed at
an average of 0 60 (US$0.47) per dozen.
22.       Due to the rising costs of concentrates and the erratic supply of
components the commercial poultry industry has been stagnating. The presence
of a "de facto" monopoly controlling supply of concentrate components is re-
straining the expansion of commercial poultry production. Therefore, it seems
that the most appropriate approach might be to encourage poultry production at
the small farmer level using family labor, relying mainly on farm by-products
and scavenging, and operating with minimal inputs. This policy is being en-
couraged by the Government through credit programs and technical assistance.
In view of the constant increases in the price of grains and the scarcity and
high cost of animal protein, the low cost approach is gradually being adopted
in the colonies and cooperatives as a long-term viable solution.
D. Pig Production
23.       In 1972, the estimated pig population of the country amounted to
0.6 million head, growing at 2% to 3% per year. Annual output is approxi-
mately 776,000 head slaughtered.  With the exception of a few commercial
enterprises and some colonies, pig production is carried out mainly by small



ANNEX 3
Page 7
farmers and seldom constitutes a specialized enterprise, being usually a side-
line on the farms. Main improved breeds are Landrace, Large White, Duroc
Jersey, and Berkshire. Pigs are generally marketed between 100 and 150 kg
liveweight and the tendency has been to produce a lard type. Semi-extensive
methods of breeding are based on feeding manioc and maize and letting the hogs
graze and scavenge on cultivated pastures. Prevailing diseases are hog cholera
and swine fever, responsible for high mortality in 1971. Producers are paid
0 45/kg liveweight (US$0.36).
24.       Like the poultry industry, expansion of the pig industry is limited by
the high cost of inputs, principally concentrates. Government policy has not
been oriented toward expansion of commercial medium- or large-size pig enter-
prises but towards production on small farms, aiming principally at self-suffi-
ciency in feeds grown on the farms. Credit and technical assistance have been
provided for this purpose mainly by BNF. This approach seems to have been
widely adopted in the colonies but its impact on the implementation of a beef
substitution policy will be minimal, particularly due to problems of physical
access to markets, management and the fact that retail prices are exceedingly
high compared with those of beef.
25.       Within the Fourth Livestock Project, a limited pig,. poultry and
dairy component would be included for small farmers and cooperatives, to
increase food production at family level and to provide supplementary income.

PARAGUAY
FOURTH LIVESTOCK CREDIT PROJECT
Production and Marketing of Commodities
To be Financed under the Project
A. Markets
1.        Paraguay traditionally has been one of the Latin American countries
producing mainly beef as reflected in the pattern of land use, production,
consumption and exports. The large number of cattle in relation to its popula-
tion (2 to 3:1) has permitted the country to become a small but, nevertheless,
significant supplier of meat to the international market, contributing about
2% to total world beef exports.
2.        Cattle production, as indicated by registered slaughterings (which
excludes uncontrolled exports as well as herd buildup) has varied over the
last 10 years between 600,000 and 700,000 head per year. Slaughterings in-
creased very slowly in the sixties with an average annual increase significantly
below the population growth rate. In 1971/72, about two-thirds of the slaught-
ered cattle were consumed domestically, while the remaining one-third was ex-
ported. Since 1969/70 there has been a decrease in domestic consumption and
an increase of exports in absolute and relative terms. The reduction of domes-
tic beef utilization, (0.5 million head per year between 1968 and 1970 to 0.4
million head in 1972) was a result of internal beef price rises combined with
real wages decreases and very attractive export prices. Consequently, domestic
per capita consumption of beef dropped from about 40 kg per year between 1968
and 1970 to an average of about 29 kg in 1972 without any significant substi-
tution by other meats. The volume of exports rose almost exclusively at the
expense of domestic consumption, increasing from 17,700 tons to 32,900 tons of
beef and meat preparations between 1968 and 1972, or at an annual rate of about
20%. In value terms, exports increased over the same period at an even faster
rate, by more than 30% per annum because of fast rising international beef
prices and changes in composition of exports from low value meat preparations,
mainly corned beef, to higher value frozen beef.
3.        Traditional importers of Paraguayan beef have been the USA and EEC.
The export increase during the last three years has been mainly absorbed by
the latter countries which accounted in 1972 for 70% of all Paraguayan beef
exports.



ANNEX 4       
Page 2
4.         Pig and poultry production is of much less importance than beef
as it is consumed entirely internally and per capita consumption levels are
very low at 4.5 kg and 0.8 kg per year for pork and poultry, respectively.
Domestic dairy output covers 90% of domestic demand. Significant imports of
powdered milk and cheese, valued at US$0.7 million in 1972, are required to
meet the very modest per capita consumption levels of 27 litres of milk, 1.9 kg
of cheese and 0.2 kg of butter per year.
5.         Because of the strong international demand for beef and the exist-
ing backlog in meeting domestic beef demand, no problems are foreseen in dis-
posing of the incremental annual production from the Project at full development,
amounting to about 64,000 slaughtered cattle or 9% of present slaughterings in
either of the two markets. The additional production of pork, poultry, milk
and eggs from the proposed Project is small in relation to present production
levels (1%, 3%, 4% and about 10% respectively). Therefore, and in view of the
very low consumption levels prevailing, no difficulties are expected in the
absorption of these amounts in the domestic markets. This assumption is also
supported by the fact that pork and poultry are appropriate substitutes for
domestically scarce beef and because of the existing domestic supply gap for
cheese and milk.
B. Marketing System and Facilities
6.         In general, there is free movement of livestock from the producer
to the domestic market and Government control is limited to the issue of
transfer permits and sanitary inspection at some of the cattle slaughterhouses
and at the meat processing plants. Although simple and not without shortcom-
ings, the marketing system has been reasonably adequate for channelling the
production from the producer to the market. Existing problems limiting, to a
certain extent, its effectiveness relate mainly to difficult transportation
conditions in the hinterland, a lack of price information and price stratifica-
tion and iinconsistencies in price and export regulations. Consequently, mar-
keting costs are relatively high. Current and unbiased price information is
available only to about half of the ranchers and quality and time characteristics
of demand are not adequately reflected in farm-gate prices giving farmers little
incentive to adjust their production to specific demand. In 1973, the ceilings
on cattle price for the domestic market and on export volume distorted the
balance of the flow of cattle to the two markets and gave increasingly rise
to smuggling, mainly into Brazil. In February 1974, the ceiling on domestic
prices was removed (para 15).
7.         There are three major marketing channels for cattle:  direct sales
to slaughterhouses or exporting meat plants (about 30% of transactions);
selling to independent cattle dealers, who, in turn, sell to slaughterhouses
or meat plants (about 55% of sales); and sale to agents of meat plants (about
15% of sales). In general, sale prices (about 77%) are established on a
liveweight estimate but, in 13% of the transactions, sales are based on a
per head basis and, for only 10%, prices relate to the carcass weight. If



ANNEX 4
Page 3
an intermediary is involved, his fee amounts usually to slightly more than
1X of the sale price. Transportation of cattle to the market is done, in
about equal proportions, by driving on the hoof or trucking except for a small
number which are transported by river and railway. Average transport costs
per head vary between ¢ 0.6 and ¢ 2.5, depending on the mode and regional
transport conditions. The average distance of haul is almost 200 km and
weight losses during the trip are reported to be between 3 and 13 kg per
animal.
8.         Cattle earmarked for domestic consumption have until recently
been slaughtered exclusively in one of the 69 municipal slaughterhouses,
generally under precarious technical and hygienic conditions. Cattle for
export are handled by the packing plants. In the past, the export market
was quite firmly controlled by three private firms (two of them foreign
owned). But since 1969, six more plants have been established and an
additional one is under construction, improving considerably the ranchers'
competitive price position. The combined installed capacity exceeds the
actual throughput level by some 30%.
9.         Marketing procedures for hogs, poultry, milk and cheese are little
developed largely because of the small quantities which enter commercial trade
channels. A large portion of these products are for subsistence or are sold
directly to local consumers. Industrial facilities, with an installed capacity
to handle 90,000 litres of milk per day, exist for supplying Asuncion with
processed dairy products. Actual utilization of the two existing plants does
not exceed 25% of their capacity. Hogs entering commercial market channels
are slaughtered concurrently with cattle in municipal slaughterhouses.
10.        Although there is room for improvement in the marketing system
and facilities, actual market capacity is capable of handling the additional
output expected from the proposed Project without difficulty.
C. Prices and Taxes
11.        Most agricultural commodity prices are set by market forces.  Until
the end of 1970, producer priees (Table 1) for cattle were generally low in
relation to production cost, using prevailing techniques. Until 1970, the
producer received about 0 20 per kg liveweight (US$0.16/kg), making cattle
production using traditional methods a rather marginal economic operation
with net returns to total investments barely exceeding 2%. However, between
1970 and March 1973 average cattle prices rose by 105% to about 0 42/kg
(US$0.33 kg) thus increasing revenues to cattle producers significantly and
creating a very favorable climate for additional investment in the sub-sector.
Efficient farmers producing for export have received prices of up to 0 60
(US$0.48) per kg.



ANNEX 4
Page 4
12.        Price trends for hogs, poultry and eggs have been similar.  Producer
prices in March 1973 were 0 45 (US$0.36) per kg pig (liveweight), 0 140 (US$1.10)
per bird and 0 58 (US$0.56) per dozen for eggs.  However, price increases for
these commodities since 1970 have been less than for beef, averaging only 48%
for the three products. This, and the fact that prices of feed inputs used for
their production have risen about 100% or about three times as much as output
prices, has lessened the advantage of these production lines compared with
beef and grain production.         0
13.        Milk prices at about 0 13 per litre are relatively high and they
have remained more or less stable over the last 10 years. However, dairy
production is based largely on feed grains which have experienced a 100% price
rise since 1970 and production has become increasingly unattractive. Given
this unfavorable relationship between input and output prices and the pre-
vailing low productivity level, milk production is financially viable only
if the fodder base is changed from feed grains to pasture or forage crops
or if the milk is marketed as cheese.
14.        Taxes during marketing are restricted to cattle output.  They include
a levy of 0 500 (US$3.97) per head sold as a substitute for ranchers' income
tax and 0 100 (US$0.79) per head as a contribution to the national foot-and-
mouth disease program. In addition, there is a transfer tax of 0 250 (US$1.98)
per head for moving cattle from one ranch to another or to the slaughter plants.
IIeat packers pay a complementary tax of 0 506 (US$4.02) per head slaughtered
and an additional 0 300 (US$2.38) for each animal killed for export. W4hen cattle
are supplied from a ranch owned by a meat plant, they also pay a levy of 0 600
(US$4.76) per head as a substitute for income tax as do the ranchers. Further-
more, exports carry various custom fees which amount to a total of about 0 25
(US$0.20) per head. If cattle are exported on the hoof, a 0 300 (US$2.38) per
head export tax is charged. As a result, revenue yield on cattle internally
sold is about 0 850 (US$6.75) per head, increasing to 0 1,356 (US$10.76) on cat-
tle slaughtered for domestic consumption and about 0 1,681 (US$13.34) on those
slaughtered for export, plus the additional export surtax introduced in February
1974 (see para 15 below).
15.        Rising world market prices for beef had a negative effect on domestic
beef consumption (para 2.04 and Annex 4, para 2). To prevent further declines
in domestic consumption of beef Government established export controls and fixed
domestic beef prices. This measure was expected to prevent further heating
up the country's inflationary problems. In addition to the above regulations,
Government introduced in February 1974 an export surtax of 0 2,000 (US$16) for
each head of cattle slaughtered for export, and removed the domestic beef price
control. However, Government intends to keep such a tax rate flexible in order
to maintain an appropriate level of supply for local consumption without unduly
weakening farmers' production incentives or encourage illegal exports to neigh-
boring Brazil. Before deciding on measures for 1975, the Government and the
Bank would review the effects of relevant policies for the livestock sub-sector.

The Banking System
1.        The banking system is controlled by the Central Bank of Paraguay (CB)
within the terms of the General Banking Law (Decree Law No. 20 of March 1952).
Banking institutions subject to the General Banking Law are the state-owned
Banco Nacional de Fomento (BNF) and ten commercial banks. A number of non-
bank financial institutions such as insurance companies, pension funds, a
state-owned small-farmer credit institution, Credito Agricola de Habilitacion
(CAH), and a privately owned development corporation, Compania Paraguaya de
Desarrollo (CONDESA), are subject to certain provisions of the General Banking
Law and to the control of CB.
Central Bank of Paraguay (CB)
2.        CB was established in 1952 when the now defunct Bank of Paraguay
was relieved of its central banking functions. CB's principal duty is to
apply monetary credit and exchange policies. Among its more important
functions are the control of the currency issue, the establishment of bank
interest rates on both deposits and loans, the determination and enforcement
of statutory reserve requirements and, through the Superintendency of Banks
which forms part of the Central Bank, the supervision of the banking system
and of other institutions subject to the General Banking Law. CB is also
empowered by law to advise on all domestic and foreign borrowing by the
Government although its opinion may be overruled by the National Council
for Economic Coordination. CB provides rediscount facilities to the banking
system and provides substantial loan finance to BNF. Fondo Ganadero (FG)
which was established within CB to hold and manage Bank/IDA financed funds
for livestock production is described in Annex 8.
Banco Nacional de Fomento (BNF)
3.        BNF is Paraguay's largest banking institution, with 50% of the loan
balances and 12% of the deposits held by the banking system. It is the major
source of medium- and long-term development loans, particularly to the agricul-
tural sector (Table 1). BNF, which consists of three departments and has 36
branches and agencies distributed throughout the country, is described in more
detail in Annex 9.
Commercial Banks
O    4.         Of the ten commercial banks operating in Paraguay, eight are
affiliates of foreign banks. All have their principal offices in Asuncion



ANNEX 7
Page 2
where there are also 17 branch offices; there are 26 branch offices located
at 14 towns outside the capital.  The commercial banks' lending operations are
financed by deposits from the private sector and by short-term revolving
credits from abroad. The bulk of these funds is channeled into the commercial
and industrial sectors which absorb 67% and 17%, respectively, of commercial
bank lending. Historically, the commercial banks have been reluctant to
finance lending in agriculture because of the relatively high risks. However,
there has been some increase in lending to agriculture in recent years,
principally for livestock fattening and, since mid-1972, in response to
higher agricultural product prices for crop production, although it has been
essentially of a short-term nature and highly selective. In March 1972, by
Resolution No. 40, CB required commercial banks to restructure their lending
portfolios so that 25% would comprise loans to industry, 20% to exports and
5% to agriculture. Loans made under the new policy, which was to be fully
implemented by April 1973, must be of a minimum maturity of 240 days with
an interest rate of 10% per annum. In addition, banks are permitted to charge
a commission of 2% on 240-day loans, 2.5% on loans of from 240 to 360 days
and 3% on loans in excess of 360 days. Banks may rediscount with CB 20% of
loans made under Resolution No. 40 at a rate of 5% per annum. As a result
of the lower interest and commission rates now permitted on half their port-
folios (interest rates of 12% per annum and unrestricted commission rates,
often as high as 8% per annum, are permitted on their other lending) com-
mercial banks have been obliged to reduce the rate of interest paid to
depositors by one percentage point per annum. Rates now range from 5% per
annum on savings accounts to 7% per annum on 12-month fixed deposits. How-
ever, as banks are required to maintain statutory deposits with CB equivalent
to 42% of all demand, savings and time deposits, the effective cost of such
funds to the banks is between 8.6% and 12%. Commercial bank lending for
agricultural and livestock production in 1972, totalling 0 1,595 million
(US$12.7 million), represented 7.6X of their total lending during the year.
At the end of 1972, the balances of loans, outstanding to the agricultural
sector formed 14% of the commercial banks total lending portfolio.
Credito Agricola de Habilitacion (CAR)
5.        CAR is an autonomous public institution operating under the overall
authority of the Ministry of Agriculture. It was founded in 1943 to provide
credit and other services to small farmers and operated in this area until
1960 when a bad repayment position compelled it to restrict its activities
to loan collections. CAH recommenced lending at the end of 1969 when CB agreed
to reschedule an old debt of 0 140 million (US$1.1 million) and to provide/
new resources while Government agreed to make an annual budgetary alloca 4on
to assist with operating expenses. CAUl has made some progress since it/re-
started lending but it is short of working capital and staff and is not likely
to make a significant impact on agriculture credit availability unless these
deficiencies are rectified. Its total lending in 1972, all of which was on
short term, amounted to only ¢ 31 million (US$246,000).

Compania Paraguaya de Desarrollo, S.A. (COMDESA)
6.        COMDESA, a private development bank established in Asuncion,
commenced operations in March 1971. It has an authorized and paid-in share
capital of ¢ 126 million (US$1 million), half of which is owned by private
shareholders, one-quarter by local commercial banks and one-quarter by Adela
Investment Co., S.A. In addition to its paid-in capital, COMDESA's resources
include a Government loan of C 50 million (US$0.4 million) and a USAID loan
of US$2.6 million.
7.        COMDESA's policy is to finance investments in development-oriented
projects including, where necessary, feasibility studies and technical
assistance. At December 31, 1972, COMDESA had approved 103 loans, totalling
C 476 million (US$3.8 million), of which 35% was for agriculture and livestock
and 33% for agro-industries.
8.        More than 70% of COMDESA loans are of long-term (five to 10 years)
maturity, while the remainder are for medium-term (two to five years).  Interest
rates are fixed at 10% per annum for loans expressed in US dollars and 12% per
annum for loans expressed in Guaranies.

FOURTH LIVESTOCK CREDIT PROJECT
The Fondo Ganadero (FG)
Background
1.        The First and Second Livestock Project were partially financed by
two IDA Credits, 47-PA in 1963 and 86-PA in 1966, amounting to US$3.6 million
and US$7.5 million, respectively. They were administered on behalf of Govern-
ment by the Central Bank (CB), operating through a coordinating committee.
This committee, consisting of a senior representative of CB as chairman, a
representative of the Banco Nacional de Fomento (BNF) and the technical
director of the Project (an expatriate contracted in accordance with the
Credit Agreements), was responsible for approving sub-loans to ranchers and
machinery contractors. BNF provided technical and banking services for the
preparation of ranch development plans, for assessing the creditworthiness
of applicants, for making disbursements of sub-loans approved by the coordi-
nating committee, and for collecting repayments.
2.        Under these arrangements, CB carried the financial risk on sub-
loans to ranchers. Counterpart funds came from collections of debts from
the defunct ex-Banco de Paraguay. This was not always satisfactory. The
technical director found it necessary to assume the major burden for Project
administration and was, in practice, the project director. Furthermore, under
this arrangement the technical director was located in CB, whereas the local
technicians were employed by and located in BNF. This made it difficult
for the technical director to provide adequate technical assistance to partic-
ipating ranchers so as to maximize the benefits of investments financed under
the Projects.
The Fondo Ganadero (FG)
3.        With the experience gained in the two Projects, the Government and
Bank/IDA agreed to make certain modifications in the management and admin-
istration of the Third Project. To this effect, the Bank/IDA Loan and Credit
Agreements, 620-PA and 156-PA of June 1969, introduced two main amendments:
(a) the establishment of FG under the jurisdiction of CB. FG, managed by
a coordinating committee, was established to hold and manage all funds made
available for, or accruing from the First, Second and Third Livestock Project;
and (b) the establishment of a Livestock Project Division by BNF to assist in
carrying out BNF's obligations as described under an amended "Operating
*    Agreement" between Government, CB and BNF.



ANNEX 8              0
Page 2
4.        To implement the two amendments mentioned above, the Government
by Presidential Decree of September 12, 1969, created the FG as an entity under
the jurisdiction of Central Bank to have the exclusive administration of all
funds of the three Bank/IDA assisted livestock Projects. FG is administered by
a coordinating committee of three members: a senior staff member of CB, nomina-
ted after consultation with Bank/IDA; a senior staff member of BNF, nominated on
the same manner, and the technical director of the Project. The representative
of CB is chairman of the coordinating committee and the legal representative
of FG. Even though FG is under the jurisdiction of CB, it has been granted
full legal personality and representation.
5.        By the same Presidential Decree, it is provided that FG will be
provided with resources as follows: all rights and obligations accruing from
IDA Credits, 47-PA, 86-PA and 156-PA, and Bank Loan 620-PA, which were trans-
ferred by CB; 50% of the recuperations from the loan portfolio of the defunct
Banco del Paraguay and any other resources that the Government or Central Bank
may contribute to FG to complement the counterpart funds of the borrower as
provided for under the Credit/Loan Agreements with IDA and the Bank; and the
funds collected for amortization of principal and interest paid by the benefi-
ciaries of the three livestock Projects. CB is responsible for the supervision
of operations and financial condition of FG; for assuring of availability of
resources assigned to FG; for ascertaining, through its representative on the
coordinating committee, that FG operations are carried out in accordance with
Bank/IDA Agreements; and for the annual audit of the accounts, balances and
financial statements. CB also seconds certain personnel and provides legal
and administrative services, for which it is reimbursed on a monthly basis.
6.        In 1973 FG had a staff of 20, consisting of the chairman of the
coordinating committee, the legal adviser, the secretary of the coordinating
committee with three assistants, the chief of the administrative division
with seven assistants, the technical director, two technicians working on the
evaluation of the first two Projects, and three general office personnel.
Records are maintained on all sub-borrowers in each of the three Projects
and a daily financial balance is available, in addition to an up-to-date
situation of each ranch plan.
7.        Financial resources of FG, as of September 30, 1973, were US$17
million, received from Bank/IDA Loan/Credits; US$1.3 million equivalent from
Government contribution to FG from the 50% collected from debts to the ex-
Banco del Paraguay and US$4.3 million equivalent of resources from accumulated
surpluses. However, due to two US$ devaluations, FG incurred liabilities in
relation to IDA funds received equivalent to US$3.1 million, reducing the
above surpluses accordingly.
The Livestock Project Division of BNF (under Previous Projects)
8.        In accordance with the Loan/Credit Agreements for the Third Project,
BNF by resolution of its administrative council dated November 1969, created
the Livestock Project Division within its Development Department.  This            0



ANNEX 8
Page 3
division was headed by a senior technician and 20 other technicians (loan
officers), two financial analysts and five general office personnel. This
division was assigned by BNF to work exclusively for the Project. The task
of the livestock project division was to: assist ranchers in the prepararion
of ranch plans and the formulation of sub-loan applications, appraise ranchers'
sub-loan applications, valuate the goods offered as collateral, perform sub-
loan supervision, prepare reports to FG, and provide technical assistance to
sub-borrowers. BNF was also responsible for the preparation of the legal
documents concerning the sub-loans approved and granted by FG, the disbursement
and accounting of the funds provided to sub-borrowers and the collection of
interest and principal of the FG sub-loans which were then transferred to
FG's account in CB.
9.         For the services mentioned, BNF was authorized to retain from the
amounts collected 2% per year of the outstanding principal due from sub-loans
made with funds from IDA Credits 47-PA and 86-PA, and 1% per year from the
first to the fifth year, 0.75% per year from the sixth to the tenth year and
0.50% from the eleventh year on in the case of sub-loans made by FG, starting
on the date of Loan/Credit Agreements, 620-PA and 156-PA.
10.        The operating agreement between FG and BNF expired on June 30, 1974
and CB decided to permit FG to employ its own technicians, open field offices,
handle loan transactions and thus sever its ties with BNF under which the
latter provided technical and banking services. FC intends to take over
former BNF technicians working under the Project.

FOURTH LIVESTOCK CREDIT PROJECT
Banco Nacional de Fomento (BNF)
General
1.         BNF, a Government-owned autonomous entity under the authority of
the Ministry of Finance, was established by Decree Law No. 281, 1961 follow-
ing the closure of the Bank of Paraguay. Its stated objectives are "to
promote and finance general programs and specific projects to develop agri-
culture, livestock, forestry industry and commerce."
Administrative Council
2.         BNF is governed by an Administrative Council comprising a President
and seven members. The President, who is BNF's legal representative, is
appointed by the President of the Republic, with the agreement of the State,
Council for a period of five years. The other Council members, four of whom
represent Government (from the Ministries of Finance, Agriculture & Industry
and Commerce and from the Central Bank) and three representatives of the agri-
cultural, livestock and industrial sectors, are also appointed by the
President of the Republic, with the agreement of the State Council, for three
year renewable terms. The Council is responsible for formulating BNF policy
and regulations and for the approval of programs, budgets and accounts.
Organization and Management
3.         BNF has three main operating departments, each of which has its own
share capital. These are:
(a) The Commercial and Savings Department which has paid-in cap-
ital of $ 247 million (US$2.0 million) and is responsible for
all normal commercial banking operations. It receives cur-
rent, fixed and savings deposits from the public and, like
private commercial banks, is subject to a CB regulation re-
quiring that 42% of all such deposits be lodged in a statutory
reserve account with CB. As a result of the high reserve re-
quirement the actual cost of deposits ranges from 10.3% to
13.8% per annum. During 1973, deposits from the public of
all types increased by 0 636 million (US$5.0 million), or 43%
over 1972. Funds are also obtained by way of loans from CB
and other internal and external sources. The Commercial and
Savings Department makes overdrafts and short-term advances,
_              rarely exceeding six months maturity, for commercial and in-
dustrial purposes. Nominal interest rates range from 10% to
12% per annum, but effective rates, inclusive of commissions,
are from 11% to 16% per annum,



ANNEX 9
Page 2
(b) The Development Department, which has a paid-in capital of ¢ 575
million (US$4.6 million) provides mainly medium-term (up to five
years) and long-term (five to 12 years) loans for agricultural,
industrial and other types of investment of a developmental na-
ture at effective interest rates ranging from 9% to 13% per annum.
Sources of funds are loans from the. CB, recoveries from the out-
standing portfolio of the former Banco del Paraguay and external
loans.
(c) The Agriculture and Livestock Department with a paid-in capital
of 0 700 million (US$5.6 million) provides investment and sea-
sonal credit to crop and livestock farmers, mainly under a series
of programs partly financed by external agencies. The most sig-
nificant of these programs, both in terms of volume of lending
and of its impact on BNF finances, is the national grain program.
Under this program, which was initiated by Government in 1966 to
increase local production of wheat and other food grains, BNF
hurriedly made large loans for up to 100% of Project cost mainly
to absentee landowners, who, in most cases, had little or no
experience in grain production. Loan appraisal was minimal, with
the result that wheat was planted on marginal land unsuitable
for wheat production, there was a large degree of over-investment
in machinery and, reportedly, substantial funds were misused.
The massive default which has resulted from this ill-conceived
and grossly mismanaged program has virtually decapitalized BNF,
(para 11).
4.        In addition to the three operating departments, BNF has an Adminis-
tration Department which is planned to perform all accounting and administra-
tive functions on behalf of the operating departments. In 1973, Administration
Department processed deposits, current accounts and personnel salaries and it
is intended that it will take over the maintenance of loan accounts in 1974.
Each of the departments is headed by an Executive Director appointed by the
Administrative Council. Executive Directors are required to attend all meet-
ings of the Administrative Council.
5.        A successful scheme administered by BNF has been the Agricultural
and Livestock Promotion Program (PPA) which has been partly financed by three
IDB loans totalling US$16.9 million. During the ten years ended December 31,
1972, BNF granted about 38,000 loans amounting to ¢ 3.8 billion (US$30 million)
under the PPA, of which one-third was for seasonal credit and two-thirds for
on-farm investments. Seasonal credit is granted against chattel mortgage for
up to one year and investment credit is provided against land mortgage for up
to 12 years inclusive of a four-year grace period. Interest rates on loans
made under the PPA are 9% per annum with a commission of 1% of the loan. BNF
plays an important role in the channelling of finance to the livestock sub-sec-
tor, both by the provision of banking and technical assistance to Fondo Ganadero
(Annex 8) and by direct lending.  During 1972, BNF lent ¢ 210 million (US$1.7
million) from its own resources for livestock production, of which O 177 million
(US$1.4 million) was to 234 small livestock farmers under the PPA.

ANNEX 9
Page 3
6.         The Agriculture and Livestock Department departs from BNF's general
policy of lending only to farmers with land titles in the case of loans to
small farmers, particularly settlers, made under specific agreements with
Instituto de Bienestar Rural (IBR) and Credito Agricola de Habilitacion (CAR)
and to a few cooperatives which are being developed by AID financed technical
assistance. Under the IBR agreement, BNF makes loans to settlers in specified
colonies secured by IBR guarantee.
Staffing
7.         Staff on December 31, 1972 totalled 832 of whom nearly half had
less than five years service with BNF. The staff, although generally of good
caliber, is numerically excessive, particularly at the head office, in re-
lation to BNF's activities. Furthermore, the large majority comprises ac-
countants and clerks, while there are insufficient technical staff to give
adequate coverage to borrowers in the agricultural sector. At the end of
1972, BNF employed only 17 veterinarians, of whom 14 were seconded to work
with Fondo Ganadero, 37 agricultural graduates and 27 agricultural technicians.
Staff salaries are similar to the Central Bank and private banks and higher
than those paid by Government and semi-Government agencies for comparative
levels of work.
Capital and Reserves
8.         The Decree Law under which BNF was established set its authorized
capital at 0 1.5 billion (US$11.9 million) to be wholly owned by Government.
Initially 0 345 million (US$2.7 million) of the authorized capital was sub-
scribed from assets of the defunct Bank of Paraguay but, as part of this
subscription comprised a portion of the largely delinquent loan portfolio
of the Bank of Paraguay, BNF was extremely short of operating capital from
the outset. The authorized capital was increased by 0 600 million (US$4.8
million) in 1966 and by a further ¢ 500 million (US$4.0 million) in 1973.
Subscribed capital was provided at an average annual rate of 0 127 million
(US$1.0 million) from budgetary allocations, interest collections on Bank of
Paraguay loans and 20% of Central Bank annual net profits until, on December
31, 1973, it totalled 0 1,523 million (US$12 million). The distribution of
capital between departments was as follows:
Department                        Authorized       Subscribed
C-(o million)---i
Commercial and Savings                       400              247
Development                                1,000              576
Agriculture and Livestock                  1,200              700
Total:         2,600           1,523
9.         BNF's law provides for the establishment of reserves on the
following basis:



ANNEX 9
Page 4
(a)  Development Department:  Net profit to be allocated to a reserve
for bad debts until it reaches 10% of the portfolio and thereafter
to other reserves as necessary until total reserves reach 50% of
authorized capital, when net profits will be transferred to capi-
tal; and
(b)  Comercial and Savings Department:  Net profit to be shared equally
between capital and reserves.
No reserve requirements are stipulated for the'Agriculture and Livestock
Department. In addition to its legal reserves, BNF has established specific
reserve accounts as follows:
(a) revaluation reserve to make provision for the revaluation of the
head office building;
(b) exchange risk reserve which has been set up in connection with
IDB loans and is maintained by allocations equivalent to
one-sixth of the gross earnings on sales of goods related to
these loans; and
(c) special social and financial aid reserve which is linked with a
loan from the Kreditanstalt fuer Wiederaufbau (Federal Republic of
Germany) and is maintained by annual allocations equivalent to
1.5% of the outstanding balance of this loan with the object of
providing funds to finance other projects.
10.        Reserves account balances at December 31, 1973 totalled 0 270
million (US$2.1 million) and reserves plus retained unallocated earnings were
equivalent to 18% of BNF's paid-in capital. BNF makes additional provision
for bad debts by annual transfers to an allowance for doubtful loans account.
The amount of the annual transfer is based on a management assessment of the
portfolio. At December 31, 1973, provisions for bad debts totalled 0 847
million (US$6.7 million) which was equivalent to 9.3% of BNF's portfolio, in-
cluding interest receivable, after transfer of the wheat program loans to
Government account. The bad debt provision in relation to the BNF portfolio,
inclusive of wheat program loans, was 7.9%.
Resources
11.        BNF has been chronically short of working capital since its estab-
lishment and has been obliged to use borrowed funds to finance the major part
of its lending activities throughout its history. Since the failure of the
wheat program (para 3c), which resulted in loans totalling more than BNF's
paid-in capital going into default, BNF has had to rely entirely on deposits
from the public, Central Bank financing and external borrowings to finance
its lending operations.



ANNEX 9
Page 5
12.        Deposits are received by the Commercial and Savings Department and
are subject to CB's statutory deposit requirement of 42%. During the five years
ended December 31, 1972, BNF's deposits increased from ¢ 964 million (US$7.7
million) to ¢ 1.5 billion (US$11.9 million), an increase of 57% over the period,
compared with a 106% increase in deposits held by private banks. This reflected
the preference given by depositors to the private banks which are in a position
to grant commercial loans immediately, whereas BNF, because of its liquidity
problems, cannot always satisfy applicants quickly. However, during the first
eight months of 1973, BNF's deposits increased by 55% to ¢ 2.3 billion (US$18.3
million), compared with a 20% increase recorded by private banks. This was
due to the fact that, early in the year, new CB regulations had restricted
the private banks' portfolio earnings, causing them to reduce their deposit
interest rates to one percentage point below those offered by BNF. As a re-
sult of the substantial increase in deposits held by BNF, its share of total
deposits with the banking system, amounting to ¢ 16 billion (US$130 million)
at August 31, 1973, was 14.3%, compared with 11.5% at the end of 1972. BNF's
deposit interest rates during the third quarter of 1973 were 6% per annum on
savings deposits, 7% per annum on deposits fixed for six months and 8% per
annum on 12 months deposits.

FOURTH LIVESTOCK CREDIT PROJECT
Economic Rate of Return
1.        The rate of return from the Project to the economy has been
calculated separately for each farm model. For the economic evaluation,
the following assumptions have been made:
(a) except for beef, which accounts for 95% of the Project output,
present domestic prices prevailing in mid-1973 have been used
for estimating benefits throughout the life of the Project.
The present beef price of ¢ 50 per kg liveweight (US$0.40)
has been reduced in accordance with the projections for 1980
of the Bank's Commodity and Export Projections Division;
(b) present prices have been used for investments and current
expenditure after making due allowances for taxes and customs
duties on imported items; and
(c) the residual value of breeding stock has been accounted for.
2.        Table 1 presents the streams of costs and benefits over the as-
sumed 20-year economic life of the Project. The estimated rates of return
are 27% for the smaller farmers (Model I), 16% for the large ranches in the
Oriental area (Model II) and 24% for large ranches in the Chaco (Model III).
The aggregate estimated economic rate of return for the three investment
models is 20%.
3.        To measure the Project's sensitivity to deviations from the basic
price assumptions, two alternative sets of livestock product prices have been
made:
(a) a reduction of prices by 10% for all livestock products; and
(b) a reduction of prices by 20% for all livestock products.
As a result of the 10% price reduction, the overall rate of return from the
Project drops to 18% and in case of a 20% price reduction, to 16%.
