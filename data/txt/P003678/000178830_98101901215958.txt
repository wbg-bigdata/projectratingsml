DEPARTMENT OF POSTS AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS (P&T)
APPRAISAL OF THE SECOND TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
io        The project appraised in this report constitutes the first phase
(1976-78) of the seventh development plan (1976-80) of P&T, the operating
entity responsible for public telecommunications services in Fiji. A Bank
loan of US$5 million is proposed, which would finance about 52% of the
foreign exchange cost of the project whose total cost is estimated at
US$14.0 million equivalent.
ii.       The borrower would be the Government of Fiji and the beneficiary
would be P&T.
iii.      The 3-year project (1976-78) aims to expand existing telecom-
munications facilities and to spread the services to areas presently having
no telecommunications. The project will support Fijits development objec-
tives by providing essential services to tourism, industry, trade, agricul-
ture, forestry, business and administration. The project will also improve
telecommunications services with neighboring territories in the South
Pacific region.
iv.       The project is technically and financially sound, and economi-
cally justified. The internal economic rate of return is estimated to be
at least 15%.
v.        The proposed loan would be the second for telecommunications
development in Fiji. The first loan, 833-FIJ made in 1972, provided for
the expansion of local telephone systems, the extension of the long distance
system throughout the main island of Viti Levu and between Viti Levu and
other islands, and the expansion of telex services to meet existing demand.
This project is progressing satisfactorily and would be completed by mid
1976. All covenants of the Loan Agreement are being met and the institution-
building process of reorganizing P&T's financial procedures and implementing
a commercial accounting system is well in progress.
vi.       All Bank-financed items of the project with the exception of
telephone switching equipment would be procured through international compe-
titive bidding in accordance with Bank Group Guidelines for Procurement.
The major part of the switching equipment included in the project will be
required for the extension of existing exchanges. For reasons of economy,
compatibility and standardization, this equipment has to be bought from the
original supplier. The Bank's agreement to this purchase would be subject
to prices being in line with international prices. The total estimated cost
of this procurement would be US$1.21 million or about 24O of the proposed
Bank loan.



- ii -
vii.      P&T's management and staff are well qualified to carry out the
project. Consultants would assist P&T in the procurement of the major part
of the equipment.  P&Tts financial position is sound, and the forecasts
indicate that this will continue throughout the project period.
viii.     The project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$5 million for a
term of 20 years including a grace period of 5 years.

DEPARTMENT OF POSTS AND TELECOMMIJNTCATIONS (P&T)
APPRAISAL OF THE SECOND TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Fiji has requested Bank financing for the first
phase of its 1976-80 development plan to extend and improve the Fiji tele-
communications system, to be undertaken by the Department of Posts and
Telecommunications (P&T).
1.02      The project proposed for Bank financing covers the first phase of
the above plan during the three-year period January 1, 1976 - December 31,
1978.  It aims at meeting part of the urgent demand for telephone connec-
tions; expanding the long distance network to meet the expected traffic
increase; providing telecommunications services to areas and islands pres-
ently having no service; expanding telex service to meet growing demand
from trade, commerce and administration; and improving telecommunications
services to neighboring countries in the South Pacific region.
1.03      The estimated cost of the project is F$11.22 million (US$14.03
million) with a foreign exchange component of F$7.69 million (US$9.62
million), 52% of which would be financed by a proposed Bank loan of US$5
million equivalent. The borrower would be the Government of Fiji which
would make the proceeds available to P&T for carrying out the project.
1.O4      The proposed loan would be the Bank's second loan for telecommuni-
cations development in Fiji, the first being Loan 833-FIJ (US$202 million)
in 1972. A substantial part of the first project has been completed, with
final completion likely by mid 1976 which is according to schedule,
1.05      This report is based on information provided by P&T and on the
findings of a mission composed of Messrs. S. Sathar1/, H. Hillebrenner and
B. Johnsson which visited Fiji in September/October 197T.

2. THE ECONOMY AND THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR
The Economy
2.01      Fiji, formerly a British colony, became an independent dominion
within the British Commonwealth on October 10, 1970. It comprises two main
islands which contain about 90% of the total land area and population, and
about 300 smaller islands scattered over some 260,000 square kilometers of
ocean. The country is physically isolated from the main centers of world
population by thousands of kilometers of ocean, but it is situated on the
main trade routes between North America and Australasia. The population,
some 550,(000, increases by about 1.9% per year.
2.02      In the past decade, Fiji has undergone a major transformation,
shifting away from a predominantly rural-agricultural economy to one in
which the provision of services is the dominant form of economic activity.
Agricultural production, on which more than half of the population contin-
ues to depend for a livelihood, has stagnated and contributes now less than
25% to the GNP. Tourism has been Fiji's most dynamic sector and the reve-
nues from this sector now exceed sugar export as Fiji's largest earner of
foreign exchange. Tourist arrivals have increased by almost 25% per annum
over the past decade. Tnere was, however, a marked slowdown in tourist
arrivals in 1972-73. The per capita GNP (1972) was about US$500.
2.03      Fiji's large number of populated islands scattered over a large
area of ocean and the steep and mountainous terrain on its main islands
make transportation of people and goods difficult, expensive and time-
consuming. The telecommunications services have therefore become particu-
larly valuable in maintaining contact between the population centers. The
tourist industry also relies heavily on telecommunications services to
assure proper booking of facilities.
The Telecomnmunications Sector
2.04      Ordinance Chapter 149 enacted in 1954 gives the Government the
exclusive privilege of establishing and maintaining telecommunications
services within Fiji. P&T, the Governmental department providing these
services, :is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Communications,
Works and Tourism.  Following agreements under Loan 833-FIJ, P&T is now
operating on commercial lines (para. 5.10). In order to further foster
efficient financial management, Government enacted the Posts and Telecom-
munications Trust Account Act on October 31, 1973. This law provides P&T
with adequate financial autonomy to manage its financial affairs and to
be responsible for servicing of all debt incurred by Government on P&T's
behalf, both prior to and after the Trust Account Iaw. The responsibility
for managing the Trust Account is vested in the Permanent Secretary for



-3-
Posts and Telecommunications. In consequence of these arrangements, P&T's
operating budget no longer needs parliamentary approval. However, P&T's
annual capital works continue to need approval by the Minister of Finance
who also approves any borrowing. The arrangements are satisfactory.
2.05      With the exception of telecommunications services to neighboring
territories in the South Pacific, which are provided by P&T, Fiji's inter-
national telephone, telegraph and telex services are operated by a private
company, Cable and Wireless, Ltd. (C&W), under a license. The traffic is
routed via submarine cables connecting Fiji to New Zealand and Hawaii.
C&W is presently installing an earth satellite station which, when completed
in 1976, will give Fiji direct connections to a number of destinations via
the Pacific Ocean satellite. P&T receives terminal charges for all traffic
routed by C&W.
Existing Facilities
2.06      As of December 31, 1974, Fiji had some 25,600 connected telephones
which corresponds to a telephone density of 4.6 telephones per 100 popula-
tion (Annex 1). The telephone densities for some other Pacific islands are:
French Polynesia: 9.1; American Samoa: 12.1; Western Samoa: 1.5; and Tonga:
1.2. The quality of the services provided is generally good, but P&T has
not had the resources to fully meet the demand for telephone connections.
The Government and P&T have been extending the services to many remote
islands and villages. However, there are still many locations that lack
telecommunications facilities. Basic statistical data and details of exist-
ing facilities are given in Annexes 2 and 3.
Local Service
2.07      At the end of 1974 Fiji had 14 automatic and 11 manual telephone
exchanges.  Three of the automatic  exchanges are of step-by-step type; all
the others are of modern common control crossbar type. The total multiple
capacity of manual and automatic exchanges is 20,200 lines and the number
of connected DELs is 14,800. The average exchange fill is 73%, which is
normal. Further, about 2,500 lines from the ongoing works will be cut into
service in the period 1975 - mid 1976. All exchanges are well maintained.
2.08      Based on classification for tariff purposes, 55% are business,
15% Government and administration and 30% residential subscribers. However,
a large part of the "residential" connections are for small businesses, self-
employed repairmen, contractors, doctors, etc.
2009      The geographic distribution of the telephones is as follows:
No. of         Telephones per
Location                     Telephones        100 Population
Suva capital area              14,200                17.8
Viti Levu excl. Suva            9,760                 3.0
Vanua Levu                      1,190                 1.2
Other islands                     450                 1 .0
Fiji Total               25,600                 4.6



- 4 -
The concentration of telecommunications services in the Suva area is due
to the location of Government, business   and financial institutions which
largely handle and service the economy of the whole of the country. As
such, the telecommunications facilities in the city also benefit the rest
of the country where the telephone subscribers necessarily need to contact
Suva for their needs and for marketing their products.
2.10      The local distribution networks show the usual pattern with
underground cables in the centers of the main cities and open wire lines
or overhead cables in the outskirts.  The network is generally in good
condition and adequately planned. Cable pressurization is used to some
extent in the main cities.
2.11      There are 485 private manual branch exchanges (PMBXs) and 61
private automatic branch exchanges (PABXs) in service with a total installed
capacity of 13,400 lines. About 10,000 extensions are connected to these
exchanges.
Long Distance Service
2.12      Of Fijits long distance netw7ork, 95% consists of different types
of radio transmission systems; the remainder of cable carrier routes. The
netwzork comprises 527 long distance circuits with a total length of 51,200
circuit kilometers. Microwave systems connect the cities of Suva, Lautoka,
Mba, Namaka and Singatoka and VHF systems are extended to a number of other
cities. Microwave systems included in the ongoing project (Loan 833-FIJ)
are now being installed fram Suva to Singatoka along the south coast of
Viti Levu and between Viti Levu and Vanua Levu.  The transmission quality
in the long distance network Es good. The capacity of several microwave
and VHF routes has been used up or will be so in the near future and there-
fore requires relief.
2.13      Automatic subscriber-to-subscriber dialing is possible between
all automatic exchanges. Two modern trunk switching centers are located
in Suva and Lautoka. The pulse metering system is used for charging of all
automatic long distance and local calls.
Services to Remote Areas
2.14          Telephone service is extended to 48 small islands by means of
HF or VHF radio telephone. Further, about 35 radio telephones are installed
or under installation in isolated villages in the interior of the two main
islands (see map). These outstations have access to the public telephone
network via radio base stations in Suva and Lautoka. Service is generally
part time on a time schedule basis, but emergency connections can be set up
24 hours a day. Most such stations are for public use; the remainder serve
governmental agencies or private subscribers.



Telegraph and Telex Services
2.15      Telegraph service is provided from 82 telegraph offices by means
of teleprinters, Morse telegraph or telephones. Fiji's only telex exchange,
located in Suva, is equipped for 160 lines with 136 subscribers connected.
The telex service is available in nine other cities by connecting subscribers
through long distance circuits using VFT channeling equipment.
International Services
2.16      Telephone and telegraph services to nine neighboring territories
in the South Pacific area are provided by P&T through HF radio. The quality
of the service is subject to the limitations of HF radio communications.
In some cases Lincompex terminals have been installed to upgrade the quality
of telephone calls.  All other international services are provided by a
private company, Cable and U1reless, Ltd. (para. 2.05). The quality of
this service is good.
P&T's Performance Under Loan 833-FIJ
2.17      After initial delays resulting mainly from the effects of the
October 1972 hurricane damage to existing telecommunications facilities,
the project is now proceeding satisfactorily. The loan is expected to be
fully disbursed by March 31, 1976.  The project is expected to be completed
by mid 1976 as scheduled. The covenants of the Loan Agreement are being
met. The institution-building process of reorganizing PAT's financial pro-
cedures and establishing a commercial accounting system is proceeding

3.03      The cost estinates for equipment and services included in the
project have been based on prices obtained in Fiji for the same or similar
items recently procured under international competitive bidding or, where
appropriate, under tied procurement. A 5% physical contingency has been
added to all items for which detailed specifications have not been completed
to cover for unforeseen design or engineering modifications. Price contin-
gencies of between 10% and 28% (average 17.9%) dependina on the purpose and
year of expenditure have been added to foreign expenditures to cover for
unforeseen increases in prices. A price contingency of 10-45% (average
20.3%) depending on the year of expenditure has been added to all local
costs for material and labor to meet unforeseen price and wage increases,

Items Proposed for Bank Financing
3.04      The main categories proposed for Ba.nk financing are given below:
F$      US$
(in millions)
(i) 5,4oo automatic telephone exchange lines,
expansion of trunk exchanges and interna-
tional exchange, including installations   0.97       1.21
(ii) Telephone sets, radio telephones and
radio base station equipment                0.40      0.50
(iii) Cables and wire for local and trunk net-
works                                       1.16      1.h5
(iv)  Microwave and UHF radio equipment           0.59      0.74
(v)  Consultants' services                       0.17      0.21
(vi)  Unallocated                                 0.71      0.89
Total        h.00     5.00
3.05      In order to meet the balance of the foreign exchange cost of the
project Government intends to seek other external financing, possibly from
the U.K. for about US$2.9 million (para. 6.12) Tne balance of about US$1.7
million equivalent would come from P&T's internal resources.
Procurement
3.06      All Bank-financed items with the exception of the switching equip-
ment will be procured through international competitive bidding in accord-
ance with the Bank Group Guidelines for Procurement.  The switching equipment
to be exempted from competitive bidding for reasons given in para. 3.07
below will be purchased through negotiations with the supplier of existing
installations of the same kind, provided that the prices are reasonable.
The totaL cost of Bank-financed equipment for which competitive bidding is
inappropriate amounts to US$1.21 million or 2)4' of the total loan amount.
3.07      of the switching equipment to be procured from Bank financing for
which negotiated procurement is recommended, 71% consists of extensions to
existing exchanges. These extensions need to be of the same type as those
already installed on grounds of compatibility and of economy through use of
common equipment facilities in the existing installation.  The remainder of
the switching equipment which is for one new telephone exchange could pos-
sibly be procured through competitive bidding. However, considering the
small size of the Fiji telephone network and the standardized type of switch-
ing equipment used, one single telephone exchange of divergent type would
considerably complicate exchange maintenance and require additional staff
training. Therefore, this exchange also ought to be procured from the
supplier of the other exchanges.



3.0B      Items not financed by the Bank will be procured through nego-
tiations from existing suppliers mostly in UK for reasons of standardi-
zation.
Project Execution
3.09      The detailed project planning and engineering have been carried
out by P&T's staff. P&T intends to continue the services of Messrs. Preece,
Cardew and Rider as consultants for the preparation of bid specifications
and the Crown Agents for assistance in procurement during the execution of
the project. The total time for this assistance is estimated at about 30
man-months. These arrangements are satisfactory. The installation, test-
ing and commissioning of all telephone and telex switching equipment would
be carried out by contractors under P&T's supervision, P&T would also
attach some of its staff to these works to meet training requirements. The
installation of the cable network, subscriberst plant, microwave and radio
equipment will be carried out by P&T's own staff. These arrangements are
satisfactory.
Disbursement
3.10      The proposed loan would be disbursed against the CIF cost of
imported equipment and the foreign cost of services. An estimated schedule
of disbursements is given in Annex 5. The use of any unused loan funds
would be subject to agreement with the Bank; in view of P&T's further expan-
sion requirements, an unused balance could be applied to the purchase of
goods and services similar to those already procured under the loan.

4. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PROJECT
4.01      Fiji consists of a large number of populated islands with rugged
mountainous terrain on the main islands. There are few roads and the public
transportation facilities are scarce. The difficult and time-consuming
transportation of people and goods makes reliable telecommunications service
indispensable to administration, production, distribution and transportation.
The project aims to expand the existing telecommunication facilities and to
spread the services to areas presently having no telecommunications. Accord-
ingly, the project will provide services to remote islands and to isolated
areas in the interior of the two main islands to assist in the production,
marketing and transportation of products from these agricultural areas. The
project will further support Fiji's development objectives by providing essen-
tial services to tourism, industry, trade, forestry and business.
4.02      The project is a balanced allocation of the limited resources
available to P&T. Sufficient investment is allocated to augmenting the net-
work traffic-carrying capacity to satisfy the priority need for preserving
an adequate quality of service to the existing customers and to provide for
new customers. Network extensions with high priority are included and the
remainder of the funds are allocated to meeting demand for new connections.
4.03      Paragraph 6.20 of this report shows the estimated fiscal impact
of the project; that it contributes substantially to the Government's
finances. In fact, P&T will in addition be financing a substantial part
of its expansion program from self-generated funds and be servicing fully
all past and future debts incurred on its behalf. The execution of the
project will strengthen P&T's financial base and enable continuation of
financing future expansion plans out of funds partly generated from user
charges. This and similar future projects would confer significant bene-
fits to every productive sector of the economy.
Market Demand
Local Service
4.o4      During the 1970-73 period of the ongoing development program, the
total demand for DELs which is the sum of existing DELs and waiting appli-
cants (unsatisfied demand) grew by about 12% annually. This increase in
demand is expected to continue during the remainder of the ongoing develop-
ment program and during the period of the new project, 1976-78. By the
end of the ongoing program, there would be about 15,900 DELs connected,
leaving an unsatisfied demand for some 5,400 DELs. After completion of the
proposed project, these figures would have increased to 21,300 DELs and
about 9,000 of unsatisfied demand. Thus the project will meet only slightly



more than half of the sum of the unsatisfied demand existing at the begin-
ning of the project period, and anticipated new demand arising during the
period. P&T has informed the Government about this expected shortage in
meeting demand, which is caused by financial constraints.
Long Distance Service
4.05      P&T has worked out the historical trend of traffic increases for
each section of the long distance network, and the demand for the project
period has been forecast. As an average for all routes, an annual traffic
increase of about 18% is foreseen with a somewhat higher figure of about
20% for the Suva area. These increased rates are well in line with those
experienced in other countries. The project will provide for necessary
increases in channeling equipment corresponding to. the traffic increase.
In some cases the circuit requirements exceed the capacities of the existing
microwave or VHF systems and these are being replaced by new systems with
higher capacities. Where economically justified, the replaced material will
be reused on other routes.
Services to Remote Areas
4.06      In the past, P&T has provided extensively for telephone services
to remote and isolated areas.  However, there exists a further demand for
such services in many locations. P&T will, in consultation with Government
and local authorities on a year to year basis, establish radio telephone
service to about six new locations annually, or to a total of 18 localities
in the project period. In addition, P&T will connect some 15 villages along
a valley devoted to agriculture production in the main island and install
coin boxes and public telephones at these places. While installation and
operation of the outstations are not financially profitable, these meet
economic and social needs in these remote locations.
Telegraph and Telex Services
4.07      The increase in the number of internal telegrams is now stagnating
and no significant increase is foreseen for the project period. Tle increase
in telex lines has been 31% annually over the last five years. As the most
urgent demand is now satisfied, the increase in the period 1975-78 is esti-
mated to average 14% which is well in line with experience in other countries.
There are at present 43 applications for telex service that have not been
met; in most cases due to lack of capacity in VFT equipment for linking sub-
scribers in distant areas to the telex exchange in Suva. The list of those
waiting is expected to be reduced to about 10 in 1978.
International Services
4.08      The overseas telephone traffic handled by Cable and Wireless, Ltd.
increased during 1973 by 35% over previous years. In the same period the
number of international telegrams increased by 11% and the telex traffic
by 88%.



- 12 -
Least Cost Solution
4.O9      P&Tts fundamental plans for the telecommunications network were
drawn up in the period 1902-65, based on long-term forecast of growth of
the Fijian network and included national numbering, routing and transmis-
sion plans for achieving least cost.  These plans are still fully appropriate.
P&T also decided to standardize on common control switching systems for its
telephone exchanges in order to obtain a uniform numbering and for flexible
routing of the long distance traffic. For the long distance network the
use of radio communications, such as microwave, VHF and UHF links was the
correct solution in view of Fiji's topography wihich makes the alternative,
cable routes, expensive and vulnerable.
4.10      The predominant part of the project consists of expansion or
replacement of existing equipment. The detailed planning of the project,
based on continuous studies of demand and traffic increases, has been made
in order to arrive at the least cost for the project and the anticipated
future expansion.
Return on Investment
4.11      The internal financial return on the project, defined as the dis-
count rate which equalizes the stream of expected revenues attributable to
the project with the attributable capital and operating costs excluding
taxes and contingencies, is about 15% (Annex 6). This rate of return is
acceptable. In the calculation, no shadow pricing has been applied because
Fiji has a realistic exchange parity. A sensitivity analysis reflecting
the most unfavorable combination of main parameters -- 10% increase in
capital and operating cost and 1051 decrease in revenues -- resulted in a
rate of return of about 12%. which is still satisfactory.
4.12      The economic return is undoubtedly higher because (a) the value
of the service to the user is greater than the price paid for the service,
and (b) there are external benefits which accrue to parties other than
those who pay directly for use of the facilities.

5. THE BENEFICIARY
Organization and Management
5.01      P&T's position within the Governmental setup, and its respon-
sibilities are outlined in para. 2.04. Its internal organizational struc-
ture shown in Chart WB 9452 follows conventional practice in most British
Commonwealth countries. There are separate branches for posts, telecom-
munications, finance and accounts, and administration. The Permanent
Secretary of Posts and Telecommunications is responsible for the adminis-
tration of all the branches. However, the civil engineering construction
for P&T is to some extent the responsibility of the Public Works Department
and most recruitment is done by the Public Service Commission. P&T has no
difficulties coordinating the different activities and the present setup is
appropriate for the time being. However, these arrangements should be re-
viewed in about two years, giving consideration to vesting P&T with increased
day-to-day autonomy in these matters.
5.02      Present management is competent.  There are still some expatriate
officers in managerial and technical positions. Government intends to grad-
ually replace them as and when qualified Fijians become available to fill
the posts (para. 5.04).
Staffing and Training
5.03      P&T's staff, including unestablished and casual workers, totaled
850 in June 1974, with 630 directly engaged in teleccmmunications.  The
number of employees per 1,000 telephones is 28, a reduction from 33 per
1,000 telephones since the last appraisal in 1971. This figure is well
below average for other countries in similar stages of development.
5.04      There are, as of June 1974., seven expatriates employed in P&T;
a reduction from 12 in December 1973. One of the expatriates holds the
top management position as Permanent Secretary for Posts and Telecommuni-
cations; the remaining are employed as senior technical officers or teachers
in P&T's Training School.  The position of Director of Telecommunications is
not yet filled on a permanent basis.
5.05      In the past a considerable number of P&T's technical staff members
and graduate engineers had resigned after completing their training and
joined other employers offering better salaries. Based on information fur-
nished by P&T during negotiations, the position has now improved and the
loss of trained staff has decreased due to paucity of other more attractive
jobs in Fiji and overseas. As a result the number of vacancies in the tele-
communications branch was only 23 in April 1975, a decrease from 58 in June
1974. The demand for graduate engineers has also been reduced because it
has been possible to fill some positions by qualified technicians.



- 14 -
5.06      From April 1975 training of technical telecommunications staff
from the South Pacific region, including those from Fiji, is provided by
a Regional Telecommunications Training Center in Suva. This center is
being set up with UNDP assistance; International Telecommunication Union
(ITU) will be the executing agency. Theoretical and practical training
is provided for three categories of trainees: technical officers, tech-
nicians and assistant technicians. The training periods are three years,
two years, and four-eight weeks respectively. The total annual intake of
trainees from P&T will be 4I4 in 1975 and 35 in 1976. This level of intake
seems appropriate even taking into account anticipated losses of trainees
and technical staff.
5.07      Under Loan 833-FIJ it was agreed that P&T should carry out a
study of its recruitment and training systems. This study has been com-
pleted but the creation of the Regional Telecommunications Training Center
in Fiji (para. 5.06) has substantially changed the recruitment and training
situation. P&T anticipated little or no difficulties in recruiting candi-
dates for being trained in the new Training Center.
Accounting and Reorganization
5.08      Under Loarn 833-FIJ it was agreed thati during 1973 the Government
should cause P&T to (a) establish a financial section; (b) engage a quali-
fied accounting consultant to install within twelve months of his appoint-
ment a commercial accounting system that provides a complete separation of
the accounts of P&T's postal and telecommunications branches and to admin-
ister the finance section during the installation period; and (c) employ a
qualified accountant who will become responsible for the administration of
the said finance section after the installation period.
5.09      P&T has met these requirements.  A qualified accounting consul-
tant from the Australian Post Office was engaged in July 1973. The Finance
Section was established on January 1, 1974, when the commercial accounting
system a,lso came into operation. In order to ensure smooth transition when
the consultant would terminate his job after the installation period, P&T
is employing a qualified accountant to head the Finance Section and to coop-
erate closely with the consultant.
5.10      The commercial accounting system being installed by the consul-
tant meets the requirements identified in the first project (Loan 833-FIJ)
and provides a reasonable separation of the accounts of P&T's postal and
telecommunications operations. While the implementation of the system pro-
ceeds satisfactorily, its final consolidation and smooth operation would be
facilitated by the consultant's assignment continuing until July 1976.
5.11      With the introduction of the system, an adequate property record
has been set up and a proper valuation for all telecommunications plant
together with the fixing of reasonable depreciation rates have been carried
out. In order to improve billing procedures, P&T intends to completely
mechanize their billing process by installing modern billing equipment at
headquarters in Suva. This is a reasonable approach.



- 15 -
Audit
5.12      During negotiations, it was agreed that P&T have its accounts
annually audited by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank and that
certified financial statements together with the auditors' opinion will
be submitted to the Bank within six months after the close of each fiscal
year.
5.13      Under Loan 833-FIJ, the Bank accepted the Government's proposal
to have P&T's accounts audited by the Auditor-General, who is appointed by
the Governor-General. The Auditor-General has been performing commercial
audits for the sugar mills in a satisfactory fashion. Therefore, it is
expected that he would audit P&T's commercial accounts equally well.
Taxes and Insurance
5.14      P&T as a Government department is not subject to any form of
taxation.
5.15      P&T's wide geographical spread of its assets provides a reason-
able dispersion of risk and thus no provisions for insurance of their assets
have been made in the past. This is in line with the approach adopted by
most telecommunications entities. P&T's policy of not carrying insurance
is acceptable.
Tariffs
5.16      While P&T may recommend a revision of existing tariffs or the
fixing of new tariffs, the authority for the approval of tariffs is vested
with the Minister of Communications, Works and Tourism. In practice, how-
ever, all major tariff revisions are submitted to the Cabinet for its con-
currence before they are put into effect.
5.17      Annex 7 summarizes the present tariffs, essentially unchanged
during the last five years. The basic features include a F$10 installation
charge; subscribers on manual exchanges without metering pay an annual
rental (no call charges) of F$32 for business connections and F$22 for
residential connections; automatic subscribers and subscribers on manual
exchanges with metering pay annual rentals of F$20 for business and F$15
for residential connections together with F$0.03 for each local call.
5.18      The current level of P&T's tariffs provides sufficient revenues
to meet the existing rate covenant of 12% and to support the proposed expan-
sion. Forecasts given in Annex 8 show that operating results would be fully
satisfactory over the period 1974-1980, with a rate of return of more than
15% throughout the period. Under Loan 833-FIJ, P&T is required to maintain



- 16 -
tariffs for its telecommunications services which will provide revenues
sufficient to produce an annual rate of return of not less than 12% on
the average net fixed telecommunications assets.  To ensure that P&T will
continue to generate the funds required for the proposed expansion, the
same rate covenant is proposed for the new loan. This was agreed during
negotiations.
5.19      While the tariff structure is in line with those generally prev-
alent in many other countries, the classification between business and
residential subscribers appears to cause administrative problems since an
increasing number of small businesses operate from residences. P&T has
proposed to eliminate the residential classification and to raise the
installation charge which is on the low side. These adjustments are in
the right direction. Government is expected to review the matter towards
the end of 1975.
5.20      In the past, Government did not pay for its use of telecommuni-
cations services. Under Loan 833-FIJ, it was agreed that Government will
be billed for all services provided at normal tariffs. Government has
complied with this agreement and pays full rates for all telecommunications
services provided by P&T as from January 1, 1974.

6. FINANCES
Summary of Finances
6.01      Following the introduction of a commercial accounting system,
P&T has restated the financial data of the past telecommunications oper-
ations in order to reflect accrual accounting practices and Government's
use of telecommunications services at regular rates (para. 5.20). These
data show that P&T's operating results and its financial position have
been very satisfactory over the past five years (para. 6.02).  Forecasts
for 1974 through 1980 indicate that P&T's favorable operating results
would continue during this period. The expansion program for the period
1976-78 will increase plant in service from F$15.3 million to F$25.6
million, an increase of about 67%. It is estimated that internally gen-
erated funds would cover 46% of this expansion after debt service and
payment of compensation to Government for its equity investment. The
proposed Bank loan would cover 34% of the project cost. Forecasts for
P&T's debt/equity ratio indicate that despite considerable borrowings,
the ratio at the end of the expansion period would not exceed 44/56
which would still leave a fair margin for further borrowings.
Past Financial Performance
6.02      Income statements for 1969-1973 are shown in Annex 8. Related
notes are given in Annex 10, Section A. A summary is given below.

the high growth in long distance traffic and P&T's success in keeping down

6.05      Under Loan 833-FIJ it was agreed that P&T's assets be valued and
suitable depreciation rates be introduced. This has been done. The present
plant valuation is realistic. Depreciation is computed for each class of
plant on a straightline basis. The composite rate is 5%, which is reasonable.
6.o6      P&T's current assets as at December 31, 1973 did not include any
cash because up to this date P&T operated under the traditional Government
budget account system under which all cash collections were paid into a
consolidated fund held by Treasury and expenditures were charged against
this fund within the limits of the budget allocations. With the introduc-
tion of the Trust Account (para. 2.04) and the implementaticn of the com-
mercial accounting system as from January 1, 197h, P&T has been vested with
adequate financial autonomy and hence has cash of its own.
6.07      The current ratio excluding cash (para. 6.06) was 1.9 which is
satisfactory. Accounts receivable were about two monthstbillings. This is
acceptable.
6.o8      P&T's telecommunications equity is the balancing figure of fixed
plus current assets and the sum of long-term debt plus current liabilities,
and represents the Government's equity investment in P&T.
6.og      Long-term debt consisted of IBRD Loan 833-FIJ, a bilateral loan
from the UK and the Viti Levu VHF loan which were all incurred by Government
on P&cT's behalf. Details are given in Annex 10, Section B. As at December
31, 1973, P&T was not yet financially responsible for this debt but will be
so as from January 1, 1974 (para. 2.04). Based on this understanding, P&T's
telecommunications debt/equity ratio was 17/83 which is low.

6.11      Internal cash generation would total F$10.0 million (US$12.6 mil-
lion) and would contribute, net of debt service and Government compensation
for its equity investment, about 46% of total requirements for all purposes.
This is satisfactory.
1/US$134 thousand of the proposed loan of US$5 million will be required
during 1979, i.e., after the nominal project period.



- 20 -
6.12      Borrowings would cover 54% of total requirements.  Details are
as follows:
(i) F$40,o00 (Us$50,000) and F$30,000 (US$38,000) would come
from balances remaining in the IBRD Loan 833-FIJ and a UK
loan respectively.
(ii)  The proposed IBRD loan of US$5 million is assumed to be
made to Government for a period of 20 years including a
five-year grace period. Government would pass on the loan
to P&T at the same terms. For the financial projections,
an interest rate of 8-1/2% has been assumed.
(iii)  In addition to the proposed IBRD loan Government expects to
arrange for a loan in the order of F$2.3 million (US$2.9 mil-
lion) from the UK. In the event that such a loan would not
be forthcoming, Government will make available funds in the
above order to P&T from its own resources. This was confirmed
during negotiations. For the financial projections, it has
been assumed that such loan would be made available at terms
similar to the proposed IBRD loan.
Future Finances
6.13      Forecast income statements and balance sheets for 1974 and 1975,
the project period 1976-1978 and thereafter up to 1980 for P&T's telecom-
munications operations are given in Annexes 8 and 9; related notes are in
Annex 10. The main features of the forecast telecommunications accounts
are given below:

6.14      The past favorable trend of P&T's telecommunications finances
(para. 6.02) is expected to continue during the forecast period 1974-1980
including the project period 1976-1978. Based on present tariffs (para.
5.18), the average annual growth rate of revenues during the period 1974-
1980 would be about 15% and the corresponding growth rate of expenses 18%,



- 21 -
thus resulting in a decline of the rates of return from 22.1% in 1974 to
15.5% in 1980 and an increase of the operating ratios from 55% to 61% res-
pectively. However, rates of return would continue at a high level; also
an operating ratio of 61% is still very satisfactory. Throughout the
forecast period the rates of return would be well above 12% as agreed
under Loan 833-FIJ. These prospects are satisfactory.
6.15      Indicators which will help monitor P&T's performance are given
in Annex 12.
6.16      Net plant in service would increase from F$7.8 million as at
January 1, 1974 to F$20.6 million at the end of 1980, an increase of 164%.
Even after allowing for substantial payments to Government for its equity
investment (para. 6.20) and large payments of interest on debt, retained
earnings would increase equity frcm F$7.5 million at the beginning of 1974
to F$15.3 million at the end of 1980, an increase of about 104%. This
would fairly compensate for the sharp increase of P&T's long-term debt and
thus causing a moderate rise of the debt-equity ratio from 25/75 in 1974
to 44/56 in 1978.  Due to further rise of equity and substantial repayments
on long-term debts thereafter, the debt/equity ratio is expected to drop to
36/64 in 1980. These ratios are satisfactory and would leave a fair margin
for further borrowings.
6.17      P&T's current ratio for their telecommunications operations which
includes current maturities, would average 1.5 during the project period.
This would give P&T reasonable liquidity.
6.18      Debt service coverage by internal cash generation would not fall
below 3.6 times through the forecast period. Under Loan 833-FIJ, P&T should
not incur long-term debt for its telecommunications branch without the
Bank's agreement unless the preceding 12 months' internal cash generation
would cover maximum future annual debt service at least 1.5 times.  In order
to help ensure P&T's future viability, the same debt limitations will be
applied to the proposed loan. This was agreed during negotiations.
Equity Compensation
6.19      Under Loan 833-FIJ it was agreed that P&T will make payments to
Government from telecommunications net income to provide a reasonable return
to Government on its equity in the telecommunications branch. The matter
was discussed during negotiations and it was agreed that Government will
review P&T's cash position at the end of each fiscal year and allow P&T to
retain such funds as are needed to provide adequate financing for carrying
out P&Tts telecommunications capital expansion programs, for its operational
requirements and for such other purposes as the Government may from time to
time consider necessary. Based on the results of such review Government
will then fix each year the level of P&T's contributions by expressing the
contribution either in the form of an interest rate on Government's equity



- 22 -
as defined in the Trust Account Act No. 30 of 1973 (see para. 2.04) or such
other form as may be determined by Government. The first review of P&T's
cash position for this purpose will be for the year ending December 31, 1974,
which is the first full year of operation after the Trust Account Act became
effective. The financial forecasts prepared for this report assume that from
fiscal year 1974 P&T would annually transfer to Government that part of its
net income which is surplus to its requirements (para. 6.20).
Fiscal Impact
6.20      On the basis of Bank's assumptions (para. 6.19), payments by P&T
to Government would total about F$2.2 million (Us$2.7 million) during the
project period 1976-1978. In addition, P&T would make annual contributions
to the Fiji National Provident Fund. These contributions would total
F$389,000 (us$486,ooo) during the above period. Also P&T has now taken
over the obligation for the servicing of all debt including debts incurred
on behalf of P&T by Government before the new financial arrangements under
the Trust Account Act (para. 2.04).

7. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECHMOENDATIONS
7.01      During loan negotiations, agreements were reached on the follow-
ing principal points:
(a) the accounts of P&T will be audited annually by independent
auditors acceptable to the Bank and certified financial
statements together with the auditors' opinion will be sub-
mitted to the Bank within six months after the close of each
fiscal year (para. 5.12);
(b) P&T will maintain tariffs to provide revenues for the tele-
communications branch sufficient to produce an annual rate
of return of not less than 12% on the average net fixed tele-
communications assets (para. 5.18);
(c) P&T will not incur for its telecommunications branch any
long-term debt without the Bank's agreement unless the pre-
ceding 12 months' internal cash generation would cover maximum
future annual debt service at least 1.5 times (para. 6.i8); and
(d) Government will review P&T's cash position at the end of each
fiscal year and fix the level of P&Tts payments to Government
(para. 6.19).
7.02      The proposed project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$5 million
for a tenm of 20 years including a grace period of 5 years.

Internal Economic Return
1. Benefit Period
The following analysis covers a period of 23 years which is derived from
the three-year construction period plus the twenty-year project lifetime.
2. Net Benefits
Capital expenditures under the project exclude taxes, duties and contin-
gencies. An adjustment in 1998 has been made for the residual value of local
networks which have a lifetime beyond the assumed project life. Revenues
atrributable to the project are mainly telephone and telex revenues and were
derived from the forecast revenues in the income statements for the period
1976-1980 (Annex 8). Operating expenses other than depreciation have like-
wise been obtained by apportionment of the expenses given in Annex 8 for the
period 1976-1980.  It was assumed that 50% of the annual expense increase
would be related to the project.
A summary of revenues and cost at constant 1975 prices (in F$ thousands)
that have been allocated to the project is given below:
Capital     Operating                    Net

1977            3,110         130             358      (2,882)
1978            2,797         203            939       (2,061)
1979              113         281          1',659       1 ,265
1980-1997         -           281          1,816        1,535
19913            (613)        281          1,816        2,1h8
3. Rate of Return
On the basis of the above data which are conservative estimates, the
internal rate of return on the project, defined as the discount rate which
equalizes the stream of net benefits over the project period, is 15.4%.

TELECOMMUNICATIONS BRANCH
Notes and Assumptions on Financial Statements
A. Income Statements (Annex 8 )
Revenues
1. Revenues for the period 1969-1973 have been restated to reflect
accrual accounting practices and Government's use of telecommunications
services at regular rates. Revenues for the period 1974-1980 have been
forecast on the basis of existing tariffs.
Telephone Installation Fees
2. Forecasts were based on the planned average increase in connec-
tions.
Telephone Rentals
3<. These have been forecast on the basis of average annual connec-
tions for both automatic and manual subscribers.
Call Charges
14. The forecast comprises local, long distance and international
calls. The total revenues accruing from these calls have been forecast
to annually increase by 12%.
Telegraph
5. Telegraph revenues are assumed to annually decrease at a rate
of 2% reflecting the increasing availability of telephone and telex services.
Telex
6. Revenues accruing from this service have been forecast to annu-
ally increase by 15%.
Leased Circuits
7. It is assumed that the lease of circuits would not substantially
increase during the forecast period. On this basis annual revenues are
forecast at F$70,000 during 1974-75, F$75,000 during 1976-77, and F$80,000
during 1978-1 980.



ANNEX 1 0
Page 2 of 3 pages
Miscellaneous
8. Miscellaneous revenues are assumed to annually increase in accord-
ance with the average growth of subscribers.
9. Expenses for the period 1969-1973 have been restated to reflect
accrual accounting practices and include also costs not reflected in P&T's
accounts before the introduction of the commercial accounting system, e.g.,
pension fund contributions, power, water, depreciation and building main-
tenance. As from January 1, 1974, forecasts are made on the basis of com-
mercial accounting practices.
Staff Expenses
10. Staff expenses are assumed to annually increase by 10% during
1974-1976 including a special increase by F$90,000 for upgrading certain
low-paid staff in 1975. Thereafter staff expenses would increase by 11%
in 1977, 12% in 1978, 13% in 1979 and 14% in 1980.
Operating Cost
11. These costs are assumed to annually increase in accordance with
the annual growth in direct exchange lines.
Depreciation
12. Depreciation has been computed on a straight-line basis at a
composite rate of 5%.
B. Balance Sheets (Annex 9 )
Background
1. P&T did not maintain an asset register in a commercial sense and
did not prepare balance sheets before 1973. Following the valuation of
their assets by a consultant under Loan 833-FIJ, balance sheets for the
period 1969-1972 have been drawn up by the mission on the basis of the con-
sultant's valuation of assets and with a view to reflect accrual accounting.
P&T's balance sheet as of December 31, 1973 has been drawn up on the basis
of P&T's newly implemented commercial accounting system and is, therefore,
reasonably realistic.  The forecasts for the period 1974-1980 have been
prepared on the same basis.
Plant-in-Service
20 Values of total plant additions for the years 1974 through 1980
are based on P&T's program. The depreciation reserve was computed for each
year's additions based on a 5% straight-line depreciation rate.



ANNEX 1 0
Page 3 of 3 pages
Plant Under Construction
3. The values for plant under construction as from 1974 were assumed
to equal 40% of the annual capital construction plus the balance of works
brought forward from previous years.
Cash and Bank
4. Cash and bank reflects the cash at the end of each year consistent
with the respective annual statement of sources and applications of funds
(Annex 11). Cash and bank also reflect the cash balance of the trust fund
at the end of each year.
Accounts Receivables
5. Accounts receivable were forecast to annually equal about two
monthst billings.
Inventories
6.  Annual inventory value was forecast at 2% of gross plant plus
respective plant under construction.
Accounts Payable
7. Accounts payable were assumed to be 15,% of annual capital expendi-
ture plus operating cost other than depreciation.
Long-Term Debt
8. Following the Trust Account Law, P&T is responsible for all long-
term debt incurred before or after this Law went into effect. Apart from
IBRD Loan 833-FIJ, there are two long-term loans incurred by Government on
P&T's behalf prior to the Trust Fund Law which have now to be serviced by
P&To  The Viti Levu VHF loan was made available to P&T during 1961-1965 by
installments totaling F$1,110,000 (US$1.14 million). The average interest
rate is 575%. The loan would be repayable during 1976-1979. The UK loan
was incurred by Government on behalf of P&T in 1972 and would be serviced
by P&T as from January 1, 1974. This loan is at an interest rate of 5% and
a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years.
