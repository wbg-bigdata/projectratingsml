PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
FIJI - SECOND TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT (LOAN 1140-FIJI)
PREFACE
1.        This Project Completion Report (PCR) covers the Fiji second
telecommunications project supported by Loan 1140-FIJ. The loan of US$5
million was approved in July 1975, became effective in October 1975 and was
closed in March 1981, twelve months after the original closing date.
2.        The PCR was prepared in the Industry Department of the World Bank
on the basis of information and data supplied by the Fiji Department of
Posts and Telecommunications (P&T) and gathered by a Bank project
completion mission which visited Fiji during October 1981.
3.        The comments of the Borrower and the Government on the draft PCR
have been incorporated in the final PCR.
4.        The project has not been subjected to audit by the Operations
Evaluation Department.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
FIJI - SECOND TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT (LOAN 1140-FIJI)
HIGHLIGHTS
1.        The Second Telecommunications Project in Fiji encompassed the
FY76-78 construction program of the Department of Posts and
Telecommunications (P&T). It followed the First Telecommunications Project
(Loan 833-FIJ) and ran about one year late in its execution (PCR paragraphs
3.02 and 3.03). The physical content of the project comprised a
continuation of the expansion of the Fiji telecommunications system to help
meet the growing demand for telephone services and the increasing usage
rates (PCR paragraph 2.02). Its objectives also included institutional
improvements within the P&T in the areas of technical and financial
planning, financial management and accounting and costing systems (PCR
paragraph 2.03). Both the physical and institutional objectives were
achieved.
2.        Despite the one year delay in execution, the project cost was in
line with the originally estimated cost (PCR paragraphs 3.13 and 3.14).
3.        During the course of the project, from FY76 through early FY78,
P&T's financial position deteriorated significantly (PCR paragraphs 5.04
and 5.05). The net surplus of the telecommunications operations after
interest and compensation to Government dropped from about F$l million in
FY75 to a deficit of F$50,000 in FY77. This was a result of increasing
inflation pushing up operating costs and P&T's inability to increase
tariffs, which had remained virtually static from 1966 until revised rates
were introduced on April 1, 1978 (PCR paragraph 6.09). A further tariff
increase was introduced in January 1980, and this has fully restored P&T's
financial position, allowing it to achieve a 12.7% rate of return on
revalued assets in FY80 compared with the covenanted rate of 12.0% (PCR
paragraph 5.06).
4.        Notable features of the Fiji telecommunications service are the
high quality technical performance of the system, the reasonable number of
staff required to operate and maintain the system (16 per 1,000 telephones)
and the small number of expatriates employed (PCR paragraphs 4.01, 4.02 and
6.04). Assistance from the Bank during the two telecommunications projects
contributed significantly to these achievements.  However, the demand for
service remains in excess of supply and this situation will not be remedied
in the short term because of P&T's likely continuing lack of adequate
financial and physical resources (PCR paragraph 9.01).

I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The telecommunications services in Fiji are provided by the
Department of Posts and Telecommunications (P&T) under the jurisdiction of
the Ministry of Communications and Works. Although d governmental
department, P&T has adequate autonomy to manage its affairs. P&T is also
responsible for the postal services and is operating on commercial lines with
separate accounts for its telecommunications and postal branches.
1.02       The international telecommunications services in Fiji are operated
by a separate organization, Fiji International Telecommunications Limited
(FINTEL), which is jointly owned by the Fiji Government and Cable and
Wireless Limited, a United Kingdom company. P&T's Permanent Secretary is a
member of the board of FINTEL. According-to an agreement with FINTEL the
Fiji Government will acquire a 51 percent majority ownership of FINTEL by the
end of 1982.
1.03      In 1971 the Fiji Government requested the Bank's assistance to
finance P&T's FY71/75 Development Program and in June 1972 the Bank approved
a loan of US$2.2 million to finance the first telecommunications project in
Fiji. This covered the FY72-75 four-year time slice of P&T's investment
program. The project cost was estimated at about US$5.65 million with a
foreign exchange component of about US$3.97 million. This project was
completed in April 1979, but its major elements were completed by July 1977.
1.04       In 1974, the Fiji Government requested the Bank for a second
telecommunicatioris loan to assist with the P&T's FY1976-80 Development Plan.
This second loan for US$5.0 million was approved in June 1975 to finance the
project covering the period FY1976-78.
II. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
Preparation, Appraisal and Negotiation
2.01       In January 1974 the Fiji Government requested the Bank for the loan
to finance its FY76-80 development plan to extend and improve the
telecommunications system. An appraisal mission visited Fiji in September
1974 and negotiations for the loan took place in May 1975 in Washington. The
Board of Executive Directors of the Bank approved the loan in July 1975. The
loan was signed in July and became effective on October 23, 1975.
Project Objectives
2.02       The project was part of P&T's seventh development plan for
FY76-80. Its objectives were to expand the telecommunications network to
meet part of the urgent demand for telephone connections and to expand the
inter-exchange network to cater for the expected traffic increase; to provide



-2-
communications to new areas and islands without services and to neighboring
countries in the South Pacific region.
2.03       As a follow-on project it also aimed at strengthening the
institution building which had been initiated under the first project
financed under Loan 833-FIJ.  Particular attention was given to the training
of local staff and to the improvement and consolidation of the commercial
accounting systems.
Project Description
2.04       The project comprised the following main components:
(a) Local Telephone Service
(i) Installation of automatic switching equipment for providing an
additional capacity of 5,400 lines and manual switchboards for
about 500 lines.
(ii)  Installation of local distribution network, junction cables
and associated facilities corresponding to an increase by
about 6,000 direct exchange lines (DELs).
(iii) Installation of telephone instruments, coin boxes, PABXs and
PMBXs.
(b)  Long Distance Service
(i) Installation of microwave and ultra high frequency (UHF) radio

Construction of new buildings for telephone exchanges, radio
stations and workshop, extensions and improvements of existing
buildings and access roads.
(f) Miscellaneous
(i) Purchase of tools and vehicles.
(ii) Provision of consultants' services for procurement and
delivery control.
Project Cost Estimates
2.05      The project cost was estimated at F$11.2 (US$14.0) million with a
foreign exchange component of F$7.7 (US$9.6) million. A comparison of the
estimated costs and the actual costs is given in Annex 1.  The approved Bank
loan was US$5.0 million, which would provide about 52 percent of the foreign
costs, or about 36 percent of the total estimated project cost. The
remaining project cost was to be financed from P&T's internal sources and
other external financing through Government.
Covenants
2.06      In addition to the standard covenants the Loan Agreement 1140-FIJ,
provided that the Government of Fiji as the Borrower shall:
(a) provide funds and other resouces as required to
carry out the project through P&T (Loan Agreement
Section 3.01);
(b) employ consultants to assist P&T in the procurement
of goods required for the project (Loan Agreement
Section 3.02);
(c)  cause P&T to provide the Bank not later than six
months after the end of each fiscal year certified
copies of its financial statements and audit
reports (Loan Agreement Section 4.02);
(d) cause P&T to establish and maintain tariffs for
telecommunications services sufficient to produce
an annual rate of return of not less than twelve



-4-
percent (12%) on the net fixed assets in operation
as revalued by methods acceptable to the Borrower
and the Bank (Loan Agreement Section 4.04); and
(e)  not to permit P&T to incur for the
Telecommunications Branch any long term debt unless
the net Telecommunications revenues for the fiscal
year preceeding such incurrance is not less than
1.5 times the maximum debt service requirements for
any succeeding fiscal year on all debt including
the debt to be incurred (Loan Agreement Section
4.05).
2.07       The performance of P&T in relation to the above covenants is
discussed in Chapter V and VI of this report.  A summary table of covenant
compliance is in Annex 10.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND COST
Loan Effectiveness and Project Start Up
3.01       The loan was made effective on October 23, 1975 and procurement
action was taken early. The following table shows the procurement processing
for the local exchange switching equipment:
Approx.

3.02       Bids were called for network cables and accessories to a value of
US$700,000 and for microwave radio equipment to a value of about US$780,000
during the first half of 1976. Although the P&T initiated the procurement
processes in a timely fashion, disbursements lagged behind the appraisal
estimate throughout the project (paragraph 3.15) and the project execution
commenced about one year and ended about one and one half years later than
envisaged. The longer than expected lead time between equipment ordering and
delivery was the main contributing factor to the slower start up.



3.03      During 1976, the Government of Fiji imposed limits on overall
Government spending and this also retarded progress in the first year of the
project period.
Revision of Project
3.04      During the course of the project it was decided to defer the
extension of Lami exchange, a suburb of Suva. This exchange has not yet been
extended as the area development has not occurred to the extent predicted by
the Ministry of Urban Development. The funds proposed for the exchange were
diverted to the purchase of subscribers' network cables and accessories.
Another revision was to reduce the planned 2,000 line extension for Suva
exchange to 1,000 lines with the addition of a new 1,000 line exchange at
Samabula (in the Suva suburban area) as the demand for service in Samabula
was greater than in central Suva.
Loan Allocation
3.05      The proposed and actual allocation of proceeds from the loan are
shown in the following table:
Appraisal Report Allocations
-------------------------US$ Millions…-------               ----       Actual

3.06      This shows a slight underspending on (a) above due to the deletion
of the Lami exchange extension from the project, with other allocations,
apart from (c) and (e) reasonably in accord with those originally planned.
The amount allowed for (e), consultants' services, was not required because



- 6 -
the P&T had built up its own competence to a sufficient extent to forego the
use of consultants.  The cable network needed large expansion than estimated
and the actual amount spent on (c) was increased.
Implementation Schedule
3.07      Despite the difficulties, experienced in start up (paragraphs 3.01
to 3.03) most of the local exchange installations were completed close to the
scheduled dates. The Deuba 200 line and the Suva 1,000 line extensions were
about six months late buit all others were completed virtually on time. The
installation of subscribers'network cables took longer than scheduled and
consequently the provision of new subscribers' services was slower than
planned.
3.08      Implementation of the microwave radio systems also went generally
in accordance with the schedule with the exception of the Koro-0-Rakiraki
system where a delay occurred in site acquisition for the repeater close to
Rakiraki.
3.09      Overall, the project was completed 18 months later than originally
estimated by which time it was about 70% complete. This is a reasonable and
commendable effort for a small and developing entity like the Fiji P&T.
Procurement
3.10      No significant difficulties were encountered with the procurement
arrangements. The P&T were able to prepare technical specifications for all
material components of the project and the Crown Agents, (procurement agent
for the Fiji Government as a whole), performed very effectively and promptly
in publishing bid documents and undertaking preliminary bid evaluations for
the P&T.
Project Costs
3.11      The project costs as estimated at the time of appraisal compared
with the actual costs are shown in Annex 1, A. The actual costs incurred
through the years 1976-1980 on the project and other works and the total
construction program is tabulated in Annex 2. The actual costs for the total
construction program on a year by year basis and broken down by network
categories is shown in the following table.

3.12      The actual detailed project costs are not recorded in an easily
identifiable form in the P&T's accounting system. This is the case with most
telecommunications operating companies because many elements in a telephone
network are used for a variety of different purposes and it is not possible,
nor is it necessary, to break down and debit the cost of individual parts of
a unit (such as a multipair telephone cable) to different purposes. Such
breakdowns as are necessary are carried out at the macro level.  In all cases
where telecommunications projects are in progress, there will also be ongoing
works, commenced before the project started, still proceeding, and new works,
commencing after the project started, becoming more significant as the
project proceeds. This is shown in Annex 2. The accounting systems are
designed to record the total amounts spent on the construction program, often
broken down by general categories of expenditures, and the actual amounts
spent on materials necessary for the project implementation. The total
actual cost of the project can be however derived from the available data
with an acceptable degree of accuracy.
3.13      From the figures so derived we have the following comparison
between actual cost and appraisal estimate cost (F$ Millions):



- 8 -
Foreign  Local    Total
Appraisal estimate          7.70    3.52    11.22
Actual                      7.62    4.06    11.68
% Difference               -1     +15        +4
3.14      In the appraisal estimate, price coritigencies were atlowed on local
costs at an average of 20.3% and, on foreign costs, an average of 17.9%.
Actual inflation rates in Fiji, averaged over the extended period of the
project, would produce an average escalation in local costs of about 34%.
World costs for telecommunications have not inflated at the general rate due
to improved technologies and an average figure of 7% p. a. has been generally
accepted as recent experience. On this basis over the project period the
average escalation of the foreign costs would have been about 19%.
Consequently, the actual costs have approximated the appraisal estimated
costs.
Disbursements
3.15      The estimated and actual disbursements were as follows:
Accumulated Disbursement         Actual as
(US$ Millions)                 % of
Bank Fiscal Year        Appraisal           Actual        Appraisal
1976                0.30               0
1977                2.22               0.2             9
1978                3.99               2.6            65
1979                5.00                3.4            69
1980                5.00               4.3             86
1981                5.00                5.0           100
3.16      The slippage in disbursement in 1976/1977 was caused by the initial
delays in equipment deliveries (paragraphs 3.01 to 3.03).
Performance of Consultants, Contractors, Suppliers and Borrower
3.17      By the time the project commenced the P&T had gained sufficient
expertise through the first telecommunications project to virtually dispense
with the use of consultants.  As shown in the table in paragraph 3.11 no
expenditure has been incurred on consultants since 1978 arid, overall, only
$11,636 was used for consultants' services during the course of the project.



- 9 -
3.18      Most of the project was carried out with P&T's own personnel
resources.  Some exchange installations were contracted out and these were
executed at reasonable cost and in good time.
3.19      The suppliers for the telephone switching equipment and the
microwave radio performed satisfactorily.
3.20      The borrower managed the project in a professional manner, kept
excellent records, provided excellent progress reports to the Bank.
IV. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
4.01      The various works covered by the project have been competently
undertaken and the project achieved its purpose.  The quality of performance
in the telephone network in Fiji is very high despite the heavy traffic
experienced. This reflects the competent planning and design and the
professional construction standards. Maintenance staff are adequately
trained and service interruptions are attended to in a reasonable prompt
manner.
4.02      Details of the staffing of the P&T for telecommunications are as
follows:
Telecom Staff         1976    1977    1978    1979    1980
Nationals             450      506      552     563      618
Expatriates              8      12       10       11       8
Trainees               64       66       74      70       78
Total               522      584     636      644      704
Total Staff per         30      32      32        30      29
1,000 DELs
Total Staff per        17       18       18       17      16
1,000 telephones
4.03      The staff figures shown above are quite satisfactory for a
developing country with a reasonably widespread network. The low percentage
of expatriates and the high number of trainees is illustrative of the
Government's policy of nationalizing the government institutions and
according high priority to the training of local people.
4.04      The actual figures for demand and the waiting list are in general
agreement with the forecasts at the time of appraisal (Annex 1, F&G).  In
1980, for the first time since 1972, the waiting list contracted during the
course of a year (1980 compared with 1979).  But the waiting list of 9,500 in
1980 is still very high in a country like Fiji with only about 24,000 DELs.

V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
Introduction
5.01       Since January 1, 1974, the Posts and Telecommunications Department
(P&T) has been operdting in accordance with accepted commercial accounting
practice arid maintains separate accounts for its postal and
telecommunications operations. Under the P&T Trust Accounts Act of 1973, P&T
has the autonomy to manage its financial affairs and is responsible for
servicing all debts incurred by Government on P&T's behalf. P&T's financial
management and its accounting systems have improved significantly during the
course of the two Bank-financed projects.
5.02       P&T's postal operation has been able to generate sufficient funds
for its own limited requirements and is considered satisfactory. The
analysis presented below will be concentrated on P&T1s telecommunications
operation.
Operating Results
5.03       The income statements for the Telecommunications Branch and the
appraisal estimates for FY75-80 are given in Annex 4.  A summary of the
operating results is as follows.

3/  On revalued assets starting from FY77.
5.04      During the project period, FY76 through FY80, P&TVs operating
results were mixed. From FY76 through early FY78, P&T's finances suffered
from prolonged delays in the increase in its service charges to offset the
adverse impact of inflation. P&T's tariffs had remained unchanged since
1966. Despite P&T's effective control of the operating cost,l revenues from
the telecommunications operation were not sufficient to meet its debt
service, expanded operation and construction requirements; net surplus after
interest and compensation to Government dropped from approximately F$1.0.
million in FY75 to a deficit about F$50,000 in FY77.
1/ Over the period FY75 through FY80, P&T's operating costs (less deprecia-
tion) per average direct exchange lines (DELs) in constant terms
increased by about 25 percent while the number of DELs increased by
more than 50 percent.



- 12 -
5.05      After repeated requests from P&T as wel. as from the Bank,
Government finally approved two tariff increases in FY78 and FY80 (see
paragraph 6.08). With the additional revenues generated under the higher
tariffs, P&T was able to restore its financial viability. The net surplus
from the Telecommunications Branch increased from F$0.8 million in FY78 to
about F$2.8 million in FY80 and the operating ratio improved from 88 percent
in FY77 to 70 percent in FY80.
5.06       In January 1977, P&T revalued its assets (see paragraph 5.16).  The
rate of return on revalued assets in FY77 was less than 4.0 percent and
compared unfavordbly with the covenanted 12 percent.  After the tariff
increases in FY78 and FY80 and with the increased usage of the
telecommunications services, P&T's operating results began to improve
steadily and the rate of return increased from 5.5 percent in FY78 to 8.6 in
FY79 and 12.7 in FY80.
Financial Position
5.07      The actual balance sheets and the appraisal estimates for the
Telecommunications Branch during FY76-80 are given in Annex 5. A comparison
of the Branch's financial position at the end of FY75 and FY80 is set out
below (in million F$):

- 13 -
5.08       From FY75 to FY80, P&T's total net telecommunications assets
including plant under construction increased from F$12 million to F$33
million.  Although the Bank-financed project experienced some delay in
completion, the effect of this slippage is not considered significant with
regard to the additions to fixed assets in operation (see paras. 3.07 and
3.08).
5.09       Current assets as of December 31, 1980 was about F$8 million or
about three  times higher than the appraisal estimate.  The increase was
mainly due to higher levels of accounts receivable and inventories than
originally anticipated.  However, with the expanded service usage and higher
tariff charges, the total outstanding receivable position has improved and is
considered satisfactory; the year-end balance in FY80 was about 28 percent of
the year's billing as compared with nearly 50 percent in FY76 (see paragraph
5.18 and Annex 7).
5.10       As regards the inventories, the increase in part reflected the
rapid rise in costs which occurred during this period, but it also resulted
from the increase in the volume and variety of stocks needed to service
adequately the expanding networks. On the basis of the number of DEL's
connected in the network, the level of inventories in constant terms was kept
constant at approximately F$ 30 per DEL over the period FY75 through FY80;
this is considered satisfactory after taking into account the expansion of
the network and the inflation experienced during the period.
5.11      The inability to adjust tariffs at an earlier stage led to a rapid
deterioration in P&T's cash position. As a result, the Branch's current
liabilities including accounts payable exceeded its current assets; the
current ratio dropped from 1.2 in FY75 to as low as 0.7 in FY78, reflecting
P&T's insolvency with its working capital. The liquidity position has since
been restored after the FY78 and FY80 tariff increases. The current ratio
stood at a comfortable margin of 1.6 and 1.7 in FY79 and FY80, respectively.

Branch and the appraisal estimates for FY76-80 are given in Annex 6.

5.13      The Branch's construction program during 1976-80 which included the
Bank-financed project was slightly higher than projected because of some
slippage of the ongoing works and new works under separate financing added
after the appraisal. During FY76-80 about 54 percent of the Branch's total
funds requirements against the appraisal estimate of 69 percent was financed
from net internal sources. It was estimated that the internal financing
would drop to less than 30 percent without the tw tariff increases in FY78
and FY80.
5.14      As a result of its increasing serious financial situation, P&T was
not able to pay the required compensation on Government's equity under the
Trust Account Act; the payment was estimated at about 8 percent per annum for



- 15 -
FY75-77.  To partially remove P&T's tight liquidity problem caused by
Government's refusal to grant tariff increases, Government exempted the
payment for FY78 and converted the FY75-77 overdue payments of about F$1.5
million by P&T to a grant which increased Government's equity investment in
P&T. In addition, Governmernt provided a loan of F$2.55 million to P&T under
commercial terms to meet its recurrent expenditures and capital investment
needs.
Valuation of Fixed Assets
5.15       Initially during the project period, P&T did not maintain separate
records for plant under construction.  Although cost and budget records were
kept, they were not readily available to assess the status of each individual
capital project. This problem was discussed during the Bank's completion
mission for Loan 833-FIJ in FY79.  At the mission's recommendation, P&T
started introducing a plant-under-construction account in FY80.  The new
account was fully implemented effective January 1981. In addition, P&T also
improved its stores accounting and completed the computerization of accounts
by the end of FY80. In view of the increasing complexity of the
telecommunications investment, these new improvements by P&T's Finance and
Accounting Department will significdntly strengthen the management's ability
to monitor its capital expenditures and to assess the value of the fixed
assets in operation.
5.16      Until FY76, P&T's fixed assets were shown at historical cost.  As
agreed with the Bank, P&T carried out a revaluation of its fixed assets and
the associated accumuldted depreciation as of December 31, 1976.  The
revaluation resulted in an increase in P&T's net value of telecommunications
assets by about 60 percent which may be a little high.  The revaluation
method, however, is considered acceptable.
Billing and Collection
5.17      During FY77, P&T changed over to a system of centralized billing
utilizing the Government's computer facilities.  By FY80 all telephone
subscribers' accounts were computerized. P&T has been constantly improving
the computer system and is expected to produce by the end of 1981 detailed
breakdown by subscriber categories. This should provide a better analysis of
accounts movement and facilitate more effective bill collection.
5.18      In general, the receivable position of telecommunications accounts
has improved over the years as d result of the billing computerization and
the improvements in the collection procedures (see Annex 7).  The total
accounts receivable balance at year end was reduced from about six months of
the yearly billing in FY76 to about three months in FY80; the overdue
accounts receivable balance at year end was reduced from about 4 months in
FY76 to about 2 months in FY80.d  It is anticipated that the collection
performance will further improve in the coming years.
2/  The reduction was not as significant as expected due to the tariff
increase in FY80.



- 16 -
Submission of Accounts
5.19       Under Loan Agreement 1140-FIJ, P&T was required to submit its
audited annual accounts to the Bank within six months of the close of the
fiscal year ending December 31.  As a government department, P&T's accounts
are audited by the Auditor General and the auditing procedures have been
acceptable.  However, P&T's annual reports together with audited accounts for
FY76-80 were not submitted until October or November of the following year.
This was partly due to the delays in obtaining the basic information from
overseas agencies and other government departments, but more due to the
delays in publishing the final official report pending the approval of the
Parliament. As a remedial measure, P&T was able to send unaudited financial
statements to the Bank for early review within the stipulated time frame;
this arrangement has been acceptable and P&T's accounts and statistics have
been found reliable and consistant.
International Services
5.20       The revenue collected by P&T in respect of international
telecommunications services is shdred with the operating company, Fiji
International Telecommunicdtions Limited (FINTEL), which is jointly owned by
the Government of Fiji and. Cable and Wireless, Limited. The Permanerit
Secretary of P&T is also on the Board of Directors of FINTEL. Collections
under this arrangement amounted to approximately F$5.0 million in FY80 or
about 40 percent of P&T's total telephone revenue; about four-fifths of these
collections accrued to FINTEL and P&T retained the remainder. According to
the agreement with FINTEL, the Government is planning to acquire a majority
of 51 percent of the issued shares by end 1982.
VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
6.01       The quality and effectiveness of P&T's management is good.  The
most serious weaknesses when the project commenced were in technical and
financiaL planning.  In addition, there were insufficient local people with
professional and technical skills to manage the entity and there was need for
substantial support from expatriates. However, the number of expatriates has
diminished throughout the project period and their complete elimination will
have to be approached cautiously as local staff gain the added confidence and
experience necessary for them to take over.
6.02       During the course of the project the P&T introduced a new
management level within the Telecommunications Branch designed to strengthen
the organization in its technical planning and in its general operations and
budgeting. Two new positions have been introduced immediately under the
Director of Telecommunications.  They are Assistant Director, Planning and
Development and Assistant Director, Operations. This is a significant
improvement in the organizational structure of the P&T.



- 17 -
6.03      The financial planning, as well as the general performance of the
finance and accounting area, has improved significantly during the project.
The Principal Accountant now produces a five-year financing plan containing
all the essential projections necessary for sound management and strategic
corporate planning.  On the capital investment side the finance plan is
supported by a five-year draft capital works development program produced by
the Assistant Director, Planning and Development.
Staff Recruitment, Training and Development
6.04      The staff statistics over the past five years are given in
paragraph 4.02. This shows the percentage of expatriates as 1.1% and the
number of staff per 1,000 telephones as 16.- Although this latter indicator
has remained approximately constant over the project period, it is low by
comparison with other developing countries. Many developing countries have
more than 50 staff per 1,000 telephones.
6.05      The quality and quantity of training is good.  With the help of the
International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and the Governments of Australia
and New Zealand a regional Telecommunications Training School has been
established in Suva. In 1979, 104 students were engaged in full-time
training coming from nine countries as follows: Cook Islands - 8; Fiji - 63;
Gilbert Islands 1; New hebrides - 7; Tonga - 9; Western Samoa - 12; Nive - 2;
Tokelau Islands - 1; and Tuvalu - 1. The Fiji P&T has now taken over the
responsibility for operation and maintenance of the school.
6.06      At the professional level the P&T sponsors staff to attend
Universities in New Zealand, Australia, the United Kingdom and the
University of the South Pacific in both engineering and finance/accounting
studies.
Tariffs
6.07      The P&T's tariff structure is in line with that generally prevalent
in many other countries. Initially, the Government was not charged for its
use of telecommunications services, but under Loan 833-FIJ Government agreed
to pay for all its telecommunications usage and since 1974 Government users
have been paying the full rates.
6.08      As early as 1974 the P&T submitted a proposal to Government for
increased tariffs. Due to intervention by the Price and Income Board (PIB)
and subsequent national general elections, P&T's new tariffs which were
originally approved for implementation from January 1975 were revoked and
thus tariffs remained virtually unchanged until a revised schedule was
approved and became effective on April 1, 1978. These revised tariffs
represented the first major increase since 1966.  Subsequently, rising costs
and the need to finance more of the investment programs from internal sources
made additional revenue necessary. The P&T carried out a tariff review in
1979 and obtained Government's approval to implement a second tariff increase



- 18 -
effective January 1980.  Details of the two tariff revisions and their
effects on revenues are given in Annex 8.
6.09       During the period FY75-78, when the prices of telecommunications
services were kept artificially low, the P&T's cash position deteriorated
rapidly under the pressure of high inflation.  Only by relying on temporary
relief measures made available by Government (see paragraph 5.14) and after
the two tariff increases in 1978 and 1980, was it possible for the P&T to
carry on business and restore its solvency with working capital.  After the
P&T's experience during this period, both Government and P&T have become very
conscious of the damaging effects on financial viability resulting from
inadequate pricing of services.  The P&T now reviews annually the adequacy of
its tariffs in conjunction with its financial forecasts and planning.
(paragraph 6.03).
Covenants
6.10       The loan covenants relating to tariffs and P&T's payments to
Government gave support to the P&T in its dialogue with the Government during
the period 1975 to 1978 when it was endeavoring to raise tariffs. The extent
to which the P&T was able to conform with the covenants  is tabulated in
Annex 9.
VII. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
Project Achievements
7.01       The project has achieved the physical targets set at the time of
appraisal .  Institutional improvement by P&T has been good in the areas of
financial and technical planning, accounting systems and organization, goods
procurement and management efficiency. The relative stability in top
management and the increasing coordination between technical and financial
staff have been important factors contributing to the achievements under the
project.
Least Cost Solution
7.02       Throughout the project the least cost solutions were adopted in
accordance with the design of the project at the time of appraisal.
Interndl Rate of Return
7.03       Based on the actual operation, the internal financial rate of
return on P&T's investment program during FY76-80 was re-estimated at about
18 percent. The new estimate is slightly higher than the appraisal estimate
of 15 percent partly because of the higher traffic generated than originally
expected for this period. Details of the calculation are given in Annex 10.



- 19 -
VIII. BANK'S PERFORMANCE
8.01      The Bank's performance was generally sound.  The identification and
formulation of the project was undertaken mainly by the P&T but with
assistance from Bank staff during supervision missions for the first
telecommunications project and during the appraisal mission. The sizing of
the exchange installations included in the project could have been larger.
Both the P&T and the Bank appraisal staff agreed on this point but the
Government had insufficient overall resources to allow an increase in its
allocation to telecommunications.
8.02      The technical solutions proposed were sound and the additions to
all parts of the network are operating satisfactorily.
8.03      The financial viability of the P&T suffered through the middle of
the project period (paragraph 6.09) and, even in retrospect, it appears that
there was little the P&T or the Bank could have done to alleviate the
position more quickly. The financial covenants under the loan, together with
continued direct requests by the Bank, gave much needed support to the P&T to
press Government to approve tariff increases during this period (paragraph
6.10).
Supervision
8.04      The Bank's supervision was adequate.  The P&T produced detailed
quarterly progress reports throughout the project and the project was not
very complex. Apart from the problem with tariffs, there were no significant
departures from the predicted implementation program and the P&T had the
management, financial and technical competence to handle it well.
Working Relationship
8.05      An excellent and harmonious working relationship was established
between the Bank and the P&T (and the Finance Ministry) during the course of
the two telecommunications projects. The P&T actively sought the Bank's
advice and expressed gratitude for both formal and informal advice received.
8.06      The only problem which developed in the Bank's relationship with
the P&T was the Bank's decision not to proceed with a third
telecommunications loan, which left the P&T in some doubt concerning the
financing of its 1981-1985 capital works development program.  The decision
was the result of Government and Bank's agreement that the 1981-85 lending
program should emphasize rural development, particularly the agricultural
sector.

IX. CONCLUSIONS
9.01      The technical performance of the network expansion covered by the
project should continue to remain at a high level because of the quality of
equipment and plant employed and the professionalism of its installation,
maintenance and operation. If Government continues its current policies in
support of P&T's tariffs, P&T's future financial viability is reasonably
assured, although it is clear that, with external financing constraints, P&T
will not be able to satisfy the large unsatisfied demand for telephones
(paragraph 4.04) in the foreseeable future. Unsatisfied demand at the end of
the project period was greater than it was at the beginning.
9.02      All of the specific goals of the project were achieved, though a
little later than envisaged, and the project must be considered, on both
physical implementation and institution building grounds, an overall success.

Return on Investment
1.         The Second Telecommunications Project covered the 1976-80 five-year
time slice of P&T's Seventh Development Plan (FY76-80). The delays in
execution of both the first and the second Banik-financed projects and the
overlapping of the two projects over the period have mixed incremental
revenues and costs for the projects as well as for the rest of the program,
making all attempts at allocation somewhat arbitrary. Therefore, the
internal rate of return has been calculated on the 1976-80 time slice of the
total investment program with 1975 as the base year, assuming that the
benefits of the progran are representative of and proportional to the
project.
2.         Benefit Period - The period was estimated, as in the appraisal
report, to be from 1976 to 1998 covering the estimated life of the assets.
3.         Net Benefits - Construction costs were obtained from P&T's records
and were assumed to be the value of additions to the telecommunications fixed
assets, discounted to 1975 prices. Incremental revenues and operating costs
net of depreciation and interest attributed to the program were based on the
actual 1976-80 financial results and the additional exchange capacity and
working lines; all values were expressed in 1975 prices. Preinvestments were
also taken into account in the calculation. A summary of the cost and
benefit streams is given below.

COMMENTS FROM THE GOVERNMENT
20 October 1982
Mr Shiv S Kapur
Director, Operations Evaluation Department
The World Bank
1818H Street N W
Washington DC 20433
USA
Dear Sir
RE : PROJECT PERFORMANCE REPORT ON
TELECOMMUNICATION LOAN 1140-FIJ
0
Co
Thank you for your letter of 27 August, 1982
and the copy of the Project Performance Report on Loan
X      11140-FIJ.  It is also noted that copies of the same
letter and Project Report have been sent to our Minister
for Communications and Works, the Minister for Economic
Planning and Development, the Minister for Finance and the
General Manager of FINTEL for their comments.  My Minister
has asked me to also acknowledge receipt of your letter
and to reply appropriately.  I will assume that the other
recipients of your letter will reply directly to you with
their necessary comments.
X-)               The report as a whole is well presented and easy
to follow.  It has covered virtually all of the important
items of our projects funded under Loan 1140-FIJ and in
general accurately reflects how the projects have been
0)     implemented together with background notes and difficulties
experienced during DP7.  However I would like to suggest a
number of amendments to some of the statements and figures
>      given to give a more accurate information for the report as
4      far as we are concerned.

Further comments and suggested amendments on the
Project Performance Report are as follows:-l/
¢      (1)    Page 5 Section 3.04
This paragraph has a few errors arising perhaps
0
Z              from the misprint of Ba exchange when it should
be Lami exchange and the misconception of "a
new 1000 line exchange at Samabula."  The whole
/2.,.



ANNEX 11
Page 4 of 6
paragraph should be re-written as follows:-
"13.04 During the course of the project it
was decided to defer the installation
of an extension to Lami exchange, a
suburb of Suva, This exchange has
not been extended because the area
development has not occurred to the
extent predicted by the Ministry of
of Urban Development. The funds
proposed for the exchange were diverted
to the purchase of subscribers* network
cables and accessories. Another re-
vision was to reduce the planned 2000
line extension for Suva exchange to 1000
lines with the addition of a 1000 line
extension to the Samabula exchange (in
the Suva suburban area) as the demand
for service in Samabula was greater than
in central Suva."
(2)    Page 5 Section 3.05
The actual allocations shown in the table totalled
US$5.07m whereas the actual final allocation agreed
was US$5.00m. It was our understanding that any
over-spending above the US$5.00m were to be met from
internal P&T funds and our accounts have been adjusted
accordingly.
(3)    Page 5 Section 3.06
The first five words of the second line,which reads
"Ba exchange from the project" should be amended to
read "Lami exchange extension from the project," as
a follow-on to the amendment already suggested for
section 3.04.
(4)    Page 7 Section 3.11 table
The actual total costs for the construction programme
in 1980 shown in the table should be $5,556,862. The
small reduction from the figure of $5,565,187 shown
is due to a reduction in the local service figure from
$32396,086 to $3,387,761.
(5)    Page 11 Section 5.03 table
Three minor changes are necessary to the figures shown
in the table on page 11. Operating Expenses Actual for
FY78 should read 6.4 instead of 6.2. Therefore Operating
Ratio Actual for FY78 becomes 84 instead of 82.
/3.00



ANNEX 11
- 37 -          Page 5 of 6
The actual Rate of Return for FY80 should read
12.3 as stated in our 1980 P&T Annual Report
instead of 12.7 as stated in your table.
(6)    Page 14 Section 5.12 table
Total internal cash generation actual should
read $16,52 million instead of $16.62 million.
(7)    Page 17 Section 6.03
The words "Director, Finance"? should be replaced
by the correct title of "Principal Accountant"
as we do not have a post of Director of Finance
in the Department.
(8)    Page 22 Annex 2
Total Construction Program for 1980 should read
$5.56m and not $5.57m with the overall total
reducing to $20.06m. This reduction is due to the
fact that New Works have been reduced from $3.44m
to $3.43m and the New Works Total then becomes
$5.28m instead of $5.29m.
(9)    Page 23 Annex 3
After rechecking our installation statics the actual
number of exchange lines in 1978 should be 19,608
instead of 19,612 and in 1979 should read 21,341
Instead of 21,352. The actual number of telephones
in 1978 totalled 34,889 instead of 34,999.
The rate of return for the 1980 financial year should
be corrected to 12.3o instead of 12.7%.
(10)    Page 25 Annex 5
Accounts Receivable 1975 Actual should read 2,594
instead of 2X5914
Total Equity 1978.Actual should read 19jl61 instead
of 19,611.
(11)    Page 26 Annex 6
Total Internal Cash Generation 1977 Actual should
read 2,091 instead of 2,081.
Borrowings IBRD Loan 1140-FIJ should read 571 instead
of 527.

(12)   Page 29 Annex 8
Under Principal Changes for April 1, 1978 we are
suggesting a third item as follows:-
(iii) Telephone Rentals : increases ranging
from 20% to 50%.
The above suggested amendments to the report are
mainly in the form of corrections to errors or omissions
that we have noticed by going through the report internally
in the Department. Some of these could be straight-out
typing errors and some may have already been corrected by
you but I feel the amendments are necessary to give a more
accurate document.
On the whole we are quite happy with your review
of the project 1140-FIJ, I must thank the World Bank for
the compliments expressed in the report about the staff of
the P&T Department and our achievements but there is still
a lot of work ahead of us if we are to improve on our
operations as a fully commercially run department of Govern-
ment. Improved training in all aspects of telecommunications
is one of our priorities.
It has been a pleasure being associated with the
various World Bank personnel directly involved with Project
1140-FIJ over the past six years. Their regular visits to
Fiji have always been fruitful and informative and our P&T
management staff have certainly gained from the experience
of direct discussions with your team of experts. We are
looking forward to receiving a copy of the final report at
some future date.
Yours faithfully
E Naqova
Permanent Secretary for
Posts & Telecommunications
