INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO FIJI
FOR A SECOND TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to Fiji for the equivalent of US$5.0 million to help finance a Second Telecom-
iLunications Project. The loan would have a term of 20 years, including 5
years of grace, with interest at 8-1/2% per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report titled "Current Economic Position and Prospects of Fiji"
(No. 376-FIJ, March 27, 1974) was circulated to the Executive Directors on
April 3, 1974 (R74-64). The next economic mission to Fiji is scheduled for
1976. Recent information has been obtained from a 1974 IMF mission report
and through statistics sent by the Fiji Government. Basic country data are
given in Annex I.
3.        Fiji became independent on October 10, 1970 after nearly 100 years
as a British colony and is now an independent member of the British Common-
wealth. It is composed of a group of over 300 islands in the South Pacific
with a total land area of some 18,000 km2. It has a population of slightly
over 500,000 of which about 90% live on the two main islands, Viti Levu and
Vanua Levu. The gradual transfer of political power was accompanied by a
program of local recruitment at all levels of government which has helped to
ensure competent leadership and a well managed administrative system after
independence. In the first post-independence election in April, 1972, the
Alliance Party, based largely on the support of the Fijians (42% of the popu-
lation) and European and Chinese minorities (8%), retained political power.
The National Federation Party, which is in the opposition, is largely sup-
ported by the Indian community. Serious racial tensions have been avoided.
Past Economic Performance
4.        Over the past decade real gross national product has increased by
about 5-1/2% a year. At the same time, Fiji has undergone a major trans-
formation, shifting away from a predominantly agricultural economy to one
in which the provision of services is the dominant form of economic activity.
Output in agriculture, forestry and fisheries has remained stagnant and as
a result, this sector's share in GNP has fallen to less than 25% from over
40% a decade ago; it now contributes less to GNP than wholesale and retail
trade. The expansion of the service sector, which now contributes about
half of GNP, has been mainly due to the rapid growth in tourism which cre-
ated demand for different kinds of services, such as hotel labor, construc-
tion of hotels and other infrastructure, transport, communications, and



- 2 -
distributive trades. This expansion has attracted a large number of people
from the rural into urban areas where real per capita incomes have been
rising at perhaps 3% a year. Public investment in urban areas has increased
and substantial foreign capital irtf lows were attracted into hotel building.
These capital inflows also enabled Fiji to undertake a large overall invest-
ment program while earnings frcmn tourism have helped pay for increased
imports of food and raw-materials, thus offsetting the sluggish growth of
domestic production. However, the growing dependence on imports at a time
of world-wide inflation, and rapid wage increases, especially in the service
sectors, have combined to produce an increase in the rate of domestic in-
flation. Since mid-1973, consumer prices have been rising at an annual rate
of about 17%.
5.        Despite the reasonably rapid growth in output in the non-agricul-
tural sector of the economy, employment growth did not keep pace with the
labor force growth. Thus, although employment increased by about 3.5% a
year during 1966 - 73, the unemployment rate rose to about 8%. About one-
fifth of the entrants into the labor force during the period remained un-
employed. The leading employment growth sectors since 1966 have been con-
struction and commerce (including tourism) which increased by about 9% and
7% per annum, respectively. Together they accounted for about one-third of
new employment during the period. Employment in agriculture grew at between
2 and 3% a year. The main structural shift in employment was the decline
in agriculture's share from 56% to 51% of the labor force employed and in-
creases in commerce from 9% to 12% and construction from 6% to 8%.     As a
result of these trends in output and employment, the proportion of the
national income earned in the rural areas, including sugar, has diminished
over the decade. Although the average income per head has increased some-
what in real terms since the early 1960's, the average income in farming
occupations has fallen in real terms, while that in the service sector has
increased.
6.        Tne Government's fiscal effort in the past decade has been impres-
sive. Current revenues of the Central Government have increased at about
12% a year in real terms, and the ratio of revenues to GDP has increased from
less than 20% in the early 60's to 24% in 1972.    However, substantial in-
creases in Government salaries and an expanding Civil Service, as well as a
change in the tax system which places increased reliance on direct taxes
have resulted in current expenditures outpacing revenues and reducing the
current surplus in the past couple of years.
7.        During the past decade gross investment in real terms has grown
by almost 10% a year to reach US$94 rnillion in 1973 with much of the growth
taking place since 1968. Prior to 1968 the share of investment in gross
domestic income was relatively stable at about 20%. Since then the invest-
ment share has averaged about 24%. The most striking feature of the invest-
ment boom since 1968 is the sharp rise in the share of investment financed
from overseas, mostly concentrated in tourism. While these capital inflows
enabled Fiji to maintain a high aggregate investment rate, they also created
increased outflows, in the form of debt service and the repatriation of
profits, for the future.



-3-
Growth Prospects
8.        For the rest of the decade GDP is likely to grow more slowly than
in the past ten years. This is mainly because of a slower growth in the
tourist trade. The slow-down in the world economy and increased transport
costs have already had an impact on tourist arrivals. Prospects of slower
growth have slowed the recent hotel construction boom and, may lead to over-
capacity in the industry once hotels under construction are completed.
Neglect of agriculture in recent years makes it difficult to expand produc-
tion in the short-term to compensate for slower growth in services, although
the volume of sugar exports is expected to increase. In the longer term,
tourism growth - and hence construction - may recover, but the Government
rightly is now aiming at revitalising the agricultural sector to promote
a less lopsided growth in the 1980's. By that time the economy may also
be benefitting from copper exports resulting from recent explorations. An
added reason for renewed emphasis on agricultural development is a labor
force growing at 3-1/2% a year.
9.        The next economic plan covering 1976 - 80 is still being prepared,
and the capital expenditure targets of the Government are not yet known.
The Government has indicated, however, that agriculture, power, telecommunica-
tions and port development would receive top priority in the new plan. If
capital expenditures expand roughly in line with the growth in the economy
during the period, Government investment would average about 6 - 7% of gross
domestic income during the rest of the decade. A capital program of this
magnitude would total US$280 million during 1975 - 80. About a third of the
public investment program could probably be financed from current savings and
a small amount of foreign grant assistance. The Government would have to
borrow the balance from domestic and external sources.
Balance of Payments
10.       The performance of the balance of payments for the rest of the
decade will depend largely on the performance of sugar exports and tourism
receipts. Mainly as a result of fluctuations in the price of sugar,
merchandise export earnings should increase substantially in 1974 and 1975
and then level off. Assuming a recovery in tourism by 1976, an increasing
surplus on the service account would offset to a large degree growing trade
deficits. However, even allowing for relatively low growth in imports,
depending on movements in the terms of trade, the cumulative goods and
services deficit could exceed US$400 million during 1975 - 80. After
allowing a small amount of reserve accumulation and amortization of loans,
total foreign exchange requirements could amount to US$625 million during
the period. About US$170 million would be provided by private remittances,
official grants, direct investment and short-term finance. The remaining
US$455 million would have to come from foreign borrowing of which about
US$120 million would be public. About half of the public sector borrowing
could probably be financed from disbursements of existing and new project



- 4 -
loans. The balance would have to be cash loans which would probably require
that Fiji explore new capital markets besides Australia and Nauru which have
provided most of the cash loans obtained abroad in recent years.
External Debt Servicing
11.       Because of the lack of information on past private capital inflows,
the service on existing debt can only be roughly estimated. At the end of
1973, the level of external debt is estimated at about US$115 million of
which about US$32 million is public. By the end of the decade the level of
debt could increase to about US$400 million with public debt accounting for
about US$140 million of the total. Debt service payments in 1973 are estim-
ated at about 14% of export receipts. Because of the expected large in-
creases in the value of current exports in 1974 and 1975, the borrowing
program outlined above should not result in a serious debt burden during the
period. Overall, the debt service ratio would fall to about 12% in 1977 and
gradually increase to about 15% by 1980. Thus Fiji remains creditworthy for
Bank lending. At present the Bank's share in total debt service is about
4% and is expected to rise only moderately in the years ahead.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
12.       Fiji became a member of the Bank in May, 1971 and the proposed
project would be the third in Fiji, bringing total Bank lending to US$23.2
million. The first loan of US$11.8 million was made in June 1971 for the
construction of a 67-mile section of the 130-mile Suva-Nadi road. A supple-
mental loan of US$4.2 million for the same project was signed February 1,
1973 to help meet an increase of the total estimated cost from US$16.6 to
US$31.8 million.  At the same time, Australia and New Zealand also agreed
to contribute US$2.7 and US$1.8 million, respectively, to help Fiji meet
the increased costs. Implementation of this project is generally satis-
factory and the works are about a third complete. At the end of Mav 1975.
about US$11.0 million had been disbursed.
13.       The second loan to Fiji of US$2.2 million was for a telecommunica-
tion project to support the Government's 1971 - 75 development program.   T7he
project provided for the expansion of local telephone systems, extension of
the long distance services throughout the main island of Viti Levu and be-
tween Viti Levu and other islands, and the expansion of telex services to
meet existing demand. The project is proceeding satisfactorily and should
be completed on schedule by mid-1976. The reorganization of the financial
procedures of the Department of Posts and Telecommunications (P&T) and the
implementation of a commercial accounting system are well underway. About
US$1.0 million of the loan has been disburse,.



- 5 -
14.       The Bank's lending program in Fiji in the next few years would
be concentrated on agricultural and power development in line with the pri-
orities mentioned earlier (paragraphs 8 and 9). The next proposed loan,
scheduled for consideration by the Executive Directors in FY76, would help
finance a project, largely on Vanua Levu - Fiji's less developed major
island - designed to increase sugar production for export. It will include
a land development and settlement scheme for smallholders, a small estate to
train Fijian farmers to grow sugarcane, construction of improved farm access
roads and sugarcane transportation facilities. Another loan for later con-
sideration would finance the first phase of a hydro-electric project, being
prepared with technical assistance from New Zealand, which should meet the
entire demand for power of Viti Levu - Fiji's more developed major island.
A broad-based rural development project has also been identified which may
include farm inputs, credit and marketing facilities, extension and improved
infrastructure, to help stimulate production in rainfed rice producing areas
and improve rural living standards. External assistance for sectors other
than agriculture and power is likely to be provided by ADB and bilateral
donors.
15.       Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans as of April
30, 1975, and notes on the execution of two ongoing projects. No IFC
investments have been made in Fiji.
PART III - THE SECTOR
16.       Fiji is physically isolated from the main centers of world popula-
tion and trade, and is made up of a large number of populated islands
scattered over a territorial sea of over 260,000 km2. Development of surface
transportation has been difficult, expensive and time-consuming due to the
many sea crossings and the steep, mountainous terrain of its two main islands.
Therefore, telecommunications is particularly valuable for co-ordinating
transportation, for maintaining contact between population, business and
marketing centers and centers of production of goods for domestic consumption
and exports, as well as for administration. The tourist industry also relies
heavily on telecommunication services for assured reservation of hotel,
transport and related facilities.
17.       The Government enjoys under its laws the exclusive right to es-
tablish and maintain telecommunications within Fiji. These services, which
are of generally good quality, are provided through the Government Department
of Posts and Telecommunications (P&T), now operating on commercial lines
under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Communications, Works and Tourism.
Although P&T also provides telecommunications services to neighboring South
Pacific territories, Cable and Wireless, a licensed private company, operates
international telephone, telegraph and telex services. This company will
complete installing an earth satellite station in early 1976, which will
give Fiji direct connections to several new destinations via the Pacific
Ocean Satellite and supplement the present cable facilities.



- 6-
Existing Telecommunication Facilities
18.       As of end-1974, Fiji had 25,600 connected telephones, with a
density of 4.6 telephones per 100 population which is quite low, compared
to American Samoa (12.1) and French Polynesia (9.1). Of the subscribers,
55% are classified as "business,' 30% as "residential," and 15% as Govern-
mental; however, a large number of the telephones located in residences are
used by businessmen, government officials, small contractors, technicians,
doctors and nurses. Close to 90% of telephone usage is for productive or
other essential purposes.
19.       Telecommunication services are concentrated in the area of the
capital - Suva - which accounts for over 14,000 telephones, (a density of
17.8 per 100 population for Suva and other principal cities) compared to
9,800 telephones in all other parts of Viti Levu, (a density of 3.0). There
are only 1,190 telephones on Vanua Levu and 450 on all the other islands.
The average density of telephones in rural communities is about 2.4. The
concentration of telecommunications services in the Suva area is due to the
presence of Government, business and financial institutions which provide
services for the whole country, and, therefore, benefits the rest of the
country, where telephone subscribers must contact Suva for their needs and
for marketing their products. P&T has been extending services to many
islands and remote villages, but demand for telephones in many locations
has still not been met.
20.       Fiji had 14 automatic and 11 manual telephone exchanges at the end
of 1974. There are three step-by-step type automatic exchanges with others
using modern, common control crossbar-type equipment. The total capacity of
all exchanges is presently 20,200 lines with 14,800 direct exchange lines.
About 2,500 more lines will be connected before mid-1976. All exchanges are
well maintained.
21.       Different types of radio transmission systems constitute 95% of
Fiji's long distance service network. Microwave systems connect major cities
cn the two main islands and very high frequency radio communication serves
several other cities. The circuit capacity of several routes is used up, or
will be soon, and requires relief. The telephone service has been extended
to 48 small islands by means of radio telephone while 35 radio telephones
are being.installed in isolated villages on the two main islands. There is
a need to expand the long distance network to meet expected traffic increases
and to serve areas and islands presently without these services.
22.       Telegraph service is provided from 82 telegraph offices and the
telex exchange in Suva is equipped for 160 lines with about 136 subscribers.
There are at present 43 applications for telex service still to be met due
to shortages of equipment. These are being provided in the proposed project.
During 1970-73 the demand for telephones in the local service grew by about
12% annually; it will continue to increase. Although 15,900 connected direct
exchange lines by end-1975 are expected to increase during the project
period to 21,300 by 1978, the unsatisfied demand is also likely to increase
from 5,400 to 9,000. On the long distance service, an average annual traffic
increase of 18% is forecast through 1978. While no increase in demand for



-7-
internal telegraph traffic is foreseen, an average 14% increase in telex
traffic is expected during 1975-78. Substantial increases are also forecast
for international telephone, telegraph and telex traffic.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
23.       The proposed project would be the Bank's second for telecommunica-
tions development in Fiji. The first loan (833-FIJ) made in June 1972, which
assisted in the financing of the national expansion program for telecommuni-
cations services during the last four years (1972-75) of the Five-Year Devel-
opment Plan (1971-75), provided for extension of the local telephone and long
distance system throughout Viti Levu and between Viti Levu and other islands,
and for the expansion of telex and telegraph services (paragraph 13).
24.       The proposed project comprises the first three years (1976-78) of
the next telecommunications development program (1976-80) and was prepared by
P&T. A Bank mission appraised the project in September/October 1974. The
loan was negotiated in Washington, D.C. in April/May 1975. The Government
team consisted of Mr. C. M. Mackenzie, Deputy Secretary of Finance, and Mr.
K. Miles, Permanent Secretary to the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications.
The Appraisal Report (No. 654a-FIJ) on the proposed project is being circulated
separately to the Executive Directors. Annex III provides a loan and project
summary.
25.       The main features of the project are:
(i) the expansion of capacity of the local telephone service
by the installation of automatic switching equipment to
provide 5,400 additional subscribers' lines together with
cable network and associated facilities;
(ii) the extension of the long distance service by installing
radio systems and carrier equipment to improve inter-
connections between the main population centers and to
provide services to remote islands and rural areas not
being served presently;
(iii) the expansion of telex exchanges by installing about 90 tele-
printers, and of international services;
(iv) construction of buildings and provision of miscellaneous
facilities; and
(v) consultants' services for procurement.



v8-
26.       Project planning and engineering have been carried out by P&T which
will be responsible for executing the project. P&T propose to continue to
retain the British firm of Messrs. Preece, Cardew and Rider as consultants
for the preparation of bid specifications and the Crown Agents for assistance
in procurement. These arrangements are satisfactory.
P&T
27.       The organizational structure of P&T generally follows the pattern of
similar agencies in most British Commonwealth countries. The Trust Account
Law of October 1973 provides P&T with adequate financial autonomy and vests
P&T with responsibility for servicing all debt incurred by Government on its
behalf. The Permanent Secretary for Posts and Telecommunications who is
responsible for the administration of P&T manages the trust account, while
the approval of the Minister of Finance is required for P&T's capital in-
vestments. In view of these provisions, P&T's operating budget no longer
requires parliamentary approval. The management of P&T's financial affairs
is satisfactory.
28.       P&T's management and staff are well qualifLed and competent.    The
Government will replace the few expatriates still hoLding managerial and
technical positions in P&T with qualified Fijians as they become available.
P&T staff totalled 850 in mid-1974, with about 630 directly engaged in
telecommunications. The resulting ratio of 28 per 1,000 telephones is a
reduction from 33 per 1,000 in 1971 and compares favorably with 34 in Papua-
New Guinea and 86 in Indonesia. Technical staff at various levels and trained
personnel previously left P&T for better salaries or for lucrative overseas
positions. A decreasing number of such staff is now leaving P&T as fewer
more attractive jobs in Fiji and overseas are available, and the staffing
position has therefore improved.
29.       The training of technical staff was earlier provided by National
Technical Institute and by P&T's training school. From April 1975, a
Regional Telecommunications Training Center has been established in Suva
to train technical telecommunications staff from the South Pacific, in-
cluding Fiji. The level of intake of trainees from P&T seems appropriate,
and these new training arrangements will substantially improve P&T's
recruitment and training position.
30.       P&T's operations have been reorganized and improved considerably
following decisions made by the Government when Loan 833-FIJ was made.
A separate Finance Section for telecommunications was established in P&T
on January 1, 1974 and a commercial accounting system installed, with the
assistance of an accounting consultant, to provide management with timely
information for sound financial decisions. A record of assets has been
compiled and a proper valuation made of all telecommunication plant, applying
reasonable depreciation rates. P&T will simplify billing by installing modern
equipment to mechanise the process.



-9-
31.       P&T's tariffs have remained essentially unchanged during the last
five years. Authority for approving tariff revisions is vested with the
Minister of Communications, Works and Tourism, although in practice Cabinet
concurrence is obtained. In order to ensure that P&T's earnings will be
sufficient to provide for an adequate contribution to future expansion and
also to service debt, Government decided, when Loan 833-FIJ was made, that
tariffs will be maintained at a level that will produce a rate of return on
average net fixed assets in service, properly valued, of not less than 12%.
Agreement was reached that P&T will continue to maintain tariffs at this
level (Section 4.05 of the Loan Agreement). In the past, Government de-
partments in Fiji paid no charges to P&T for the use of telecommunication
services. From January 1, 1974, P&T is billing Government, and full rates
are being paid for all services.
32.       P&T's average actual rate of return during 1969-73 was 20.5%.
P&T's operating results and financial position have been very satisfactory
through 1975, and forecasts through 1980 indicate that favorable operating
results would continue. It is estimated that P&T revenues will grow at an
average annual rate of about 15%. Although rates of return will decline
from 22.1% (in 1974) to 15.5% in 1980 due to increasing operating costs, the
17.7% average rate of return forecast for the period is still well above the
level of 12% agreed as appropriate under Loan 833-FIJ and for the proposed
loan (para 31).
33.       The expansion program (1976-78) which the proposed loan would
assist in financing will increase plant in service by more than 67% to about
US$25.6 million. P&T's internally generated funds during this period would
total US$12.6 million and would meet 46% of the cost of P&T's expansion after
debt service and after making payments to the Government (para 35); borrowings
would cover the balance of the cost.
34.       Forecasts also indicate that in 1978 P&T's debt/equity ratio would
not exceed 44:56 still leaving a fair margin for-further bofrowing. Under
Loan 833-FIJ the Government has agreed not to incur long term debt on behalf
of P&T or for its telecommunications branch unless the preceding 12 months'
net revenues of the branch cover maximum future annual debt service at least
1.5 times, and this undertaking is continued under the proposed loan (section
4.06 of the draft Loan Agreement). It is estimated that debt service cover-
age by internal cash generation would not fall below 3.6 times through 1980.
35.       The Government agreed under Loan 833-FIJ that P&T would pay out
of net income for telecommunications a reasonable return on Government's
equity investment. Government had not decided how it should be compensated
for its investment. This question was, therefore, discussed during nego-
tiations. An understanding was reached that Government will review P&T's
cash position at the end of each fiscal year and allow P&T to retain suffi-
cient funds to help finance its development program and operational needs;



- 10 -
and thereafter, determine the level of P&T's contribution to Government,
payable either as an interest on Government's equity in P&T as defined in
the Trust Account Act of 1973 or in another similar form. For this purpose,
the Government will make the first review of P&T's cash position for the year
ending December 31, 1974 which is the first full year of operation after
the Trust Account Act became effective. Financial forecasts assume that
on this basis payments by P&T to Government would total US$5.9 million
(1974-78).
Costs and Financing
36.       The project is estimated to cost US$14.0 million with a foreign
exchange component of US$9.6 million. The proposed US$5.0 million loan will
finance 52% of foreign exchange and about 36% of the total costs of the
project. The Government expects to seek bilateral aid from the United Kingdom
(U.K.) for US$2.9 million. The balance (US$6.1 million) will come from P&T's
resources. In the event that the U.K. loan is not forthcoming, the Govern-
ment will make available the funds needed. The proposed Bank loan would be
made to the Government for 20 years including 5 years grace. The cost
estimates for equipment and services are based on prices recently obtained
for telecommunications equipment in Fiji, and include 3.8% for physical con-
tingencies, and for price escalation 17.9% for foreign costs and 20.3% for
local costs.
Procurement
37.       All Bank financed items would be procured following international com-
petitive bidding procedures with the exception of US$1.21 million of switching
equipment which would be procured through negotiations with the supplier of
equipment in existing installations. Seventy one percent of the switching
equipment consists of extensions to existing exchanges, which should be of
the same type as that already installed in order to be compatible and achieve
maximum economy through the use of existing common facilities. The remaining
switching equipment is for one new telephone exchange. If international
competitive bidding is used for procuring this equipment and a single exchange
of different type is installed, it would substantially complicate exchange
maintenance and staff training. In view of the small size of the telephone
network in Fiji and the standardized switching equipment in use, negotiated
purchase has been agreed for this item from the supplier of the other
exchanges, provided that the terms and conditions of the contract with the
supplier are acceptable to the Bank and the price compares reasonably with
prices obtained for similar equipment after competitive bidding (Schedule 4
to the draft Loan Agreement). All the equipment would be imported.
38.       Items not financed by the Bank will be procured through nego-
tiations from existing suppliers, mostly in the U.K. for reasons of
standardization.



Disbursement
39.       The proposed loan would be disbursed against the CIF cost of
imported equipment for 5,400 automatic telephone exchange lines, for expansion
of exchanges, for telephone sets, radio telephones, microwave and ultra
high frequency systems, and for the foreign cost of services. In view of
P&T's plans for further expansion, any unused balance of the loan would be
applied to the purchase of similar additional goods and services, subject
to prior agreement by the Bank.
Justification of the Project
40.       The Government has assigned the highest priority to the project
because it would help support Fiji's development objectives by providing
and improving essential services to tourism, industry, trade, agriculture
and business activities. The importance of good telecommunication services
arises from Fiji's geography and topography (para 16). There are few roads;
and public transportation facilities are inadequate. The difficult and time-
consuming transportation of people across hilly terrain and over wide ex-
panses of ocean makes reliable telecommunication services indispensable to
production and marketing of goods for domestic consumption and for exports,
for coordinating transportation, for maintaining social and administrative
contact between population centers and remote rural areas, and for developing
tourism, trade and commerce. The project will extend telecommunications
services to remote islands and to isolated rural areas on the two main
islands assisting in the production, distribution and marketing of agricul-
tural products.
41.       New telephone connections are authorized on the basis of a priority
list under which commercial and business subscribers' demands are given
high priority, followed by those of medical, security and other essential
services, and lastly by those of residential subscribers. P&T will establish
services to about 18 remote and isolated areas of Fiji. In addition P&T will
extend the telephone services to some 15 villages on Viti Levu by providing
coin-boxes and public telephones.
42.       The financial support to the Government budget provided by P&T's
payments to the Government out of its net income constitute an important
project tenefit. These payments will amount to about US$5.9 million (1974-78).
In addition, the execution of the project will strengthen P&T's financial
base and enable P&T to continue financing future expansion plans out of funds
partly generated from user charges.
43.       The internal financial return on the project is about 15%. A
sensitivity analysis allowing for a 10% increase in capital and operating
cost and a 10% decrease in revenues would result in a rate of return of
11.5%. The economic rate of return is probably higher because, first the
price charged for the service may not adequately represent the full benefits
to the subscribers, particularly those obtaining new services; second, there



- 12 -
would be external benefits which accrue to parties other than those who pay
directly for use of facilities; third, although the cost of extending serv-
ices to new areas is taken into account, the full benefits would accrue only
in the future when additional lines are connected in those areas.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTiORITY
44.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Government of Fiji and the
Bank, the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in Article III,
Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of the Resolution
approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately.
45.       Features of the Loan Agreement of special interest are referred to
in paragraphs 31, 34, and 37 of this Report.
46.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
47.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan,

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Loan No. 771-FIJ               First Highway Project;
US$11.8 million loan of June 30,
1971 and US$4.2 million supplementary
loan of February 1, 1973; Closing
Date. December 31, 1977.
This first Bank project in Fiji provided financing for detailed
engineering by consultants of the 110-mile Nadi-Suva road in three sections:
No.  1:  Nadi-Korotongo (41 m), No.   2:  Korotongo-Deumba (43 M), No.   3:
Deumba-Suva (26 m); construction of Sections Nos. 1 and 3; and supervision
of construction by consultants.



ANNEX II
Page 2
The total estimated cost of the project at the time the original
loan was made on June 30, 1971 was US$16.6 million of which US$11.8 million
was provided by the Bank loan. The estimated construction cost of the
project was revised substantially upward following the results of re-bidding
the project works. Revised project costs were estimated at US$31.8 million
and the original loan was increased to US$16.0 million on February 1, 1973.
In addition, Australia and New Zealand agreed to contribute US$2.7 and US$1.8
million, respectively, to help meet higher project costs. Execution of the
project, payments by the Government to the contractor and supervision by the
consultants are generally satisfactory. The works are about a third complete
compared to elapsed contractual time of 50%. It is likely that the works
will require an extra six months to complete but will be finished within the
Closing Date (December 31, 1977).
Loan No. 833-FIJ              First Teleco munication project:
US$2.2 million Loan of June 23, 1972;
Closing Date: June 30, 1977
The project supports P&T's 1971-75 development program. After
initial delays resulting mainly from the hurricane in October 1972 with its
damage to existing telecommunications, the project is now proceeding satis-
factorily. Procurement and disbursement have picked up substantially and
the loan is expected to be fully disbursed by March 31, 1976. The project
is expected to be completed by mid-1976 on schedule.
The financial covenants in the Loan Agreement are being met.
Considerable progress has been made toward reorganizing P&T's financial
procedures and establishing the new commercial accounting system. Satis-
factory training arrangements have been established since April 1975.
P&T's financial position is sound and operating results are exceeding
forecasts.
