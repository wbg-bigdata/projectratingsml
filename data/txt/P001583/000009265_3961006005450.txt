*     Les entreprises reparties en quatre classifications seront agreees pour les. cat6gories
suivantes (voir tableau du decoupage des marches pour les P.M.E.en categorie travaux,
Annexe 6):
(a) micro-entreprise: tres faible qualification technique, pas de materiel mecanise, seuls les
travaux des categories A - B - C - D - E leurs seront confies d'une maniere generale.
(b) petite entreprise: faible qualification technique, tres peu de materiel mecanise, les
travaux des categories A - B - C - D - E - F - G - H leurs seront confies d'une maniere
gin6rale.
(c) moyenne entreprise:    qualification technique, peu de materiel mecanise, les travaux
des categories A - B - C - D - E - F - G - H - I - J - K - L leurs seront confi6s d'une maniere
generale (meme si les categories A - B - C - D - E ne les concement pas a priori), avec des
sous-traitances prevues pour les cat6gories J et K.

*     Ce classement qui reflete le potentiel des entreprises A rinterieur d'une classification,
permettra de d6terminer le montant maximum des marchEs pour lesquels les entreprises
pourront soumissionner dans leur classification.
a) Micro-entreprises
Les marches interesseront un effiectif de rordre de 60 entreprises agrEecs et seront soit:

traitances a la moitie inferieure du classement et les marches des catigories G et H a la moitie
suprieure du classement dans la classification.
c) Moyennes et grosses entreprises
Les march6s int6resseront un effectif de rordre de 10 entreprises agriees et seront attribu6s

Annex E - Extracts from Manuel de Procedures, Chapitre 1Y                        59
(c) Caractere confidentiel de la Proc6dure.
Apres l'ouverture des plis en seance publique, aucun renseignement concernant l'examen des
plis, les precisions demandees et revaluation des offTes ainsi que les reconumandations relatives
a l'attribution du marche ne doit etre communiqu6 aux sounmissionnaires ou a toute personne
n'ayant pas qualite pour participer a la proc6dure de selection tant que le nom du titulaire n'a
pas ete annonce.
(d) Examen des offres.
Apres la seance d'ouverture des plis, la Commission 'Attributic. doit verifier si les offres:
(i) sont dament signees;
(ii) sont accompagn6es des cautionnements demand6s;
(iii) correspondent pour ressentiel au dossier d'appel doffres;
(Iv) ne comportent pas de graves erreurs de calcul;
(v) sont, par ailleurs, recevables.
Toute offre qui n'est pas conforne pour l'essentiel aux conditions et specifications du dossier
d'appel d'offies, soit qu'elle presente avec celles-ci des differences considerables, soit qu'olle
comprenne des reserves trop importantes, est rejetee. Une fois que les plis ont et6 ouverts, le
soumissionnaire n'est plus autoris6 a corriger ou a supprimer les diffirences ou reserves
importantes.
(e) Evaluation et comparaison des offres.
L'6valuation doit permettre de determiner le cout de chaque offre et de comparer les offres
entre elles sur cette base. Le prix de l'offre lu a haute voix lors de la s6ance d'ouverture des
plis doit etre ajust6 pour tenir compte de toute erreur de calcul. Si un prix global et des prix
unitaires sont respectivement au-dessous de 15% ou 30% des prix de reference, et si les
explications fournies pour justifier ces ecarts de prix ne sont pas acceptables, cette soumnission
sera rejetee.
La Commission d'Attribution doit etablir un rapport d6taillN sur l'valuation et la comparaison
des offres indiquant les el6ments precis sur lesquels elle s'est fbnd6 pour recommander
rattribution du marche.
(f) Selection des soumissionnaires.
La Commission d'Attribution doit d6ternminer si le sounissionnaire dont loffre a et6 jug6e la
moins disante a la capacite et l'assise financiere voulues pour executer le marche. Les critires
a remplir auront 6te precises dans le dossier d'appel d'offres et, si le soumissionnaire ny repond
pas, son offre sera rejetee.
(g) Attribution du marche.
Les marches doivent etre attribues pendant la periode de validite des offres. I ne peut etre
demand6 au soumnissionnaire d'accepter, comme condition d'obtention du march6, de se
charger de travaux ne figurant pas dans le devis descriptifni de modifier son offire.

(h) Prorogation de la validite des offTes.
Si des circonstances exceptionnelles justifient une prorogation de la validit6 des offres, une
demande 6crite doit Ctre pr6sent6e A tous les soumissionnaires avant la date d'expiration. Les
soumissionnaires ne doivent pas 8tre invit6s ni autoris6s a cette occasion & modifier leur prix
ou d'autres conditions de leur offre.
(i) Rejet de toutes les offres.
II n'est pas pefnis de rejeter toutes les offres et d'en demander de nouvelles sur la base des
memes prescriptions techniques aux seules fins d'obtenir des prix inferieurs, sauf au cas od
r'offle jugee la moins disante d6passe consid6rablement les estimations de coQts. Au lieu de
lancer un nouvel appel d'offres, I'Agence peut alors entamer des discussions avec le
soumissionnaire ayant pr6sente rofe la moins disante (ou sAil n'obtient pas de reponse
interessante, avec le soumissionnaire se placant immediatement apres) pour essayer d'obtenir
un marche satisfaisant. Le rejet global des offies peut egalement se justifier lorsque celles-ca
ne sont pas conformes pour ressentiel au dossier d'appel d'offres ou qu'il n'y a pas jeu efficace
de ia concurrence.
Quand ele rejette toutes les offres, rAgence doit en 6tudier la raison avant de lancer un nouvel
A.0. et doit envisager de r6viser des clauses techniques et 6ventuellement de modifier le sous-
projet.

considerE, et le projet ne peut 8tre differe,
b)    le sous-projet est suffisamment simple pour pouvoir etre contr8le par la direction

* Lune des fonctions essentielies de la direction technique de ragence est de superviser les
bureaux d'etudes agissant pour son compte en tant que maitres d'oeuvre delegues pour le
contr8le des travaux.

convoqu6 le maitre d'oeuvre concern6, robjet de ces visites etant de contr8ler la bonne
execution des obligations contractuelles du maitre d'oeuvre.
* L'Evaluation des prestations du maitre d'oeuvre devra donc se referer exclusivement au

Section I.   Evaluation des travaux
A)    PrEsentation et contr6le des decomptes
* L'agence aura une entiere autorit6 sur le reglement des decomptes mensuels des entreprises
signataires d'un marche avec elle.
* Les marches de travaux seront admnstres suivant les regles du code des marches Publics:
1)    Les reglements des P.M.E. seront effectues par ragence-Matre d'Ouvrage DelEgue, i
partir des dEcomptes etablis par elle et correspondant & des situations mensuelles de travaux
certifiees par le bureau de contr8le.
2)    Les situations mensuelles de travaux reprendront les quantites cumulees reUllement
executees et les appliqueront aux prix unitaires qui sy rattachent et qui figurent dans le
Bordereau de Prix contractuel.
3)    Le calcul de ces prix unitaires sera mene a partir du sous-detail de Prix de la tache
correspondante qui comprendra ou pas les fournitures de materiaux et d'equipernents par
lAgence suivant les cas.
* Le visa du bureau de supervision sur les situations mensuolles devra declencher le processus
de reglement des entreprises par une simplification de procedures, pour aboutir au paiement
effectif des P.M.E sur compte bancaire au plus tard i J + 30 de la date du visa pour accord
sur les situations.
- Les differentes procedures et etapes permettant de respecter ce delai maximum de 1+30
seront:
(i)   Presentation - examen - contr8le du decompte mensuel i rAgence (avec la
situation)               => J+ 5

* Une retenue de garantie sera ainsi d6duite de chaque acompte i hauteur de 10% du budget
du march6.
L'Agence, repr6sent6e le cas 6ch6ant par le mattre doeuvre, convoque alors rentreprise aux
op6rations de reception qui ont lieu dans les meilleurs d6lais.
Les vrifications portent sur un ensemble dboprations qui se deroulent chronologiquement
comme suit:
1) La constatation de l'achevement ou de Iinex6cution partielle da travaux et la constatation
6ventuelle d'imperfections ou de malfacons,
2) Dans le cas de malfagons ou defaillances graves, I'Agence peut refuser de prononcer la
reception provisoire et enjoindre par ordre de service a l'entreprise de demolir les ouvrage
defectueux ou non conformes aux stipulations du contrat et de refaire les travaux.
3) le repr6sentant de l'Agence, accompagn6 le cas 6ch6ant du Maitre d'oeuvre et le
repr6sentant de Pentreprise etablissent un proces-verbal de r6ception provisoire des travaux
quils signent,
4) au cas ou le representant de Pentreprise refuse de signer, ce refus est mentionne au
proces-verbal. Au vu de ce proces-verbal, rAgence decide de prononcer soit la r6ception
provisoire sans r6serves, soit la r6ception provisoire des travaux avec r6serves,
5) il notifie alors sa dtcision a rentreprise en lui enjoignant d'executer ou d'achever les travaux
omis ou incomplets et de remdier aux imperfections et malfagons constat6es,
6) il fixe un delai a rentreprise pour proceder aux travaux requis. Le d6lai de garantie stipul6
au contrat court a compter de la r6ception provisoire. Pendant ce d6lai, rentreprise est mise en
demeure par rAgence d'ex6cuter les travaux qui lui incombent au titre de la garantie. Pass6 ce
d6lai rAgence est en droit de faire executer les travaux mentionnes au proces-verbal de
r6ception provisoire par une entreprise de son choix aux frais et risques de rentreprise titulaire
du march6,
7) le solde des sonunes dues a Pentreprise est normalement pay6 lors de la r6ception provisoire
sous d6duction d'une eventuelle retenue au titre des travaux onis, incomplets ou
d'imperfections et malfacons constatees.
8) Le bureau de supervision etablit alors un proces-verbal de reception provisoire sign6 par lui
meme et rentrepreneur, qui permet i Pagence soit de prononcer la r6ception provisoire des
travaux, soit la r6ception avec r6serves dans le cas 6ventuel de travaux inacheves ou de
mal*ons constat6es.
9) Dans ce dernier cas, le d6W de garantie stipule dans le march6 prendra effet a compter de
cette reception pour la mise en demeure de Ientreprise par r'Agence pour ex6cuter les travaux
inachev6s ou recommencer les travaux d6fectueux.

10) En cas de refus ou d'inex6cution, I'Agence est en droit de recourir a rex6cution d'office et
de pr6lever sur des sommes retenues au titre de la garantie, les sommes necessaires au
rernboursement des d6penses engagees.
C)    RdEeption d6finitive
- La reception d6finitive est prononcee a la fin du d6lai de garantie par un proces-verbal notifie
i 1entreprise.
* Le b6n6ficiaire des travaux peut assister a leur r6ception d6finitive dont la date lui est notifi6e
par rAgence au moins cinq jours ouvwables avant cette reception. LVavis du representant de
lAgence est prepond6rant pour accepter ou refuser la r6ception d6finitive.
* LAgence lib6re alors la retenue de garantie sous r6serve de rextcuion des travaux qui
incombent a rentreprise au titre de la garantie.
* II sera important a ce stade, de proc6der avec la contribution du bureau de supervision i un
examen a posteriori du deroulement complet des travaux dans le but d'valuer la performance
de rentreprise concern6e, ses progres ou ses d6fililances, pour un reclassement ou un
d6classement le cas 6ch6ant.

ANNEX F. STATUS OF PROJCT PREPARATION
Legal Docment
A PPF advance in an amount of US$ 300,000 was granted in February 1993. AGETIPA
has been registered and granted the status of a public utility (Manuel de Procedures,
Annexe 7; also in Annex i). A Convention between AGETIPA and the government1 has
been signed, as well as between AGETIPA and the municipality2. The model of Contrat
de Maitrise d'Ouvrage dilOgu&e2, to be used for each sub-project between AGETIPA and
the municipality, as well as the final Convention' between AGETIPA and the goverrnent
were completed during the negotiations of the project. As a result of the positive outcome
of the test sub-projects and the reconstruction needs in the aftermath of Hurricane Giralda
which hit Antananarivo on February 1, 1994, an increase of US$ 975,000 to the PPF
advance was made soon after negotiations..
Test Sub-Projects
Eight sub-projects have been identified to be used as a test for AGETIPA's performance
during project preparation. All of them are now under way and should be completed by
the end of February 1994.

The contracts were awarded on November 5, 1993, except for the last sub-project,
providing for the improvement of the Anosy intersection in front of the veterans' building,
which was awarded on December 6, 1993. The delay in the launching of this sub-project
is due to a field simulation, which seeks the reactions of beneficiaries to the new design;
this is reflective of the participatory approach being sought in the Project.

ANNEX G. STUDIES
During Project Preparation
Thirteen studies have been identified and will be carried out during project preparation. The
status of these studies is:
1.    Studies Related to the Sub-Projects
.1 .Output and efficiency of production of paving stones in the Antananarivo area
This study, awarded on October 12. 1993, is now completed. Three subjects were to be
investigated by the consultant: the local capacity to provide paving stones, a marketing study of
the demand for paving stones by the construction industry in the Antananarivo area, and
proposals to improve the efficiency of the production of paving stones. The study has been
placed in the Project File.
1.2. Ambohijatovo -ark
The study was awarded on October 18. According to the Terms of Reference, the consulting
firm will have to set up a package of tendering documents for the contract of the renovation of
the Ambohijatovo park. This park is located in the center of the city. The very small number
of parks in Antananarivo expWlains the great importance of Ambohijatovo.
The preliminary engineering studies are now completed. The final engineering studies are new
completed up to 85%. The consultant will also provide the tendering documents based on the
studies, and participate in the evaluation of the bids for the award of the contracts.
1.3. Drainage pattem of the up_er Antananarivo
This study is now completed. The consulting firm has divided the area of upper Antananarivo
in seven sub-areas, independent in terms of drainage problems. It has designed separate work
projects for each of these sub-areas, and prepared a cost evaluation for each. The study has
been placed in the Project File.
1.4. Traffic study of Ananaarivo
This study was awarded on November 23 and is now completed. The objective of the study
was to prepare a traffic count of Antananarivo city. The consultant has provided a map
indicating the number of vehicles per day per specific routes. The counting of vehicles has
been done within one week and distinguishes between different types of vehicles. The study
includes flow charts of main routes and prinary intersections; data is also provided in tables.
The study has been placed in the Project File.
1.5. Environmental assessment of a sample of representaive suMprojects
This study was awarded on December 15, 1993. According to the Terms of Reference, the
objective of the assessment is to ensure that there will be no adverse impact, within acceptable
limits, on the environment as a result of the execution of the sub-projects. The Consultant will
have to design and conduct the sub-project assessments, monitor the implementation of key
sub-projects, evaluate the assessment process, and conduct a review workshop.  The
preliminary study is now completed.

1.6. Economic rate of return of a sample of representative sub-proiects
This study was awarded on November 23 and is now completed. The study analyzes
technically and economically twenty representative sub-projects, identified in the Terms of
Reference. The objectives of the study are to:
- technically, describe the condition of each representative sub-project and
submit various proposals for the works -,) be carried out. The cost of the works and the
recurrent costs will be spelled out.
- economically, assess the benefits and costs of each representative sub-project.
The economic rate of return and the social impact of the sub-projects will be determined from
this analysis. The results of the study are given below. The average rate of return of the
investigated sub-projects is about 30%.
The study has been placed in the Project File.

charge of this study will also set up training programs for local consulting firms, for the
instruction in these new tests and procedures.
2.6 Software needs for AGETIPA
This study, currently under way, will provide AGETEPA with the costs of implementing the
software needed for procurement processes and monitoring of the works. The costs will
include the price of the software, the adaptation of the software to the needs of AGETEPA, and
training of the users of the software.
2.7 Format for technical audits
This study is currently under way. Two technical audits are programmed to be carried out in
1994, and two in each following year. The consultant in charge of this study will define the
content of the technical audit, and the schedule of the auditing missions.  This includes
preliminary work in common with the financial auditors, the audit itself, the proposal of
technical measures to AGETIPA's management, and a final meeting with the financial auditors
to prepare a common report.

ANNEX H. TRAINING FOR LOCAL SME'S AND
CONSULTANTS IN THE CONSTRUCnON INDUSTRY1
I.    INTRODUCTION
1.1   In conjunction with the preliminary design, appraisal, and support for the test phase of
the Antananarivo Urban Works Project (AUWP), a series of working papers was prepared. A
synthesis of these papers is provided here for ease of rsferenc.. The original papers have been
placed in the project files. A list of the titles of these papers is provided as Attachment A.
II.    PREIXMINARY OVERVIEW OF TRAINING DESIGN ISSUES
(Working Paper No. 2)
2.1   The AUWP can be said to have two sets of goals-long-term and short-term-which
require somewhat different sets of training actions. In the short-term, for example, the
primary objective is the execution of maintenance work through contracts to the private sector.
Ile contracting firms selected for the initial sub-projects would bring with them a fair level of
technical capability. The primary area of training required for their performance would be
related to the costing/processing of the sub-projects in order that they could bid on work. In
the long-run, however, building the capacity of the private sector would require upgrading the
sklls of the more marginal firms. There will need to a balance in the design of the training
component for the project between both sets of needs.
2.2   It will be necessary to provide training under the project for: (i) the staff of the
executing agency-AGMIPA-; (ii) certain municipal employees; (iii) the consulting and
contracting industry; and (iv) community groups. Although the staff of AGETPA may play a
role in the provision of training under the project-especially during the early phases-the
primary role of the executing agency should be the supervision of training and the assurance of
consistency and quality control; such external sources as NMOs and existing vocational
training programs should be considered for the provision of training under contracts issued by
AGETlPA.
2.3   The training to be provided under the project should be developed using the following
general guidelines: (i) it should be practically oriented, keyed to the specific needs of learners;
(ii) it should be designed on the basis of learners as adults; (iii) it should have an "out-
put"/"capacity-building" orientation; and (iv) it should support the need to fast-track project
implementation.
2.4   Training should be provided through a variety of settings which have little classroom
structure, for example: (i) self-taught/interactive training; (ii) group seminars and workshops;
(iii) in-house instruction including groups and one-on-one consultation; and (iv) on-the-job
training. The training package for the AUWP should include printed materials-for example,
specifying procedures or technology-and explanatory notes or explanations, trainer's
guidelines, workbook samples and exercises, demonstrations, and practical exercises. It should
also provide mechanisms for the evaluation of proficiency and for periodic reviews and
I As adapted from Working Papers No. 2-7, by Ph. Moeller.



Annex H - Training for Local SME's & Consultants in the Construction Industry      95
updates. The training should be structured on the basis of specific modules for inter-related
concepts or sub-topics. This would enable the trainer to select from the training package the
module which is most relevant to the specific need of the trainees without using the materials
for the entire topic. Modules can be revised, moreover, without affecting the remainder of the
modules.
2.5.   An early assessment of the cost requirements for training will be necessary. Costs can
be substantially reduced if local resources are used for their production. Many activities or a
full package of all training services can be contracted locally, but review and monitoring will
be essential for quality control and consistency. One of the members of the staff of AGElIPA
should have skills in training program design and implementation.
2.6.   The experience of best practice in the Bank indicates that participants apply themselves
most fully when they must pay a fee for receiving training. In this case it is suggested that the
SMEs and the Design Consultants pay a small fee for training; the municipality should offer a
payment in kind. In view of the different nature of training for the local communities they
should be exempted from the payment of any fees. The design of the project calls for the
initiation of actions during the preparation phase, and it will be necessary to initiate certain
training during this phase. The overall training package should be prepared and operational in
advance of implementation. Fast-tracking the training program can be facilitated by: (i)
drawing upon existing materials where relevant; (ii) initiating preliminary, intensive instruction
in selected key skills, and phasing-in more advanced instruction as needed; (iii) structuring the
curriculum on the basis of modules keyed to specific task performance and levels of
proficiency; (:v) using existing training capacities where appropriate; (v) using counter parts
and/or on-the-job training; and (vi) early identification End hiring/contracting of training
staff/consultants.
2.7    The participation of local communities in the identification of sub-projects is an
essential element of the design in the project. At the community level this element is intended
to promote empowerment, facilitate project effectiveness, and provide a bridge to the cost
sharing element of the project.2 The training required to support community participation in
the project may require attitude change, including the correct use of facilities, and in that
respect it may differ from the training to be offered to other participant.

the set-up of AGETIPA and the first round of contracting under the sub-projects, including the
test sub-projects and the follow-on projects after project effectiveness. An early priority for

the acting Director General should be to recruit the training specialist for AGETIPA or to
contract for such services.
m.   INSTITIUIONAL AND PARTICIPATORY DIMENSIONS
OF PROJECT DESIGN (Working Paper No. 3)
3.1    The management of urban infrastructure in the Antananarivo metropolitan area is
shared by a variety of public organizations. As a result of various institutional constraints
these organizations are unable to keep abreast of maintenance requirements. Such constraints
include: cumbersome administrative procedures, a lack of accountability and monito.-ing
systems, and the compartmentalization of the provision of services. These organizations lack
the absorptive capacity, i-ioreover, to profit from additional technical assistance. Experience in
Sub-Saharan Africa has shown that the reform of public organizations is highly dependent on
comprehensive sector/macro reforms which must be initiated over a protracted period of time.
The deteriorating state of urban infrastructure in Antananarivo, however, requires immediate
attention. This suggests, therefore, the need to introduce a different approach which will de-
link the provision of urban works from the constraints found in the existing system and have a
demonstration affect for subsequent institutional reform and development in Madagascar.
3.2   Institutional capacity in Madagascar clearly must be seen within the administrative
context of recurrent alternations in structure and policy. Parallel to such reorganization and
restructuring of goveinment ministries and agencies have been shifts in the centralization and
decentralization of decision-making and responsibilities within these organizations. Such
policy changes were sometimes rigorously applied, and in other cases they were not.
Considerable confusion has resulted. Within this context the setting of national goals, the
development of long-term plans, the specification of specific organizational missions, and the
establishment of priorities and performance standards has been almost impossible.  The
provision of maintenance for infrastructure has been placed primarily within an emergency
context. The unreliability of service has seriously eroded the confidence of the population in
central, regional, and municipal government.
3.3    The administrative structure in Madagascar consists of four levels of decentralized
units-referred to as a whole as collectivltes decentralisees (CD). The first level consists of six
provinces (Paritany). Tle next level consists of 110 municipalities (Fivondronana). At the
next level are 1,250 urban districts (Firaisana). The lowest level consists of 11,401 wards
(Fokontany). This system has yet to prove effective. First of all, the power and resources of
the respective levels do not correspond to their functions and responsibilities. Secondly, in
actuality the government has maintained close supervision over key issues and made available
only limited funding for local activities. The overall result is not the promotion of local
initiative but a lack of empowerment resulting in the marginal performance of services.
3.4   The Fivondronana corresponds to a mu.icipality and the president of its delegation
speciale can be considered the Mayor. The administration of each municipality is broken down
into various directorates by function, each of which in turn is divided into services. The
provision of maintenance in the fivondronana is primarily a function of the Direction des
Services Techniques (DST). The Ministry of Finance is responsible for assisting the CDs with
resource mobilization and the preparation of annual budgets. These budgets must also be
reviewed by the Ministry of the Interior which has tutelary responsibilities for all local
government. The budgets of the municipalities, however, support little more than recurrent



98                               MADAGASCAR   Antananarivo Urban Works Project
costs, and the function of local government is mainly the provision of employment rather than
the provision of services.
3.5    The greater metropolitan area of Antananarivo includes not just the Fivondronana of
Antananarivo Renivohitra but also four other fivondronana. None of the fivondronana have
the institutional mechanisms necessary to cope with current problems or the growth projected
for the area. Equally limiting, moreo.-ir, is the absence of coordinating mechanisms between
the fivondronana and the lack of a metropolitan maste. plan. The situation is exacerbated by
the existing congesdon in the central area, recurrent problems with drainage and flooding, the
terrain surrounding the area, and the already deteriorated state of infrastructure in the area.
3.6    Until 1988 there was no central authority responsible for the integradon of urban
development. Although various government agencies held responsibilities for activities related
to urban affairs-the Ministry of Public Works (MintstOre des Travaux Publics, MTP), for
example, was responsible for the application of urban policies by all central and local
authorities but had no clear guidelines in the Iorm of a statement of natonal policy-the control
of urban development was weak at best. This gap was filled in January of 1988 by the creation
of the National Technical Committee for Urban Development (Comrti technique national pour
le developpement urbain, CTNDU) to work as a consultative group, serving both as a
coordination mechanism and a forum for the discussion of crucial urban-related issues.
3.7   Then in September of 1991 the Ministry of Urban Development and Tourism
(MinistWre de developpement urbin et de tourisme, MDUT) was created. It drew in part on
directorates from such existing ministries as the Ministry of Public Works and the Ministry of
Transport, Meteorology, and Tourism. Each of the directorates was subdivided into services.
In early April of 1993 the structure and title of these services was under revision pending the
issuance of another new decree. The MUDT in association with CTNDU offers considerable
potential as an agent of policy and coordination. Although the ministry is still defining itself,
it contains the remnants of other govemment ministries, agencies, and operations most familiar
with urban development and the problems associated with urban development. It is the most
likely partner for the project. 4
3.8    The project rationale of de-linking the provision of service from the constraints of
existing governmental organizations and mechanisms through the establishment of AGETIPA is
well supported by the preceding institutional assessment. In summation this results from: (i)
the breadth of the institutional issues which would need to be addressed; (ii) the time and
resources required to address the institutional constraints; (iii) the continuing state of
fluctuation and modification in the institutional system; and (iv) the erosion of popular
confidence in government capacity.
3.9    Although the AUWP seeks to de-link the immediate needs for infrastructure
maintenance from the constraints of the existing bureaucracy, it should not be seen as bi-
passing support for national policy reform and government restructuring. The project is a pilot
effort to demonstrate that infrastructure maintenance and associated services can be provided
by the private sector rather than through in-house, force account services. The project can be
seen as a model for one of three outcomes: (i) As a model for the municipality (or other
government agencies) to follow in developing an in-house capacity to contract out services to
4 In mid 1993 the MUDT was reconstituted as the Minislle de P'Amenagenient du Territoire (MAT).



Annex HA - Training for Local SME's & Consultants in the Construction Industry  99
the private sector; (ii) As a model for the continued use of an external agency to contract for
the services from the private sector providers; or (iii) A mix of one and two, depending upon
comparative advantage. Thus, the life of the agency itself is an open question. It could be a
temporary solution or a permanent resolution. Its context as a mutually beneflting pilot or
model needs to be emphasized in discussions with agencies/individuals who might find it
competitive to their established interests.
3.10   The success of the project will depend upon a high-level of commitment on the part of
the various stake-holders concerned with the project, ranging from the government to the
residents of the Fokontany. The government has already evidenced strong interest In the
project, and this interest was manifest in discussion with other stakeholders as well. liitial
commitment must be reinforced and regenerated both over the life of the project and beyond.
3.11   The best means of ensuring commitment by the stake-holders is to ensure their
participation in all phases of project life, beginning with design and continuing through to final
evaluation.  Project ownership will be especially important at the user and municipal
government levels in order to ensure the implementation of any cost-recovery mechanisms, in
the first instance, and to offset the potential for resistance in the second instance. A variety of
participatory mechanisms will be necessary, including working groups, general popular
fbrums, workshops, and forms of information sharing. These mecharisms should build upon
existing mechanisms wherever possible unless such mechanisms are moribund.

IV. PARTICIPATORY WORKSHOP DEMONSTRATION
(Working Paper No. 4)
4.1 In conjunction with the Appraisal Mission for the AUWP two workshops were held at the
Fokontany level. The objectives of the workshops were to: (i) introduce participatory
methodology into the design phase of the ALTWP; (ii) determine/validate the key concerns of
typical urban communities; (iii) assess the potential for the inclusion of participatory
methodology in the implementation phase of the project; and (iv) provide a methodological
model for application during the implementation phase by AGETIPA.
4.2 The workshops were held on two consecutive days. The participants in the first workshop
included representatives of the Comitd Local de Securitg (CLS) of the West-Central Fokontany
of 67 Hectares. On the second day the workshop was expanded to include representatives of
the CLSs of the three other Fokontany in 67 Hectares.
4.3 The methodology for the workshops used participatory appraisal techniques. Central to the
approach is the use of open, non-directive mechanisms for obtaining data or determining
preferenees. Non-directive techniques seek to enable participants to provide information in the
course of group activities. Validity is cross-checked by the presence of several participants.
The group works as a team with the facilitator providing only minimal guidelines or frames of
refer3nce. This group experience in itself can be a first step toward strengthening community
identification and linkage.
4.4 In this case, in the first workshop the participants were broken into two groups. They
were asked to discuss and prepare a list of what they felt were the major infrastructure
problems in their immediate community. The two lists were then compared and discussed by
all the participants jointly as a whole group. The participants then consolidated the two lists
into a single list of ten issues; the group then scaled the issues in terms of their importance.
The group was then asked to jointly draw a map of their community. After the map had been
prepared, the participants were asked to indicate where the problems were located by using
colors and symbols of their choice.



Annex H - Training for Local SME's & Consultants in the Construction Industry  101
V
4.5    The ownership of the participants was reinforced wherever possible. Such terms as
"your community", "your interests", "your needs" were emphasized. Where possible a
moderator was selected by the participants to guide discussion. The lists and map were saved
for use during the second workshop, but after the second workshop they were given to the
president of the CLS for retention and reference in the Fokontany office.
4.6    The second workshop was divided into two parts. In the first half the participants
discussed past efforts to address the problems identified on the consolidated list and then the
public or private groups with whom they had sought resolution of the problems. The paths of
appeals and the relationships between the organizations were drawn on a large chart. Tle
success of their past attempts was evaluated in terms of short-term and long-term (sustainable)
results. In the second half of the workshop a presentation was made by the facilitator about
AGETIPA. The participants were encouraged to ask questions and make comments on the
proposed approach.
4.7    The participants gave first priority to four problems: Drainage, garbage collection,
housing/squatter settlements, and toilets. In the discussion of these primary problems and the
others they had listed the participants indicated that they understood the inter-relationships
between the problems and also had a fair comprehension of what might be required to resolve
the problems. The participants were highly interested in providing further input in the
Identification of sub-projects. The issue of the structure and function of sub-committees at the
Fokontany level was also reviewed.5
4.8   The methodology used in the workshop for 67 Hectares provides a model for use in the
project. Although the priorities identified by the municipality and the fokontany were quite
similar, the workshops would provide: (i) improved linkage between the municipality and the
Fokontany; (ii) improved information on specific problems found in any one Fokontany; (iii)
improved understanding of the AGETIPA approach at the popular level; (iv) improved
organizational interaction for the Fokontany; and (v) higher ownership/sustainability of project
results.
4.9    Discussions with the Ministry of the Interior and the municipality during the pre-
appraisal mission indicated considerable interest in the application of participatory
methodology under the project as a means of strengthening the relationship between the
Fokontany and the Fivondronana. This interest may need to be focused and regenerated.
4.10 Although the municipality feels it understands the general problems commonly found
throughout the city, the workshop would allow specificity. The workshop would enable either
the collection of problem specific data or the determination of problems which specifically
require at-site visitations. The workshop would also advise the Fokontany on how to best
present their interests to the municipality, providing guidelines, formats, and samples for the
inventory of Fokontany identified problems. Municipal policies and procedures could also be
clarified. The workshops, finally would facilitate ownership by the Fokontany of the results of
the project. Such ownerships would make th  Fokontnay more interested in preserving the
achievement made under the project and in undertaking local actions supportive of correct use
S  As follow-up to this discussion but on their own initiative, the four fokontany subsequently
coopeatively revised the structure of these sub-committees.

and preservation of such infrastructure as parks, market places, garbage collection bins, and
even streets.
4.11   At this point the municipality lacks the qualified personnel and associated resources
necessary to conduct such problem identification/information dissemination workshops. The
project could offset this scarcity by funding a contract to a local consulting firm which would
serve as the facilitators for the workshops. The sustainability of the approach would need
continued resources, an issue requiring further consideration and commitment by the
municipal'

V.    INFORMATION PROGRAM: DESIGN, TARGETS, AND COSTS
(Working Paper No. 5)
5.1    The experience of the Bank with project implementation Indicates the importance of
initiating public information programs at an early date in the project cycle. Effective project
management requires that the stakeholders associated with a project have access to sets of
information ranging from project objectives to the scheduling of activities under sub-projects.
Access to information Is an especially important element in both the promotion of participatory
approaches and the development of the private sector.
5.2   Projects supporting public works are especially visible to public scrutiny and are,
therefore, highly vulnerable to public critique. When such projects are located in urban areas,
then the issue of public inconvenience is intensified. Providing advance information in such
settings can significantly reduce the likelihood of "bad press" as well as encourage the local
ownership of a project.
5.3    AGEIIPA  must provide information to a range of stakeholders including, the
Fivondronana, the Fokontany, Design and Supervision Firms (DSFs) or consulting firms, and
Small and Medium Scale Enterprises (SMEs) as well as various govermment ministries and
agencies, professional associations, NGOs, and the direct beneficiaries of the sub-projects.
The information and training services to be provided by AGETIPA will be inter-related and
mutually supportive. AGETIPA should consider having a local media specialist review the
information program AGETIPA proposes or AGETIPA may wish to contract for a single
package of public relations services. In order to maximize the participation and development
of the private sector, long-term technical assistance will not be considered for the provision of
information services. The information program discussed here is indicative of the components
which must be supported by the project. It is not a rigid structure, and one of the first tasks of
AGETIPA will be to review the fit of the proposed program to the evolving realities and needs
in Madagascar.
5.4    World Bank experience has demonstrated the value of holding a project launch
workshop at the time of project start-up. These workshops ensure that there is a clear
understanding of goals, approach, and strategy for a project as well as facilitate the
coordination and phasing of project elements. They also enable clarification of the specific
roles and responsibilities of each agency or group associated with the project. Since the design
of the AUWP calls for the advance test of a number of sub-projects before effectiveness it will
be necessary to separate the launch workshop into two phases, with, first, a preliminary
Orientation Workshop linked to the first test sub-projects and, later, a more comprehensive
Implementation Workshop closer to the time of project effectiveness.
5.5    AGETIPA will need to plan a general information strategy which builds upon the
suggested list of activities here. Such a strategy should include a more detailed list of
activities, their content, and target audiences.  The approach to the dissemination of
information must build upon a specific understanding of cultural values and norms and should
differentiate betueen information dissemination for general audiences and more specific
targets. The range of activities under the information program is indicated below:
Fokontany Participation Worksltp Workshops enabling the Fokontany to identify their
concens for repairs and rehablitation of infrastructure as well as to give priorities would be

provided through one-day workshops conducted by a local consulting firm in association with
the municipality.
Agen   Promotional Materials- AGETIPA will need a packet of promotional materials
including an agency brochure, posters, and such associated items as pins or stickers.
Agency Computer-Proiection Presentations- A series of up to six computer projected
presentations on AGETIPA and procedures and processes relative to becoming short-listed or
submitting proposals will be prepared by consultants using materials provided by AGETIPA.
These will be on computer disks and can be upgraded or modified as needed.
Oua y Newsle- AGETIPA would publish a newsletter quarterly which would provided
basic information on project/sub-project status. It would also have a feature article jointly
prepared by AGETIPA and a consulting firm which would offer special advise and tips on the
consulting and contracting industries.
Sub-Project Schedules- Specific information on the schedule for work, especially when detours
might be required or services temporarily discontinued, would be published for each sub-
project.
General Mass Media Promotional Activities- AGETIPA will conduct a range of mass media
promotional activities including advertisements on radio and television and the preparation of
articles on AGETIPA and its activities for publication in the local press.
Reference Center- In order to assist the promotion of the private sector a small reference center
will be operated by AGETIPA. This center will use either the facilities of AGETIPA or
Waining site facilities at off hours in order to not disrupt the business operations of AGETIPA.
A variety of materials would be available for public use, especially by the SMEs.
CQgUacting Industry Workshop- The development of the private sector contracting and
construction industry requires the promotion of a supportive environment. Existing research
and country-specific issues will be reviewed at a one-day workshop by selected ministerial,
municipal and industry representatives.
Consulting Profession Workshop- Similarly a workshop should also be held for the private
consulting sector. An alternate would be to combined the focus of the two workshops into one
and to use the funding indicated for an expanded two day workshop.

VI. INDICATIVE TRAINING PROGRAM COMPONENTS
(Working Paper No. 6)
6.1    AGETIPA will assist the development of the private sector in Madagascar by
strengthening the capacity of the Small and Medium Scale Enterprises (SMEs) and Design and
Supervision/Consulting Firms (DSFs) associated with the execution of contracts under the sub-
projects. Actions taken by AGETIPA will be targeted toward both the environment/market
and the very enterprises themselves9. The primary targets for training include: staff of
AGETIPA; staff of the municipality; design and supervision consultants; small and medium
scale construction contractors; and credit facilities. Central to the support to be provided to the
enterprises themselves will be a training package including a mix of such instructional and
counseling components as: written text; guidelines for trainers; expanded commentary; audio-
visuals/handouts; samples, workbooks, exercises; one-on-one consultations; self-instructional
videos; evaluations of proficiency; and reviews and/or updates. More limited training actions
will include in-house training for the staff of AGETIPA, training for credit organizations, and
for the municipality/community.
6.2.  In general the training package will be based on topics or series which, in turn, are
broken down into modules. Each module will have specific components. Except for certain
topics most modules will be kept short, perhaps fifteen minutes, not including time for
exercises.  The evolution of training materials will be on an iterative basis.  Initial
presentations will be evaluated by the trainees and/or use evaluations of trainee proficiency.
These evaluations will be used by the training consultants to improve individual modules.
9 AGETIPA wiU also conduct information on the environment/market for SMEs and DSFs as part of
its information service. This may require some assistance by consultants but wil be largely supported by
the saffof AGETIPA. For discussion see Casting, July 1993.



Annex H - Training for Local SME's & Consultants in the Construction Industry  107
Trainees may provide examples or present questions during a training session which can be
incorporated usefully into the module.
6.3    Although AGETIPA will be responsible for the supervision of all training provided
under the program, the development of the training modules and associated materials will be
contracted to a local firm. During the Appraisal Mission consultations were held with several
firms which have had experience in this area. Because of the need to develop highi quality
materials quickly, the local firm awarded the contract will be required to associate with an
international firm. The international firm will assist start-up during both the test phase in 1993
and full implementation in 1994 as well as provide a recurrent review function. Thus, the
TOR will require experience in the preparation and implementation of training activities both
in Madagascar and internationally.
6.4   The projected schedule for the AUWP indicates that work should start on the test sub-
projects some time in October 1993. This leaves little time in which to prepare the TORs,
tender, and award and will give the consulting fim awarded the contract very little start-up
time.  With this constraint in mind, high priority should be given to recruiting the
information/training specialist for AGETIPA. This specialist will have an especially active
role to play as a result of the fast-tracking which will be required.
6.5    The training program  should be innovative and avoid a traditional class-room
approach. Trainees will be provided information and techniques they need to know in order to
both perform and grow. From an early point the development of the training program has
been seen as an iterative process. As discussed above, this means that the training modules be
used, evaluated-testing how well they meet the needs of the trainees-and improved as
necessary on a recurrent basis; each training action will have an evaluation mechanism to
determine both trainee achievement and satisfaction with the activity. Considerable attention
will also be given to direct consultation with firms-both DSFs and SMEs-on an in-house and
at-site basis. Building a complex, comprehensive curriculum is not the obJective of the
project: rather, capacity-building is.
6.6    Within this framework the training contract, therefore, wMl involve two phases.
During the first phase the consultant will quickly prepare provisional training modules for the
first lot of firms-SMEs and DSFs-to be award contracts; since these firms will be the more
experienced firms, their needs for training will be less than will be required to assist the less
experience firms which will be involved later. If necessary the provisional modules will be
revised and upgraded.
6.7    The consultant will also be required to asses the needs of the SMEs and the DSFs; the
assessment will use materials already produced as well as selective interviews. Based on the
evaluation of the modules prepared and the assessment the consultant will prepare the overall
training program for the implementation phases. This design will be more comprehensive,
including not only supplemental training but also target groups not included during the test
phase. This design will be reviewed by AGETIPA and the Institutional Development
Specialist provided by the Bank before the consultant will be authorized to proceed. The
training developed for the test sub-projects, therefore, will itself serve as a test and basis for
expanded program development.

6.8    During the second phase training modules will continue to be evaluated and revised.
This will be based on end-of-session evaluations by the trainer and trainees as well as in
conjunction with periodic technical audits. The consultant will be responsible for providing
AGETIPA with a master file on disk and a print out for each iteration as revisions are made.'0
TORs will be prepared in accordance with the suggested curriculum and will require a revision
of the curriculum for the implementation phase based on the experience obtained in the test
phase.
6.9    An indicative package of components by specific target has been prepared and will be
provided to AGETIPA as a guide for the preparation of the training package by the
consultants. Using this package as a base, costs have been estimated. These estimates are
based on general unit costs for training in Madagascar obtained during the appraisal mission
and must be considered as indicative. The total cost of US$ 300,000 includes a base cost of
US$ 271,600 plus US$ 27,160 for contingencies. This cost does not provide for inflation over
the three year life of the project.

Annex J - Supervision Plan  ,
ANNEX J. SUPERVISION PLAN
The Antananarivo Urban Works Project will be supervised every four months.
The supervision plan will provide for combined supervision missions in which auditors,
World Banc supervisors and foreign consultants responsible for technical and managerial
assistance would participate.
Supervision missions will consist of field trips to review financial anx4 maent
practices, tendering and payments procedures, the supervision and performance of sub-
projects, as well as the development of small, intermediate and medium-scale enteprises. The
missions will also carefully monitor the number of registered firms, the number of firms
bidding and winning contracts, the number of firms receiving technical assistance, and the
performance of AGETIPA through the use of key performance indicators (Manual of
Procedures, Annex 10).
The supervision of the project will be simplified by computerized project management. To
improve his proficiency with the CPM software, AGETIPA's General Manager has used it to
keep track of all the tasks for project preparation. During project implemenaion, he will use
the software to schedule and carefully monitor all the tasks of AGETIPA, including: sub-
projects, studies, training servies, scheduling of supervision missions and audits, and
administrative activities.
Two examples of the CPM document used to monitor project preparation are given below.
They reflect the status of project preparation as of mid-JWanuary 1994.
- the first one gives two extracts of the project: from task 48 to task 61, the schedule for
the environmental study and the first steps in the execution of test sub-projects, and
from task 110 to task 120, the last tasks of the project preparation, from the
negotiations to the signing of the Credit Agreement and the short-listing of auditors.
- the second one embraces the entire scope of project preparation, taking into account
only summary tasks;
In both examples:
-  planned bars (white) correspond to the project preparation as scheduled in its early
days;
-  striped bars represent the current schedule of project preparation (scheduled star and
finish dates are given on the sides of the bars);
-  black bars give the progress of each task, with the percentage completed above;
-  Summary tasks are represented with special bars; and
-  Milestones are indicated by a diamond, with the date of their execution above or NA if
not completed yet.

ANNEX K. SUB-PROJECTS SUMMRY
Eight test sub-projects have been identified for the project preparation.. More details about
these test sub-projects are given in the Annex F.
Before the effectiveness of the project, the government and the municipality will identify sub-
projects for the first year of project implementation, which will have to comply with the
requirements of the Manuel de Proc6dures, COzapfre IV, Secdon ff (also in Annex E) to be
eligible for IDA's financing. An objective of 20 sub-projects to be undertaken is sought for In
the first year of project implementation.
At the end of 1993, 30 sub-projects had been identified. According to the nature of works they
involve, they can be clustered as follows:

All the sub-projects mentioned above are described with full details and pictures in a folder
located in the Project File. A second folder gathers pictures of the test sub-projects, covering
the whole duration of the works.
The identification of possible sub-projects is not over, and will be carried on all through the
project implementation.
Before project effectiveness, AGETIPA will choose approximately 20 sub-projects among the
identified ones, and will launch the engineering studies related to them. It will then be
possible to begin the works on the sub-projects as soon as the project becomes effective.
tThe sub-projects taken into accomunt to calculate the average costs are the ten medium sub-projects in
terms of the costs of works. This is aimed to exclude very costly sub-project like the 'lumction road
between Main roads 2 and 7- which is estimated 7,600 Mio FMg, and very little sub-projects like the
'Ankadifotsy Befelatanan  St' estimated 3.5 Mio FMg.
2The-cost of the works for these drainage subprjects is.    sub-am  II: 1,700 Mio FMg
sub-area V: 5,900 Mio FMg

Annex M - Environmental Review                                          121
ANNEx M. ENviRoNMENTAL REVIEWI
1.    Madagascar has been blessed with both flora and fauna the uniqueness of which
impresses both scientists and tourists and the preservation of which is an international
concern.  A  diverse body of agencies and organizations are concerned with
environmental issues in Madagascar, including government bodies, international
donors, and NGOs. The main national agencies include: the National Environmental
Office (Office National de I'Environnement, ONE), the National Association for the
Management of Protected Areas (ANGAP); and the National Association for
Environmental Actions (ANAE).
2.    Attempts to consolidate environmental protection in Madagascar have just
begun. Major institutional issues include: flagging popular and government support
over time; the need to revise institutional arrangements; the limited extent to which
ONE has been able to carry out its coordination function; the limited development of
national policy; the duplication and overlapping of roles and responsibilities; an, the
slow development of national legislation supporting environmental protection.
3.   The relevance of the Antananarivo Urban Works Project (AUWP) to
environmental issues has been reviewed, and the AUWP has been designated a class B
project (The Environmental Data Sheet for the AUWP is provided as Appendix A).
Since the AUWP will be confined to the central Ant=anarivo, it has little potential
impact on any protected areas or bio-systems. In fact, the project would have a
positive impact on environmental conditions in the inner urban ar.-. It has been
agreed, however, that an assessment would be made of the environmental impact of the
sub-projects. It is in conjunction with such assessments and the promotion of local
capacity-building in the private sector that the AUWP can be most supportive of
environmental concerns in the country.  It is proposed that an assessment of a
representative sample of sub-projects
be contracted to the private sector.
4.    To the extent possible the AUWP should encourage the strengthening of local
capacity to conduct environmental assessments. This interest, however, in the first
instance must be balanced against the need to fast-track sub-project preparation during
the test phase before project effectiveness. Similarly the objective of not overburdening
AGEnIPA-itself intended to be a model for later application--must be kept in mind.

levels/experience of the private sector and the potential for skill enhancement through
training. The existing skill base and experience available in-country is limited. A
survey conducted for AFrEN in 1990 revealed the existence of about 30 local
consultants in Madagascar with skills relevant to environmental programs. The same
survey identified about twelve firms with varying degrees of competence and
experience in environmental studies or projects2. Similarly there were perhaps 40
NGOs with relevant experience3. The experience gained by most local fims had been
in association with intemational firms or organizations and would need to be
supplemented by training.
6.    Since the NGO community in Madagascar is already playing a role in
conjunction with the NEAP, it would seem a logical choice to tap them as a resource.
A review of the capability of the NGOs relative to implementation issues for the NEAP
in Madagascar suggests that the local NGOs were already carrying about as much as
they could and had little absorptive capacity to take on more.
7.    The absorptive capacity of the private sector was more difficult to assess. In
conjunction with a recent tendering by ANGAP, 21 of the 54 submittants of proposals
were classed as local consulting firms. Again, a review of the credentials of these
firms indicated that most firms had gained their experience in conjunction with
exatriate firms. ANGAP did not feel that-except for the top two or three-these firns
could conduct environmental assessments without some degree of training.
8.   Discussion with ONE indicated that they were in the process of designing a
training package for local consulting firms which would prepare them to conduct
environmental assessments.  The syllabus was under preparation, but would be
primarily technical in content. The program would be initiated in the last quarter of the
year. The ONE felt it had the financial resources for the training but was especially
interested in the idea of AUWP hiring some of the trainees to provide environmental
assessments for the sub-projects.
9.    AGETIPA will have to review the proposed curriculum to see how well it fits
with the requirements of the AUWP. The ONE would very much like to collaborate
with AGETIPA in developing the format for the assessment. Most likely, the
management training proposed for the consulting firms under the project in general
would also be applicable for the firms interesting in being trained to conduct the
assessments.
2 The survey listed the following firms: AIA, JARY, BRGM, FRISA, GEDID, INFRASMAD,
MAGE, MICROS, OSIPD, SOATEG, SECE, SOMET, and SOMEAH.
3     NGOs Listed included: COMODE (A cluster of NGOs), FJKM, FLM/SAFAI, FIKRIFAMA,
GARITAS, WWF, IC, DVV, ACCN, JICADRAIC, TIAKO, WESM, and WV.
