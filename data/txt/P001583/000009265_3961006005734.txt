MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO
THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT OF
SDR 13.3 MILLION TO
THE REPUBLIC OF MADAGASCAR
FOR AN ANTANANARIVO URBAN WORKS PROJECT.
I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed IDA credit in
the amount equivalent to SDR 13.3 million to the Government of Madagascar e'n standard IDA
terms, with 40 years maturity.
1.    Bacliground. With a population of about  21.4 million, growing at 3 percent p.a., and a
declining GNP per capita of about US$ 230 in 1992, Madagascar is one of the poorest countries in
the world. Its capital, Antananarivo, with a population of about 1.5 million growing at 7 percent
p.a., is the major economic center, with 21 percent of GDP, 24 percent of total consumption, and
35 percent of total imports concentrated in this area. About 60 percent of the 500 km road
network which serres the city is in bad condition, severely constraining the supply response to a
collective transport demand of 450,000 passengers per day growing at 21percent p.a. With a
vehicle fleet growing at a steady 8 percent a year, this situation has dramnatically increaced traffic
congestion, time losses and accident rates, and constitutes a major obstacle to any attempt to
reverse economic distress towards sustainable growth.
2.    Madagascar is a striking example of unfulfilled potential. It has ample but often misused
resources, ranging from cheap and easily trained labor to natural resources. The recent start of a
new political era forged with democratic institutions promoting a market-based economy has
resulted in a rethinking of the national economic strategy. The new government has opted for a "6
percent sustained growth" scenario, to be achieved through daring and innovative economic
policies. The existing constraints to such a growth-oriented strategy include: inadequate
infrastructure for urban transport and markets, poor social conditions, inefficiency of government
institutions, and shortage of foreign exchange.  The proposed project would contribute to a
reduction of all of these constraints.
3.    This sustainable growtni scenario will feed on sustained investments coming from national
and international savings. In the short run, national savings will come exclusively from public
savings generated by a good management of public expenditures. More immediately, the major
share of investments will come from external savings, i.e., public aid for development and for
private investments. In the long run, these investments are expected to trigger private domestic
savings.
4.    Project Objectives.  The main objective of the proposed project is to introduce a
contracting-out approach for the management ana maintenance of infrastructure works.  The
project will familiarize the government with the efficiency of this new instrument and serve as a
model for subsequent use.
5.    There are two central development objectives. The first is to restore the road-related
infrastructure of Antananarivo, and the second is to develop domestic small and medium
enterprises (SMEs) in the construction and engineering industry. The associated objectives are: to
strengthen the management capacity of the municipality, to create jobs by encouraging the use of



2
labor-intensive technologies, whenever economically efficient, and to stimulate growth in the
con;truction industry and in the economy as a whole.  The project will use participatory
methodology to increase the voice of users and stakeholders in maintenance planning and better
link the municipality to popular interests.
6.    Project Description. The project will include the creation of an executing agency, Agence
d'Execution des Travaix dI'nfrastructures Publiques d'Antananarivo (AGETIPA, Executing
Agency for Public Infrastructure Works in Antananarivo), the execution of sub-projects for
improving the infrastructure in Antananarivo, a training program for SMEs and public institutions,
and the provision of services to inform the public about the approach of the project and the work
program. The sub-projects will be identified by the municipality and other public agencies,
reviewed by the executing agency according to clear eligibility criteria, and packaged for
incorporation into an annual work program. AGETIPA will annually oversee the contracting of
about 25 sub-projects--primarily urban road and street repair--with an average value for each sub-
project of about US$ 200,000.
7.    The Agency will be headed by a broadly empowered General Manager (GM), to be
recruited from the private sector, whose responsibilities will be clearly defined in the Statutes of
the Agency. The GM will report to a General Assembly including representatives of the
municipality, the water and electricity company, associations of domestic contractors and
consultants, road transporters, and labor unions.  User and stakeholder ownership will be
promoted through participatory methodology.  The government and AGETIPA will sign a
convention delegating to AGETIPA the full and exclusive responsibility to review and approve
proposed sub-projects, invite and evaluate tenders, award and administer contracts (engineering
studies, works and supervision), and provide technical assistance. These responsibilities will be
carried out according to a detailed Manual of Procedures--acceptable to IDA--and will be verified
on the basis of monthly progress reports and teclmical and financial audits carried out by external
auditors acceptable to IDA. The training program for SMEs will cover the execution of sub-
projects and basic business management; promising consulting firms will be trained to become
future executing agencies in their own right.
8.    Project Implementation.  An essential feature of project implementation is the fast-
tracking of certain project components as a tcst i.n advance of effectiveness.  The project is
expected to be implemented in three years, with an average annual volume of works and services
of about US$ 7 million equivalent. Subsequent annual work programs, including corresponding
counterpart funding arrangements and the grouping of sub-projects, will be presented to IDA by
AGETIPA annually for approval. The operating costs of the Agency are estimated to be about 6
percent of total costs, exclusive of audits, training, and services. The proposed project assumes
that the disbursements will span a four-year period because the use of a professional, independent
agency to contract works and consulting services is expected to minimize the traditional delays due
to bureaucratic constraints. This expectation is corroborated by the Bank's experience with similar
projects in West Africa. Slower actual disbursements would increase AGETIPA's fee and reduce
the global ERR of the project.
9.    Project Sustainability. The project will rehabilitate infrastructure which has deteriorated
for lack of maintenance under the present system.  It will introduce efficient methods for
implementing an adequate maintenance program.  It will create the basis for enhanced cost



3
recovery and long term sustairiability. AGETIPA will provide a model which is expected to be
replicated for other government-financed works.
10.   Lessons Learned from Previous IDA Involvement. The Urban Development Project
approved by the Bank in 1984, attempted to improve the institutional capacity of the municipality
of Antananarivo. The project was limited by the constraints of working within the governmental
system--including the bloated staff structure of the municipality of about 2,000 employees--and
failed to introduce sustainable reforms or increase the productivity of the services provided by the
municipality. The innovation offered by the proposed project to delegate contract management to
an independent executing agency builds on the lessons of the past. It provides a mechanism for
both getting works done, and compensating for the deficiencies of the current staff which limit the
capacity of the municipality itself to directly contract for services. It will open the door for
eventual reductions in staff.
11.   The proposed project follows region-wide recommendations to improve the entry quality of
projects, and draws largely from the experience of similar projects using the AGETIP (Agence
d'Exgcution de Travaux d'lnteret Public pour l'Emploi) approach which has beer, successfully
introduced in six West African countries. The design of the proposed project is simple but
includes such key elements as: the participation of beneficiaries in the selection of sub-projects; the
contracting-out of services to the private sector; the use of key monitoring indicators; the
preparation of an implementation manual (Manual of Procedures) as part of the appraisal of the
project; selectively targeted training programs; the use of sample bidding documents; the
recruitment of key staff before effectiveness; the financing of incremental recurrent costs by the
government; and arrangements to secure sufficient counterpart funding. As experienced in West
Africa, this approach has accelerated disbursements, through facilitating the prompt payment of
invoices presented by contractors, and has, in turn. resulted in a 15 percent reduction in bidding
prices. In particular in Mauritania, advanced contribution of government counterpart funds has
worked well.
12.   Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The proposed project is fully consistent with the
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) which was discussed by the Board on May 18, 1992. The
Bank's over-arching objectives in Madagascar ar't to help promote sustained export-led growth
with equity, to help reduce poverty and to protect the environment. In pursuing these objectives
through its lending and economic sector work, the Bank is giving priority to: (i) improving macro-
economic management; (ii) reducing the role and scope of the public sector and strengthening its
management; (iii) promoting export diversification through private sector development and external
competitiveness; (iv) alleviating widespread poverty; and (v) removing physical and human capital
constraints to sustainable long-term growth. The proposed project will strengthen the service
delivery capacity of the government through a contracting-out approach, alleviate poverty through
substantial employment generation, remove physical constraints through improving transport
infrastructure and support private sector development. The proposed project is also expected to
have a positive impact on the environment.
13.   The experience gained by IDA in the development of agencies responsihle for public works
makes it the natural leader to support this project in Madagascac.  The project will be
complemented by the proposed transport sector project, which will support the broad
harmonization of sector policies, the rationalization of resource allocation in the sector, and the
restructuring of the railway. The proposed Urban Works project will also serve as a pilot for



4
futnre highway projects. It will promote the development of small contractors and engineering
firms who should be able to take over the responsibility for larger infrastructure projects later on.
It will be used to quickly repair selected urban infrastructures destroyed by the January/February
1994 cyclones in Antananarivo. Finally, it will help improve the disbursement performance of
IDA's portfolio in Madagascar by increasing the abrzrptive capacity for civil works in all sectors.
14.   Capacity Building. The proposed project will be critical to effective capacity building for
provision of public services. Rather than providing technical assistance to a limited number of
civil servants, the project seeks to promote a comprehensive reform of the sector by using private
contractors and by encouraging a result-oriented approach.  The project seeks to provide an
enabling environment conducive to the contracting of municipal services to the private sector by
shedding the tendering and supervision processes from existing bureaucratic constraints.
Concurrently the project would strengthen the municipality's capacity to represent community
interests and technically identify sub-projects for consideration by AGETiPA. Within this context,
the interests of multiple stakeholders will be furthered.
15.   Agreed Actions.  The sub-projects will be eligible for financing if their counterpart
funding is included in the annual budget of the government and/or the municipality. The local
contribution will be shared by the municipality and the MAT, increased during the life of the
project from 5 percent to 15 percent, and deposited up-front for each sub-project or group of sub-
projects.
16.   If the government/municipality fails to maintain the works previously rehabilitated under
the project, IDA would delay its approvai of the next annual work program. At the mid-term
review, agreement will be sought for improved use of the municipality's resources. The adequacy
of arrangements for selection, financing and implementati3i of sub-projects and cost recovery will
also be reviewed, as well as the inclusion of components for the training of the municipal police
and for the rehabilitation of public buildings.
17.   Environmental Aspects. The project's environmental classification is B. Its direct impact
on the environment--drainage works, sanitation, tree planting, garbage collection--is expected to be
positive, and its indirect impact--for example, the dumping of refuse--will be regulated under
specific provisions in the bidding documents. A review of the impact of individual sub-projects
will be conducted locally by environmental specialists.
18.   Program Objective Categories. The project will improve the basic urban infrastructure
(IU), build managerial capacity in the public institutions (PB) and develop the private sector (PV).
The generation of employment will contribute to poverty alleviation (PA).
19.   Benefits. The project benefits would be: (i) the availability of a tested model for the
efficient contracting-out of infrastructure maintenance; (ii) the development of about one hundred
firms in the construction industry in Antananarivo; (iii) the rehabilitation of about 300 km of
essential urban roads; (iv) the creation of jobs in an amount of about 70,000 person-months; and
(v) the building of capacity within the municipality.
20.    Risks. There are five potential risks: (i) the risk of insufficient funding will be addressed
by the requirement that government provide its contribution up-front and progressively increase the
proportion of its cost sharing for works during project implementation--the overall issue of



5
resource allocation in the transport sector will be dealt with under a concurrent transport sector
project; (ii) the risk of government interference in the management of AGETIPA will be reduced
by establishing adequate procedures for decision making early in the project's life; (iii) the risk of
poor performance by the executing agency is low, based on the agency's strong initial
performance; (iv) the risk of failure to maintain works already undertaken under the project will be
mitigated by making such maintenance a condition for the approval of subsequent annual work
programs; and (v) the prompt payment for works and services by the agency will reduce the risk of
poor performance by small contractors and engineering firms which are particularly sensitive to
problems of short-term cash flow.
21.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.

MADAGASCAR
ANTANANARIVO URBAN WORKS PROJECTS
Note on projects with significant disbursement lag
1.    Most Madagascar projects have suffered from slow disbursements due partly to
generic problems, including (a) lack of counterpart funds; (b) difficulties for project
managers to access IDA funds deposited in special accounts opened by the Central
Bank and operated by signatories in the Treasury; and (c) cumbersome public
procurement procedures due to repeated reviews by central agencies. The situation
worsened in July 1991 with the onset of political turmoil. Large scale demonstrations
and strikes paralyzed public administration and severely disrupted economic activity.
The country has now completed a process of political transition (new government in
place since late August 1993). Project implementation continued to be slow during the
two-year transition. The generic problems noted above have affected ail projects, in
addition to project-specific delays. The following projectr have the most significant
disbursement lags:
Accounting and Management Training Project (Cr. 1661-MAFG. Even though the
project has attained most of its goals, disbursements are low due to larger than
anticipated co-financing from grants by Canada and France. Agreement has been
reached on possible uses for some of the remaining funds, and a little more than US$1
million has been cancelled.
Forest Management (Cr. 1878-MAG). Implementation of this project has been
delayed by a wide variety of problems (organizational, personnel, counterpart funds,
marketing). A mid-term review in March 1992 made recommendations to redirect and
streamline the project and agreed on an action plan. The Forestry Department (DEF)
has so far implemented the agreed program with minor delays. The Fanamalanga pine
forest plantation has almost completed its efforts at reorganization and equipping to
meet its tasks, and is continuing its efforts to find foreign operators who are interested
in its products and by-products.
Seventh Highway Project (Cr. 1905-MAG). This project was mostly affected by the
generic problems of cumbersome procurement procedures and lack of counterpart
funds.  Many contracts have now been signed and disbursements have increased
significantly (US$8 million. in FY93 and slightly more than US$12 million already in
FY94 by the end of January 1994).

iconomic Management and Social Action Project (Cr. 1967-MAG).
Implementation of IDA-financed components was slow, partly due to complexity of
project design. Components financed by grants from Switzerland and UNDP were
disbursing more rapidly. Following the establishment of a new coordination unit
(private sector), the disbursement rate picked up and the project was redesigned in
October 1992 to streamline its activities.
National Agricultural Research Project (Cr. 2042-MAG). The project experienced
an eight-month start-up delay in meeting credit effectiveness conditions. Project
execution was disrupted in 1991 due to the political turmoil in the country and
continued to be affected by institutional disputes.  Several missions in 1993 have
focussed on possibilities for restructuring the project, and a proposal to downsize the
project and cancel part of the credit is expected shortly.
Education Sector Reinforcement Project (Cr. 2094-MAG). Only 20% of this credit
has been disbursed, even though the project has been effective for three years. Project
objectives and design are being simplified in order to speed up project implementation.
Financial Sector and Private Enterprise Development (APEX) Project (Cr. 2104-
MAG). The APEX credit, despite a good commitment record, is not disbursing
rapidly. A mid-term review in October 1993 gave particular attention to identifying
and addressing the probleriis which are holding up disbursements. Solutions to a
number of problems (e.g. authorization for Central Bank to request disbursement
directly, simplified methodology for ERR calculation, clarification of eligibility
criteria, procurement guidelines, more regular monitoring) were agreed with the
Borrower and for the most part are already being implemented.
Antananarivo  Plain  Development Project (Cr. 2117-MAG).   This project
experienced start-up delays, due both to procurement procedures as well as complicated
resettlement issues, but most of these problems have been resolved and disbursements
are expected to pick up considerably.
Environment Project (Cr. 2125-MAG). Madagascar's period of political and social
instability coincided with and affected the take-off of this project. The institutional set-
up of the project has, however, been put in place and seems to be attaining a
satisfactory implementation capacity. The project now needs to be concentrated in
priority areas and establish realistic objectives and performance criteria. A mid-term
review mission and meeting with the cofinanciers was held in December 1993, to
address these issues.
National Health Project (Cr. 2251-MAG). Start of this project was delayed due to
slow establishment of a project management structure. Competent project staff have
now been recruited and disbursements are expected to increase significantly.

2.    Some recent breakthroughs have been made which should go some way towards
addressing the generic problems involving procurement and access to special accounts.
These breakthroughs followed the Country Implementation Review (CIR) in
Antananarivo in December 1990 and a follow-up CIR in March 1992. Government
agreed to: (a) issue new regulations for procurement and use standard bidding
documents which comply with Bank guidelines; and (b) publish a decree allowing
project managers to have direct access to special accounts to be opened in commercial
banks to ensure that funds for project implementation are available as and when
needed. Both of these changes are now operational. In addition, attention has been
given to the availability of counterpart funds for Bank projects within the context of
public expenditure/ investment reviews, and to identifying areas where shifting
priorities or resource constraints may necessitate restructuring. A review of the public
investment program was held in November 1993. A CPPR is planned for the second
half of FY94. In FY93, disbursements for investment operations reached US$41
million, i.e. almost 80% more than the total amount disbursed in FY92. In FY94,
US$26 million had been disbursed as of January 1994.
