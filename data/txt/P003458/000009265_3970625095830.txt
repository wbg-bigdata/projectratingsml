TIANJIN PORT PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:        People's Republic of China
Beneficiary:     Tianjin Port Authority
Amount:          US$130 million
Terms:           Twenty years, including five years of grace, at the standard
variable interest rate.
Relending
Terms:        GOC procedures for ports subsector; currently 20 years,
including five years of grace, at 4Z p.a. interest, and TPA
will bear the foreign exchange risk betweem the dollar and
the borrower's currency and commitment charge on the
subsidiary loan.
Project
Description:   rte project will directly contribute to China's overall plan
_..- remove port bottlenecks by constructing deepwater berths
at key ports by 1990. The project will meet government
objectives by supporting infrastructura development at the
Tianjin port; providing training in planning. design, control
and operation of ports; including preparation of a master
plan for the Tianjin port; providing equipment for the devel-
opment of computerized operations and information systems,
and a study on reducing siltation in the port; and establish-
ing the Tianjin Port Development Center for training,
research, and development studies. It will also contribute
to the development of an important new organizational model
for port operation and management in China.
Specifically, the project would: (a) increase capacity by
construction of 2,150 m of quaywalls for timber, construction
material and general cargo berths with the necessary works
like dredging, reclamation, railways, pavement, roadways,
utilities, and supply of equipment; (b) provide technical
assistance and training for port personnel to minimize silta-
tion, to extend computer control of operations, to prepare a
master plan for the port and to further develop management
information systems; and (c) establish Tianjin Port
Development Center and provide the necessary equipment and
technical assistance.
Risks:           There are no unusual risks associated with the project since
all components involve proven technology that has been in



- 'I-
eztended use in China or in other parts of the world. The
training that will be provided to Tianjin Port Authority
(TPA) personnel to construct and operate the new project will
assure its proper function and use. The risk involves
possible delays in project start-up due to the introduction
of ICB for civil works in this subsector. To minimize this
risk, appropriate Bank assistance and supervision will be
provided in the early project stages.

TIANJIN PORT PROJECT
r . THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
1.01      The structure of China's economy, which for three decades emphasized
heavy industry at the expense of light industry and the service sector, is
still inherently "transport intensive," despite recent reforms of the sectoral
priorities. Chinese policy statements repeatedly identify transportation and
energy shortages as the two most critical bottlenecks in the economy. Coal is
at the heart of both problems, because coal is simultaneously the most import-
ant source of energy and the largest user of transport capacity. This dual
problem with coal is exacerbated by China's high level of energy consumption
per unit of GDP (about two and a half times that of other ldcs). However, the
need to ship large volumes of coal is not the sole cause of the transportation
bottleneck. The rapid growth of China's economy in recent years has naturally
entailed ; growing demand for the shipment of commodities of all sorts, and
for passenger travel as well. Efforts to reduce waste within the transport
system (for example, by eliminating cross hauling of the same commodity,
increasing the processing of raw materials before shipment, and increasing the
intensity of road and waterway utilization) are certainly desirable. More
fundamentally, however, the Government's strategy for solving transportation
shortages will have to rely on an expansion of the system's capacity, primar-
ily by increasing the productivity of existing facilities wherever possible,
and secondarily by building new facilities where needed.
A. Traffic
1.02      Freight Traffic.  Domestic freight transported in 1984 reached 1,131
billion ton-km, a 15-fold increase since 1952, or an average annual growth
rate of almost 92, systematically higher than the growth of domestic
product. By the year 2000, domestic freight traffic could be in the range of
3,000 billion ton-km, or nearly three times the 1984 level. The modal split
has moved toward a more balanced use of modes, but the railways still handle
64Z of the traffic versus 82% in 1952; this predominance is expected to
continue for quite some time.
1.03      Passenger traffic reached 362 billion passenger-km (p-km) in 1984, a
14.6-fold increase since 1952 and an average annual growth rate of almost
9%. Since 1978, growth averaged 13Z p.a. This illustrates the potential
demand for travel as income grows. It is likely that this growth would have
been even more rapid if it had not been constrained by the limited capacity,
particularly of the railways, to offer more passenger services. The modal
split has shifted more rapidly than for freight, and the railways now handle
less than 56% of the !traffic versus over 80% in 1952. Despite the rapid
growth of passenger traffic in recent years, the mobility of people in China
is still much lower than in countries of comparable income levels. By the
turn of the century, passenger traffic may well reach about 1,500 billion p-km
per year or about four times current levels.



-2-
B. Investment
1.04      Over the period 1953-84, some Y 136 billion, or 14Z of all new
investments under central government control went to transport. In comparison
with other countries, annual levels of transport as a investment appear some-
what on the low side, a factor contributing to transport's being a bottleneck
to economic development. For example, by 1983, 30 million tons of coal had
accumulated in Shan i for lack of transport, and some of this stockpiled coal
was destroyed by spontaneous combustion. Despite a recent policy of
curtailing production to match available transport, the volume of coal
stockpiled in ShAnxi increased during 1984. Rural areas are short of
transport, both for agriculture and for commune and brigade enterprises. In
the ports, lack of proper handling facilities is hampering trade of bulk
commodities such as fertilizers, cement and grain. In the forthcoming
decades, a much larger investment effort will be needed in transport if these
bottlenecks are to be overcome.
C. System
1.05      The railway system consists of some 52,000 route-km, of which about
9,700 km are double or multiple-track and 3,100 km are electrified. The net-
work is served by 11,100 locomotives, 291,000 freight cars and 19,600 passen-
ger coaches. At present, 682 of tractive power is still steam, 28Z diesel and
42 electric. Freight traffic density averages 15 million net ton-km per
route-km which is the second highest freight density in the world after the
Soviet Union, and 502 higher than freight density in the United States.
Freight traffic reached 1.2 billion tons in 1984. Growth which averaged
4.5Z p.a. since 1978, reached 92 in 1984. Three quarters of all freight
traffic involves ten commodities including coal, iron and steel, grain and
construction materials. The passenger traffic density of 4.2 million passen-
ger-km per route-km is also second in the world this time after India. In
1984 1.1 billion passengers were carried. The average annual increase since
1978 has been 11 p.a.
1.06      Despite some possible rationalization in the transport of natural
resources and heavy industrial outputs, there is no question that the trans-
port demand for the major commodities will continue to grow rapidly. Thus,
although the rail share is expected to decrease, rail traffic will continue to
grow requiring massive investments in line capacity increases as well as in
motive power and rollini stock well into the future. The Bank has financed
two railway projects.(Loan 2394-jCA, 1984 and 2540-CHA, 1985) and a third is
scheduled for Board approval soon. Besides line capacity increases, these
projects include assistance to the manufacture of electric locomotive,
passenger coaches and signalling equipment, as well as to railway management.
1.07      The highway system comprised about 915,000 km in 1983, of which
about 180,000 km were asphalt paved, about 510,000 km were gravel and sand
paved, and the remainder were earth roads. Despite impressive expansion of
the road network since 1949, when only some 80,000 km of motorable roads exis-
ted, the roads in China today are inadequate because: (a) pavement strength
and quality are poor; (b) there are many thousand kilometeres of extremely
rough macadam surfaced roads with traffic in excess of 300 average daily



-3-
traffic (ADT); (c) congestion is severe near cities, due to mixed slow and
fast moving traffic; and (d) there are gaps of about 4,000 km on major
national roads linking large cities and provincial capitals. The road network
and road transport in China today can therefore be characterized as under-
developed. Road maintenance, however, is well organized and currently absorbs
much of the attention and resources of the provincial and other local road
authorities. Except for western China, the highway network is still very much
a system of feeder roads to the railways. Nevertheless, motor traffic has
reportedly grown at a very high overall annual average of 15% on the national
highways since 1978. The Bank's First Highway Project in China (Loan
2539-CHA; Credit 1594-CHA) involves the construction or improvement of about
290 km of national roads and about 1,400 km of rural roads.
Transport Issues and Objectives in the 1980s
1.08      The transport system has been severely taxed by the recent economic
development and capacity constraints are evident in all modes. At present,
railway transport is a greater constraint on energy supplies than coal mine
development. Recently initiated projects of line electrification and new line
construction are addressing the problem although it will take several years to
alleviate bottlenecks between major mining areas and coastal cities. Modern
freight car technology and operational improvements could also contribute to
capacity increases. China will also need to expand substantially its ports
and waterways facilities for domestic and foreign trade (details on the port
subsector are given below). But the most serious transport need is for
dramatically expanded road transport, especially in rural areas where
increased specialization has created an urgent demand for better farm to
market transport services. It is widely recognized in China that road
transport should and will play a larger role in the future. Yet there seems
to be no strate'gic plan to bring this about. There is a need for more
efficient trucks of both larger and smaller size as well as for more and
better roads to handle the traffic. Potential sources of financing for road
development such as road user charges need to be investigated as they could
generate sufficient funds for an accelerated construction and improvement
program as well as contributing po an economically appropriate division of
traffic between modes. Considerable efficiency gains could be made in the
entire transport system through better:intermodal coordination which has thus
far been impeded by the vertical and self-contained organization of transport
and other sectoral agencies. Through container transport from origin to
destination is still the exception. Changes in policy, pricing and management
of the system are needed to maximize the benefits of intermodal transport. To
support all th_ developments referred above, staff development and training
will also be an important ob;ctive in the sector.
II. THE PORT SUBSECTOR
A. Port Facilities
2.01      China has 15 major coastal ports but most foreign trade passes
through just seven of these: Dalian, Huangpu, Qingdao, Qinghuangdao,



-4-
Shanghai, Tianjin and Zhanjiang. There are also many minor ports along
China's 2,000 km coastline and 110,000 km of navigable rivers. China's
largest port, and one of the ten largest ports in the world, is Shanghai. It
has 96 berths with a total waterfront of 12,700 m but only 50 berths acces-
sible to ships larger than 10,000 dwt. In 1984, Shanghai port handled just
over 100 million tons of cargo and more than 10 million passengers. Dalian
and Tianjin are China's next largest ports. Dalian has 36 deep water berths
and a further 3 under construction. Tianjin has 26 berths and 3 under con-
struction. Approximately 30X of all traffic passes through Shanghai, 35%
through the three bulk cargo ports of Dalian, Qingdao and Qinhuangdao, 9%
through Tianjin and 26Z through the remaining 10 major ports.
2.02      Most of China's ports are now badly congested.  There are shortages
of bulk cargo berths, container berths, port equipment and storage areas and
transport infrastructure for distribution. For example, in 1981 container
cargo at the most important 7 ports was only 700,000 tons, even though 60% of
general cargo of 42 million tons was suitable for concainers. As a result,
ship waiting time is very high; outside Shanghai part alone there are usually
120 vescels at anchor waiting for berths. The extent of the congestion is so
serious that it threatens to hold back further expansion of China's foreign
trade.
B. Traffic
2.03      Despite the serious congestion, for the size of its economy China's
port traffic is low compared with other developing countries. This is mostly
because of China's historical emphasis on self-sufficiency. In 1983, China's
foreign trade accounted for abolit 13% of GNP whereas Brazil's accounted for
about 20% of GNP, Korea's for nekrly 30%. However, China's port traffic is
now growing quick4y following the opening of the economy to foreign trade:
between 1977 and 1983 traffic at the 15 major ports increased over 50% to
249 million tons (Table 2.1).                             l
2.04      Tonnages of domestic and foreign cargoes are growing about equally
but proportionately foreign traffic is growing faster. Between 1977 and 1983
foreign traffic more than doubled to 89 million tons and domestic traffic
increased about 502 to 160 million tons. Foreign trade is expected to con-
tinue growing in stride with the economy as a whole, and domestic water trans-
port should play an increasing role to relieve the congested rail system.
These two elements combined will continue to generate a large demand for port
capacity and port traffic could more than quadruple its 1980 level by the end
of the century. Accommodating such an increase would require major expansion
of all China's port facilities.
C. Operations and Maintenance
2.05      All the major ports operate continuously using a 3-shift system but
port operations are hampered by congestion. On average more than 60% of
ships' port time is spent waiting first for berths and then for port equip-
ment. Berth time is also long because a lot of China's port equipment is out-
moded and slow. In 1983 the average demurrage time in Dalian port was 5.7
days, up from 3.6 days in 1981. Total port tir- in 1983 averaged 9.2 days.
In Tianjin the average in 1983 was 5.5 days; in 1984 it increased to 7 days.



5-
2.06      Apart from inadequate port capacity, three aspects of port opera-
tions contribute significantly to the delays. First, documentation procedures
are complicated and ponderous. Frequently this results in port equipment not
being in the right place at the right time and sometimes in cargoes arriving
before bills of lading have been received by the port. Second, in some of the
southern ports, a large proportion of traffic is ship-to-ship or ship-to-barge
transfers some of which could be avoided by direct trading between minor ports
or by modern sea going barges capable of operating both on coastal routes and
inland waterways. Third, not all shipping and domestic distribution is
arranged as efficiently as it might be and some trans-shipment cargoes could
be distributed more easily by rail from another port. Recently, the Ministry
of Communications (MOC) has begun rationalizing some traffic flows. Shanghai,
for example, has already had some coal traffic directed to their final desti-
nations in surrounding provinces and by year 2000, approximately 34 million
tons of other trans-shipment traffic is expected to be diverted from the port.
2.07      Each major port has its own maintenance works and port equipment is
kept serviceable although because of its age much of the equipment suffers
frequent breakdowns. The most serious maintenance problem is siltation at the
estuarine ports and this requires considerable routine dredging. Neverthe-
less, some present dredging may be excessive and might be reduced somewhat
through survey work to understand estuarine flows better.
D.  Costs and Tariffs
2.08      The structure of port ta'riffs and tariff rates are determined
jointly by MOC and the State Price Bureau. The present tariff structure was
set up in 1978 on the basis of an accounting allocation of costs to the dif-
ferent types of port services which was to some extent arbitrary. The tariff
structure also reflects all the distortions inherent in the prices of the dif-
ferent factor inputs. As a first step in rationalizing tariffs, the Bank's
first port project in China (Ln 2207-CHA, October 1982) included a study of
the economic costs of providing port services for bulk cargoes and contain-
ers. This study is to be carried out during 1987, the first year of operating
the new terminals under the project, and includes Tianjin.
2.09      About 8OZ of all Chinese cargo is carried in vessels owned or
operated by the Chinese Ocean Shipping Company (COSCO), which is controlled
directly by the MOC. In national terms, port tariffs paid by COSCO are little
more than a transfer payment between two parts of MOC. Tariff rates could
still be set for efficiency objectives, but instead rates seem to reflect the
relative financial -trengths of COSCO and the ports and their different
investment requirements. In contrast, rates for foreign vessels seem to be
set on the basis of what the market will bear. Until a 40% increase in May
1985, tariff rates for foreign vessels had been kept somewhat lower than rates
at Hong Kong. There was no increase in the lower rates charged for domestic
vessels, and HOC says it has no plans to increase these rates. Overall,
present tariffs provide TPA with a sound financial position (details are in
Chapter 6).
2.10      There are no shipping conference rates for Chinese ports and the
ports only rarely pay demurrage charges for ship waiting. Charter contracts



- 6 -
usually incLude an allowance for ship waiting time, but these charges are paid
by the cargo owner, not by the port. Recently, however, ports have been
signing contracts with ship operators guaranteeing a certain turnover time
with demurrage charges if time is exceeded or premiums paid to the port if a
ship is handled faster. Usually the premiums far exceed the demurrage
charges.
E. Planning and Control
2.11      Investment planning has so far been largely carried out by the MOC
i1 consultation with the ports management. The process starts with the annual
drafting and revision of plans by the ports themselves. These plans are
usually based on actions needed to alleviate congestion. MOC subsequently
holds extensive meetings with port personnel and reviews the draft plans. If
necessary, the plans would be amended during these meetings so as to achieve
consistency with the national transport plan objectives. Once approved by the
MOC, the plans are submitted to the MOF for final approval. In the case of
new projects designed to handle more than one million tons of cargo annually,
approval of the State Planning Commission is also required.
2.12      Financial planning consists mainly of short-term budgeting, because
the traditional grant system of financing combined with rigid central govern-
ment control of project approvals, rendered unnecessary anything more sophis-
ticated. As ports acquire a greater degree of autonomy and greater discretion
over available funds, more comprehensive planning techniques will be needed.
Recently, the Government has initiated quite radical institutional reforms of
the ports sub-sector as part of its policy of devolving responsibility from
the central government. The beneficiary of the proposed loan, Tianjin Port
Authority, is a pilot for these reforms, whose object is to create the incen-
tives necessary to accelerate resource mobilization at the enterprise level,
enhance operating efficiency and provide the extra port capacity needed to
facilitate the further expansion of China's foreign trade. The significance
for TPA's operations is discussed at para. 3.03.
F. The Role of the Bank
2.13      Besides assisting the urgent expansion of port capacity and improve-
ment of productivity, the Bank is through its involvement in the subsector at
this time afforded a unique opportunity to assist Government in introducing
organizational changes aimed at improving the effectiveness of port management
and autonomy of operation. While the general direction of the reforms is
sound, a number of the steps so far taken are short-term expedients pending
the more careful evolution of longer term policies and the benefit of
'experience. Through a dialogue with government and through education at the
enterprise level, the Bank can contribute to the formulation of these policies
in the light of its international experience.
2.14      At the Ministerial level, the Bank will concentrate on demonstrating
to Covernment the need to give increasingly autonomous enterprises an appro-
priate policy framework within which to work; in particular a financial envir-
onment which will encourage planning for expansion, and provide the means to
implement it, thus securing the benefits expected from the system reforms. At



- 7 -
the enterprise level, Bank will continue to help develop project identifica-
tion and evaluation techniques and stress the importance of integrating
investment planning and financial planning. Both these dialogues can best be
pursued through a continuous lending program to the ports.
III. THE BENEFICIARY
A. Legal Status, Organization and Management
3.01      Tianjin Port Authority (TPA) will be the beneficiary of the proposed
project. On June 1, 1984, TPA was placed under the primary leadership of
Tianjin Municipality rather than MOC, and functions as the harbor administra-
tion agency of Tianjin Municipality. Its powers and duties are described in
regulations which have recently been approved by the Tianjin Municipal
Government and found acceptable by the Bank. It has authority over the land
and water areas of Tianjin port, and is responsible inter alia for planning
port development, ra.sing finance therefor, administering fees and charges,
training personnel and enforcing security, safety and environmental protec-
r-ion. It can enter into joint ventures and technical cooperation projects
with foreign partners.
3.02      TPA is managed by a director and a deputy appointed by Tianjin
MuniLipality. Other officials are appointed by the director. TPA controls
the five enterprises that carry out port operations, as well as a number of
other enterprises engage- in warehousing, tug and lighter operation, engineer-
ing and maintenance. Each of these enterprises is self accounting and has
legal personality, but their individual production and project plans and
budgets are subject to approval by TPA, which as their supervisory authority
is ultimately responsible for their coordination. The consolidated plans and
results of TPA and its subordinate enterpriaes are subject to review and
approval by Tianjin Municipality.
3.03      The administrative arrangements for Tianjin port represent a signi-
ficant departure from normal practice in the subsector in a number of ways.
First, Tianjin port is the fitst to be placed under the primary leadership of
the local mAunicipality instead of MOC. Second, the degree of supervision to
which it will be subject is considerably less than that exercised by MOC over
the ports under its leadership. Third, TPA has been endowed with a number of
powers which considerably exceed those typically vested in the administrations
of China's other major ports. In particu'lar:
(a) TPA bas been authorized to retain the income tax and profit remit-
tance due from its subordinate enterprises (and also from the local
branches of PENAVICO, the foreign shipping agency, and SINOTRANS,
the foreign trade transport corporation), and to utilize the funds
for capital expenditures instead of paying them over to the State;
(b) TPA's own approval ceiling on individual capital projects has been
raised to Y 10 million;



(c) foreign exchange earnings of the subordinate enterprises may be
retained by TPA for application to the purchase of imported plant
and equipment.
3.04      Taken together, these arrangements represent a substantial decentra-
lization of authority and increased autonomy for TPA. The objective is to
develop the capability of local management in the interests of improved effi-
ciency of operations and more effective planning and development of the port.
TPA is clearly an experiment: it is referred to in the Chinese documents as a
"pilot system reform."  If it is successful, there could be significant conse-
quences not merely for other ports but for state enterprises generally.
3.05      Due to the large construction program of the Tianjin Municipality,
including port development projects, TPA's construction and development
department (Tianjin Harbor Construction and Development Company -- THCDC) has
recently been separated and given the status of an enterprise under the
Municipality. THCDC is entrusted with feasibility studies, design, bidding
construction supervision and the import of equipment for all the new major
projecLs in the Municipality. A charter for THCDC has been approved by
Tianjin Municipal Government and found acceptable by the Bank. THCDC will be
responsible for the construction of the project and disbursement of funds
allocated to the project.
B.   Facilities
3.06      Tianjin is located about 42 km from the mouth of the Hai river and
120 km Southeast of Beijing (Map IBRD 18961). The city's main port is sited
at Xingang, at the river mouth. Construction of these facilities began in
1939, replacing much older and since abandoned shallow facilities near the
city. There are also shallow draft berths for fishing vessels and ships up to
3,000 dwt at Tanggu, a few km upstream of Xingang. A barrage has been built
on the Hai river between Xingang and Tanggu for irrigation purposes, and
access to Tanggu is through a navigation lock.
3.07      Tianjin port has 26 deep-water operating berths totalling 3,405 m in
length, with water depths alongside between 8.0 m and 12.0 m below MLW. Three
new container berths financed under the Three Ports Project (Loan 2207-CHA)
are nearing completion. The proposed project will add 11 berths with a total
length of 2,150 m and water depths alongside between 11 and 13 m below MLY.
The port is protected by north and south breakwaters of 5 km and 8 km in
length respectively. The access channel extends from the east side of Xingang
lock to the entrance channel Tanggu light tower and is about 24 km in length
and 8 m depth at MLW.
3.08      Tides are semi-diurnal with a range of about 2.5 m between mean high
and low water levels. Ice conditions prevail for about three months of the
year during the months of December through February with most severe condi-
tions in January, but they do not hinder shipping or port operations. The
port and access channel experience heavy siltation naL.;sitating about 8 mil-
lion cu m of snnual maintenance dredging. Dredging spoil is dumped in the
sea. The dumping sites are not selected to prevent the spoil from returning
to the channel and port basins by waves and currents. Assurances were



- 9 -
obtained that TPA will carry out a siltation minimization study aimed at
reducing maintenance dredging in accordance with terms of reference and timing
agreed with the Bank. Terms of reference were discussed and agreed with the
Bank (Annex 9); implementation will start around October 1986.
3.09      Tianjin Port is connected to the city by two railway lines.  The
port is served also by two highways, with a third highway under construction
that will bypass the city of Tanggu, and relieve traffic congestion in the
city. Adequate transit sheds, warehouses, and open storage areas are avail-
able. Rail and road service in the port area, power and water supplies, waste
disposal and telecommunication systems are also adequate.
C. Port Planning
3.10      The need to update the port master plan for Tianjin is urgent.  The
future needs resulting from rapid economic growth and in particular from the
creation of a special economic zone area and the rearrangement of existing
port facilities which will be made following completion of the proposed
project are all important activities that need to be coordinated in a master
plan. The transfer of the port to the authority of the Municipality of
Tianjin gives it an added incentive, since its plans must be harmonized with
those of the municipality. Accordingly, TPA hired consultants (Port of Kobe,
Japan) to roll forward the master plan for the port. Upon completion of the
Master Plan TPA will send it to the Bank for review and comments. The present
project is contained in the existing Master Plan and thus will also be part of
the new one. A Master planning course financed by the Bank was conducted in
China in August 1985 to train Tianjin and other major port's staff in modern
master planning techniques.
3.11      TPA's master plan is not complemented by a financial plan.  The
financial policies which applied until recently rendered such a plan
unnecessary at the enterprise level, since investment project approval by SPC
automatically conveyed the corresponding release of funds from the State
budget. Now, however, changing circumstances render the adoption of formal
financial planning procedures highly desirable; this is further discussed in
paras. 6.05-6.07.
D. Accounting and Auditing
3.12      TPA prepares the following financial statements:  Funds BaLance
Sheets (yearly); Statement of Fixed Assets (yearly), an elaboration of a
Balance Sheet item; Special Funds and Appropriations (yearly), an elaboration
of a Balance Sheet item; Statement of Seaport Handling Cost (monthly),
containing information on the plan for the year and the performance for the
reporting month as well as cumulatively to date; and Statement of Profit
(monthly). Double entry accrual basis accounting is used. It is entirely
manual. Management accounting consists of monthly key indices and capital
construction progress statements. Revenue, handling costs and administrative
expenses are examined quarterly and compared with budgets. Final accounts for
the year including a balance sheet are prepared within 50 days of the fiscal
year ending December 31. Annual financial statements on capital construction
are ready within 60 days of the fiscal year end.



- 10 -
3.13      The ports financial statements are now audited by the State Audit
Administration (SAM), whose procedures are acceptable to the Bank. The SAA
reports to the municipal government in the event of dissatisfaction with a
port's accounts. Assurances were obtained from TPA that financial statements,
including balance sheets, statement of income and of sources and application
of funds for the entire port will be audited .y independent auditors
acceptable to the Bank and submitted to the Bank for review not later than six
months after the end of each fiscal year. At the same time, assurances were
also obtained from THCDC that project accounts kept by THCDC will be similarly
audited and submitted.
IV. THE PROJECT
A. Project Objectives
4.01      This project will directly contribute to China's overall plan to
remove port bottlenecks by constructing additional deepwater berths at key
ports.  It will increase Tianjin port's efficiency in handling timber, con-
struction materials and general cargo by constructing specialized berths with
modern equipment. The project will also contribute to longer-term efficiency
improvements by: providing training in the planning, design, control and
operation of ports; including preparation of a master plan for the port;
providing technical assistance for the development of computerized operations
and information systems, and a study on reducing siltation in the port; and
establishing the Tianjin Port Development Center. Importantly, the project
will allow the Bank to participate in developing a new orpanizational model
for public enterprises in China, which could have a significance much wider
than the ports sector alone (para. 3.03 and 3.04).
B. Project Description
4.02      To reduc' congestion and handle future cargo volumes, the construc-
tion of a new pic  (East Pier) has been decided (see Map No. IBRD 18961).  It
will comprise 11 dLep-water berths for ships of 30,000-50,000 dwt with work to
be carried out from 1986 to 1992 in two phases: Phase I (1986-1990) to con-
struct 5 berths and Phase II (1987-1991) to construct an additional 6 berths.
The 11 berths have been designed to be converted into container berths in the
future when needed. The proposed project would comprise both phases. It
would include the following components:
(a)  construction of five new berths on the East Pier's south side for
timber, general cargo and construction materials, requiring: (i)
construction of a 780 m quaywall for four berths with alongside
depth of 10.5 m; (ii) construction of a 170 m quaywall with
alongside depth of 10 m for the remaining berth;
(b)  construction of six new berths 1,200 m in length on the East Pier's
north side for general cargo with alongside depth of 10 m; and the
construction of some service boat quays;



- 11 -
(c) dredging about 11.82 million cu m of spoil and reclamation of
840,000 sq m of land and stabiLization of the fill material;
(d) construction of the required railway lines (about 15.6 kms), roadway
and yard pavement (about 48,000 sq m);
(e) provision of water supply, sewerage and power supply systems;
(f) provision of the required loading/unloading equipment, navigational
aids, harbor operations equipment and boats;
(g) construction of the required maintenance buildings, auxiliary build-
ings, and various minor structures; and
(h) provision of consultants to assist port staff in supervising
construction.
4.03      The project also contains components to address the port's needs in
institutionaL and technological development. These components comprise:
(a) technical assistance for a study of methods to minimize siltation in
channels and basins (para. 3.08) and training of port specialists;
(b) equipment for the development of TPA's management information and
operations control system (see Annex 8);
{c) establishing Tianjin Port Development Center for training, research
and development studies (see Annex 6 for details).
Assurance was obtained that TPA will carry out the training under the project
in accordance with the program agreed with the Bank (Annex 4).
C. Cost Estimate
4.04      The total project cost is estimated at Y 902 million or US$282 mil-
lion equivalent, including Y 457 million or US$143 million in direct and
indirect foreign exchange costs. Detailed cost estimates are presented in
Tables 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 and are summarized below.
4.05      Cost estimates for civil works including design and supervision are
based on unit and design prices for ongoing similar works in China. Equipment
costs are based on costs of similar equipment recently purchased in China and
in other Bank-financed projects. Estimates are in January 1986 prices, and
include physical and price contingencies. They are based on design d.tne by
the First Design Institute and reviewed by consultants financed under the
Technical Cooperation Credit (TCC) (IDA Credit No. 1412-CIA). Physical con-
tingencies of 10% have been added for all civil works and equipment. Price
contingencies for both foreign and local costs assume an annual increase of 7%
for 1986, 7% for 1987, 7.5% for 1988, 7.7% for 1989, 7.6% for 1990 and 4.5Z
for 1991. Customs duties amounting to about 10% of purchase price will be
levied on imported equipment. The foreign exchange component of Bank financed
civil works is based on construction by foreign contractors.

D. Financing
4.07      Financing of the project will be as follows:

The Bank loan will be made to the People's Republic of China and will be used
to finance the foreign exchange cost of civil works and procurement of
equipment awarded through international competitive bidding (ICB), and the
costs of technical assistance and training. TPA will finance the local costs
and the remainder of the foreign exchange costs. The Government will onlend
the loan proceeds to TPA on terms and conditions approved by the Bank. In
accordance with the Government's established procedures, the terms will be
those prescribed for enterprises in the ports subsector, currently 4Z over 20
years including a grace period equal to the period of construction (but for
this subsidiary loan, five years). TPA will bear the foreign exchange risk
and the commitment charges. Signature of a subsidiary loan agreement between
the Government and TPA satisfactory to the Bank is a condition of
effectiveness of the loan. The subsidiary loan agreement will provide for
THCDC, as the implementing agency, to withdraw the required funds.
E. Implementation
4.08      The implementation of the proposed Project falls within the juris-
diction of: THCDC for the construction of the East Pier (para. 4.02); and TPA
for the institutional and technological developments of the port (para.
4.03). THCDC would be assisted by the Design Institute consultants and the
China National Technical Import Corporation (CNTIC) as appropriate. Assur-
ances were obtained that at the completion of project construction, the facil-
ities will be transferred from THCDC to TPA for operation. Other aspects of
project implementation (training, master pla7., operations control/MIS, silta-
tion study and the establishment of Tianjin Port Development Center) would b2
carried out by or under TPA.
4.09      Procurement will be carried out according to the following table:

Note: Figures in parentheses are the respective amounts financed by the Bank
loan.
Six works contracts will be awarded after ICB for wharf construction south
side (US$25.0 millions), soil consolidation (US$30.0 million), storage yards
and roads (US$12.0 million), utilities (US$15.0 million), wharf construction
north side (US$34.0 million), and other utilities (US$4.0 million). The
remaining civil works, not financed by the Bank, will be carried out by
contractors chosen through Local Competitive Bidding (LCB). These are mainly
for dredging of the north basin which can be more economically and efficiently
handled through LCB due to technical reasons including labor intensive tech-
niques for site preparation and flexible use of dredging equipment. Other
elements of LCB will be the railway connection outside the port which does not
belong to the port, and auxilliary buildings that are mostly for overall port
use. Prequalification of contractors will be carried out for works contracts
to be awarded under ICB. Qualifying domestic contractors for civil works will
receive a preference in bid evaluation of 1iZ of the total contract cost.
Most of the equipment will also be procured through ICB. Qualifying domestic
suppliers of goods will receive a preference in bid evaluation of 15% of the
cif price or the import duty, whichever is lower. Some small items to be
agreed with the Bank and amounting to less than US$200,000 per contract, and
aggregating less than US$1,000,000, will be procured under contracts awarded
after evaluation and comparison of quotations solicited from at least three
qualified suppliers under procedures acceptable to the Bank. ICB awarded
contracts will be subject to the Bank's prior review of procurement
documentation and proposed contract awards.
4.10      Civil works and equipment installation are expected to be completed
by the end of 1991. Construction, procurement and installation schedules are
shown in Charts A and D.

4.11      In order to operate the new terminal at Tianjin until 1995, TPA
intends to train some 6,000 management and administrative staff, stevedores,
machine operators and maintenance personnel (Annex 5). TPA prepared a
recruitment and training plan which incLudes training to be provided by
equipment manufacturers. The training plan covers the operational needs until
1995.
4.12      Land needed for the project will be reclaimed from the sea and
consolidated within the project. Designs are completed and consultants are
now assisting in the preparation of the bidding documents, which would be com-
pleted by April 1986. Prequalification of contractors was carried out for the
two major contracts; for the other contracts, prequalification will follow
according to schedule (Chart A). The call for te- v for items (a) and (c) in
para 4.02 is planned for April 1986 and evaluation of bids from July to
September 1986. THCDC will construct the project assisted by foreign consul-
tants to supervise execution. The consultants will be appointed following the
Bank's Guidelines and with terms of reference reviewed and agreed with the
Bank. Construction will start by November 1986.
F. Disbursements
4.14      Disbursements from the proceeds of the loan will cover:  (a) 100% of
the foreign costs of equipment or 1002 of the local costs ex-factory, 75% of
other items locally procured; (b) 1002 of foreign cost and 20% of local costs
of civil works procured under ICB; and (c) 100% of the costs of technical
assistance and training. Disbursement will be made againist full documentation
except for reimbursement for training and contracts for civil works, goods and
services each valued less than US$200,000 equivalent which will be disbursed
against statements of expenditures. Statements of expenditure for civil works
should be supported by an engineer's certificate. Supporting documents for
the statements of expenditure will be kept in the offices of TPA and THDCD and
will be made available for inspection by Bank supervision missions. On the
basis of the implementation schedules shown in Charts A and D, a schedule of
estimated quarterly disbursements has been prepared (Table 4.5). This sche-
dule is based on the assumption that the proposed loan will become effective
by July 1986 and the loan closing date will be December 31, 1992. It follows
implementation schedule and disbursement profiles of similar .orts projects in
China and in other countries. To facilitate disbursement a special account
will be set up in a bank on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank; the
authorized allocation should be $8.0 million, approximating four months'
estimated expenditures. Applications for replenishments would be submitted
quarterly or when the special account is drawn down by 50% of the initial
deposit.
G. Ecology and Environment
4.12      The project will not affect the existing ecology of the port of
Tianjin. The dredging spoil will be used for reclamation; an arrangement



- 16 -
which has proved satisfactory in the past. The terminal design will incorpo-
rate the equipment and safeguards appropriate in minimizing pollution.
V. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. Port Hinterland and Traffic
5.01      Tianjin port serves a vast hinterland extending all the way to
Xinjiang province, some 3,000 km inland. However, 97% of the outgoing traffic
and 841 of the incoming traffic have their origins and destinations within the
special cities of Tianjin and Beijing and the surrounding province of Hebei.
The nearest ports north and south of Tianjin are Dalian and Qingdao. Both are
equally congested and need further investments to serve their own hinter-
lands. In addition, the overland distances from those ports to the Beijing-
Tianjin area are respectively 1,000 and 600 km and the rail lines which could
be used to and from these ports are heavily congested. Therefore, there is no
economic alternative to further development of Tianjin port.
5.02      In 1984, Tianjin port handled 16.1 million tons (mt) of which
12.4 mt foreign trade and 3.7 mt domestic cargo. The traffic reflects the
economic base of the hinterland and the high level of industrialization of the
two special cities and Hebei province. These three areas account for 12% of
the country's gross industrial output value with Beijing and Tianjin alone
doing 8%. In 1984, Foreign trade general cargo including iron and steel pro-
ducts exceeded 7 mt, representing 44Z of total traffic.  The main bulk commo-
dities are grain imports and salt exports each with a volume of 2 mt nandled
in 1984. Details are in Annex 7.
5.03      Total port traffic is forecast to double over the next decade to
38 mt and triple to 50 mt by the end of the century.  Given the emphasis
placed by Government on foreign trade and the potential for greater use of
coastal shipping, these forecasts could well be exceeded. General cargo,
timber and construction materials are expected to grow fastest in the coming
years. TPA also plans to handle significant amounts of coal, petroleum pro-
ducts and mineral ores in the future. These developments are contingent upon
developments in the port hinterland, and specialized facilities will be
necessary for this traffic when demand firms up. The project does not include
any facilities for such traffic.
B. Port Operations
5.04      TPA now operates 31 berths, 26 of which are on the ocean and 5 in
the Huai river accessible through a small lock and used primarily for domestic
cargos. Four of the berths are fully dedicated; two for grain, one for salt,
one for containers. TPA plans to install equipment to receive bulk cement on
another berth, thus leaving 21 berths for general cargo including iron and
steel products. Three new container berths financed under the Three Ports
Project (loan 2207-CHA) are nearing completion.



- 17 -
5.05      The port works around the clock, 7 days a week and has achieved a
high throughput of about 400,000 tons of general cargo per berth in recent
years. Despite such remarkable achievements existing facilities cannot keep
up with the traffic growth. Congestion is heavy and total ship waiting time
exceeded 10,000 days in 1984. At an average value per ship day in port of
about US$6,000, this represents an economic cost of US$60 million or about one
fourth of total project cost.
5.06      Thte proposed project will provide 11 new berths to be used for
general cargo, timbe. and construction materials. Project berths will be used
flexibly, first for general cargo, gradually shifting to timber as this
traffic grows and eventuelly to containers. With the project, traffic will
still exceed capacity in 1990 and 1991 when the first five berths are open to
traific. It is only in 1992 that occupancy will be a more efficient 76%. New
container berths will be needed around 1995. The logical expansion of
container facilities will be along the south face of the east pier in direct
continuation of the three berths now being completed. Remaining general cargo
will have to shift to new facilities at this time.
C. Costs and Benefits
5.07      For this analysis, all inputs and outputs were evaluated in constant
January 1986 prices. Financial cost estimates were converted to economic
costs by shadow pricing and by excluding price contingencies, taxes and duties
(details are in Annex 7).
5.08      Quantifiable benefits attributed to the proposed project are: cargo
handling cost savings, ship time savings and cargo time savings. Benefits
build up rapidly upon project completion since the port is very congested
now. They have been assumed constant after the year 2000 when project facili-
ties will be used to their full capacity.
5.09      The largest part of the benefits results from ship time savings
accounting fcr wo thirds of the first year benefits and increasing to 70 Z by
1995.  These in  ude the reduction in ship time waile awaiting berth and at
berth due to im1roved cargo handling productivity. Cargo handling cost
savings account for most of the remaining benefits with cargo time savings
representing only a small fraction of the total (Annex 7, Table 12). As about
75% of the ships calling at Tianjin are either Chinese owned or operated, most
of the project benefits will accrue to China directly.

D. Overall Evaluation and Risks
5.10      Based on total project costs and the benefits described above the
overall ERR of the project is 212. The sensitivity of the ERR to variations
in costs and benefits is summarized below:
ERR
(Z)
Best estimate                                   21
15Z increase in costs                           19
15Z reduction in benefits                       18
15% increase in costs combined with
15Z reduction in benefits                   16
Using annualized resale value of ships
for ship time savings benefits              18
5.11      The economic benefits are calculated on the assumption that the port
could handle all the traffic demand without the project, by using measures
such as lightering from anchorage. This is a conservative assumption. Some
traffic might conceivably be diverted to other ports at a much higher total
transport cost (para. 5.01), but since these other ports are themselves
congested, it would be more likely that some traffic demand would simply not
be satisfied thus affecting adversely the economic development of the port
hinterland. The cost of such curtailment of demand is difficult to estimate
but could be substantial.
5.12      The risk involves possible delays in project start-up due to the
introduction of ICB for civil works. To minimize this risk appropriate Bank
assistance and supervision will be provided in the early project stages. It
is unlikely that traffic will fall short of estimates and it may indeed be
higher. The flexibility of the design enabling to use project berths first
for general cargo and convert later to container traffic ensures that their
use will be maximized at anytime.
VI. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS

Tables 6.1-3: the highlights are summarized below.

/a  At historic cost less depreciation.
The working and operating ratios, as well as most other indicators of port
performance, were satisfactory and show an improving trend due in part to the
tariff increase of 1984 and, more importantly, to excellent cost control.
Unit operating costs fluctuated during 1981-84, ending the period with only an
average 1.0% p.a. increase; the port-wide average handling cost for all commo-
dities was a low Y 3.9 per ton in 1984.
B. Present Financial Position
6.02      At the end of 1984, TPA's financial condition was sound.  Current
assets substantially exceeded current liabilities, with two-thirds of the net
current assets in the form of cash or equivalent. The salient points of the
balance sheet are as follows:
Y million
Current assets                            135.2
Fixed assets (net)                        630.4
Special Fund assets                        32.4
Total                                798.0
Current liabilities                         8.5
Long-term debt                              5.0
Equity                                    727.7
Special Funds                              56.8
Total                                798.0
6.03      The virtual lOOZ equity capitalization is a function of the finan-
cial policies for state owned enterprises which applied until very recently
and under which enterprises obtained all their funding for approved capital
projects by way of budgetary grants from the State. In return, enterprises
turned over the greater part of their profits to the State, retairzin only



- 20 -
small amounts for the purposes served by the "special funds" - principally
R&D, welfare and bonuses. Generally, the policy is now changing to one of
financing through loans instead of grants, coupled with a system of taxation
of profits which, although at present closely approximating the effect of the
earlier profit remittance system, does allow considerable flexibility for the
future to introduce increased - and perhaps discretionary - retention of
earnings through adjustment of rates.
6.04      In the case of TPA, the application of these new policies has been
suspended for an unspecified period (understood to be not less than three
years), as part of the "pilot system reform" described in paragraphs 3.03 and
3.04. TPA's financial policies are thus fluid. A number of possibilities are
discussed below, and proposals are introduced as to: (a) how TPA could derive
maximum advantage from its experimental status by developing financial poli-
cies best tailored to the requirement of the port and the municipality; and
(b) financial objectives which would be appropriate for TPA to adopt pending
definition of those policies.
C. Financial Policy
6.05      In the absence of specific measures to extend the tax holiday or to
introduce alternative policies, it must be presumed that TPA would eventually
become subject to the normal policies for public (state, provincial or munici-
pal) enterprises in China. As in force at present, these would include in
particular:
(a) capital project funding by 20-year loans at 3.6% through People's
Construction Bank of China (PCBC);
(b) income tax at 55%;
(c) adjustment tax at 24%; and
(d) retention by TPA of remaining profits, but earmarked to the purposes
of the special funds.
On present understanding, the earliest date by which TPA could revert to these
arrangements would be 1987. By virtue of its heavy development program, a
policy of 100% debt financing would raise TPA's leverage to around 50:50 by
the early 1990's; debt service coverage would be below 2 and falling, and a
persistently negative cash flow would be emerging (tariff increases excepted).
6.06      On the other hand, if the tax holiday were to be continued indefi-
nitely, TPA would have very little need of recourse to debt (apart from the
existing and proposed Bank loans). Debt service (virtually all Bank) would be
covered around three times, and leverage would be a low 30:70 in the early
90's. This scenario must, however, also be considered unsatisfactory from a
national point of view since, although it leaves TPA in no jeopardy, it is an
inefficient method of funding for revenue-earning projects. The ready avail-
ability of cost-free money does not encourage rigor in project selection or
cost-consciousness in construction; and, in any event, operational cash flows



- 21 -
will only by coincidence match optimal capital expenditures, especially on a
year-by-year basis.
6.07      Clearly some compromise between these two extremes is required which
would maximize leverage to the extent sustainable by TPA's operational cash
flow while at the same time leaving some cushion of retained earnings against
an unforseen traffic recession or other adverse circumstance. One such com-
promise which at first sight appears viable is one in which adjustment tax
might be reduced or phased out and the resultant increased profit retention
applied to capital expenditure, while TPA remained liable for income tax and
special fund contributions at normal rates. There are undoubtedly many other
arrangements that would work. What is important at the present time is not
that long-term policies should be immediately defined, but rather that TPA
should develop an expertise in devising and evaluating alternative financial
strategies, and through this process initiate and maintain a dialogue with its
lead agencies to define longer term policies best suited to the objectives of
the "pilot system reform" now underway.  To this end, assurances were obtained
from TPA that, beginning in 1986, it will prepare annually a rolling 5-year
financial plan bringing together its projected traffic, revenues, costs,
capital expenditures and financing plan (or plans), and will discuss its
conclusions with the Bank.
D.  Future Financial Performance
6.08      TPA's projected income statements through 1992 are at Table 6.1.
The revenue estimates are based on the traffic forecasts in Annex 7, Table 1,
which have been reduced slightly to reflect revenue cargo volumes. Forecasts
of revenue from loading and unloading cargo, which represents more than 70X of
alongside port operations, are given in Table 6.4. Forecast working expenses
allow for annual inflation on most costs. No increase in individual tariffs
has been assumed, but the growth in container traffic will be highly benefi-
ciaL to average revenues because container unit revenues are much higher than
those for other cargo. The estimated gross revenue growth over 1984-92 at
82 p.a. will therefore slightly exceed the overall growtL  t t:affic.  On
these fairly conservative assumptions, the port's operating performance conti-
nues satisfactory through 1992. with en operating ratio of around 40 as at
present and a rate of return on assets employed of around 9%.
6.09      Because of the uncertainty surrounding TPA's future financial poli-
cies, it is not possible to forecast funds flows and balance sheet items with
the same degree of confidence. The projections at Tables 6.2 and 6.3 portray
the base case described in para. 6.05 in which TPA reverts in 1987 to the
(presently) orthodox policies for Chinese public corporations. Many other
scenarios are possible, however, as discussed above. In these circumstances
it would be premature to propose that TPA should adopt specific financial
objectives other than in the most general terms. Therefore, assurances were
obtained from TPA that it will take such measures as may be necessary to
maintain its gross revenue at a level sufficient to cover its full costs of
operation (including depreciation), and to meet from internally generated
funds all its financial obligations including debt service, taxes, allocations
to special funds, and other cash outflows.



- 22 -
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      Assurances were obtained from:
(a) TPA, that it vill:
(i)  carry out a siltation minimization study aiming at reducing
maintenance dredging (para. 3.08);
(ii) provide the Bank with its audited financial statements within
six months from the end of each fiscal year (para. 3.13);
(iii) carry out the technical assistance and training components as
agreed with the Bank (para. 4.03);
(iv) beginning in 1986, prepare annually a rolling 5-year financial
plan and discuss it with the Bank (para. 6.07); and
(v)  take measures to maintain its gross revenue at a level suffi-
cient to cover its full costs of operation (including deprecia-
tion), and to meet from internally generated funds all its
financial obligations including debt service, taxes, alloca-
tions to special funds and other cash outflows (para. 6.09);
(b) THCDC that it will:
(i) provide the Bank with audited accounts of the project, within six
months from the end of each fiscal year and (para. 3.13); and
(ii) upon completion, transfer project facilities to TPA for operation
(para. 4.08).
7.02      Approval of the Loan .Agreement by China's State Council, and execution
of a subsidiary loan agreement satisfactory to the Bank (paras. 4.07-4.08) are
conditions of effectiveness of the proposed loan.
7.03      Agreement having being reached on the above matters, the project
constitutes a suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$130 million to the People's
Republic of China for a term of 20 years, including a five year grace period,
at the standard variable interest rate.

Manpower Requirements
1.        In 1982, the number of employees within the port was 20,365.  This
number is expected to increase to 29,362 in 1990 and 38,000 in 2000.
Currently, there are 1,078 operation management staff which is expected to
increase to 4,050 by 1990. The following is a breakdown of staff requirement
by level of education.

Training Needs
2.        The TPA has establisehd a goal of upgrading and retraining approxi-
mately 702 of its existing workforce over the next decade. This is primarily
due to the lack of education received during the decade of the cultural
revolution. In addiiton, TPA has set a goal of increasing the percentage of
college trained employees to at least 50% during the next decade. The current
port workers training center trains about 700 per year in a variety of
areas. Most of the training is in basic vocational skills and general educa-
tion. It does not provide any significant technical training.
Training in the New Center
3.        Training requirements at the institute covers the following:
(a) Short-term training for 3-6 months period and include training in
languages, computer, automation, communications, electronics, system
management information systems, capital construction, procurement,
port planning, and management;
(b) Seminars and workshops for exchange of information and technology
between domestic ports and possibly some foreign ports; and
(c) College graduate courses at the TV college in the port. This would
increase the number of college graduates particularly in Transport

TIANJIN PORT PROJECT
Economic Evaluation
A. Hinterland and Traffic
1.        The port of Tianjin serves a vast hinterland extending all the way
to Xinjiang province, some 3,000 km inland. However, almost 90% of the
traffic has its origins or destinations within the special cities of Tianjin
and Beijing and the surrounding Hebei province. The nearest ports are Dalian
in the north and Qingdao in the south. The overland distance from these ports
to the Beijing-Tianjin area is 1,000 km and 600 km, respectively, and the rail
links which could be used from these ports to the Beijing-Tianjin area are
heavily congested. Therefore, there is no economic alternative to the port of
Tianjin.
2.        Present Traffic.  In 1984, the port handled 16.1 million tons (mt)
of cargo, 12.4 mt of foreign trade and 3.7 mt of domestic cargn. The traffic
composition reflects the economic base of the hinterland, and in particular
the high level of industralization of the two special cities and surrounding
Hebei province. Foreign trade general cargo (including iron and steel pro-
ducts) is the most important type of traffic with over 7 million tons in 1984
or 44Z of total traffic. The main bulk commodities are grain imports and salt
exports. In 1984, trade in each was 2 mt. Container traffic started only in
1980 but is increasing rapidly and reached 80,000 TEUs in 1984. Details by
commodity are give in Table 1. The distribution of traffic to and from the
port by mode is in Table 2. Rail handles about 70% of incoming cargoes but
only 20% of the outgoing cargoes since most of these are generated in the
proximity of the port.
Future Traffic
3.        Total port traffic is forecast to more than double over the next
decade to 38 mt. in 1995 (8Z p.a. annual growth) and is expected to reach
50 mt by the year 2000 (less than 6% p.a. annual growth). These figures are
well in line with macro-economic projections of quadrupling the output of
industry and agriculture by the year 2000. Given the emphasis placed by
Government on foreign trade and the potential for greater use of coastal
shipping, they could even be on the low side.
4.        Detailed forecast by commodities are also on Table 1.  General cargo
is expected to grow at 8% p.a. while iron and steel products are expected to
stay around 4 mt p.a.; with imports being gradually replaced by domestic trade
as domestic steel production increases. Timber traffic is expected to grow
rapidly from 400,000 tons in 1984 to 1.2 mt in 1990 and 2.5 mt in the year
2000. China is a net importer of timber and expects rapidly increasing needs
in the next few years. Construction materials traffic, mainly sand, is also
expected to grow fast, doubling from 1.5 mt to 3 mt by the end of the



ANNEX 7

century. The demand is for the port construction itself, the city of Tianjin
and the oil industry.
5.        From 1990 onwards, the Tianjin Port Authority (TPA) plans to handle
significant amounts of coal, petroleum products and mineraL ores. Only very
small amounts of these commodities are handled at present. These developments
are contingent upon industrial and mining developments in the port hinterland
as well as the finding and development of oil in the Bohai Gulf. Specialized
port developments will be necessary to handle this traffic if this demand
materializes. The project does not include any facilities for such traffic.
B. Operations
Without the Project
6.        The port now operates 31 berths, five of which are in the Hai
river. These five berths were only recently reopened to sea-going traffic
after the decision to reopen the lock to the river. However, the lock is only
opened a few hours per day to prevent salt water intrusion and is limited to
ships of 5,000 tons or less. The berths are used primarily for domestic
cargoes. Of the 26 ocean berths, four are fully dedicated; two for grain, one
for salt and one for containers. One berth is used preferentially for cement
which is now imported in bags. TPA plans to install equipment to receive bulk
cement and the berth will then be fully dedicated. Therefore, there are 21
berths capable to receive general cargo including iron and steel products,
timber, construction materials, miscellaneous general cargo and lesser amounts
of chemical fertilizer and ores. In addition, three new container berths
included in the Three Ports Project (Loan 2207-CHA) are nearing completion.
7.        Table 3 summarizes the operational characteristics of existing
general cargo berths. The port works three 8 hour shifts; with " net working
time per shift of 5.3 hours, equivalent to 16 hours per day. The table beljw
gives some of the hourly productivities per crane or gang achieved by TPA.

The annual throughput per berth for general cargo is well above 300,000
tons. In recent years, because of the very large traffic increases,
throughputs around 400,000 tons per berth have even been achieved, but it
would be difficult to maintain that level indefinitely.
8.        Table 3 also gives average shipment sizes.  Presently these are
quite small: around 5,000 tons for general cargo, 6,600 t for steel and



34 -                            ANNEX 7
Page 3
8,000 t for timber.  Because of this and the traffic congestion, ships now
spend more time waiting for berths than being loaded/unloaded. Average ship
waiting time in 1984 was 3.3 days while averagc loading/unloading time was
only two days. Details by type of ship are in Table 4. Total ship waiting
days in 1984 exceeded 10,000. With an average ship value per day in port of
about
US$6,000, this represent an annual economic cost of US$60 million or about one
fourth of total project costs of about US$250 million.
Operations with the Project
9.        The project will provide 11 new berths to be used for general cargo,
timber and construction materials. They will all be suitable for conversion
to container berths when the need arises. Five berths on the southern face of
the east pier will be available to traffic from 1990 and the other six from
1992. One of the new berths will be used mostly for construction materials
and up to four berths can be used for timber. The remaining berths will be
used for general cargo. The economic analysis is based on operating the new
berths flexibly between general cargo, timber and construction materials to
ensure even berth occupancy as well as adapt to traffic demand over time.
With present traffic forecast, the 11 berths would be used as follows by the
year 2000: general cargo 6, timber 4 and construction materials 1. More
berths will be used for general cargo in the 1990s while timber demand is
gradually expanding. Operational characteristics of the proposed berths are
also on Table 3.
10.       General cargo traffic which will use the 21 existing berths and the
proposed project berths is summarized on Table 5. This traffic includes only
foreign trade general cargo as domestic cargo is handled mainly in the Hai
river. This traffic is likely to peak between now and the project opening
date and then stabilize around 8.5 mt per year as a result of the increase in
containerization. It is expected that by 1995, 80% of the containerizable
cargo will be containerized. The existing container berth plus the three
nearing completion are expected to be able to handle the forecast container
traffic until about 1995; possibly with the need for one additional crane. It
is expected that at least six container berths will be needed by the year
2000.
11.       Table 6 shows cargo handling with and without the proposed bertbs.
It is based on the operational parameters of Table 3 and the traffics of
Table 1 and 5. Without the pro,ect, traffic far exceeds the practical
capacity of existing berths. For the purpose of the economic evaluation it
has been assumed that ways would be found, e.g. through lightering, to hardle
traffic in the port area with waiting times not exceeding those corresponding
to 95% berth occupancy. As waiting time increases rapidly with congestion
this is a fairly conservative assumption. Indeed for 1984, the model gives
less than 5,000 waiting days versus the actual figure of 10,000 days.
12.       With the project, traffic would still exceed capacity in 1990 and
1991 when the first five berths ar- opened to traffic. It is only in 1992
that occupancy would be a more efficient 76%. Occupancy would climb to 80% by

- 35 -                              8g 
1995 and stay at this level as the demand shifts increasingly to container
traffic. Since container berths will be needed after 1995 and the expansion
of the container facilities will logically be along the south face of the east
pier in continuation of the three berths now being completed, some of the
general cargo will have to shift to new facilities at that time.
C. Economic Evaluation
Project Costs
13.       Financial cost estimates have been converted to economic costs by
shadow pricing and by excluding price contingencies, taxes and duties.
Conversion factors for various cost categories have been estimated in two
ways.
(a) for major items such as wharf construction, dredging and reclamation
and consolidation, by separately shadow pricing each cost components
(Tables 7 and 8); and
(b) for minor items such as utilities, auxiliary buildings and ancillary
facilities, by applying aggregate conversion factors estimated in
previous Bank studies (Table 9).
Conversion factors for major items are near onie; the overall factor for the
project is 1.06. The factors derived for the -arious cost items have been
applied to the table of annual project expenditures to obtain the stream of
project economic costs (Table 10.).

14.       Quantifiable benefits attributed to the proposed project are:
cargo-handling cost savings, ship time %avings and cargo time savings.
Benefits build up quickly as the port is very congested now. They have been
assumed constant after the year 2000 when the project facilities will be used
to their full capacity.
15.       Cargo-handling Cost Savings.  Handling costs calculated by TPA for
the existing berths are given on Table 3 together with estimates of handling
costs at the proposed new berths. No savings are expected for handling
general cargo over the new berths. However, without the project, the only way
to handle traffic in excess of berth capacity would be through more costly
lightering. TPA estimates lightering costs to be 3 to 4 times normal handling
costs. Detailed estimates of handling cost savings are in Table 11.
Lightering has been assumed for cargo tonnage in excess of berth capacity at
95% occupancy at a cost three times that of normal handling.
16.       Savings in handling costs have been converted to economic benefits
by shadow pricing the main cost components of normal handling and of lighter-
ing. Shadow pricing each component on the basis of TPA's estimated handling
cost breakdown yields an aggregate conversion factor of 1.05:

/c It is assumed that 50% of labor is unskilled and 50% is

/d See Table 8 for explanation.
A similarly estimated conversion factor for lightering is 1.1. It combines
the factor estimated for handling normal traffic with factors estimated for
the economic costs of transshipment and of barging the cargoes into river
berths for final unloading.
17.       Ship Time Savings.  These include both the reduction in ship time
while awaiting berth and at berth due to improved cargo handling. Estimates
of ship time in port with and without the project are calculated on Table 6.
Ship costs in port are based on the ship cost model developed by the Bank,
updated to reflect recent world market prices. The annualized repLacement
value plus operating costs is used to calculdte project benefits. This gives
a cost per day of 1 16,200 (US$5,700) for general cargo ships. For
sensitivity analysis, the annual resale value of ships have been assumed to
reflect the presently depressed state of the shipping industry (see para. 19).
18.       Cargo Time Savings.  Savings in ship time apply also to cargo:  the
benefit is in interest savings on cargo value. For domestic cargoes, the
marginal source of working capital would be loans from PBC at 6.5-7.5Z
interest. For foreign cargoes, higher foreign exchange working capital would
mean more foreign borrowing and it is assumed that this would be at China's
marginal cost of capital of around 12Z. Roughly two-thirds of all cargo
passing through Tianjin is foreign trade cargo, and imports account for about
half of total cargo. Interest savings have therefore been calculated assuming
an average rate of interest of 9.5% p.a.
19.       Total project benefits by year for the three items discussed above
are calculated in Table 12. The majority of project benefits would be in ship

Page 6
time savings. These would accrue first to ship owners and could be passed on
to cargo owners. As about 75% of the ships calling at Tianjin are either
Chinese owned (COSCO) or operated, most of the project benefits will accrue to
China.
Rate of Return Calculation and Sensitivity Analysis
20.       Table 13 sets out the rate of return calculation.  Cost data are
taken from Table 10 and total benefits from Table 12. The best estimate rate
of return is 21X. The sensitivity of the economic returns to variacions in
costs and benefits are summarized as follows:
ERR
Best estimate                              21
15% increase in cost                       19
15% reduction in benefits                  18
15% increase in cost combined with
15% reduction in benefits                16
Using annualized resale value of ships
for ship time savings benefits           18
The results show that the project remains well justified even with sizable
variations in project costs and benefits.   The assumption that the port could
handle all the traffic demand by measures such as lightering is a conservative
one. Some traffic could be diverted to other ports at a much higher cost, but
since these other ports are themselves congested, it would be more likely that
some traffic would be curtailed thus affecting economic development of the
port hinterland. The cost of such curtailment is difficult to estimate but
could be substantial.

Development of Operations Control and Management
Information Systems
1.        Tianjin Port Authority (TPA) established a computer Bureau in 1983.
The initial complement of equipment comprises 1 Altos 8600, 2 Hercules and 1
IBM PC. Besides the Computer Bureau, computers are also utilized by the
Navigation Bureau (Z80 minicomputers) and by the five Harbor Operating
Corporations (mainly IBM PC's). Applications currently operational include:
(a) anchorage control;
(b) estimation of port time for each arriving ship;
gc) collection of operational statistics.
2.        The Computer Bureau is currently working with an EDP specialist from
the Ministry of Communications (MOC) to extend the existing applications to
include the control of berth operations, and the daily collection and
reporting to MOC of the information on ships arrived, departed and waiting
which the latter uses to plan and control the allocation of future ship
arrivals to ports.
3.        The Computer Bureau has proposed, and TPA has adopted, an ambitious
plan for the further development of operations control and MIS during the next
five-year plan period (1986-90). The plan covers 12 segments of TPA activity,
as follows:
(a) planning statistics;
(b) berth operating systems (ship movements, cranes, stevedores,
Loading/unloading schedules, tonnage of cargo Loaded/unloaded);
(c) cargo transportation systems (routing, warehousing, delivery system
planning);
(d) financial systems (costing, fixed asset control, cash flow,
daily/monthly/annual financial reporting);
(e) payroll;
(f) material management;
(g) personnel management and records;
(h) equipment and facility management;

(i) estate management;
(j) documentation and archives;
(k) science and technology documentation;
(1) engineering.
4.        The implementation of the program will clearly involve a consider-
able multiplication of minicomputers in the Harbor Operating Corporations,
enhanced computing power in the Computer Bureau, and the acquisition of
extensive new software. Since the objective is a fully integrated system
(possibly eventually interfacing with KOC systems in Beijing), TPA is
concerned to standardize equipment and software to the greatest extent
possible. TPA has therefore retained a local consulting firm to assist them
with:
(a) finalization of the systems specification;
(b) assessment of the volumes of data to be handled;
(c) on the basis of (a) and (b):
(i)    selection of hardware;
(ii)    identification of appropriate software packages, or, if
necessary
(iii)    preparation of software packages to be written "in house".
5.        The Technical Assistance component of the project provides $550,000
which may be utilized by TPA for the acquisition of appropriate hardware
and/or software when the corresponding specifications have been completed and
adopted.

Terms of Reference for Siltation Minimization Study
INTRODUCTION
1.        Tianjin Port is lOCatFJ at the western end of Bohai Wan Bay (Map No.
IBRD 18961). The coastal sediments at the port site and along its 24 kilo-
meter long navigation channel are composed of coastal d.eposits of silty clay
with average grain size of 0.004 m.  Presently, an estimated amount of 9.1 m
of annual maintenance dredging is needed to maintain proper navigation along
the approach channel and the port basin. This would increase to 11.8 m as
the East Mole basin development is completed. Identification of potential
sources of sediment to both the navigation channel and the harbor basin, is
vital for the analysis of future performance of these facilities under future
development activities and for the assessment of needed mitigation measures.
This suggested study program outlines the needed analysis to evaluate and
mitigate the sedimentation problem at the study area.
PROBLEM DEFINITTON
2.        The sedimentation problem at the project site has three main ele-
ments: (i) sediment source identification; (ii) methods and modes of accretion
along the navigation channel and basins system; and (iii) mitigation methods
of accretion control. The suggested program would assist in proper under-
standing of these problems through comprehensive field and theoretical
analysis of the existing sediment and hydrodynamic conditions.
APPROACH
3.        Reasonable understanding of a sediment problem of this type would
require the performance of some field measurements and observations. These
field studies, in combination with the application of some available analy-
tical techniques and mathematical models can be used for both the understand-
ing and possible mitigation of the existing sedimentation prublems. Following
is a summary of the suggested studies.
3.1 Analytical Studies
This would cover the following studies:
(a) Review of Available Data. This includes review of available data on
the dredging repords, oceanographic data and other relevant
information.
(b) Wave Analysis. In order to assess the effect of waves on the
sediment conditions, wave forecast, refraction and littoral current
analysis is suggested for the Bohai Wan Bay. The results of this



- 54-                                ANNEX 9
Page 3
analysis will be used with both the field program and the subsequent
models to understand the overall sediment behavior.
tc) Water Circulation Model. The circulation within Bohai Wan Bay due
to both tidal current and storm wind is a major factor in sediment
transport and behavior along the study area. It is therefore
suggested that a water circulation model be applied to this area
using peak flood and ebb currents and a design storm wind condition.
(d) Sediment Transport Analysis. Sedimentation potentials along the
study area may be assessed using available theoretical methods and
dredge materials disposal models. These analyses would utilize the
established oceanographic and hydrodynamic conditions in combination
with the prevailing sediment characteristics. Information on the
incipient motion conditions and potential erosion or accretion areas
aJ'd hence, the fate of dredge material disposal can be predicted.
The results of this analysis would be useful in the understanding of
the eristing conditions along the study area and in the development
of mitigation measures for the present and future development.
3.2 Field Studies
Field studies to define the existing hydrodynamic regime are
necessary to develop an accurate understanding of sedimentation processes.
These field studies are designed to measure tidal circulation in terms of near
bottom current speeds and direction; to characterize bottom sediment charac-
teristics within the dredged channel and contiguous harbor areas; and to
provide input into theoretical studies of phenomenon not easily measured
directly in the field such as currents and re-suspension potential during
episodes of high wind and wave activity. Specific field studies should
include the following:
3.2.1 Current Measurements
Continuous current measurements near the bottom (approximately one
meter above the bed) should be taken at a minimum of three locations for a
duration of one month. Current measurements should record both speed and
direction as a function of time. Current meter locations should be selected
to provide data on the effect the dredged channel has on the tide induced
current regime.
3.2.2 Drogue Studies
Drogue releases, tracked through a tidal day during spring tide
conditions will be used to follow the movement of water masses and detect
probable sources for sediments entering the harbor and channel. Drogue
releases should be scheduled to observe strong ebb and flood tidal currents.
Sail depth of the drogues should be set so that near bottom currents are
represented with minimum influence of surface wind driven currents. It is
estimated that about six drogues with four or five release dates should be
sufficient to map tidal circulation under normal conditions.

Page 4
3.2.3 Bottom Samples
Bottom sediment samples should be taken in the harbor, the channel,
and adjacent areas of the bay. These samples should then be analyzed for
grain size distribution. Approximately 40 samples should be sufficient to
adequately describe bottom sediment characteristics.
3.2.4 Suspended Sediment Profiles
Suspended sediment concentration profiles should be obtained at
several key locations under various tidal stages.  It is desirable to obtain
profiles during maximum flood, maximum ebb, and slack tide conditions.
Approximately seven profiling locations are needed.
DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION OF MITIGATION METHODS
4.        Mitigation measures to relieve maintenance dredging requirements
should be developed based on the understaiiding of present on-going sedimenta-
tion processes developed in prior tasks. Possible mitigation measures include
relocating dredge spoil disposal areas to minimize transport of dredge mate-
rial back into the harbor and dredge channel, construction or extension of
harbor jetties and breakwaters, and altering maintenance dredging practices.
Once possible mitigation measures are identified, each alternatives should be
evaluated on its impact to shoaling and maintenance dredging requirements.
Comparison of each alternative in terms of total project life-time cost can
then be found and used for further decision making.
STUDY DURATION
5.        This study would take from 4-6 months to complete including at least
1 month of field studies. The study is planned to start in October 1986.
Additional Requirements
6.        (a)  Consultants should give:  Lectures for Chinese engineers, which
include utilization of 3-D mathematical model and computer
software.
(b) Send Chinese engineers (7) outside China to learn about
mathematical modeling (for 8 weeks). The consultants will
arrange and provide accomodations for this training.
7.        Consultants will carry out parts 2, 3, 3.1 assisted by the Tianjin
Marine Transport Institate. The Institute will carry out 3.2 assisted by the
consultants whenever needed. Part 4 will be carried out by the consultants
and the Institute together.

Financial Forecast Methodology and Principal Assumptions
1.        Traffic  over TPA facilities will increase as forecast in Annex 7,
Table 1.
2.        Harbor Superitendency Organization.  Forecasts are based on vessels
and cargo utilizing all river facilities, using current tariffs. Net revenue
estimate set conservatively at Y 3.0 per annum.
3.        TPA Operating Revenue.  Forecasts (with the exception of "sales")
have been calculated on the basis of traffic forecasts referred to above,
using current tariffs. Calculations of revenue related to cargo loading and
unloading and storage are given in Table 6.4 and represent the operations of
the five Operating Corporations and the Container Corporation. Revenue from
"Sales" reflects the activities of the Maintenance and Engineering Corporation
and the Machinery Repair Corporation. "Other" revenue derives from operations
of the Cargo Storage Corporation and the Tug and Lighter Corporation.
4.        Depreciation.  Overall annual average rate resulting from estimates
of future depreciation charges on fixed assets in use - other than basic
facilities are as follows (in Z):
1984      1986       1988      1990       1992
3.4       3.8        4.0       4.1        4.2
5.        Nonoperating Net Costs.  Relate to staff welfare services such as
schools, hospitals and housing.
6.        Apportionment of Surplus Revenues.
(a) TPA may retain, at least for the period 1984-86, all income and
adjustment Taxes accruing to the state from PENAVICO, SINOTRANS and
Bunker Oil Company as well as from TPA's own subordinate
enterprises. TPA may also retain all basic depreciation charges and
the USO net revenue.
(b) from 1985, 21% of the year's profit is to be retained at the
enterprise level for developing production, approved investments,
collective staff welfare and bonus awards.
7.        Borrowing.  Local loans at 3.62 over 20 years, including 5 grace.
World Bank loans onlent at 4Z over 20 years including 5 grace.
8.        Capital Espenditures.  Undertaken by THCDC from January 1, 1986.
Funding is provided by TPA; the resultant receivables from THCDC are
extinguished by transfer to TPA of the completed assets.

Table 6.7
Page 2
9.        Balance Sheets
(a) Receivables, based on previous experience are assumed to be 3.02 of
gross revenues.
(b)  Payables, based on previous experience are assumed to be 8% of
expenses.
(c) Inventories are estimated taking into account current efforts to
dispose of slow moving and obsolete stores.
