IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
CHINA
TIANJIN PORT PROJECT (LOAN 2689-CHA)
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) f,or the Tianjin Port
Project in China for which Loan 2689-CHA in the amount of $130 million was approved
on May 6, 1986. The loan was closed on October 31, 1994. The Loan was extended
twice, for one year and ten months, respectively. Final disbursements were made on
November 8, 1994. The Loan amount was fully disbursed.
The ICR was prepared by Messrs. Toshiro Tsutsumi (Task Manager) and
Han-Kang Ten (Economic and Financial Analyst) in the Transport Operations Division,
China and Mongolia Department of the East Asia and Pacific Region of the Bank and
reviewed by Messrs. Richard Scurfield, Chief, EA2TP and Yo Kimura, Project Adviser,
EA2DR. The borrower provided comments that are included as appendixes to the ICR.
Preparation of this ICR was started just before the project closing date and
was based on material in the project file. The borrower contributed to the ICR with its
own evaluation of the project preparation and execution.

TIANJIN PORT PROJECT
(LOAN 2689-CHA)
CHINA
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Objectives
1.          The project's principal objective was to assist the Government of the
People's Republic of China (GOC) to relieve congestion in the port of Tianjin and increase
handling capacity by providing additional facilities and improving the planning, managerial
and operational capabilities of its staff. The Bank also encouraged the establishment of an
autonomous port authority which would be a new organizational model for public
enterprises in China. The Bank helped finance: (a) 11 berths (2,150mr long) for general
cargo, timber and construction materials along with yard, railway, road and other related
facilities; (b) cargo handling equipment, navigational aids and harbor boats; and (c)
technical assistance and equipment for: a study to minimize siltation in channels and
basins; provision of a management information system; and establishment of the Port
Development Center.
Implementation Experience
2.          Project implementation was generally satisfactory, although the closing date
was extended twice, first for one year and then for 10 months due to:
(a)   A one-year delay in the construction of the north-side wharves, owing to
unforeseen soil conditions at the construction site. This required the pile
structure to be redesigned to a caisson-gravity type and bid documents to be
modified; and
(b)   A delay in procurement of equipment for the training center, two boats and
two quay-side container cranes. The former was delayed due to ,xtra time
needed to finalize the scope and size of the training center; procdrement of
the boats was delayed due to space shortages at the shipyard. Obtaining the
cranes was delayed because of the long period devoted to bid evaluations as
well as to the limited availability of space in the shipyard where the parts
were to be assembled.
3.          Bid evaluations, which required a dual process (one by the end-user and
another by the central evaluation committee) took a long time (7-10 months) at the initial
stage of the project. Although this improved after the borrower became familiar with Bank
guidelines, evaluation for other contracts still required about six months, instead of the



- iii -
two-to-three months maximum typical of countries at China's stage of development. This
should be improved as soon as possible.
Results
4.           Total project cost was $321.7 million, against $282.0 million estimated in
the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR). The increase was mainly due to a rise in local prices
compounded by the implementation delay (the local component was $188.1 million against
$139.2 million) (para. 12 and Table 8A). The $130 million loan was fully disbursed.
Remaining costs were borne by the Tianjin Port Authority (TPA).
5.           The principal project objective was achieved, as the port is now more
efficient. For example, productivity per vessel increased over 50 percent, from 777
tons/day in 1985 to 1,175 tons/day in 1993 (para. 14). Institutional goals were also
achieved substantially through technical assistance: TPA's management information and
operations control systems were developed, the Tianjin Port Training Center was
established, and the siltation minimization study was completed. In addition, savings were
obtained in cargo-handling costs, ship waiting and berthing time, and cargo time. The
project's economic rate of return (at completion) was estimated at 15.7 percent against
19.2 percent in the SAR, which is considered satisfactory.
6.           The objective of decentralizing the port authority so it could operate as a
financially autonomous corporation was only partly achieved, since the function of setting
tariffs is still under Government control. The issue of tariffs becomes critical in the long
term because they do not fully incorporate price hikes and the Government must therefore
provide the port with favorable tax arrangements.
Sustainability
7.           The project should be sustainable. Because it extended the port facilities,
traffic will grow in conjunction with Tianjin's economic development, the Beijing-Tianjin
corridor and the country in general. Further, TPA is a financially stable entity with
adequate financial resources to maintain and operate the port efficiently. Moreover, with
the modern equipment and extensive training provided under the project, TPA has the
potential to increase the port's productivity even further and provide services at competitive
costs.
Findings and Lessons Learned
8.           The main findings from the project's implementation was that TPA and
Tianjin Harbour Construction and Development Company (THCDC) were quite capable
of handling the construction and procurement of equipment.
9.           A key lesson was that the project's flexible design for the wharf, which
allowed it to be converted to a container terminal, was a major factor in its success.
Another lesson was that procurement of goods took longer than expected because of the



- iv -
dual evaluation process carried out. A third lesson was that financial targets with respect
to decentralizing the setting of tariffs, should have been identified more precisely in the
SAR. This can be accomplished in the near future. However, to ensure that tariffs are
set correctly and do not reflect monopoly pricing (that would adversely affect users of the
port), TPA and the municipal government will need to promote competition among
companies that operate at the port. This may entail the formation of new companies
(which could be joint ventures) and TPA divesting itself of many of its subsidiaries, so
these could operate independently and compete.

(LOAN 2689-CHA)
PART 1. lMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. STATEMENT/EVALUATION OF OBJECTIVES
1.          The project's main objectives were: (a) to increase Tianjin port's capacity
to handle timber, construction materials and general cargo by building specialized berths
that contain modern equipment; (b) to contribute to long-term efficiency and productivity;
(c) to improve TPA's efficiency through training for various aspects of port planning and
development and through TA (to help with installing computerized management
information systems, conducting a salutation study and establishing the Tianjin Port
Training Center), that could improve TPA's managerial skills.
2.          When the project was identified, most ports were badly congested; container
berths, bulk cargo berths, port equipment, storage yards and transport infrastructure for
distribution were in short supply. In fact, congestion was so severe that it could have
constrained China's foreign trade from expanding further. Thus, the project was designed
to address congestion at Tianjin port, China's third largest port at the time and the one
serving Beijing.
3.          The Bank also encouraged the Government to introduce organizational
changes that could improve the port's management and promote its autonomy. Tianjin was
the first port placed under the local municipality, which gave the TPA broader decision-
making and financial authority than the Ministry of Communications (which had previously
been in control).

B. ACHIEVEMENT OF OBJECTIVES
Project Description
4.           To achieve these objectives, it was decided (see Map attached) that the
project would comprise 1 1 deep-water berths for ships of 30,000-50,000 dwt with work
to be carried out from 1986 to 1992 in two phases: Phase 1 (1986-90) to construct 5 berths
and Phase 11 (1987-92) to construct an additional 6 berths. The 11 berths were designed
to be converted into container berths when needed. In the future the project would
comprise both phases. It included the following components:
(a)   construction of five new berths on the East Pier's south side for timber,
general cargo and construction materials, requiring: (i) construction of a
780 m quaywall for four berths with alongside depth of 10.5 m; (ii) con-
struction of a 170 m quaywall with alongside depth of 10 m for the
remaining berth;
(b)   construction of six new berths 1,200 m in length on the East Pier's north
side for general cargo with alongside depth of 10 m; and the construction
of some service boat quays;
(c)   dredging of about 11.82 million cu m of spoil and reclamation of 840,000
sq m of land and stabilization of the fill material;
(d)   provision of the required cargo handling equipment and navigational aids,
and harbor equipment and boats;
(e)   provision of other related facilities such as railway, road, yard pavement,
water supply, sewage, power supply;
(f)   construction of the required buildings; and
(g)   provision of supervision consultants.
5.           The project also contained components to address the port's needs in
institutional and technological development. These components comprise:
(a)   technical assistance for a study of methods to minimize siltation in channels
and basins and training of port specialists;
(b)   equipment for the development of Tianjin Port Authority's management
information and operations control systems;
(c)   establishment of the Tianjin Port Development Center for training, research
and development studies.

In particular, TPA agreed to incorporate long-term financial planning in its rolling financial
five-year plan (in which it would assume the position of an autonomous entity).
Project Implementation
6.          The loan became effective on March 20, 1987, about five months after the
legal documents were signed on October 16, 1986. Although the closing date was
extended twice (due to unforeseen physical factors, not the Borrower's unsatisfactory
performance), the major objectives were achieved.
7.          Physical components.  Prequalification of bidders, preparation of bid
documents, as well as bid evaluations for civil works contracts, were undertaken prior to
loan effectiveness. Construction was supervised by experienced teams from the Tianjin
Habour Construction and Development Company (THCDC), whose backgrounds and
professional experiences were reviewed and approved by the Bank; they were assisted by
foreign consultants. TPA/THCDC applied the deep mixing method to strengthen the soft
soil at the wharves, which was then able to accommodate the caisson-gravity type structure
(this modification led to a one-year delay).
8.          Procurement. Although no major procurement problems surfaced, there
was some delay in the various stages, such as with the preparation of bid documents,
evaluation, and delivery of equipment. TPA and GOC took more time than expected to
evaluate bids at the beginning of the project since they were not familiar with the Bank's
procurement guidelines (Table 5C). While performance in this area improved gradually,
the evaluation period generally required more than six months (180 days) which was much
longer than the bid validity period (90-120 days) recommended by the Bank. This was due
to the GOC's multiple authorization procedures.
9.          Additional container handling equipment (two quay-side container cranes and
three rubber-tired gantry cranes) were procured through cost savings. The additional
cranes were needed to meet the increase in containerized cargo. For the same reason, one
timber berth was converted to a container terminal. This was anticipated in the SAR and
all 11 berths were designed for such conversions. Delivery of the two quay-side cranes
was delayed until March 1995 due to constraints in the subcontracted shipyard. However,
this delay did not affect the loan closing. The loan proceeds were fully used and the
remaining contractual payments were met by local funds.
10.         TA components. Implementation of training and studies, including the
development of Management Information System (MIS), was satisfactory. TPA provided
overseas and domestic training in various aspects such as management, long-term planning
and cargo handling. TPA's training for the east-pier operation was trimmed because the
type of cargo to be handled was changed from general cargo, which would have required
a large pool of stevedores, to container and dry bulk cargo. The MIS was satisfactorily
established and covered a wide area of TPA's activities such as planning, berth operations,
financial payroll, personnel management, equipment management, fixed asset evaluations,
documentation, and engineering matters. The siltation study was completed as planned.



- 4 -
The size of the training center was reduced, since it was reconceived as a regional institute
that would be expanded in the future, instead of national center, as originally planned
(following the Bank's recommendation).
11.         During implementation, TPA prepared and submitted annual financial five-
year rolling plans successfully; these plans indicated that TPA's financial condition would
be healthy.
12.         The project's final cost was $321.72 million against $281.96 million
estimated at the time of appraisal. The increased costs were mainly due to price hikes in
local costs, which were compounded by a delay in implementation (from $139.2 million
to $188.1 million). For example, steel was Y 1,000/ton at appraisal, but Y 3,300-
3,500/ton in 1994.
13.         No environmental or resettlement problems arose during implementation.
14.         Throughout implementation, the primary objective to increase port efficiency
was achieved: the average cargo-handling period per vessel for general cargo was reduced
from 2.1 days in 1985 to 1.8 days in 1993 (a 14 percent reduction). Further, when the
increase in vessel size is included in the calculation, vessel productivity increases more
than 50 percent, from 777 tons/day in 1985 to 1,175 tons/day in 1993 (see Table 6).
Moreover, the institutional goal to establish a financially autonomous entity was achieved,
except that tariffs are still under Government control. Because tariffs do not fully reflect
price increases, the Government must provide TPA with favorable tax arrangements, such
as exemptions. Under these arrangements, the TPA has an incentive to become more
efficient, because it will be able to retain more of its savings.
15.         In the long term, ports should encourage competition among companies that
operate the terminals to increase efficiency. In this regard, a new container handling
company (the Oriental Company) was created and is competing with the exiting container
terminal operated by Tianjin Container Company. The Bank highly recommends this
approach be adopted at other ports, where appropriate. Also, an independent firm, Xing
Tang Labor Company (XTLC) was established to provide personnel for the East Company
and No. 6 Company, which operate at the east pier (their construction was financed by the
Bank).
16.         Decentralization. From June 1984, some of the management and financial
functions of the port were decentralized from the central Government (MOC) to the
municipality.  While the latter assumes most of the responsibility through the port
authority, which handles daily management, operations, construction and development,
major projects and plans that affect the port's long-term development still need to be
approved by MOC. In order to avoid placing a financial burden on the municipality, port
finances were restructured in mid-1984; all its tax obligations were eliminated, which
improved its financial position. To date, this arrangement has not been altered.

17.         The decentralization has significantly affected the port's financial and
management structure. The following table summarizes the key financial terms of the
restructuring.

18.         Financial performance. The port's financial performance from 1985-93 has
been satisfactory. A comparison of performance with that projected at appraisal indicates
that the actual average annual growth rate of before-tax income was 8.4 percent during
1985-92 compared with the 3.9 percent forecast in the SAR. However, the average annual
increase in operating revenue of 14.5 percent (7.7 percent forecast in the SAR) was offset
by the rise of operating costs of 21.6 percent (7.4 percent forecast). Before-tax income
in 1992 was Y 274.1 million, compared with the SAR's Y 129.7 million, and the figure
increased by 13.8 percent to Y 311.9 million in 1993. The total volume of traffic handled
by the port in 1993 was not very different from the level forecast (33.9 million tons in the
SAR vs. 34.6 million tons).
19.         The SAR's financial forecasts were developed when the country controlled
prices for almost every major commodity at the national level; as a result, cost increases
and inflation were rare. In addition, the Government allocated major resources during the
previous three decades and only charged users the "planned" prices. At appraisal, there
was no indication that either the cost of resources or the rate of inflation would change.
Therefore, the financial forecasts assumed that:  (a) real port charges would remain
virtually constant; and (b) the rate of inflation would be minor (from 6 percent-7 percent
during 1985-92). These assumptions, although reasonable at the time, now appear very
conservative due to the much higher than expected inflation.
20.          During 1985-93, although the Government tightly controlled the port's
tariffs, unit tariffs increased by an average of 20.9 percent a year. However, this increase
still did not match average unit price increases in operating costs of 31.7 percent (the result
of sharply rising fuel, materials and wage costs, and depreciation (most of which have to
be paid on the basis of market prices, which were much steeper than the rise in regulated
government tariffs).  Highlights of the port's income statements for selected years,
compared with the SAR forecast, are summarized below with details shown in Table 1.1,
Annex 1.

21.            TPA's financial performance in 1993 was better than expected at appraisal
due to the preferential financial arrangements stemming from decentralization. Operating
ratios, however, continued to deteriorate and were higher than the appraisal targets because
costs rose rapidly, while tariffs remained lower. Thus, if the current tariff system is not
changed, TPA's operating costs are expected to exceed its operating revenue in 1997
(based on the annual growth rates of costs and revenues between 1984-93).
22.            The rate of return on average net fixed assets (RRFA), although still quite
satisfactory, also declined from 24 percent in 1985 to 15.4 percent in 1992. The decrease
was largely due to the rise in operating costs. TPA's fixed assets (RFA) were revalued
in March 1993 and it was expected that after this, the RRFA would decline even further
in 1993. However, it dropped only slightly (to 15.0 percent). This was because: (a) the
RFA was too conservative (carried out for the first time in more than 40 years it increased
fixed assets only by an average of about 30 percent in book value and 15.3 percent in net
value); (b) the impact of the RFA was further diluted when the value of new fixed assets
was averaged with the low-valued fixed assets from the previous year; and (c) the 8.6
percent increase in operating revenues in 1993 absorbed some of the negative impact from
the RFA. Thus, it is very important for TPA to apply the proper market value on its fixed
assets so it can adequately depreciate its aging facilities and then replace them without
jeopardizing the port's future financial capacity.
23.            Beginning in July 1993, TPA adopted new financial reporting procedures in
order to align Chinese accounting procedures more closely to the Western accounting
system. Based on the new procedures, some accounts were abolished and replaced by
others.  The purpose of the new  system  is to accelerate the commercialization and
privatization of the port by providing westernized accounting instruments.

24.         Present performance.  At the end of 1993, despite the rapid rise in
operating costs, the port's financial position was still sound. The actual current ratio in
1992 was 5.7, which was lower than the SAR's original forecast of 19.2 but still
acceptable. Also, debt service coverage during 1985-92 was much better than the SAR
forecast, and current assets exceeded liabilities. The percentage of net current assets in
the form of cash, however, declined from 80 percent in 1985 to 75 percent in 1992 and
to 55 percent in 1993. For the same years, the share of accounts receivable increased from
6 percent to 14 percent and then to 39 percent. Accounts receivables rose due to: (a) the
merger of special funds with other accounts, and (b) the merger of accounts with the two
other TPA-owned firms (the Foreign Ship Agent Company and Fuel Supply Company)
which had higher accounts receivables.
25.         The most noteworthy points of the balance sheet during these years can be
found in Table 1.2, Annex 1, and are summarized as follows:
1985               1990                 1992

26.         Future performance. Under present financial arrangements, despite the
recent high increase in operating costs, the port still enjoys healthy liquidity, leverage and
profitability ratios because it is exempt from all taxes, funds and depreciation payments (to
the Government). These conditions have not been altered over the last 10 years. The
port's new responsibility for financing all its capital investment programs has not yet
impacted on its cash flow (Table 1.3, Annex 1), but is expected to weigh more heavily in
the near future. In addition, its current preferential tax terms, which will expire in 1995,
could change at any time in the coming year.



- 8 -
27.          Considering the higher growth rate of operating costs and TPA's future
financial obligations, the port's financial personnel should test many scenarios prior to
negotiations with government officials. The critical issues are:
(a)    Tariffs. To offset the rapid increase in operating costs, tariffs should be
adjusted every year in line with the general price index;
(b)   Revaluation of fixed assets (RFA).  To improve the port's financial
capacity to replace its aging equipment, RFA should be carried out
periodically;
(c)   Investments. To enhance the port's cash flow, some non-cash generated
infrastructure investments (such as for dredging and construction channels
and breakwaters) should be financed by the State;
(d)   Foreign exchange risks. Due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, it
is expected that TPA will have to pay an additional Y 61.0 million annually
for its foreign loans.
Econoniic Re-evaluation
28.          The economic analysis presented in this report is based on actual data on
traffic, operational performance, economic costs and the benefits of project components.
The methodology used in the revaluation was similar to that in the SAR and is briefly
summarized as follows:
(a)    Capital investment and maintenance costs were revised to reflect 1994 prices
and included in the cost stream;
(b)   The benefit stream, also reflected in 1994 prices, was also included, and
consists of savings in port handling, ship port time (berth and waiting), and
cargo port time (berth and waiting);
(c)    A project life of 20 years was assumed and the capital investment period for
all berths was from 1985-95;
(d)   Benefits started to accrue both for the construction-material berth and the
container berths in 1990. For general cargo berths, benefits started in 1993.
29.          During project implementation, the use of the berths changed due to changes
in the composition of the traffic. In particular, the growth of timber traffic was much
slower than the SAR estimate. Thus, TPA decided to use the existing general cargo berths
to handle the shrinking timber traffic and convert the four timber berths into three
container berths. This conversion was taken into account during the planning stage, in the
design of the timber berths. It was also considered in the economic analysis for this ICR.



-9-
30.         Some expenditures (about 1 percent of total project costs) were allocated to
the newly established Port Training Center to improve the operational and managerial
efficiency of port staff. The results of these 'improvements are not quantifiable in monetary
terms and, consequently, a conventional cost-benefit analysis of the investment cannot be
made in the usual manner. However, the payoff is expected to be large.
31.         When reviewing the three project components together, it appears that two
major factors had a positive impact on improving the revalued economic internal rate of
return (REIRR): (a) the lower average daily ship cost in the port; and (b) better than
expected traffic performance for the cargoes. Conversely, these factors will be offset by:
(a) the higher cargo handling costs; (b) the higher economic capital cost; and (c) the delay
in project completion.
32.         After the data was revised, the REIRR for the project was 15.7 percent,
which is slightly lower than the SAR estimate of 19.2 percent, but still acceptable. A
detailed analysis is presented in Annex 2.
33.         The REIRR and SAR estimates of the project in terms of economic rates of
return and net present value (NPV) are given below.

C. MAJOR FACTORs AFFECTING THE PROJECT
34.         Major factors affecting the project are summarized as follows:
Positive factors:
(a)   The developing economy of the area and the country which increased port
traffic;
(b)   The Borrower's expanded capacity to implement projects;
(c)   Simplicity of project design; and
(d)   Use of an advanced construction method to improve the soft soil (MDM),
which saved costs.



- 10 -
Negative factors:
(a)   Underestimation of the limit of decentralization in the port's financial
administration;
(b)   Price hikes during implementation, that increased both project and port
operation costs; and
(c)   Underestimation of the difficulty in organizing a training center for
nationwide use.
D. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
35.         The project can be considered sustainable. It expanded port facilities and
raised productivity, and port traffic will grow in conjunction with the economic
development of the Tianjin area, as well as the Tianjin-Beijing corridor and the country.
Further, TPA is a stable entity with enough financial resources to maintain and operate the
port efficiently. Moreover, with the modem equipment and extensive training provided
under the project, TPA has the potential to increase the port's productivity even further and
provide services at competitive costs.
E. BANK PERFORMANCE
36.         The Bank's performance in identifying issues and preparing the project was
thorough and timely: The project was identified in June 1984 and appraised in June 1985.
Bank staff resources were used efficiently (130.4 staffweeks), both until appraisal and
during supervision with an annual average input of 9.1 staffweeks, including all specialties
throughout the duration (see Table 12, Bank Resources).  Also, it gave adequate
consideration to the design of the wharves (all 11 berths were designed in a way that they
could be converted to handle containers).
37.         However, its performance could have been better if it had more carefully
assessed the training needs during appraisal: while the SAR provided for a comprehensive
Port Training Center for the entire country, the plan has not fully materialized.
38.         Regarding procurement, the Bank took a consistent position and provided
appropriate instructions and guidance, when necessary.
F. BORROWER PERFORMANCE
39.         In general, the Borrower's performance was good and preparation and
implementation were adequate. Pilot reforms decentralized the administration of Tianjin
port, provided it with financial autonomy and separated the major construction works from
daily port administrative functions by the establishment of an independent entity (THCDC).
Both TPA and THCDC succeeded in implementing the reforms. As shown in Table 10,



- 11 -
Part II, covenants were mostly met.  The Borrower's performance, therefore, was
satisfactory.
40.         Although operations are satisfactory, the Borrower will need to closely
monitor the activities of the new east pier, with its advanced systems of managing
information and equipment, to determine the level of increased efficiency.
G. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
41.         This project is assessed as satisfactory since it achieved all the major
objectives without any shortcomings.
42.         The net present value is positive, Y 487.2 million against Y 310.1 in the
SAR (see para. 33), when flows are discounted at 12 percent for the major portion of the
investment.
H. FuTURE OPERATIONS
43.         The project has provided the port with the capacity to handle traffic up to
around the year 2000. It is important for authorities to prepare the next phase of the
development since planning and construction will take several years; any delay that will
lead to congestion will be a great loss to the national economy.
44.         The efficiency of the port as well as its financial performance will need to
be monitored in the future; several indicators of port productivity, such as ship waiting
time, cargo handling volume per day per vessel (as indicated in para. 13), and moves
(load/unload) of container boxes per hour per crane, can be used. These will be available
from the statistics provided by TPA.
45.         TMG as well as TPA have asked the Bank to assist in financing a follow-up
project for port expansion. The Bank has proposed that it include various modes of
transportation that interface at the port so that maritime traffic will be considered along
with road and railway linkages. Discussions between GOC and the Bank are underway.
I. KEY LESSONS LEARNED
46.         The key lessons from the implementation are:
(a)   Decentralization of control over China's port system can be carried out
satisfactorily. An autonomous corporation for port construction (THCDC)
proved viable when staffed by competent professionals. TPA and THCDC
performances were quite satisfactory.
(b)   Port decentralization now needs to include tariff setting; tariffs are still
under Government control, and operating costs cannot be fully reflected.
Also, TPA needs to pay more attention to improving productivity by
introducing more competition among corporations that operate at terminal;



- 12 -
(c)   Flexibility in the project design, such as that of the wharf, which allowed
it to be converted to a container terminal, proved well-advised; and
(d)   Procurement of goods took longer than expected (more than six months) due
to the country's dual-evaluation process; in the future it could be shortened
if evaluation procedures were simplified or the meetings were better
coordinated. Government effort is under way.

Table 7: STUDIES INCLUDED IN PROJECT
Siltation Minimization Study
(a)  Purpose as defined at appraisal. Analyzing the source of sedimentation,
evaluating sedimentation problems at the project area and providing
mitigation measures. Determine if dredged material dumped at the site would
return to the dredged channel and basin in the future.
(b)  Status. Satisfactorily completed in December 1989.
(c)  Impact of study. The proposed dumping area was evaluated appropriately.
Dumped dredged material would not return to the basin and channel. This
was confirmed by periodic field observations during implementation.
2.   Development of Operations Control and a Management Information System
(a)   Purpose as defined at appraisal. Developing a computer management
system covering a wide area of TPA activities: planning, berth operations,
cargo transportation, financial, payroll, personnel management, equipment
management, fixed asset evaluations, documentation, and engineering.
(b)  Status. Satisfactorily completed in August 1992.
(c)  Impact of study. The system was established satisfactorily and is now
operational (it can also link with the Dongfang container company's system).

ANNEX 2: ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A. TRAFFIC
1.          As shown in Table 2.1, the overall traffic of the port is increasing steadily.
The actual total traffic in 1993 was almost the same as the SAR forecast. However,
general cargo and container traffic were higher than the estimates and are summarized as
follows.

Year        Total    (1)    (2)    (3)          Total    (1)    (2)    (3)

1990        28.7     9.4    350    1.3          19.4     6.8    287    1.0
1991        30.3      9.5    385    1.3         22.5     7.7    340    1.0
1992        32.1      9.7    423    1.4         27.7     9.6    394    1.4

(1) General cargo traffic (including timber traffic).
(2) Container traffic ('000 teu); 1 teu = 10 ton.
(3) Construction materials.
2.          Despite the severe economic recession in 1990 and 1991, the average annual
traffic growth of the port during 1985-1993 still shows an increase of 8.4 percent per year,
compared to the estimated 9.0 percent in the SAR. The actual traffic in 1985, the first
forecast year, was 6.5 percent higher than the SAR estimate. The latest figure (1993) was
2.1 percent higher growth than forecast. Based on the economic activities of the area (a
newly developed special economic zone (SEZ) is located adjacent to the project site), the
increase in port traffic for the next decade (1995-2005) is estimated to be approximately
5.6 percent per year which is slightly higher than the SAR estimate of 4.7 percent.
3.          General cargo traffic. Traffic in 1993 was higher than the SAR estimate
by 17.2 percent. For the last four years (1990-1993), the traffic growth rate was 19.5
percent per year which was much higher than the SAR estimate of 1.7 percent. Thus, the



- 29 -                          ANNEX 2
port needs the additional general cargo berths to meet demand. TPA has proposed the
construction of two of additional general cargo berths plus three multipurpose berths
(which may be converted to container berths in the future) for Bank financing. The Bank
is reviewing this proposal.
4.           Construction material traffic. Most of the construction material (sand,
stone, brick and tile) is shipped from domestic sources to meet local demand, particularly
for the development of the port and SEZ. In 1993 traffic was lower than the SAR
projection by 20 percent; based on the current development plan, it is estimated that traffic
may continue to be lower than the SAR estimate.
5.           Container traffic. The container traffic in 1993 was 16.4 percent higher
than the SAR estimate. It appeared that container traffic in 1994 increased by about 26
percent over 1993.  The growth of the container penetration ratio, however, is
concentrated on foreign trade, particularly foreign incoming traffic, which increased from
24 percent in 1985 to 71 percent in 1993. For domestic cargo, the containerization ratio
also increased from 0 percent in 1985 to 13 percent in 1993. Both foreign-bound and
domestic-bound container traffic increased substantially. The share of the latter, however,
was still negligible (3 percent) in 1993. The container penetration ratio of the port can be
summarized as follows:
Container Penetration Ratio in Tianjin Port
(Percent)
1985                          1993
In       Out   Total            In      Out    Total
Foreign-bound            24       14       19            71       50       55
Domestic-bound            0        0        0            55        7        13
Domestic sharing                            0                               3
6.           The rapid growth of foreign incoming containerized cargo represents the
current cargo handling trend for international sea transport. Today, many international
ports only accept containerized cargo, and this requirement will force the port to expedite
the containerization of its foreign outgoing traffic. The development of domestic container
transport has fallen behind due to the lack of adequate investment in transport facilities for
the domestic users. Since improving domestic container handling will involve very large
sums of capital, including the participation of many entities (port, road, highway, urban



-30 -                          ANNEX 2
construction, bridge, electric power, trucking, services, etc.), it is estimated that progress
in this area will be rather slow in the foreseeable future.
B. SHIP TImE ANALYSIS
7.          General Cargo Carriers. When comparing 1985 to 1993, general cargo
carriers spent an average of 7.9 days and 5.4 days, respectively, in the port, of which ship
waiting time (nonproductive time plus weather stoppage) accounted for 5.8 days and 3.6
days, respectively. During the same period, the average working time per ship (productive
time at berth) decreased from 2.1 days to 1.8 days due to improve handling. Despite the
higher traffic demand, the decrease in ship waiting time, from 4.6 days to only 0.5 days,
reflected that if the project had not materialized-adding critical capacity-ship waiting
time would have been much larger (Table 2.2).
8.          Construction Material Carriers. Between 1985 and 1993, the average port
days per ship decreased from 2.0 days to 1.5 days. Despite the fact that average shipment
size increased from 3,700 tons to 5,800 tons, the average (productive) time needed to
unload a ship did not change (0.7 days per ship). Installation of the new equipment
improved not only the efficiency of the work but also maximized the availability of the
equipment. The nonproductive time, for example, decreased from 1.2 days in 1985 to 0.8
day in 1993 (Table 2.2).
9.          Container Ships. Although the number of container ships visiting the port
increased more than three and a half times from 1985-1993, the average port days per ship
dropped sharply from 4.7 in 1985 to 1.5 in 1993. With the project, nonproductive time
(due to the port) also dropped sharply from 3.5 days to 0.8 days (Table 2.2).
C. BERTH OPERATIONS
10.         The operating data for general cargo and container berths also differ from
the SAR estimates. Detailed operating data used for the economic re-evaluation of each
project berth are shown in Table 2.3, and highlighted as follows:

11.            All costs related to the completion of the facilities planned under the project
were included in the project economic re-evaluation. All inputs and outputs were evaluated in
constant 1994 economic costs (Table 2.4). Financial costs were converted to economic costs by
shadow pricing each berth's input categories. Conversion factors for each input category are
based on estimates determined in completed Bank studies.
12.            The overall conversion factor is 0.94, of which the construction materials' berth
is 0.92, container berths are 0.95 and general cargo berths are 0.94. The factors derived for the
various cost items were applied to annual project expenditures to obtain the stream of project
economic costs (Table 2.5).
13.           In the SAR, the overall effect of shadow pricing project costs was that
economic costs were 18.3 percent higher than the financial costs, and total economic costs were
90 percent higher than the SAR estimate (at constant 1994 prices).

Economic Benefits
14.            The economic analysis primarily focused on the benefits derived from relieving
congestion in the port. Details of the traffic forecast are shown in Table 2.1. The project will
yield quantifiable benefits in the form of savings in cargo handling coats, ship time (both waiting
and operating time), and cargo time (Table 2.6).
15.            Savings in Cargo Handling Cost. Savings from cargo handling were relatively
small when compared to total savings. These were derived from the direct costs of cargo
handling on the new facilities. Without the project, the only way traffic in excess of berth
capacity could have been handled would have been by offshore unloading (called lightening)-at
much higher costs. It is estimated that these costs would be three to four times greater than



- 33 -                         ANNEX 2
normal handling costs (see Table 2.7 for detailed estimates of savings). This alternate method
of unloading was assumed for cargo tonnage in excess of berth capacity at 95 percent occupancy.
Savings in handling costs have been converted to economic benefits by shadow pricing the main
cost components of normal handling and offshore unloading. Conversion factors of 1.05 for
berth handling and 1. 1 for offshore unloading were used; these factors were estimated in a
previous Bank study.
16.            Savings in Ship Time. These include reductions in ship time waiting for berths
and working at berths due to improved cargo handling. Estimates of the savings in waiting time
due to the project are shown in Table 2.8. Ship costs used for the economic evaluation are at
the low end of the model developed by the Bank. The annualized ship resale value, plus
operating costs, was used to calculate project benefits. It is assumed to reflect the present state
of the shipping industry and gives a slightly lower return than the annualized replacement value.
17.            Savings in Cargo Time. These also apply to the interest saved on the value
of the cargo. For domestic cargo, the marginal source of working capital would be loans from
the People's Construction Bank of China at 10-12 percent interest. For foreign cargo, the higher
foreign exchange working capital needed would require more foreign borrowing, and it is
assumed that this would be at China's marginal cost of capital of approximately 12 percent.
Roughly 22 percent of all cargo passing through Tianjin port involves domestic trade. Interest
savings have therefore been calculated assuming an average rate of interest of 12.0 percent per
year.
18.            Total project benefits for the items discussed above are presented by year in
Table 1.8. The major project benefit would be in ship time savings. These savings would
accrue first to ship owners and could be passed on to cargo owners.  All the ships and
construction materials are Chinese owned. As for general cargo and container traffic, the vast
majority of ships are either Chinese-owned (COSCO) or Chinese-operated; it is expected that 90
percent of the project benefits for such traffic will accrue to China directly.
E. OVERALL ECONOMIC RE-EVALUATION AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
19.           Table 2.9 sets out the re-evaluated economic rate of return (REIRR), net
present value (NPV) and sensitivity calculations for the entire project. The overall REIRR is
15.7 percent. Compared with the SAR, the sensitivity of REIRR and NPV to variations in
costs and benefits are summarized as follows:

Notes:
(i)   theoretical daily berth capacity = cranes per berth x average crane productivity per hour    x average working hours per days.
(li)  theoretical annual berth capacity = theoretical daily berth capacity x berth operating days per year.
(ill) maximun annual capacity per berth = theoretical annual berth capacity x maximun berth utilization.
/1. One TEU =  10.00
/_2. Equivalent to 14,tons.
/_3. Equivalent to 10,000 dwt per ship
/ 4. Figures in the table are the costs for normaL berth handling. If cargo traffic exceeds 95X berth occupancy rate, additional
cargo will be handled by lightering at roughly three times the costs for normal berth handling.
for lightering operations, throughput capacity is taken as 50X of normal berth throughput capacity.

APPENDIX A: PREPARATION MISSION'S AIDE MEMOIRE
(November 6-17, 1994)
1.          A World Bank mission comprising Messrs. T. Tsutsumi and H. K. Yen
visited Tianjin Port from November 6 to 17, 1994, to prepare the Implementation
Completion Report (ICR). The mission wishes to thank the officials of the Government
of China (GOC), Ministry of Communication (MOC), as well as the management and staff
of Tianjin Port Authority (TPA) and Tianjin Harbor Construction and Development
Company (THCDC) for the courtesies and cooperation extended to it during this visit.
2.          This Aide-Memoire summarizes the agreements reached with TPA/THCDC
officials on the preparation of the ICR. The agreements of the mission, as incorporated
in this Aide-Memoire, are subject to review and confirnation by Bank management.
The View of the Bank and TPA/THCDC
3.          The Bank mission and TPA/THCDC have the same view on the project
implementation as prepared below.
4.          The project was satisfactorily completed on October 31, 1994, except for
final delivery of two quay-side container cranes which is expected in March 1995.
However, the Bank loan in the amount of US$130 million has been fully used up in
November 1994. The contract price for two quay-side cranes was about US$4 million
higher than TPA expected.  About eighty percent of the contract works has been
completed, thus all the loan amount (US$130 million) could be fully disbursed.
ICR Preparation
5.          The Bank mission started preparation of the ICR from early September
1994, with the request to TPA/THCDC to provide the necessary information and data.
The mission received draft information and data and prepared an outline of the ICR before
departure from headquarters on November 1, 1994.
6.          The mission visited the project site and discussed with TPA/THCDC the
preparation of the ICR. The mission has obtained necessary information and reached
agreements on the actions to be taken as follows:
(a)   TPA/THCDC will view the draft ICR left by the Bank ICR mission;
TPA/THCDC will send their comments, if any;



- 49 -                         Appendix A
(b)   Bank management will review and comment on the agreement between
TPA/THCDC and the Bank ICR mission. A revised draft ICR will be sent
to the Borrower, MOC and TPA/THCDC (to be confirmed by MOC), by
February 10, 1995;
(c)   TPA/THCDC's comments, as well as their own evaluation, will be sent to
the Bank by February 28, 1995; and
(d)   the Bank will finalize the ICR and send to the Board by April 30, 1995.

APPENDIX B: PROJECT REVIEW FOR
BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
Section A
1.          The East Pier Project (First Phase) of Tianjin Port is a major project in the
port and the first port project in China. World Bank Loans were used for large civil
construction and procurement of equipment through ICB. It also introduced the project
supervision system. The project officially commenced construction in May 1987. The
south side berth and its accessories were completed in November 1990; the north side berth
started construction in May 1990 and was completed on 15 October 1993. It was reviewed
and formally accepted by the State Acceptance Committee on 12 December 1993 to begin
official operation.
2.          The project design is reasonable in general layout and function.  The
handling equipment and structure are advanced and reliable. In general, project objectives
were achieved on its completion and will greatly expand Tianjin Port's capacity in cargo
traffic.
3.          Construction on the silt beach area adopted large amounts of modern
techniques to achieve effectiveness. In store yard construction, new technology of vacuum
pre-loading and plastic drain for consolidation were used. The geologic condition of the
project site was greatly improved by reinforcing the soil of a large area (800,000 m2)-the
first time such a technique was used in China. Construction of the south side wharves
successfully applied the method of deep mixing (MDM) (also for the first time) for the
foundation structure. In order to improve the wharves' structure, the advanced techniques
of MDM were also applied to the north wharves under the approval of the World Bank;
thus, the original design of pile structure was modified to caisson gravity type which
resolved a long-standing problem in wharf construction in Tianjin Port and will
significantly influence future port construction. Although the modification has resulted in
a one-year delay, this should be considered worthwhile and successful because that difficult
technical problem has been settled.  Tianjin Port is grateful to the World Bank for
extension of the closing date.
4.          Construction of the following components such as 110 kilovolt substation,
communication center (C Station), VTMS, sewerage treatment plant, computer managing
system and training center under this project have greatly enhanced the comprehensive
capacity and function of Tianjin Port.
5.          Procurement of over 100 units of handling' machines, port boats and other
systems were carried out strictly in accordance with the Guidelines set by the World Bank



- 51 -                        Appendix B
through ICB. It provides a solid foundation for the development and traffic increase of
Tianjin Port so that it will enable the port to be an international modern one.
6.          The method of sino-foreign cooperation and the Chinese supervising
construction was adopted. Project supervision for civil works on the south side wharves
and center of the East Pier was jointly managed by Tianjin Harbour Construction and
Development Company (THCDC), Overseas Coastal Area Development Institute (OCDI)
from Japan and SPECS of Singapore; the north side wharves were managed by THCDC
alone. Consultant service by foreign experts, construction supervision and local and
overseas training enabled technical and management staff to widen their view, learn and
obtain some international practice, advanced technology and management experiences
which have enhanced the staff's ability. Therefore, project quality was ensured.
7.          Particular attention was given to environmental protection.  In the
construction period, environmental protection facilities such as the sewerage treatment
plant, smoke extinguisher, dust and firefighting system were designed and constructed
within the structure of the whole project and with the approval of the Tianjin Environment
Protection Bureau. There was no significant negative impact to the local environment.
8.          Equipment procurement under this project was executed by an experienced
autonomous department-Tianjin Port International Tendering Office which comprises very
high level experts. A project manager was responsible for implementing the project's
physical aspects. The project manager chosen was the best senior engineer with rich
experience, which ensured smooth project implementation and satisfactory results.
9.          The project design was basically undertaken by the Chinese design institute
(the First Design Institute of Navigation Engineering of MOC). In general, the design was
a success. The design institute made a great effort to ensure the satisfactory execution of
the project.
10.         Technical documents for equipment procurement were prepared by Tianjin
Port Authority, THCDC and the Design Institute with consultant service from SPECS of
Singapore, Kruger of Denmark and Compass from Germany. Some reliable and proven
techniques were incorporated in the well-drafted technical specifications which fully
complied with local conditions. The tendering work was successful.
11.         In accordance with the port master plan and development needs in the
project period, two quayside container cranes and three rubber-tired gantry cranes were
procured with funds saved from the Bank Loan (plus some amount from local sources).
The new south side berth was used successfully to develop container transportation. Now,
Tianjin Port has become the first seaport in China to accommodate fourth-generation
container ships.
12.         The south side wharves were completed and accepted by the state in
November 1993. Since December 1990, handling equipment has operated normally and
provided benefits. The north side wharves were completed in October 1993, and accepted



- 52 -                         Appendix B
in December 1993. The north side handled 10,330,000 tons in 1994 (since it began
operating in January 1994). The smooth completion of the project fully showed that the
production capacity of Tianjin Port has been strengthened. This is a successful project.
13.         Generally, the project was implemented strictly following the SAR. The
wharves, storeyard, power supply, lighting system and handling machine were completed
or delivered in the contracted period. Based on the four years' operation, the procurement
of project facilities and machines is considered satisfactory. But the delivery of boats such
as oil boats, water boats and tug boats was delayed due to the availability of the shipyard
space; and procurement of two quay-side container cranes, with cost savings, was delayed
in delivery due to the lack of shipyard space of the subcontractor (which was assigned for
other large contracts).
14.         Project objectives for TA and training were achieved with satisfactory
implementation in training and study, and construction of a training center. Delays in
construction and procurement in the training center occurred because TPA had difficulties
in finalizing the role of training centers.
15.         Due to reasons beyond TPA's control, bid evaluations required a long period
(average over six months) which prolonged the procurement.
Section B
16.         The first part of the ICR drafted by the World Bank is comprehensive. It
describes completely all the major items of the project executed and the analysis provided
is mainly correct and complies with the actual conditions.
17.         With respect to the data of each item in the list of ICR, Part III, we
acknowledge that they are correct and fully show the overall situation.
18.         With regard to the delay in procurement, we agree, in principle, with the
statement by the World Bank; the reason for delay in the delivery of container cranes was
that the subcontractor was assigned to other large contracts.
Section C
19.         From project appraisal to reimbursement deadline, the World Bank was very
positive and effective. The Tianjin Port Authority and Tianjin Harbour Construction and
Development Company appreciates the efforts of all officials and experts from the World
Bank who participated in this project. We were deeply impressed by their strong sense of
responsibility, scientific management and concern for the project.
20.         During the whole implementation period, we have kept a close cooperation
and mutual respect with the Technical Division, Communication Division, and
Disbursement Division of the Bank. Especially with the guidance on all aspects granted
by the Bank's experts, TPA and THCDC overcame various difficulties in project execution
and completed the project satisfactorily.



- 53 -                         Appendix B
21.          Each site supervision mission from the World Bank had a significant impact
on project execution. They inspected the site situation twice a year and collected first hand
information, resolved problems in the construction to accelerate the effort by strengthening
a mutual understanding and trust so that an easy understanding could be reached. The
Bank mission gave us great support on using savings to procure container cranes, etc. and
especially on extending the closing date and reallocating the loan. The Bank staff's
instruction, understanding and quick response to our request facilitated implementation.
