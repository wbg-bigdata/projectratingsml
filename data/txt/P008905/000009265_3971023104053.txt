PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
TURKEY - FIRST DEVLET YATIRIM BANKASI PROJECT
(LOAN 1024-TU)
PREFACE
This report reviews the implementation experience under Loan No.
1024-TU made by the Bank to Devlet Yatirim Bankasi (State Investment Bank)
under the guarantee of the Republic of Turkey.  The loan was approved in June
1974 ard was fully disbursed by March 31, 1981, with a delay of abo-Lt two
years. The Bank extended two additional loans to DYB (Nos. 1379-TU and
1998-TU) in 1977 and 1981, respectively.
The report focuses on DYB' role in the system of financing public
sector investment projects in Turkey and the experience of the Bank's efforts
in bringing about improvements in the resource allocation process. Another
aspect examined in the report is DYB's role in monitoring subproject implement-
ation. The report, therefore, has a slightly different perspective, focusing
more on L,YB's external relationships rather than on its institutional development.
The report is based on prc4ect files, Staff Appraisal and President's
Reports, sector studies and on the "Sector Operations Review: The Industries
and DFCs Program in Turkey" (Report No. 3077, July 18, 1980), carried out by
the Operations Evaluation Department. Operational data on subprojects were
prepared by DYB staff in Turkey. No comments were received from the Borrower.
This project was not audited by the Operations Evaluation Department.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
TURKEY - FIRST DEVLET YATIRIM BANKASI PROJECT
(LOAN 1024-TU)
HIGHLIGHTS
In making the first loan to DYB in 1974, the expectation that the
Bank's association with DYB would help rt;form SEEs and the public sector
investment allocation process was more important in the Bank's perception than
the transfer of funds or the addition to industrial capacity. As discussed in
Chapter III, it has been evident that the characteristics of the iustitutional
situation, environment and practices prevailing in Turkey constrained progress
in this direction.
After one turther attempt under Loan 1379-TU, it was realized that
the reform of the SEE system was a much more important and complex task, which
could not be achieved by building up DYB alone. In fact, substantial
improvement in DYB's internal institutional capability has occurred, but it
has been unable to bring its capability to bear on the problems of SEEs due to
its being itself a part of the system. This issue had to be taken up at a
policy dialogue level. The completely different design of the third DYB
operation (Ioan No. 1998-TU) was a transitional approach and a result of this
conclusion.
The key issue of SEE reform and of DYB's role is now being addressed
by the Bank as a part of the policy dialogue with the Government under
Structural Adjustment Loans and Specialised Technical Assistance. In view of
the rigidity of the SEE system in Turkey, its long history and tradition of
centralized decision-making, the limited results achieved under the first loan
were not surprising, and the fact that DYB has gradually built up its
professional capacity, should be seen as a positive result and a necessary
condition to enable DYB to widen its role and influence over the SEEs financed
by DYU.
The major lesson to be learnt from the Bank's experience with DYB is
that improvements in tne SEE system can oe achieved only by tackling the issue
directly through SALs, TA loans and an industrial sector policy dialogue, etc,
and not through indirect loans through a public sector DFC like DYB. It would
appear that institutioual improvements occurring within the DFC do not
themselves result in improvements in the operations of its clients, if the
role of tne DFC is severely circumscribed, as in the case of DYB, and that
only limited institution building objectives can be achieved in the public
industrial sector financing system by working through a public sector DFC such
as DYB.



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
TURXEY - FIRST DEVLET YATIRIM BANKASI PROJECT
(LOAN 1024-TU)
I. INTROflICTION
A. Background
1.01     This report reviews the major objectives, expectations and issues set
or identified under the above loan and the record of implementation. Though
the loan was made to an independent public-sector DFC - the Devlet Yatirim
Bankasi (DYB) - the loan differs considerably in its objectives from normal
lines of credit to LJICs, the reason being that DYB is an integral part of the
development planning, resource allocation and implementation system in Turkey
as far as it relates to the investments of State Economic Enterprises (SEE).
While reviewing the implementation of this loan, therefore, the problems of
tne system and its resistance to change have to be taken into account. This
report has been preceded by a detailed Sector Operations Review of the
Industries and DFCs Program in Turkeyl/ carried out by OED staff during 1980
and draws extensively on the review report.
DB. Sectoral Context
1.02     SEEs in Turkey were established since the early lY3Us' to tulfill
needs not adequately being served by the private sector. Over the years, they
have come to play a dominant role in the economy, in industry as well as in
traditional public ucilities, transport, and agricultural marketing
and supply. SEEs currently account for a substantial share of public
investment (4UZ), GDP (8X) and non-agricultural employment (10x). In
industry, SEEs have a virtual monopoly in petroleum refining, steel, alcoholic
beverages and basic metals, and have large shares in fertilizers, pulp and
paper, cement, coal, sugar, machinery and chemicals. Broadly defined, in
terms of the law as Lt stood then, SEEs are enterprises which have more than
one half of their capital owned by the Government, although within this
definition they may assume several legal forms, including being set up as a
private company. Those SEEs which are fully Government-owned are entitled to
create separate legal entities called Establishments which are, in effect,
independent branch operations.  Every SEE, along with its Escablishments, is
under the control of its related Ministry. The basic law under which all SEEs
operate was law 440 until the passage of the new SEE law in May 1983 (see
para 1.04). Supervision of SEE operations is the general responsibility of
the related Ministry and the specific responsibility of the High Control
Board, an auditing organization, which reports directly to Parliament.
Financial SEEs are also audited by a department ot the Ministry of Finance.
The Government provides SEEs with the credit and capital needed to sustain
operations and to make new investments. This is done within the framework of
the Five Year Plan and the annual programs for public sector industry. SEE

(Report No. 3077, dated July 18, 198U)



project proposals have co be vecred and approved by the State Planning
Organization (SPO). Although the respective roles of SPO, DYB and the
Treasury in the scrutiny and approval of SEE investments are not clearly
demarcated, since 1981 most budgetary funds for loans for investment in
profitable SEEs are in principle channelled through DYB while budgetary funds
for investment in nonrprofitable SEEs are transferred only after scrutiny of
the project by DYB and under DYB's supervision during implementation.  ibis
charge in the system has not been implemented fully as yet, though there has
been substauitial reduction in direct budgetary transfers to SEEs.
l.U3     Since the late 1970s, the operating losses and growing iavestment
demands of the SEEs have placed substantial burdens on the budget and added to
inflationary pressures. While some SEEs were well run and profitable, in
aggregate they showed increasing losses througn 1980.  Since then, as a result
of certain interim measures taken by the Government, primarily relating to
liberalization of output prices, the profitability picture has changed
significantly, and the SEEs are expected to show an overall net profit of
nearly TL 46 billion in 1982. Wnkat has not happened, however, is any major
improvement in SEE efficiency. With prevailing SEE output prices in many
cases well above competitive world levels, the burden of economic and
technical inefficiency is merely being reallocated from the budget to
customers and the private sector generally. The majority of the problems
afflicting the SEEs arise from the fact that while the enterprises have been
organized as economic entities with the objectives of efficiency, productivity
and profitability, they are subject to constant intervention of the Government
in pursuit of different and often conflicting objectives. The causes of poor
performance include price controls, uneconomic investments, overstaffing, lack
of autonomy, frequent changes of management, inadequate salaries for
managerial and technical staff, excessive centralization of decision making
and a confusion between economic, social and political goals.
1.04     The Government has given considerable thought to the problem of
reforming the SEEs since 1980. After a long process of deliberation, a
comprehensive SEE Reform Decree was issued on May 20, 1983. The decree
creates a Supreme Board of Coordination for all SEEs headed by the prime
minister and includes most ministers concerned with economic affairs. The
decree also removes SEEs from civil service salary regulations and, in effect,
repeals law 440. The transitory provisions contained in the Decree permit
continuation of the old regulations until new regulations are drawn up and
waile, theretore, the Aeform Decree is yet to nave any effect, it appears to
be a step in the direction of effective reform.
C. DYB - The Institution anad its Role
1.05     DYB was establisned in 1964 under Special Law 441 to provide
long-term credits, guaraatees and other services to SEEs. As a State Economic
Enterprise itself, DYB was also subject to provisions of Law 440. DYB's
parent ministry is the Ministry of Finance. Its authorized capital is TL 43.0
billion which is fully paid in and held entirely by the Treasury as of
December 31, 1982. DYB takes lending decisions under guidelines laid down in
Law 441, which are basically indicative. DYB functions within the complex
administrative procedures for provision of investment funds to SEEs. As
already mentioned, the SEEs submit their projects and financial requirements
to SPO in July every year. SPO consults the Planning Council and the Ministry



of Finance, and by the end ot the year the Government approves the Annual
Investment Program. DYB participates in the deliberations in an aavisory
capacity. The Sk.Es can then approach 0YTh for funds within the allocation made
under the Annual Investment Program and submit their project feasibility
studies, etc. for appraisal. DYB is empowerea to reject or modify projects it
finds unacceptable, but until 1980 suen projects could be implemented by the
SEEs from funds made available by the Government through the budget. This
direct access to the Treasury by SEEs, and possibillty of bypassing DYB if
necessary, coupled with the fact thiat DYB does not have resources to finance
more than a small proportion of the SEEs' investment programs, diminished
DYB's role in SEE financing and prevented  TYh from exercising real influence
over its borrowers.
1.06     Until a few years ago, the resources of the DYB were obtained mainly
from tne issue of bonds with maturities of 20 years and a fixed interest rate
of 20 percent, which were subscribed by Social Security Institutions and by
Retirement and Pension Funds. With the rise of inflation, the interest rate
of such bonds became highly negative in real terms and the financial situation
of the Social Security Institutions deteriorated sharply. These interest
rates were raised in 1981 to 30 percent, on the basis of subsidies granted by
the Treasury, but they continued to be insufficient. The DYB has also used
some foreign credits, mainly from the World Bank and the European Investment
Bank. The exchange risks are borne in full by the SEEs to which the funds are
lent. The main problem of the DYT is the scarcity of additional financial
resources to satisfy the demand for new investment credits from the SEEs. The
Social Security System and the Pension and Retirement Funds, after the losses
they have suffered, are not interested and have not the capability of
increasing tneir portfolio of bonds from iJYB. At the same time, the access to
toreign credits has been limited. To provide the DYB with funds for new
operations, the Treasury nas granted it two loans of TL 40 billion each, in
1981 and 1982 respectively, with maturities of 30 years and an interest rate
of 10 percent. This reflected the Government's policy of channelling all
investment funds to SEEs through DYI, rather than lending them directly, in
order to improve project evaluation and execution.
D. Loan Features
1.07     Loan No. 10 24-TU for $40 million was approved by the Board on
June 2U, 1974, signed on June 28, 1974, and became effective on
Septemaber 30, 1974. The loan was made to DYB with the Guarantee of the
Government at an interest rate of 7 1/4Z p.a. The foreign exchange risk was
born by the sub-borrowers.  As this was the first Bank loan to DYB, there was
no free limit, i.e. all subprojects under the loan required Bank prior review
and approval. The last date for subproject submission was set at November 30,
1976, and extended once to February 28, 1977. The closing date, originally
set at December 31, 1978, had to be extended several times, and the loan was
finally closed on March 31, 1981. On that date a balance of $262,401, which
remained unutilized, was cancelled.
II. OBJECTlVES
2.ul     The bank considered the improvement of the investment process as the
main objective of the loan to DYB. It was felt that the investment decisions
ot the SEEs needed to be overviewed, and their management and efficiency in



- 4 -
operation upgraded. In the case of some public sector units (steel, newsprint,
fertilizers) this was to be achieved through direct lending. It was expected
tnat the sAme objectives could be reached for a large number of small- and
mediumrsized SEE projects by approaching them through a DFC. DYB was already
established in the field, and it was identified as the agency through which
the Bank would seek to achieve this objective. The logic of such a move was
apparent. The public sector in Turkey accounted for almost half the
investment (and half the value added) in the manufacturing sector, and if the
Bank was to be concerned with the allocation of overall investment and the
efficiency of its operations, it could not ignore this large segment of
manufacturing industry without detracting considerably from the effectiveness
of its overall lending to the country. Besides providing an opportunity for
an institution-building role, such Lending could also be expected to provide,
through direct contact, a better perception of the worKing of (and
relationships within) the public manufacturing sector in the country.
2.02     After the investment projects of SEEs were included in the annual
investment program, DYB appraised those submitted to it for financing, putting
emphasis on checking the technical, marketing and financial aspects, and
rejecting projects which were not considered sound. The Bank accepted this as
a useful check to ensure that projects financed by DYB were designed to make a
positive financial contribution in the public sector. The DYB/SEE
relationship had traditionally not been aimed at reform or improvement in the
SEEs nor to have gone into areas of management quality and previous project
implementation performance of the SEEs sponsoring the projects submitted for
financing. It was, therefore, a second objective of the loan to help DYB to
play, in respect of small and medium size projects, the same role the Bank
played in directly financing and molding large industrial projects.
2.03     The third objective of the loan was to strengthen DYB's institutional
capability and financial structure to enable it to acquire the capacity to
bring about improvements in the operations and financial performance of its
industrial SEE borrowers.
2.04     The fourth objective, as with other line-of-credit operations, was to
support economically and financially viable medium-size projects in Turkey,
using DYB as an intermediary institution.
2.05     Though these objectives, as stated above, were rather ambitious, it
was recognized that an overall change in objectives and practices would be
very difficult to achieve immediately. Emphasis was therefore placed on the
following measures. Firstly, by an informal arrangement DYB was to receive
sumiaries of investment proposals from the SEEs at the same time these were
submitted to SP0, and DYB was to be consulted and participate in an advisory
capacity in the process of formulation of the annual investment program.
Secondly, the subprojects financed would have to be of a size amaller than
projects which would normally call for a direct appraisal and financing by the
Bank. Bank funds would have to represent at least 152 of the total investment
cost of each subproject so that the Bank's participation would be substantial
enough to warrant the type of effort required from DYB. Thirdly, a much
greater emphasis was to be placed on improving the quality of DYB's appraisals,
especially with regard to assessing the managerial and financial capability of
the sponsoring SEEs. Finally, for Bank financed projects, DYB was to extend
its supervision throughout the life of the subloan. It was clearly recognized



thac the Bank would have to reach understandings witn the Government that DYB
would be allowed to function along these lines in reality, and that such a
change could only be applied on a limited scale initially. The first loan to
DYB was, therefore, clearly understood to be of an experimental nature.
III. ATTAINMENT OF OBJECTIVES
A. Institutional Objeccives
3.01     The Bank's main objective, which was to improve the resource
allocation process and the management efficiency of projects ia the public
sector by lending thtrough DYB, met with very limited success under the loan.
The characteristics of the InstiCutLonal situatLon, environment and practices
prevailing in Turkey constrained progress in this direction, especLally as
during the ten years that had elapsed between the setting up of 1Y3 ana the
Bank loan, DYB was not being consulted on the choice of nubLic sector
investments (though it did have the right to reject investment proposals
submitted to it for financing wnich it considered unsound) and was not allowed
to exercise the rights ot the financier to ensure tnie efficient management of
the enterprLses to which it lent. This system similarly inhibited progress in
achieving the second objective of enabling DYJi to play, in respect of small
and medium sized projects, the same role the Bank played in large projects.
In retrospect, it would appear that the rigidity of the SEE system and the
ramifications of any attempts to make significant changes were underestimated
and that these issues needed to be addressed at the macroeconomic level,
rather than under a loan to an institution which was itself only a small part
of the system.
3.02     The objective of strengthening DYB's institutional capabilLCy adLd
tinancial structure was achieved to a moderate degree. Since DYB was
permitted Dy its law to issue bonds without being restricted by the amount ot
its capital, a debt/equity covenant had not been included in the first bans
loan. Instead, a debt service coverage ratio, to be minimum of 1.3:1 was
stipulated. DYB stayed well above this limit throughout the loan utilization
period and also thereafter. DYB's equity base was strengthened from
TL 1.9 billion as of December 31, 1974, and was gradually increased by
additional capital increase and also accumulation of reserves to TL 3.1 billion
as of December 31, 1979, and then to TL 43.3 billion. However, due to rapid
devaluation of the Turkisn Lira over the perLod, the increase in $ equivalent
terms was not substantial.
3.U3     The task of building up DYb 's institutional capacity by building up
its professional staft was more difficult but has now (by 1983) met wLth
greater success. DYB is permitted to engage proiessional pruject appraisal
staff on contract basis, though tne number and contract compensation for such
personnel nave to be approved by the Finance ttinistry. TDe number or such
staff increased from 18 in 1974 to 4b in 1979 and 97 by end-1962. Salaries ot
conLract personnel increased by an average of 35A up to 1982 (i.e., at a rate
well below the increase in cost of liviag) and were doubled in 1982. The loss
of professional staft has been checked for the present and DYB's appraisal
capacity has been stabilized at a fairly acceptable level.



3.04     In addition to its normal project financing activity, DYB has also
built up its capability for training of its own professional staff and
tecinical staff of SEEs to a considerable extent. DYB now conducts, on a
regular basis, 4 - 5 courses a year of 4 - 6 weeks duration on project
analysis and implementation. Staff from SEEs participate in these courses
along with DYB staff. DYB has acquired, under UNDP and OECD technical
assistance grants, adequate training materials and seminar facilities for
these courses. This training functions of DYB, while being necessarily
secondary to its major activity, is of considerable long-term importance and
is being perrormed with success.
B. Subprojects
3.05     As regards subprojects financed, the loan was comouitted on time and
the subprojects met the criteria regardiag size of projects and of subloans.
ex ante rates of return were also acceptable. The performance of the
subprojects, which are all in operation now, is discussed in chapter IV of
this report.
C. Follow-on Projects
3.06     By 1976, when the Government's request for a second line of credit to
DYB was being considered in the bank, the difficulties in achieving desired
progress on the main objectives of the first loan, as well as the modest
success in building up DYB, was apparent. Nevertheless, it was recognized
that broad institutional changes could not be immediate, and a better approach
would be to seek incremental changes in DYB itself and in its roLe in the
planning and investment process in the public sector. Duriog the first loan
an improvement in appraisal standards of DYB had been achieved. This was
further pressed in the second loan (loan No. 1379-TU) and additional require-
ments were stipulated at formalizing DYB's advisory role in the preparation of
the Annual Investment Program, broadening the scope of its audit and
strengthening DYB's influence over its subborrowers by having subloan
agreements signed with the project entities (establishments) as well as the
sponsoring SEEs.
3.07     The second loan is still not fulLy disbursed, but experience by 1979
showed that there had not been adequate progress. Consequently, when the
request for a third loan was received, the Bank informed the Turkish
Government that "the role of DYE within the system involving SPO, the Treasury
and the SEEs, for the consideration and financing of SEE investment projects
is indeed crucial for any future Bank lending relationship with DYB". The
bank asked for a formalization of procedures including DYB's role, domaiu, and
relationship with SPO and the Treasury on one hand and tee SEEs on the other.
The Bank stated: "'We hope tnat assurances retarding the above actions
ensuring that DYE in future years would be given full responsibility as the
development bank of the public sector, can be given soon." There was an
internal Bank decision not to make any further DFC line of crea.c type of
loans to DYE unless the above assurances werc received.
3.08     In the wake of the economic crisis of l979/8O, the need for urgent
Bank assistance to the SEE sector was apparent. At the same time.
institutional reforms necessarily had to take a lower priority. therefore the
third bank loan to DYs (loan No. '998-TU) was designed in a basically different



manner as compared with tne tirst two loans. DYB was asked to produce a list
ot subproject proposals (23), wnich was narrowed down to a short list of 11
projects.  The Bank appraisal mission jointly appraisea these projects along
with DYB staff with particular emphasis on their economic merit and included
six ongoLn6 completion/rehabilitation and oalancing projects in the loan. In
effect the lo-in was wnade to DYB, but for a preselected group of high-priority
subprojects, preselected by the bank, which DYB could not change. This loan
thus had none of the typical features of the previous two line-of-credit
operations, and succeeded, as warranted by the acute economic crisis, in
funding the completion of economically viable projects and in intiating
specific managerial and operational improvements in the SEEs so financed. At
tUe same time, the Government committed itself to carry out an indepth study
of DYB's future role in all iCs facets, in cne context of the reform/
reorganization of SEEs, thus maintaining pressure for institutional reforms.
The loan itself is in its initial stages of utilization while the study has
not begun, pending the issuance of the SEE Reform Decree.!/
3.09     In the meantime DYB management displayed considerable initiative and
interest in reviewing DYB's role. In 1981-82, an in-depth study of charters
of public sector DFCs was made and charges in DYB's Law were proposed for
consideration by the Government. Tne major changes proposed by DYB aim at
empowering DYB to (i) appraise the entire SEE, and not merely the investment
project submitted; (ii) supervise its borrowers throughout the life of its
loans; (iii) pay market salaries to its professional staff; and (iv) to take
equity positions and nominate representatives to SEE boards. The proposed
cnarges closely parallel the Bank's views on changes necessary to strengthen
DYB's role and are presently under Government consideration. If enacted, they
would strengthen DYB's role considerably.
IV. SUBPROJECTS FINANCED
A. Description
4.01     Loan No. 12U4 was utilized to finance 11 medium-sized investment
projects sponsored by six SEEs - Sumerbank (5), SEKA (2), AZOT (l), PETKIM
(1), SEKER (1) and Etibank (1). A list of subprojects is attached as
Annex I. The largest subloan was for $7.92 million (Sumerbank - K. Maras
Cotton Textile Project) and the smallest for $1.84 million (Sumerbank -
Erzincan Cotton Textile Project). The average size of subloans was $3.97
million.  The subloans represented at the then prevailing exchange rate of TL
13.5U = $1.00, between 59% and 8X of the total investment costs of the
projects.  The entire loan amounted to about lb% of the total investment cost
of tne subprojects. These percentage shares very rapidly became meaningless
with the successive devaluation of the TL during the implementation of the
subprojects.  At the present exchange rate of TL 206 = $1.00, the loan would
be equal to TL 8.2 billion, which is 90% of the total investment cost of the
ten subprojects.
B. Performance
4.02     The subprojects were in the textile, chemicals, fertilizer and
plastics, ceramics, sugar and pulp and paper subsectors. These subsectors
11 This is now expected to commence as the SEE Reform Decree has been issued
on may 20, 1983.



- 8 -
provide a relatively comprehensive coverage of SEE activities. A number of
general conclusions can be drawn from the performance of these subprojects,
which are now all in operation. These are: Ci) Almost all the projects
suffered slippages in their completion dates and consequent cost overruns due
to resource constraints; (ii) they were the usual capital-intensive and
import substitution type of investments of projects often taKen up by SEEs;
(iii) the ex ante ERR estimates made by DYB during project appraisal were
over-optimistic, and the projected returns did not materialize due to
difficulties and delays in subproject implementation and also due to failure
to achieve the backward and forward linkages assumed to be achieved, and                   t
finally, (iv) capacity utilization and revenue assumptions made by DYB were
optimistic. Details of subproject performance are provided in Annex II.
C. Quality of Appraisal and Supervision
4.03     As can be assumed from the previous account of the performance of the
subprojects, DYB's project appraisal quality was uneven. However, the poor
performance of the subprojects cannot be attributed to poor quality of
appraisal alone. The increasing strain on the Turkish economy and the price
controls under which the SEEs operated in that period, also were major factors.
DYB did improve the coverage of its appraisals by including data on past
working and financial operations of the sponsor SEE in its appraisals, and its
methodology of ERR calculation was improved gradually by repeated discussions
with Bank staff.  In sum, all tne ills of the SEE system, compounded by the
economic situation, resulted in under-achievement of one of the objectives of
the loan - to finance economically viable subprojects.
4.04     DYB's project supervision effort did improve during the loan
implementation. Each Bank-financed subproject was visited by DYB staff at an
average interval of about 14 months during its construction phase, which is a
much better record than in case of projects financed by DYB out of its own
resources. Despite agreements reached during loan negotiations, DYB's
supervision does not extend beyond the construction phase even at present, as
the SEEs have consistently resisted DYB's requests for progress reports after
project construction is complete. The proposed changes in DYB's Charter
(para 3.09) will enable DYB to improve the depth and scope of its clients
further.
v. DYB: OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
A. Loan Operations
5.01     DYB approvals, co  itments and disbursements from 1974 - 1981 are
shown in Annex III. DYB's operations are an integral part of the Annual
Investment program of the SEEs laid down in the Annual Development Plan and,
therefore, projecting DYB's operations in isolation and comparing its actual
operations witti the projections has always been a difficult exercise. It is
more meaningful to examine the number of new projects appraised each year by
DYB and to look at the share of DYB financing in total investments of SEEs
each year.

5.02     DYB's share in SEE investments can be seen to have fluctuated widely
according to funds made available to DYB by the Government. DYB was unable to
raise resources independent of budgetary allocations, as its onlending rates
were fixed by the Government at negative levels in real terms (DYB's bonce
issue rate of 20Z + 1-1/2% spread). This has been and continues to be the
major factor inhibiting steady growth of its operations.
5.03     In real terms, DYB's disbursements during 1981 have barely recovered
to the 1974 level.

5.04     A detailed breakdown of DYB's loan approvals by sector, geographical
location of projects and loan maturity is provided as Aanex IV. Since DYB
does not have a specific resource allocation role among industrial subsectors
or responsibility for geographical dispersal of industry, the breakdown does
not disclose any particular trend. DYB loans are predominantly long-term.
Over 90% of loan approvals are for a term exceeding 10 years.
B. Operational Results and Financial Position
5.05     DYB 's Income Statements and isalance Sheets for 1974 - 1981 are
attached as Annexes V and VI. DYB's profitability has been consistently high.
The net profit before tax averaging 36.3% of equity over the last eight
years. DYB has also managed to keep its administrative expenses to less
than 1Z of its total assets during the period. Its liquidity has been sound,
the current ratio being above 1.7 at all times. DYB has no debt/equity ratio
ceiling, but the actual debt/equity ratio has declined steadily since 1977 to



- 10 -
a normal (for DFCs) level of 8.8:1 in 1981.  Overall the picture is of an
institution with sound financial management. The arrears situation as ot
December 31 of each year from 1974 to 1981 is presented in Annex VII.
Significant ratios from the above statements are presented in Annex VIII. DYB
loan arrears as of end of each year are adjusted against disbursements to the
defaulting borrowers in the subsequent year. The level of arrears does,
therefore, not enable an assessment of the quality of DYB's portfolio, but
rather a partial picture of inter-SEE debt arrears.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
6.01     In making the first loan to DYB in 1974, the expectation that the
Bank's association with DYB would help reform SEE and the public sector
investment allocation process was more important in the Bank's perception than
the transfer of funds or the addition to industrial capacity. As discussed in
Chapter III, it has been evident that the characteristics of the institutional
situation, environment and practices prevailing in Turkey constrained progress
in achieving progress in this direction.
6.02     After one further attempt under loan No. 1379-TU, it was realized
that the reform of the SEE system was a much more important and complex task,
which could not be achieved by building up DYB alone. In fact, improvement in
DYB's internal institutional capability has occurred, but it has been unable
to bring its capability to bear on the problems of SEEs due to its being
itself a part of the system. This issue had to be taken up at a policy
dialogue level. The completely different design of the third DYE operation
(Loan No. 199o-TU) was a result of this conclusion and represents a
transitional approach. The key issue of reform of the SEE system, as well as
of DYB's role within the system, is now being addressed by the Bank as a part
of the dialogue under Structural Adjustment Loans and specialised Technical
Assistance. In view of the inertia of the SEE system in Turkey, its long
history and tradition of centralized decision-making, the limited results
achieved under the first loan were therefore not surprisiag. Tne fact that
DYB has gradually built its professional capacity, should be seen however as a
positive result. It is too early to envisage what effect the recent SEE
Reform Law will have on the relationship of the Bank with DYB and the Bank's
approach on financing of SEE investment projects if so requested by the
Government. It is clear however that only a more autonomous and responsible
DYB would enable efficient channelling of Banks funds to SEEs in future.
