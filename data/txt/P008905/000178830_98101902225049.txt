REPORT AND RECOMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO THE DEVLET YATIRIM BANKASI OF TURKEY
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY
FOR A PUBLIC SECTOR INDUSTRIAL CREDIT LOAN
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Devlet Yatirim Bankasi (DYB) (State Investment Bank) for the equivalent
of US$40.0 million to help finance public sector industrial sub-projects. Amor-
tization would conform substantially to the aggregate of the amortization sched-
ules applicable to the specific investment projects financed out of the proceeds
of the loan. The interest rate would be 7-1/4 percent per annum. The loan would
be guaranteed by the Republic of Turkey.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report (316a-TU) entitled "The Economic Development of Turkey" in
five volumes dated April 22, 1974 was distributed to the Executive Directors.
Country data sheets are attached as Annex I.
3.        Following a decade of stability in Turkey, student disturbances and
unrest among workers appeared in 1970, accompanied by party disagreements, and
in March 1971 the armed forces obtained the resignation of the Government and
called for the formation of an "above-party" and reformist Government. There
followed a succession of short-term Governments. In early 1973 a new Presid-
ent of the Republic was elected by the Parliament. Subsequently, martial law
was ended, and in October parliamentary elections were held. In a shift to
the left of center, the Republican People's Party won a plurality and formed
a coalition government in January 1974 with the National Salvation Party.
The new Government's program stresses reconciliation of the political dif-
ferences of the recent past, increased equity, social justice, and adherence
to moral values, control of national resources, broader popular participation
in economic activity, and improved planning and efficiency. Its specifics in-
clude a general amnesty, tax reform aimed at greater progressivity, and meas-
ures to promote cooperatives and a more dynamic capital market. While retain-
ing most of the essential objectives of the Third Plan, the program places
increased emphasis on the role of the public sector, especially in industry.
4.        Growth in gross national product in the last decade was high and
continuous, averaging about 6.9% per year in the period 1962-72, with gross
investment increasing as a share of GNP from 15% to 20% and gross national
savings from 11% to 18%. Since 1970, however, the shares of investment and
gross national savings have decreased slightly.
5.        The main growth sectors in the last decade were industry, power,
transport and construction. This reflected the development strategy during



- 2 -
the first and second five-year plans (1962-72), which gave highest priority
to industrialization. Industrial output grew by about 10% per annum, with
textiles, machinery and equipment, steel and chemicals providing the main im-
petus. This rapid growth, mainly to meet domestic demand and replace imports,
was largely insulated from foreign competition. Other rapidly growing sectors
were trade and financial services. Agricultural production had a trend growth
rate of about 3.5% per annum, with fluctuations from year to year depending on
weather conditions. The share of industry in GDP rose from 17% in 1962 to 23%
in 1972 and that of agriculture dropped from 39% to 28%. Growth in 1971-72
was above average. In 1971, GNP increased by 10% in real terms, with value
added in agriculture increasing by more than 11%, thanks largely to an excel-
lent harvest, a sharp rise in workers' remittances and continued industrial
growth. In 1972, GNP increased by 7.7%, with value added in agriculture not
increasing over the 1971 level, but with a 12% growth in industry, fast growth
in transport, construction and trade and another sharp rise in workers' remit-
tances. Preliminary estimates for 1973 indicate chat GDP increased by about
6.4% in spite of a severe drought which led to an 8% decrease in agricultural
value added.
6.        The balance of payments situation was characterized in 196,'-70 by
increasing trade deficits, and a strict systern of import controls which led
to shortages of essential imports and, consequently, to under-utilization of
production capacity. The overvalued official exchange rate was changed in
August 1970 from TL 9 to Tl 15 per US$ and revised to TL 14 in December 1971.
This,together with associated stabilization measures, rising world demand
and prices and a rapid rise in workers' remittances (from $140 million in
1969 to $740 million in 1972) helped to improve the situation dramatically.
Commodity exports increased by about 23% per annum in 1971 and 1972, with
agricultural exports (mainly cotton, tobacco, hazelnuts, raisins and fruits
and vegetables) increasing by about 22% per annum and industrial exports
by an unprecedented 55% (mainly in food and beverages, textiles, hides and
leather products and petroleum products). The improved foreign exchange
position also led to a high import growth of 28% per annum, mainly itn invest-
ment goods and raw materials (machinery and equipment, transport, steel and
other metals, chemicals and fertilizers). Tourism receipts, although still
relatively small, doubled between 1970 and 1972. The improvement in the
balance of paymnents continued into 1973, with exports and imports of goods
increasing by 49% and 34% respectively over 1972. Workers' remittances reached
an estimated $1.1 billion. The overall result was a continuing increase in
gross official foreign exchange reserves, whiclh stood at $2.1 billion at the
end of 1973. Net foreign assets, which had been negative in 1966-63, rose to
about >1 billion, i.e. about 6 months of imports. One of the contributory
factors to the rising foreign exchange reserves was the inflow of short-term
capital (with convertible lira accounts rising from $70 million at the end
of 1970 to a peak of $480 million in April 1973) which was subsequently
restricted by the Government. I May 1974, the lira was revalued vis-a-vis
the dollar to TL 13.5 per US$ while its previous parity vis-a-vis other
currencies was maintained. This action was taken to adjust to previous parity
changes made vis-a-vis the dollar by Turkey's major trading partners.



- 3 -
7.        The budgetary situation in the last decade was dominated by the
relatively rapid growth of public expenditures. Although tax revenues grew
rapidly, their share in GNP rising from 12.9% in 1962 to 17.9% in 1972, the
increase was more than offset by the rise in current expenditures and trans-
fers. The overall budget deficit increased and was particularly large in
1971 when the full impact on current expenditures of overdue public salary
increases was felt. The Treasury had growing recourse to the Central Bank
for short-term advances and to other short-term borrowing. The difficulties
facing public mobilization of resources led to public investment expenditures
falling short of targets, and to an actual decline in public fixed investment
in real terms in 1971. In 1972 and 1973, Central Bank financing of the Treas-
ury was reduced considerably as a result of a strict control of current expend-
itures and a sharp increase in the sale of Government bonds to TL 4 billion
(0.8 billion in 1971). Public investment also recovered, increasing by 19%
in 1972.
8.        Inflationary pressures have appeared in the economy in recent years,
as expenditures, fueled by rapid monetary expansion, grew more rapidly than
available resources. The GNP price deflator increased by about 6% per annum
during 1967-70, and accelerated to 18% and 14% in 1971 and 1972 respectively.
Excess demand was created in this period by rapidly rising workers' remit-
tances and convertible lira accounts; by substantial deficit financing by
the public sector which, however, was strictly checked in 1972 and 1973;
and by rising private investment demand. Prices of imported goods rose as
a result of the 1970 devaluation, the subsequent depreciation of the lira,
and rising world export prices. The rate of inflation increased to about
20% in 1973 as the same pressures persisted and intensified. In these cir-
cuilstances, effective demand management should be a major concern of economic
policy. Improved mobilization of resources by the public sector will be needed
to finance growing public investments. It will be essential to develop the
capital market to supplement existing sources of long-term domestic borrow-
ing. Proposals for a capital market bill are now being considered. In ad-
dition, revisions in the interest rate structure to ensure a reasonable real
rate of return are needed to encourage private savings. Further liberaliza-
tion of imports to improve the competitiveness of domestic industry and re-
duce the inflationary growth of foreign exchange reserves is also desirable.
9.        Development strategy has emphasized the growth of output and labor
productivity rather than employment. As a result, the labor surplus, includ-
ing estimates of labor surplus in agriculture, rose from about 1 million in
1962 to 1.6 million in 1972, i.e., about 11% of the labor force. Emigration
has so far greatly eased the pressure on employment. Between 1965 and 1972,
net emigration amounted to about 400,000 and was expected to be about 70,000
per year during the Third Plan period (1973-77). The Third Plan continues
the emphasis on investment in capital-intensive industries and projects a
growth in non-agricultural labor surplus by another 300,000 by 1977. With
the added effect of a slowdown in Europe on employment of Turkish workers
(paragraph 14), unemployment should be a major concern of economic policy.



- 4 -
Speedy implementation of land reform and integrated rural developmerLt pro-
grams would help to dampen the migration from rural to urban areas. In ad-
dition, labor intensive methods need special emphasis in the choice of proj-
ects. H1owever, even with tLese measures and faster growth than planned in
construction and services, urban unemployment is likely to remain a serious
problem.
10.       The prospects for continued high economic growth are good. The
Third Plan constitutes the first phase of a long-term strategy for the period
1973-95, the ultimate objective of which is to raise Turkish standardls of
living to those of Italy in 1970 through rapid industrialization and decreas-
ing dependence on external resources. The Third Plan targets are an. 8% GDP
growth rate, a 10.7% fixed investment growth rate, a marginal savings ratio
of 38% on national savings (compared with about 18% in the Second Plan), com-
modity imports and exports growing at 9.4% and 7.1% respectively and a decline
in gross inflows of official external assistance to $130 million in 1977 (comn-
pared with over $300 million in 1972). Workers' remittances are estimated in
the Plan at $600 million at constant 1971 prices in 1977.
11.       A detailed analysis of these targets is presented in the basic eco-
nomic report. The general conclusion is that, though the prospects for a growth
rate of 7% are good, the Plan projections seem to underestimate the difficulty
of raising the savings level and balancing the external accounts at a reduced
level of external assistance.
12.       The Plan anticipates that two-thirds of the increase in national
savings will come from the public sector through large increases in tax re-
venues and in surpluses of the State Economic Enterprises (SEEs). Given the
past performance of SEEs and delays in implementing a general reforti,, the
expected rapid growth in their surpluses does not appear feasible. It will
also be difficult to raise tax revenues to the extent implied by the Plan,
but there is scope for a smaller increase if vigorous policies are pursued,
e.g., further improvements in tax administration and effective collection now
under way, widening the tax net to cover agricultural incomes, increases in
the rates of property taxation, introduction of a value-added tax and liberal-
ization of imports to offset tax losses due to import substitution and reduc-
tions of custom duties under the EEC agreement. The problem of domestic
resource mobilization by the public sector is therefore likely to remain a
constraint in the growth of public investment, and, apart from improved SEE
performance, higher external borrowing and policies to increase long-term
,domestic borrowing from the private sector would be necessary to achieve the
ambitious investment targets.
13.       On the external side, the Plan projections have been overtaken by
events, and commodity imports and exports in 1973 are likely to have been at
about the level projected for 1977. Workers' remittances in 1972 were already
higher than the 1977 target. However, their future was made uncertain by the
decision of the Federal German Government in November to temporarily prohibit
further entry of foreign workers from non-EEC countries because of the energy
crisis. It remains to be seen what course this policy will take over the



- 5 -
longer run. The emphasis on capital intensive industrial development and
the rise in the prices of imported fuel and raw materials will require a
more rapid import growth rate, especially since the import regime is likely
to be more liberal than in the past. Exports, particularly of industrial
commodities, should continue to show good growth unless inflation continues
at high rates, which would erode the competitive advantage gained as a result
of the 1970 devaluation and the subsequent depreciation of the lira vis-a-vis
Turkey's main trading partners in Europe. Gross official external inflows of
the order of $500 million a year may be required.
14.       At the end of 1972, total external debt outstanding and disbursed
was $2.5 billion, of whichi all but 3% is public or publicly guaranteed. The
share of the Bank Group in total debt outstanding was 8.3% in 1972 and is ex-
pected to rise. The average terms of new credits have been hardening in re-
cent years and this trend is expected to continue. Of the total gross offi-
cial external assistance of about $380 million in 1972, the Consortium mem-
bers provided an estimated $220 million.    Of this about $58 million came from
the United States, $44 million from the Federal Republic of Germany, $35 mil-
lion from the Bank Group, $27 million from the European Monetary Agreement
(EMA) and $22 million from the United Kingdom.    The USSR disbursed $113 mil- 
lion. As a result of increased remittances and other foreign exchange earn-
ings, and successive debt reschedulings and other arrangements for debt relief,
the debt service ratio fell considerably from 24% in 1964 to 10.2% in 1972
and dn estimated 7.6% in 1973 and is likely to remain at about this latter
level in the medium-term. However, in view of the uncertainties surrounding
remittances and oil prices, Turkey should continue to exercise great care
in its external debt management, including restraint in its resort to suppliers'
credit financing.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONIS IN TURKEY
15.       During the lengthy period of chronic balance of payments difficul-
ties before the 1970 stabilization program and devaluation of the Turkish
lira, Bank lending was only intermittent. Since then, rapid improvement in
the balance of payments and in creditworthiness has made possible a large
increase and continuity in Bank/IDA lending, which in FY71, FY72 and FY73
amounted to $114 million, $173.3 million, and $175 million respectively.
In these three years sixteen lending operations were carried out, of which
five were in agriculture, four in industry (including DFCs), three in power
and the rest in urban development, transportation, and vocational education.
Agriculture accounted for 30% of the funds lent, and industry and DFCs for
nearly 40%. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits
and IFC investments as of April 30, 1974, and notes on the execution of on-
going projects. Implementation of projects in the private sector has been
satisfactory; on the other hand, projects in the public sector - especially
those breaking new ground in agriculture - have been seriously affected by
political instability and resulting administrative problems, and disburse-
ments have been much slower than expected. A comprehensive review of the
problems besetting these projects has been started with the new Government.



16.       In view of the sustained improvement in the balance of paymients
situation, no further IDA lending is contemplated. Bank lending is being
increasingly directed to support Turkish efforts to improve: (a) lagging
public sector saving through financial and management reform of the State
Economic Enterprises (SEEs); (b) distribution of income and living standards
in an economy entering its second decade of roughly 7% yearly growth, through
more attention to employm,lent in investment projects, more concerted rural de-
velopment efforts, and better urban planning; and (c) long-term capacity to
earn foreign exchange, through diversification, especially promotion of in-
dustrial exports and tourism. Bank lending for the Turkish Industrial De-
velopment Bank (TSKB) and Fruit and Vegetables emphasizes exports; a Bank
tourism project identification and preparation missions have recently visited
Turkey.
17.       While the focus of Bank lending is on supporting the institutional
and structural changes noted above, continuation of recent levels of lending
is also important in view of the increase in projected capital import require-
ments. As discussed in Part I, Turkey's Third Plan goals of an 8% growth rate
and increasing competitiveness withi the EEC in preparation for eventual full
membership require further import liberalization and higher external borrow-
ing in the near term. Under contemplated lending, the shares of IBRD/IDA in
total debt outstanding and in total debt service are likely to remain under
20% and 25% respectively through the 1970s.
18.       In supporting the broad objectives of improved SEE performance,
better distribution of welfare, and diversification of external earning ca-
pacity outlined in paragraph 17 above, it is planned to continue concentrat-
ing the bulk of Bank lending (a) in industry (including mining and DFCs),
where financial and management strengtheniing of SEEs is the key task, and
(b) in agriculture, where rural development, employmuent, and institution
building are the main focus. This core of the program will be supplemented
by repeater loans for railways and selected loans for power (which also cen-
ter on financial reform of state enterprises), follow-up lending for urban
development in Istanbul and possibly in Izmir in support of the second ob-
jective, and by lending in tourism. Bank lending has thus far been geograph-
ically focused mainly in the Istanbul region, with emphasis on urban develop-
ment and industrial finance, and in the Cukurova region around Adana on the
southern coast, with emphasis on power, irrigation and fruit and vegetables.
This pattern is likely to broaden in pursuit of the second objective, with
wider lending in the Anatolian plateau and eastern Turkey in response to
the Government's effort to widen the geographic base of development, dis-
courage too rapid urban migration, and improve the distribution of income.
Continued selective lending to the TSKB is also contemplated, with emphasis
being placed increasingly on encouraging TSKB to broaden its private sources
of capital and to step up its efforts to finance private investment in the
poorer regions of Turkey.
19.       With regard to public sector reforms, past Bank lending for power
over the course of several years helped bring about a comprehensive reorgan-
ization of the power sector including the creation of the Turkish Electricity



- 7 -
Authority (TEK). A proposed Bank loan for the Elbistan project is intended
to continue support for TEK's long-term reform objectives and to establish
a Bank working relationship with TKI in the coal mining sector. The Antalya
Forest Utilization Loan (957-TU) aims to strengthen the State Pulp and Paper
Enterprise (SEKA) in its overall investment planning as well as to promote
effective financial management in the proposed new mill subsidiary at Antalya.
The proposed industrial credit loan to the State Investment Bank (DYB), the
Government's main lending institution for public sector enterprises, would
aim to strengthen DYB's role in financing small and medium-sized SEE indus-
trial projects. The Bank is also considering a loan in FY75 to a public sec-
tor project for iron mine expansion and pelletizing at Divrigi in east central
Turkey, which will be complementary to the Erdemir Steel Expansion (817-TU)
and to modernization of the Railways (893-TU), which are heavily engaged in
ore traffic. Divrigi and Elbistan also represent greater geographic disper-
sion into lower income regions.
20.       The Bank's main effort in support of the distribution objective is
the twin strategy of promoting rural alternatives to urban migration and im-
proving urban development. As a beginning in rural development, the Bank ap-
proved a credit in FY72 for the Second Livestock Project, which focuses on
fodder cropping and breeding, raising and fattening of animals in Eastern
and Central Anatolia. For FY75 the Government is preparing an integrated
Rural Development Project in rainfed areas of central Turkey. The Forestry
part of the Antalya Forest Utilization Project should also make a signifi-
cant contribution to rural employment through expanded cutting, reforesta-
tioin and afforestation. Future lending for rural development in forest village
areas is also contemplated. In urban development the Bank lent for Istanbul
Water Supply and Urban Studies in FY72 and for Istanbul Power Distribution
in FY73. A second Urban Studies project is being prepared for FY75, and fur-
ther infrastructure lending in support of better planning and coordination
of development in Greater Istanbul and possibly in other cities is anticipated,
should the institutional objectives underpinning earlier projects in Istanbul
be satisfactorily attained.
21.       As a result of the expanded membershiip of the Common Market and
some leveling off of bilateral aid, the European Investment Bank (EIB) has
become along with the Bank Turkey's major source of external finance on non-
commercial terms. The Bank has developed informal cooperation with EIB in
the past, for example, in related but not formally parallel lending last year
to the Turkish Railways and to TSKB. The Antalya Forest Utilization Loan
represents a further step into formal joint financing with EIB, and we anti-
cipate continuing a close partnership in the proposed Elbistan Lignite Power
Project and in other future large-scale projects as appropriate.
22.       The Railways and Antalya Forest Utilization Projects also exemplify
the Bank's continuing collaboration with UNDP. In both projects UNDP financed
the feasibility study for which the Bank acted as executing agency with the
help of outside consultants. In addition, UNDP is financing further railway
technical assistance studies which form an integral part of the implementa-
tion of the project. In 1973 UNDP financed a study of forest industries in



the Marmara region of Turkey to help define a larger study recommended for
inclusion in the Antalya Forest Utilization Project. The Bank is also col-
laborating with UNDP and FAO in the preparation of the Rural Development
Project noted above, with UNDP in a tourism study, and collaboration is
anticipated on other projects in the future.
23.       IFC has been active in Turkey, having participated in investments
for nylon yarn, pulp and paper, glass, aluminum, steel pipe, and tourism.
Total commitments so far amount to about $44 million. IFC is currently in-
vestigating new investment opportunities in various sectors, including tex-
tiles and synthetic fibers.
PART III - TIIE STATE ECONOMIC ENTERPRISES SECTOR IN TURKEY
24.       Modern Turkey has developed as a mixed economy since the early days
of the Republic and the State Economic Enterprises (SEE's) have become the
principal mechanism for managing public sector economic activity. In the
productive sector, SEE's dominate electricity, petroleum refining, steel,
nitrogen, paper, rail and air transport, shipping and communications, and
play an important role in textiles, cement, coal, sugar, machinery, and
chemicals. SEE's are also important in finance, and hybrid organizations
like Etibank in mining and Sumerbank in textiles, ceramics, etc., act as
holding companies and as lenders for their operating subsidiary "establish-
ments". The Agricultural Bank and the State Investment Bank (DYB) are SEE's
created to finance SEE investments generally in agriculture and industry.
While the primary purpose of SEE's is production and finance, they lhave
also been charged with various social goals such as development of backward
regions, absorption of manpower, and mainitenance of price stability, which
have tended to become a hidden financial burden.
25.       The overall financial results of the more than 100 State Economic
Enterprises (SEEs) have been consistently poor, but there are sharp differ-
ences among them, with railways and coal being the major losers and manufac-
turing showing improving profits. The SEEs now account for about 20% of the
fixed investment in the economy and about 10% of value-added. However, since
1969 the average rate of return on investment for the 28 largest producing
SEEs has been less than 3% despite subsidized interest rates averaging about
4%. Losses in some enterprises and low profits in others have necessitated
increasing budgetary transfers to meet current and investment needs; such
transfers amounted to about TL 3.5 billion in 1971 and TL 6 billion in 1972,
which was about 12% of total Government expenditures that year.
26.       The Third Plan projects an SEE investment growth rate of 11.5% and
provides that SEE investments should stress new technology, external economies,
natural monopolies, and complementarity with private initiatives. Reform of
the SEEs - in organization, management, executive and labor skills, and pric-
ing policies - is especially important to prepare Turkish industry for compe-
tition that will arise from the EEC. Prices of some SEE's were raised in 1971



- 9 .-
and again in early 1974 to improve their financial situation. Measures agreed
upon in connection with Loan 893-TU have begun to lead to improvement in the
financial situation of the railways; and the Antalya Forest Utilizat-ion Loan
(957-TU) provides for establishment of the Antalya mill on a sound commercial
basis. The new Government has underlined the need for reform in its program,
and has already raised the output prices of several SEE's to bring them more
into line with costs.
PART V - THE PROJECT
27.       A detailed description of the proposed project is given in the report
entitled "Appraisal of the Devlet Yatirim Bankasi of Turkey", Report: No. 406b-
TU, dated June 10, 1974, which is being distributed separately. A Loan and
Project Suummary is attached as Annex III.
28.       Che proposed project was appraised during two missions to Turkey,
in November 1973 and January-February 1974. Negotiations took place in
Washington in May. The Government was represented by Mr. Muammer Akinci,
Chief Counselor for Financial and Economic Affairs of the Turkish Enmbassy and
DYB by Mr. Zeki Dosluoglu, Deputy Managing Director.
General
29.       The project consists of a relending operation by DYB for about 8-10
sub-projects in public sector industry over a period of two years. Sub-projects
would involve total investment costs of about $7-40 million each and would thus be
small- and medium-sized projects within DYB's context. Sub-loans financed by
the Bank would cover foreign exchange costs in a range of about $1-E million
per sub-project. Sub-projects will be primarily in manufacturing, heavy industry
and processing, with possibly one or two in non-fuel mining. They will be drawn
largely from DYB's 1974 program of 37 industrial projects, many of which meet
proposed lending criteria and are being appraised by DYB.
30.       The project would be the first DFC operation with DYB and would seek
to provide a sound basis for continued Bank lending to DYB for relenlding to
industrial SEEs and encouragement of improved SEE performance. DYB's role
in financing SEEs has traditionally not included encouragement of reform or
improved performance beyond a check on the financial and technical viability
of investment proposals submitted for financing. For example, admir,istrative
and financial management of SEEs or their subsidiary establishments has not
been the subject of DYB's loan negotiations. Project supervision typically
does not extend beyond the construction period. One of the purposes: of the
proposed loan would be to encourage and assist DYB to strengthen its appraisal
and supervision, and to play a broader part in investment decisions and reform
in the public industrial sector.
31.       DYB's Organization and Resources. DYB was created in 1964 to pro-
vide to SEEs long-term credits, guarantees, and other services (excluding
equity investments). DYB is managed by a Board of five directors, three of

whom are DYB's general manager and two deputy general managers; the other
two are appointed by the Council of Ministers upon nomination of the Minister
of Finance. DYB's staff includes 58 professionals; high calibre andt low turn-
over have been achieved through recruitment based on competitive examination,
use of contract hiring at higher salaries for appraisal staff, and extensive
training abroad. The Finance Ministry is DYB's parent ministry and owns 100%
of DYB's share capital. Most of DYB's lending resources are raised ihrough
sale of long-term bonds to the Pension Fund and Social Insurance Corporation.
Except for financing DYB will receive through the Government from the Bank
and from EIB for financing the Antalya integrated pulp and paper miiL, the
proposed loan would be DYB's first foreign borrowing operation.
32.       DYB's Policies and Procedures.   DYB is required by law to appraise
the technical, economic, and financial aspects of proposed projects, but the
law is silent regarding sponsoring SEE's and establislhments, and DYI; has not
appraised t:hem. Thus DYB does not reject financially sound projectE- because
of deficiencies in the sponsoring organization and it does not reject a proj-
ect on purely economic grounds. DYB's appraisal nf the technical ar,d financial
soundness of projects seems satisfactory, and a substantial proportion of the
applications it receives are rejected or returned for project revision. Under
the Lending Policies and Procedures set out in Schedule 3 of the Loani Agreement
DYB has agreed to improve its economic analysis and appraise the sponsor's
ability to help finance, implement and operate any sub-project to be considered
for financing under the proposed loan. DYB has also agreed to review the
borrowing SEEs' procurement procedures (which appear to be satisfactory) to
ensure procurement at reasonable prices and quality.
33.       When approving a new investment project, DYB does not comnmiLt the
entire amount of financing it expects to lend although it considers :its ap-
provals as a nominal commitment to finance along the lines of the appraisal.
In practice, DYB lends only for projects included in the Annual Inve<,tment
and Financial Program prepared by the SLate Planning Organization and makes
a financing commitment for disbursement during the year only against the
"annual tranche" required under the Annual Program for a given project.     As
in the case of financing for the industrial part of the Antalya Forest Util-
ization Project, DYB has agreed to enter into formal financing commitments
to sub-project sponsors for the full loan amount, although the Annual Pro-
gram and tranche procedure will also be followed. DYB's disbursemer,t pro-
cedures, which normally provide for reimbursement, are generally satisfactory;
collection procedures are adequate. The law safeguards completion c,f projects
by requiring DYB to supervise through the end of construction; supervision of
operations over the remainder of the life of DYB loans is implicitly left to
High Control Board audits. For sub-projects under the proposed loan, DYB has
agreed to extend its normal supervision to cover the life of each sub-loan.
DYB has agreed to pass on to its sub-borrowers the full foreign excl.ange risk
under the proposed loan.
34.       DYB's Operations.   During the period 1969-73, DYB financed 24% of
total investments made by operating SEE's. Of the TL 12.2 billion in new
projects approved in 1971-73, 41% was in manufacturing, 47% in power and



- 11 -
telecommunications, and 12% in mining, transportation, and agriculture.
The principal manufacturing sub-sectors were iron and steel, pulp and paper,
and chemicals and fertilizers in that order. The average size of the 50
loans approved in 1971-73 was TL 245 million; for industrial loans che aver-
age was TL 176 million ($12.6 million). There has been no particular pattern
of geograplhic distribution since SEE's are widely dispersed as a result of
government regional development and social policy.
35.       Relending Terms.   Over the past three years DYB's loan maturities
for its lending overall have averaged about 10 years including usuaLly 1-4
years' grace. Under the proposed loan for financing in the industrial sector,
the maturities of sub-loans are expected to average about 12-15 years. The
current normal DYB interest rate on long-term loans (which is subject to
approval by the Treasury) is 10-1/2% per annum; a rate of 9-1/2% is offered
for infrastructure projects and certain industrial projects of long gestation.
There is no commitment fee, but DYB charges a 1-1/2% penalty on the delinquent
portion of the loans. DYB's lending rate is considerably below market rates
in Turkey, reflecting in part a subsidy corresponding to certain non-economic
objectives of SEE's, but high enough, coupled with DYB's borrowing rate of
9%, to cover expenses plus a small margin. DYB's normal rate will apply
to sub-projects under the proposed loan.
36.       Financial Performance . Except for the year 1970 when it incurred
a substantial exchange loss on debt which it had assumed at the timf! of its
founding from predecessor organizations, DYB has regularly slhown a profit
before taxes, and the average has been about 12% on average equity in recent
years.  Administrative expenses are relatively low, 0.04% of total assets in
1972. In addition to statutory reserves, DYB currently sets 2% of loans
outstanding as extraordinary reserves and has been authorized by the Treasury,
pending full payment of share capital, to convert net earnings into paid-in
capital.  DYB's record of collections has been reasonably good and has improved
the past two years, with only 2% of total portfolio principal overdue at the
end of 1973. However, seven SEE's have been delinquent in the past. Several
SEE's have had to obtain Treasury's assistance directly, or indirectly, to
service their DYB loans; DYB has never rescheduled nor written off any of its
loans. DYB's provisions and reserves seem adequate in light of the Level of
arrears.
37.       Creditworthiness.   DYB's risk exposure seems to be very smiall because
the Ministry of Finance ensures each year that the Government's annual program
of financing for SEE's(from all sources including the Treasury) provides fi-
nancing to cover every SEE'sdebt service obligations to DYB. As of the end
of 1973 the long-term debt-to-equity ratio was about 8:1. If unpaicl authorized
capital, for which the Government is fully liable, is included in e(quity, the
ratio becornes 5.3:1. If, in addition, deposits of the Central Bank, which
have been with DYB since its founding and may reasonably be regarded as
permanent funds, are included, the ratio becomes 3.2:1. At the end of 1973
the ratio of loan collections to debt payments was about 3:1, a safe margin.
DYB has agreed in the Loan Agreement to maintain this ratio at a leirel of at



- 12 -
least 1.3:1 and to take necessary corrective measures whenever the ratio
appears endangered. On this basis, DYB is considered suitable for Bank fi-
nancing.
38.       Audit.  Under the law governing SEE's, DYB is audited annually by
the High Control Board (1ICB), an arm of the parliament. HCB audits cover
comprehensively such topics as administration, personnel, and legal aspects of
DYB. DYB hlas informally informed the Bank that the HCB's audits wiLl include
an assessmant of DYB's portfolio and an opinion on DYB's provisions for
losses.
39.       Future Operations and Resource Needs. Based on Third Plan invest-
ment targets for producing SEEs and continued financing by DYB of about one-
fourth of the SEEs' requirements, the Bank projects DYB annual lending (com-
mitments to disburse) to double from about TL 3.8 billion in 1973 to about
TL 7.6 billion in 1977. The bulk of the resources required to finance this
inicreased lending in 1974-77 would colle as in the past from bond saiLes and
miscellaneous sources. Since resources from social security and pension
funds may not be sufficient to cover DYB needs, resources will have to come
from other official assistance (e.g., Treasury or Central Bank).  In the past,
foreign exchange costs have averaged about 45% of total SEE project costs,
whichi suggests an uncovered foreign excnange component requirement of about
*300 million for 1974-75.
40.       The Proposed Loan. The amount of $40 million for the proposed loan
is small as compared with estimated requirements for the next two years. The
amount is adequate to finance, as proposed, about 8-10 industrial sub-loans,
each of about $1-6 million. DYB staff appears able to undertake the supple-
mentary work required for expanding its appraisals of sub-projects t:o be
financed under the proposed loan. Sub-loans would normally represent at
least 15 percent of total sub-project cost. Activity would be concE!ntrated
in a few SEE's. No free limit is proposed since DYB needs experience in
evaluating sponsoring organizations and economic benefits. In reviEwing each
of the sub-loans submitted for approval, the Bank will pay particular attention
to DYB's treatment of these aspects.
41.       Projected Financial Performance. As a result of increased finan-
cial expenses related to increased borrowings, DYB anticipates a dip in its
rate of ret:urn to about 97% in 1974, but forecasts a rebound to the previous
average of about 12% in 1975 and higher rates in subsequent years as opera-
tions grow. Debt service coverage is projected at 2.3-3.3 times through 1977.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
42.       The draft Loan Agreement between DYB and the Bank, the draft Guar-
antee Agreement between the Republic of Turkey and the Bank, the Report of
the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles
of Agreement, and the text of a Resolution approving the proposed loan are



- 13 -
being distributed separately to the Executive Directors. The draft agree-
ments conform to the normal pattern for loans for development finance com-
panies. Schedule 3 to the Loan Agreement contains the lending policies and
procedures for the project.
43.       I am satisfied that the proposed Loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
44.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed Loan
and Guarantee Agreements.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION -/
Ln. No. 568 Keban Transmission Lines Project; US$25.0 Million Loan of October
31, 1968. Closing Date: March 29, 1974. Progress on this project was in-
terrupted for about a year in 1970/71 by a dispute between the Turkish Elec-
tricity Authority (TEK) and the principal contractor concerning payment of
the increased cost of the project, following the devaluation of the Turkish
lira. The matter was resolved through arbitration and TEK is now carrying out
construction using its own staff. A revised construction program indicates
that one circuit, Keban to Istanbul, should be completed by the end of June
1974, in time for start-up of the first units at Keban. The remainder should
be completed by August 1974. It is expected that the residual amount of the
loan will be disbursed by July of this year.
Ln. and Cr. Nos. 587/143 Second Seyhan Irrigation Project: US$12 Million Loan
and US$12 Million Credit of February 20, 1969. Closing Date: June 30, 1975.
The project is making satisfactory progress with exception of land leveling
which will not be completed by the present closing date. Because of high
cotton prices, project farmers prefer not to make their lands available for
leveling. Yields of wheat and seed -cotton, the principal crops, reached re-
cord levels in 1972/73. A large part of this success can be attributed to the
efficient working of the project extension service which was set up for the
first time in Turkey to integrate the various extension service activities in
the project area under a full time extension service manager with sole respons-
ibility for the project. Coordination of irrigation and drainage works, on-
farm development and the extension service has been achieved by a project
coordinating committee representing the concerned Government agencies.
Ln. Nos. 713 and 873 TSKB (Industrial Development Bank of Turkey): US$40
million loan of November 27, 1970 and US$40 million loan of December 28,
1972. Closing Dates: June 30, 1975 and December 31, 1976 respectively.
Since the first Bank loan was made in 1950, a satisfactory relationship has
been developed with TSKB. These loans when fully disbursed would brLng total
Bank Group lending to TSKB to $168 million.   The standard of TSKB appraisal
work is consistently high and sub-projects submitted for Bank approval are
well prepared. Progress is being made towards more regionally even distribu-
tion of investments.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any prob-
lems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding
that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths
and weaknesses in project executions.

Cr. No. 236 First Livestock Project: US$4.5 million credit of February 22,
1971. Closing Date: June 30, 1975. Implementation of this project was de-
layed initially by difficulties encountered by the Turkish authorities in
fulfilling some of the effectiveness conditions under the Credit Agreement
and by administrative problems in hiring the necessary staff for the project
unit. These delays were largely due to the absence, following a reorganiza-
tion of the Turkish Government administration in March 1971, of an effective
coordinating link between the various ministries concerned with the project
and between the Government and the Bank Group. Steps have been taken to
correct this deficiency and progress on the project is now satisfactory.
Ln. No. 748 Education Project: US$13.5 million loan of June 9, 1971. Closing
Date: September 30, 1976. The execution of the project has progressed slowly,
due to the weakness of the Project Unit which has been handicapped by a lack
of staff and authority commensurate with its assigned responsibilities. As a
result, the project is over a year behind schedule for civil works and equip-
ment procurement. Until now no disbursement applications have been made.
A cost overrun of about 30 percent is expected for civil works for the Manage-
ment Institute and the six Adult Training Centers included in the project.
A recent supervision mission provided assistance in preparing architectural
briefs and has submitted several suggestions to strengthen the Project Unit,
streamline its operations and ensure that specialists' assistance is available
as and when required to expedite its work. Action is now being taken towards
correcting operational deficiencies, and significant improvements are expected
in project implementation over the next three months.
Ln. and Cr. Nos. 762/257 Fruit and Vegetable Export Project: US$10 million
loan and US$15 million credit of June 22, 1971. Closing Date: June_30, 1976.
This project was also delayed by difficulties in meeting some of the conditions
of effectiveness by the due date for the reasons noted under Cr. 236 above.
Progress on 3 of 5 major project components is now satisfactory (refrigerated
trucks, ferry boats, marketing facilities). New approaches are envisaged to
encourage citrus production, the fourth component; the fifth, the agricultural
credit survey, is more than a year behind schedule and will need a special
effort by the Government if it is to produce meaningful results.
Ln. No. 763 TEK Power Transmission Project: US$24 million loan of June 22
1971. Closing Date: March 31, 1975. Implementation of this project has been
delayed by shortage of staff. First contracts were awarded early in 1972 and
work is now progressing according to the revised schedule. Problems in meet-
ing the financial covenants are under discussion in connection with the pro-
posed Elbistan project.
Ln. No. 775 Fourth Cukurova Power Project: US$7 million loan of June 30, 1971.
Closing Date: March 31, 1975. The project is well advanced but the benefi-
ciary, Cukurova E.A.S., has indicated that approximately US$0.5 million will
be needed to meet additional remaining foreign expenditure commitments, which
they expect to obtain from local sources.

Cr. No. 281 Irrigation Rehabilitation Project: US$18 million credit: of
January 25, 1972. Closing Date: June 30, 1977. Civil works are well under-
way after a slow start. On-farm development is progressing with the receipt
of part of the new equipment, but is still lagging behind schedule and will
necessitate an extension of the credit closing date. Appointment of consult-
ants for the Extension Service and Topraksu is taking longer than anticipated.
Ln. No. 817 Steel Mill Expansion Project: US$76 million loan of April 28,
1972. Closing Date: December 1976. As a result of procurement problems
and ineffective management, the project is about one year behind schedule.
Past efforts to improve the organization have been relatively unsuccessful,
but additional steps are now being taken and the prospects for strengthened
project management capability have now risen. Hlowever, prospects for subs-
tantial cost overruns are high, and steps are being explored for obt:aining
required overrun financing from Government sources.
Ln. No. 844 Istanbul Water Supply Project: US$37 million loan of Jun1e 30
1972.  Closing Date:  June 30. 1977.   This loan was made effective on January
5, 1973 after some delays. Reasonable progress is being made by DS1 on source
development facilities, but the Istanbul Water Authority (ISI) has delayed
the engagement of engineering and management consultants. Very little progress
has been made so far on the ISI component of the project. The Government re-
cently approved substantial water rate increases.
Cr. No. 324 Istanbul Urban Development Project: US$2.3 million credit of
June 30, 1972. Closing Date: June 30, 1977. This credit was made effective
on January 5, 1973. Four consultant groups started work between November 1973
and February 1974. Work on Waste Water and Traffic Engineering and Control
Projects is proceeding satisfactorily. The Wholesale Market Complex will have
to be rescheduled due to questions about site suitability.
Ln. No. 845 IGSAS (Istanbul Fertilizer Company) Project: US$24 million loan
of June 30, 1972. Closing Date: June 30, 1976. This project was declared
effective on October 6, 1972. Progress in implementation is now prc,ceeding
satisfactorily following earlier delays in procurement. As a result: of the
tight supply situation of equipment and general price increases, the project
is likely to have a cost overrun.
Cr. No. 330 Second Livestock Project: US$16 million credit of September_28,
1972. Closing Date: December 31, 1976. There have been delays in setting
up the project's organization mainly because of lack of action on the proj-
ect's personnel budget. Steps have recently been taken which should correct
this situation.
Ln. and Cr. Nos. 883/360 TU, Ceyhan Aslantas Multipurpose Project: US$44
million loan and US$30 million credit of March 22, 1973. Closing Date:
December 31, 1981. The loan/credit was made effective as of March 20, 1974.
Construction underway thus far includes the access road to the camp site at
Aslantas dam, campsite buildings and some irrigation and drainage works on
the left bank of the Seyhan river. Energo project has been appointed as
engineering consultant for the Aslantas Dam and Power plant. Contracts for
on-farm development equipment have been awarded.

Ln. No. 892 Istandul Power Distribution Project: US$14.0 million loan of
May 25, 1973. Closing Date: December 31, 1976. The project has been delayed
by the failure to appoint consultants to complete the project studies and
designs. The General Management study is in progress.
Ln. No. 893-TU Turkish State Railways: US$47 million loan of May 25, 1973.
Closing Date: September 30, 1976. After initial delays, procurement of
track material and other Bank-financed items is now progressing satisfactorily.
TCDD's locomotive production has fallen considerably behind schedule, however,
and this may adversely affect the project in the long-run if production prob-
lems are not resolved by the remedial measures being undertaken. The comple-
tion of tariff reform studies has also been delayed and the Government has
requested that the date for their completion be extended.
Ln. No. 957-TU Antalya Forestry Project: US$40 million loan of January 28,
1974. Closing Date: December 31, 1978. Because of delays in the execution
of the conditions for effectiveness, including the completion of the Subsidiary
Loan Agreement, the date of effectiveness has been extended from April 29,
1974 to July 15, 1974. Implementation of the project is also being delayed
by the issue of plant site acquisition and by problems in the hiring of con-
sultants for forestry development and studies. Measures are being taken to
resolve these problems.
Technical Assistance Project - Turkish Electricity Authority (TEK): US$1.9
million grant of August 20, 1967. Technical assistance contracts covering
the second phase of the work were terminated in November-December 1972.
Achievement, though short of target in some respects, is generally satisfactory
and TEK now has a much improved accounting, budgeting and financial reporting
system. Reorganization of TEK based on the consultants' report concerning
organization structure is under way. Proposals for the last phase of the
work are under discussion with the Turkish authorities.
