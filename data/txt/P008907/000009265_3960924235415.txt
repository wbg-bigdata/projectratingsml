ELBISTAN PROJECT (LOANS 1023-TU AND 2650-TU)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Evaluation Summary
Introduction
Two loans, 1023-TU for tlS$148 million in 1974 and 2650-TU for US$10
million in 1986, were made for the development and commissioning of the Elbistan
Lignite Mine and Power Station. They were respectively, the tenth and eighteenth
Bank group operation in Turkey's power subsector, and were a continuation of the
Bank's assistance, started in 1952, for developing the subsector and increasing
utilization of indigenous resources.   Loan 1023-TU was made jointly to the
Turkish Electricity Authority (TEK) and the Turkish Coal Authority (TKI), Loan
2650-TU only to TEK. Both loans were guaranteed by the Republic of Turkey.
Objectives
The principal objectives of the Elbistan project were: (i) to expand
power generation based on indigenous resources through construction of a 4 x 300
MW lignite-fired power station and development of an open-cast lignite mine with
a production capacity of 20.7 million tons per annum; and (ii) to support reform
of TEK in the areas of organization, management, personnel and finance, in the
context of the Governments aim of SEE reform.
Implementation Experience
Project implementation, originally expected to be completed in 1981,
was not completed until the end of 1988. While technical problems contributed
to this delay, the most important factors were: (a) the unsatisfactory contract
management arrangements, (b) the institutional weakness of TEK and TKI;
(c) inadequate site management and insufficient delegation of authority from
headquarters to the site; and (d) acute TL shortages on the part of TEK, TKI
and the Government. TEK and TKI suffered from serious shortages of good quality
staff, cumbersome bureaucratic regulations and procedures, and a poor financial
position. Given their lack of experience with projL ts of this magnitude and
complexity, project management should have been entrusted from the start to a
company with a proven track record in this field. As none of the domestic firms
would have qualified, this would have involved recruitment of a foreign company,
but would have required a change of attitude of both the Government and the
institutions concerned, and a substantial modification of their regulations and
operating procedures. By 1978, the severe shortages of local currency had become
sufficiently serious to impede project implementation and by 1980, the main co-
lenders, KfW, EIB and the Bank, insisted that both TEK and TKI appoint expatriate
management  teams.    Two  German  companies,  employed  in  1981,  proved  very
satisfactory and this was probably the single most important factor in improving
project implementation. From mid-1982, progress was satisfactory and the first
unit went into commercial operation at the end of December 1984.  In 1986 the



- iii
Bank made a follow-up loan (2650-T'J) to complete the project and ensure its
adequate operation and effective maintenance. KfW and EIB also made additional
funds available.
Project Results and Sustainability
Completion of the project, although much behind schedule, has
provided Turkey with the means of utilizing some of its substantial deposits of
low grade lignite for power production. However, during the seven-year delay
in completion of Elbistan, other major power plants have been constructed, such
as the Karakaya hydropower station (1,800 MW) and the combined cycle power
stations at Hamitabat and Ambarli (2,700 MW), erected after conclusion in 1986-
87 of an agreement with the Soviet Union for the supply of natural gas. As a
result, Turkey presently has excess power generation capacity and Elbistan,
which was conceived as a base-load plant at a time of power shortages and rapidly
increasing demand for electrical energy, is not being fully utilized to planned
levels.  In the longer run, it should find a role by economic c3mparison with
new generating units. However, the power production cost at Elbistan includes
the cost of lignite which TEK pays TKI, which includes a very large element ot
fixed costs, while the economic cost to the country is low.   TEK's power
dispatching program, therefore, should be revised by ranking generating plants
on the basis of economic costs rather than financial costs because, unless
utilization of Elbistan is at a high level, the project is unlikely to generate
an acceptable level of net economic benefits during its useful life.
Tie production capacity of the mine has yet to be tested, because
during 1987, 1988 and the first half of 1989 the Elbistan power plant was run
at less than full capacity, since 1987 and 1988 were very good hydrological
years and production of hydroelectricity was much above average.   Due to low
water availability for hydro-generation, utilization increased in the second half
of 1989, but since the beginning of 1990 the plant is once again being run with
a low capacity factor.
The project fell short of its objectives in several other respects.
Much remains to be done to transform TEK and TKI into efficient and financially
viable entities. TEK's financial position, which had improved in the mid-1980s,
has since deteriorated and tariffs have again fallen below economic levels.
Because an appropriate technology could not be readily fotnd, TKI decided (and
the Bank agreed) not to proceed with the installation of a plant to produce
lignite briquettes as domestic fuel.   Consequently,  the anticipated economic
benefits attributed to the sales of lignite as domestic fuel could not be
realized.
The estimated 3.4% rate of return of the project falls far short of
the 17.6% estimated at appraisal because of a number of factors -- the most
important being the long delay in completing the project and the huge cost over-
run.  Other factors were the deletion of the domestic fuel production plant,
the over-estimate at appraisal of the likely power plant availability factor of



- iv -
74% (compared with a maximum of 65% now forecast) and tariffs being below
economic cost. Unless TEK's power dispatching program is changed as noted above,
plant utilization, and the rate of return, will be even lower.
Appropriate environmental protection measures have been taken.
Pollution control equipment was installed in the power station.   The maximum
pollution recorded to date is in compliance with the levels permitted by Turkey's
environmental standards. All effluents are being appropriately treated. Good
progress has been made in pl.anting trees as part of a land reclamation program.
Conclusions
The unsatisfactory project management arrangements during the first
seven years of project implementation, and the institutional and financial
problems pervading TEK and TKI, were the main contributory factors to the
project's poor implementation record. Moreover, the design of the lignite mining
equipment (bucket wheel excavators) and of the boilers to burn the poor and
variable quality lignite was based on experience with low grade lignite
elsewhere,  but had never been tried under Turkish conditions.   One of the
consequences, inter alia, was that major modifications had to be made to the
boilers after commissioning. Continuing technical problems are being experienced
in operating the power plant, mainly because of the highly variable calorific
values and ash content of the lignite supplied by the mine, understaffing of
the plant, operating errors of poorly trained staff, unsatisfactory maintenance
procedures and unavailability of spare parts.   The most startling finding,
however, is that the Elbistan project, an investment of US$2.5 billion
equivalent, is being operated at less than full capacity and does not have a
well-defined role in meeting Turkey's power requirements. Therefore, four major
conclusions based on or concerning this operation are that: (i) the Bank should
participate only in projects of tried technology and with fully satisfp'tory
project management arrangements; (ii) the initial project analysis was weak, in
that the role of the plant in Turkey's bulk supply system was overestimated, and
the plant conceived was too large (for example, it could have been limited to
two units to begin with, rather than four); (iii) subsequent system expansion
planning was also inadequate, in not making sufficient allowance for the Elbistan
base load capacity; and (iv) there may be a need for the Bank to continue its
supervision efforts beyond physical project completion to .ensure project
sustainability.

ELBISTAN PROJECT
(LOANS 1023-TU AND 2650 TU)
PART I
1.    Project Identity
1.01        Two loans, 1023-TU in 1978 and 2650-TU in 1986, were made for the
development and Commissioning of the Elbistan Mine and Power Station.   This
report deals with both loans in the context of a single project.

2.    Background
2.01        The Government's development strategy during the first and second
Five Year Plans (1962-1972) gave high priority to industrialization and self-
sufficiency. Over that period, industrial output had increased at an average
of 10% p.a. As a result the share of industry in GDP had grown from 17% in 1962
to 23% in 1972. During the same period the urban population rose from 28% to 36%
of the total population.   This combination of rapid industrialization and
urbanization resulted in a correspondingly rapid increase in electricity demand
of about 12% p.a. This led to electricity shortage in 1972 and 1973, since the
generating program had not kept pace with demand.
2.02        The prospects for continued high economic growth were considered good
and the target for the third Five-Year Plan was a GDP Growth rate of 8% p.a.,
with continued emphasis on industrial investment. Total power generation of the
Turkish Electricity Authority (TEK) was projected to grow correspondingly by an
average of 14.7% p.a. over the next 10 years.   In 1973,  imported oil and
traditional fuels (firewood and animal dung) met about two-thirds of Turkey's
energy requirements. The country's energy development strategy was to meet the
rapidly increasing demand while reducing the relative dependence on these high
cost sources.  This objective assumed increasing importance with the increase
in world oil prices in 1972.
2.03        The overall financial results of State Economic Enterprises (SEEs)
-were consistently poor, with the Turkish Coal Authority (TKI) being one of the
poor performers.   SEE's low profits necessitated increasing budgetary transfers
to meet their current and investment needs.  Reform of the SEEs by improving
their organization, management, executive and labor skills and pricing policies
was urgently needed.
3.    Pr2ject Qbjectives and Description
3.01        The Elbistani project supported the twin objectives of the sector
development strategy of expanding power generation and increasing utilization
of  indigenous  resources.    In addition,  it was  intended  to  support  the
GovernLment's aim of SEE reform by continuing to assist TEK's long-term reform
objectives and establishing a working relationship with TKI. The project
comprised:



- 2 -
(a)   a thermal power  station with  four  300 MW  lignite-fired units
delivering, after meeting the power station and mine loads, an
estimated 1048 MW and 7030 GWh/year to TEK's interconnected system;
(b)   380-kV transmission lines, about 540 km long, connecting Elbistan
with Kayseri and Ankara;
(c)   an open-cast lignite mine with a capacity of 20.7 million tons p.a.,
17.9 million for the power station and 2.8 million for processing
for sale as domestic fuel, including the purchase of the land and
restoration of the worked-out mining area;
(d)   separate permanent housing for power station and mine staff and roads
between these and the works as well as Elbistan town; and
(e)   consultancy services.
4.    Project Design and Organization
4.01        The project was the country's first major effort to build a large
power  project  based  on  its  substantial  lignite  resources.    The  initial
feasibility study was carried out by consultants from the Federal Republic of
Germany (FRG) under that country's aid program. That study indicated that, while
the lignite was of poor quality, because of high ash content and low calorific
value, the project was feasible, and recommended construction of a 600 MW plant.
From the start, the technical difficulties of a project based on lignite of such
poor quality were seen to be potentially problematic. The Bank therefore hired
an Australian consultant, with extensive experience on lignite based power
plants, to review the feasibility study. The consultant endorsed the feasibility
of the project.
4.02        To carry out the engineering studies and design, a consortium of two
companies from FRG and one from France was retained by TEK with German and French
technical aid. These consultants confirmed the feasibility of developing the
project, agreed with the method of excavation (large bucket wheel excavators
(BWE)) proposed by the original consultants, and proposed additional geological
and hydrological investigations. These were carried out, and burnability tests
were conducted on lignite samples.  The reports correctly identified the main
technical problems: (a) design of the boilers to burn the poor and variable
quality lignite, and (b) the mining difficulties due to the high overburden
ratio, low bearing pressures, thin lignite seams with intercalations of hard
material and difficult hydrogeological conditions. Nevertheless, the consultants
recommended increasing the project's output from 600 MW (4x150 MW) to 1200 MW
(4x300 MW).
4.03        The boiler design was based on experience elsewhere with low grade
lignite, but had not been tried under Turkish conditions. BWE's were considered
the most appropriate means of dealing with the difficult ground conditions,
although the units were larger (3000 cu.m/h) than had been previously used.
Pumping wells were to be installed in advance of the mining operations to ensure
adequate dewatering of the strata to be excavated.   The Bank's Australian
consultant and a British mining consultant endorsed the proposals and, by the
time of appraisal, agreement had been reached on the technical design of the
project.



4.04        There was not, however, a similar consensus on the other aspects of
the project - organization, management and finance. The compromises which were
reached on these items were the source of much of the poor implementation record
of the project. During the appraisal process, concern was expressed within the
Bank about the poor implementation record and the current condition of the
borrowers, their staff, organizatici and management, and it was noted that the
long list of covenants might prove ;    quate in reducing the risks, particularly
if there was no major change in t.   ctitude of the borrowers and guarantor.
4.05        The project undoubtedly called for the establishment of a strong
project management team with executive authority and staffed with capable
personnel, experienced in the execution of projects of similar magnitude and
complexity.   Neither TEK nor TKI had staff of this calibre.   The Government
resisted any solution which would bypass TEK or TKI or require them to employ
a suitably qualified construction company, yet it showed little commitment to
the drastic institutional reform required in these entities. TEK and TKI were
given separate responsibilities for the power and mining components,
respectively. Consultants were engaged to assist TEK and TKI's inexperienced
site managers. However, these consultants had no executive authority, and in
practice  their  advice  often went  unheeded.    Moreover,  the  site managers
themselves had little authority and had to refer most problems to Ankara for
decision.
4.06        These project management arrangements reinforced the need for close
coordination of the activities of TEK, TKI and the various government departments
involved, To improve the coordination, a Coordinating Committee, chaired by the
Undersecretary of the Ministry of Energy and with representatives of TEK, TKI
and the Government Departments was established, and an Administrative Committee
formed to facilitate day-to-day decisions. In the event, neither committee was
particularly effective and decisions were often delayed.
4.07        TEK was a young institution whose organization and staffing were
inadequate to handle its increased responsibilities. Its financial position was
poor and it was in breach of existing covenants in earlier loan agreements on
the financial rate of return on its assets, mainly because of failure to increase
tariffs at a time of rising costs. To address these matters, the Loan Agreement
conte.-ed covenants on the staffing and management of TEK and a financial rate
of r  irn on its assets, and a tariff increase acceptable to the Bank was one
of the Conditions of Effectiveness.   Effectiveness was delayed 19 months, mainly
because of the Government's failure to implement the necessary tariff increase,
in spite of the Bank also delaying the presentation to the Board of a subsequent
project.
5.    Project Implementation
5.01        Project construction, which was expected to be completed in
1981, was not completed until  the end of 1988.   While technical problems
contributed to this delay, the most important factors were: (a) the
unsatisfactory contract management arrangements; (b) the institutional weakness
of TEK and TKI; (c) inadequate site management and insufficient delegation of



authority from headquarters to the site; and (d) acute TL shortages on the part
of TEK, TKI and the Governuent.
5.02        Given the lack of experience with projects of this magnitude and
complexity, project management should have been entrusted to a foreign company
with a proven track record in this field. For such a company to be effective,
however, would have required a change in the attitude of the Government and of
the implemenitation institutions concerned, and substantial modification of their
regulations and operating procedures.   The colenders efforts to achieve such
modifications during implementation met stiff resistance from 'he borrower and
the guarantur.
5.03        TEK and TKI suffered from a serious shortage of good quality staff,
partly due to the low levels of pay and morale, and were burdened by cumbersome
bureaucratic regulations and procedures. This was compounded by the isolated
location of the site with poor social and welfare arrangements and totally
inadequate communication facilities.  Both institutions were in poor financial
position, because of the Government's unwillingness to price their products at
economic levels, compounded in TEK's case by its huge accounts receivable --
particularly from the municipalities. These weaknesses were largely typical of
SEEs in general at that time, and it is doubtful if the Government could have
dealt with these two entities in isolation.   The problems facing many SEEs
required drastic measures which the Government was unable or unwilling to take
in the economic and political situation of the 1970s.   Indeed, sixteen years
after appraisal, a complete solution is not yet in sight.
5.04        Inadequate tariffs for power severely constrained TEK in implementing
the project. A serious consequence of the failure to increase tariffs was the
impact on TEK's cash generation which, together with TEK's problems of accounts
receivable,  led to severe shortages of local currency for the project.   The
country's economic difficulties meant that the Government also faced shortages
of foreign and local currency for the project. By 1978 these became sufficiently
serious to impede project implementatio-a.
5.05        By 1980 the situation had become critical due to the cumulative
effect of the above factors. The first boiler was only 15% complete (compared
with a planned 40%), the general contractor's work was 5% complete (cf.24%) and
mining operations were seriously behind schedule, particularly the dewatering
and workshop construction. There were major contractual and labor disputes and
the project faced a projected cost-overrun of about 100%. The main colenders,
KfW, EIB and the Bank, mounted a very intensive supervision effort and insisted
that both TEK and TKI appoint expatriate management teams with extensive
experience in similar work, and vest them with (in practice) considerable
executive authority. Two German companies were employed in 1981, financed by
FRG technical assistance. This had a beneficial effect, and was probably the
single most important factor in improving project implementation. The severe
shortage of local funds was relieved somewhat following the Bank's Structural
Adjustment loans. From mid-1982 progress was more satisfactory, and the first
unit went into commercial operation at the end of December 1984. The other three
units were commissioned in March 1985, June 1986 and November 1988, respectively,
and the present installed capacity is 1,200 MW (4x300 MW). In 1986 the Bank made



- 5 -
a follow-up Loan (2650-TU) to complete the project and ensure its adequate
operation and effective maintenance.   KfW auid ElB also made additional funds
available.
6.    Project Results and Sustainability
o.01         Completion of  the project,  although much  behind schedule,  has
provided Turkey with the means of utilizing some of its substantial deposits of
low grade lignite for power production.   However, during the seven-year delay
in completion of Elbistan, other major power plants have been constructed, such
as the Karakaya hydropower station (1,800 MW) and the combined cycle power
stations at Hamitabat and Ambarli (2,700 MW), erected after conclusion in 1986-
87 of an agreement with the Soviet Union for the supply of natural gas. As a
result, Turkey presently has excess power generation capacity and Elbistan,
which was conceived as a base-load plant at a time of power shortages and rapidly
increasing demand for electrical energy, is not being fully utilized to planned
levels. In the longer run, it should find a role by economic comparison with
new generating units. However, the power production cost at Elbistan includes
the cost of lignite which TEK pays TKl, which includes a very large element of
fixed costs,  while  the economic cost  to the country is low.   TEK's power
dispatching program, therefore, should be revised by ranking generating plants
on the basis of economic costs rather than financial costs because, unless
utilization of Elbistan is at a high level, the project is unilikely to generate
an acceptable level of net economic benefits during its useful life.
6.02         The production capacity of the mine has yet to be tested, because
during 1987, 1988 and the first half of 1989 the Elbistan power plant was run
at less than full capacity, since 1987 and 1988 were very good hydrological
years and production of hydroelectricity was much above average.   Due to low
water availability for hydro-generation, utilization increased in the second half
of 1989, but since the beginning of 1990 the plant is once again being run with
a low capacity factor.
6.03         The project fell stiort of its objectives in several other respects.
Much remains to be done to transform TEK and TKI into efficient and financially
viable entities. TEK's financial position, which had improved in the mid-1980s,
has since deteriorated and tariffs have again fallen below economic levels.
Because an appropriate technology could not be readily found, TKI decided (and
the Bank agreed) not to proceed with the installation of a plant to produce
lignite briquettes as domestic fuel.   Consequently,  the anticipated economic
benefits attributed to the sales of lignite as domestic fuel could not be
realized.
6.04         The estimated 3.4% rate of return of the project falls far short of
the 17.6% estimated at appraisal because of a number of factors --the most
important being the long delay in completing the project and the huge cost over-
run.   Other factors were the deletion of the domestic fuel production plant,
the overestimate at appraisal of the likely power plant availability factor of
74% (compared with a maximum of 65% now forecast) and tariffs being below
economic cost.  Unless TEK's power dispatching program is changed (see para.
6.01) plant utilization, and the rate of return, will be even lower.



-6-
6.05        The project is located in a remote, sparsely inhabited area and
appropriate environmental measures have been taken. Pollution control equipment
was installed in the power station.   Equipment for monitoring the quality of
stack emissions was acquired and should be put in service as soon as possible.
Two ground stations for automatically sampling and recording air quality were
installed and two mobile air quality stations were purchased.   The maximum
pollution recorded to date is in compliance with the levels permitted by Turkey's
environmental standards. All effluents are being appropriately treated. Good
progress has been made in planting trees as part of a land reclamation program.
7.    Bank Performance
7.01        During the preparation and early stages of appraisal  the Bank
performned well and identified the problem areas and risks. In devising solutions
to the problem of project management, the Bank was less successful. It might
have been more forceful and insisted on the appointment of a well qualified,
expatriate project management team, and appropriate changes in operating
procedures. However, this could well have resulted in there being no loan; in
hindsight, that might have been an appropriate decision. The Bank's estimate
of plant availability and assessment of the lignite processing plant were also
too optimistic. During supervision, however, the Bank demonstrated appropriate
flexibility by agreeing to delete the lignite processing plant and to make
additional funds available for completing and commissioning the plant.
Persistent efforts during countless supervision missions and close cooperation
with the colenders were eventually instrumental in providing a solution to the
thorny problem of project management.
7.02        This project illustrates the importance of the Bank, the borrower
and the guarantor being in agreement on the main issues and how to resolve them
before the loan is made. The success of this operation would have been greatly
enhanced if the problems of SEEs had been tackled simultaneously with project
launching, particularly the Personnel Law, revision of bureaucratic regulations
and procedures and action to put the SEEs on a sound financial footing.   If
legislation to this effect had been passed by the Government at the time the
project was initiated, it would have been evidence of the change in attitude
needed to set up appropriate project management arrangements, on which the Bank
should have insisted.
8.    Performance of Borrowers and Guarantor
8.01        The  reluctance  of  the  Turkish  authorities  to  agree  to  the
establishment of effective project management and to increase tariffs or to
tackle the array of institutional and financial problems pervading TEK and TKI
(and other SEEs) were the main contributory factors to the project's poor
implementation record. A particular feature was the lack of coordination and
cooperation, not only among the agencies involved but even within the individual
agencies.   The authorities also failed to make optimum use of the design
consultants during the early stages of construction. They did, however, later
agree to the appointment of expatriate management assistance teams, after KfW,
EIB and the Bank decided co take a strong stand on this matter.



8.02        The project management teams initially established by TEK and TKI
did not perform satisfactorily. The site was visited only periodically by TEK's
project manager, who was located in Ankara. The site manager was inexperienced
and  had  little  delegated  authority.    TKI's  project  management  was  also
ineffective in spite of several changes in senior personnel. Arrangements for
operation and maintenance of the mining facilities were unsatisfactory and
resulted in poor levels of plant availability and output, yet TKI was loath to
enter into maintenance agreements with the plant suppliers. The communications
network was wholly inadequate and delays in decision making were common. Quality
control on civil works was unsatisfactory. Social and welfare facilities on site
were poor and their improvement was much delayed.
8.03        Under the first Elbistan Loan (1023-TU), TEK was to achieve an 8%
annual financial return on the average realistic net value of its fixed assets
in service, but TEK's actual return averaged below 3% during the period 1975-
80.   In 1981, the rate of return covenant was replaced by a cash generation
covenant under the Karakaya Loan (1844-TU), under which TEK's annual internal
cash generation was  to  increase  from  20%  of public  power  sector  capital
expenditures in 1981 to 35% in 1986.   In addition,  to prevent increases in
working capital deficits from counting as a positive element in tuie cash
generation calculation, TEK agreed in 1983 under the Third Transmission Loan
(2322-TU) to maintain a current ratio of not less than 1.0 from December 31,
1984.  Following major tariff increases during the period 1982-84 (during which
TEK did not meet the agreed cash generation targets), TEK did achieve a current
ratio of 1.16 in 1984 and an internal cash generation of 41% in 1985. After a
relatively satisfactory internal cash generation of 31% in 1986, the Bank agreed
to waive the financial covenants until the end of 1987, when TEK's tariffs and
capital were again significantly increased. Since then, however, as a result,
inter  alia,  of  the  Government's  reluctance  to  raise  electricity  tariffs
sufficiently to cover TEK's financial costs and debt service requirements,
internal cash generation has fallen to an estimated -22% in 1989, the current
ratio to an estimated 0.50 at the end of 1989, and the capital increase (which
was not paid uptil 1989) has been eroded by inflation.  1987, 1988 and 1989 were
election years (general, municipal and presidential), and 1988 and 1989 also
years of accelerating inflation, which mav explain why it was difficult to keep
tariffs in line with the rapidly increasing costs. As a result, technically,
TEK has become insolvent. A strategy to put power subsector development back
on track, discussed with the Government in 1989 and 1990, provides for a
restructuring program for TEK under a project which is presently in course of
preparation.
9.    Consultants' and Contractors' Services
9.01        The consultants employed during the feasibility stage performed
well. It could be argued that a project of this complexity was premature given
the stage of institutional development reached by TEK and TKI, but this could
have been resolved with the right project management and contractual
arrangements. The consultants employed for the design performed less well, and
during the early stages of project construction they apparently failed to seek
appropriate remedies when their advice often went unheeded. The problems should
have been escalated to senior levels of TEK, TKI and Government for resolution.
Some of the local contractors performed poorly, producing poor quality work much
behind schedule.   The general erection contractor, whose senior staff lacked



-8-
experience of this kind of work, did not perform well.  To some extent this can
be attributed to the shortages of local funds and delays in payment to the
contractor.  In addition, this was a time of political and social unrest and all
contractors  were  experiencing  labor difficulties.    The project management
assistance teams performed very well.  They exercised their considerable skills
with great tact and contributed greatly to expediting completion of the project.
10.   Conclusions
10.01       The unsatisfactory project management arrangements during the first
seven years of project implementation, and the institutional and financial
problems pervading TEK and TKI, were the main contributory factors to the
project's poor implementation record. Moreover, the design of the lignite mining
equipment (bucket wheel excavators) and of the boilers to burn the poor and
variable quality lignite was based on experience with low grade lignite
elsewhere, but had never been tried under Turkish conditions.   One of the
consequences, inter alia, was that major modifications had to be made to the
boilers after commissioning. Continuing technical problems are being experienced
in operating the power plant, mainly because of the highly variable calorific
values and ash content of the lignite supplied by the mine, understaffing of
the plant, operating errors of poorly trained staff, unsatisfactory maintenance
procedures and unavailability of spare parts.   The most startling finding,
however,  is  that  the  Elbistan  project,  an  investment  of US$2.5  billion
equivalent, is being operated at less than full capacity and does not have a
well-defined role in meeting Turkey's power requirements. Therefore, four major
conclusions based on or concerning this operation are that: (i) the Bank should
participate only in projects of tried technology and with fully satisfactory
project management arrangements; (ii) the initial project analysis was weak, in
that the role of the plant in Turkey's bulk supply system was overestimated, and
the plant conceived was too large (for example, it could have been limited to
two units to begin with, rather than four); (iii) subsequent system expansion
planning was also inadequate, in not making sufficient allowance for the Elbistan
base load capacity; and (iv) there may be a need for the Bank to continue its
supervision efforts beyond physical project completion to ensure project
sustainability.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
TURKEY
ELBISTAN PROJECT
(LOANS 1023-TU AND 2650-TU)
PART II
TEK's Comments on the PCR
In Part I of the project completion report of the World Bank, in
different clauses there are 3imilar comments for certain events.   In this
respect, we will not give our comments paragraph by paragraph, but as general
topics:
1.          During the execution of the project TEK has done its best for the
employment of well qualified personnel and training of them with the facilities
provided by the Government and in accordance with the Turkish Regulations which
TEK has to follow.
2.          In the past there might have been some delays in making the tariff
increases due to certain economic considerations.   However, in recent years
tariff adjustments are being done in a much more effective manner.
3.          In 1988 a reorganization was realized in TEK General Management
except the Generation and Transmission enterprise and the Distribution
enterprises. In August/September 1990 a reorganization was also realized in the
Distribution enterprises as well.   As is known by the Bank, studies for the
restructuring of TK are being continued. A statement made by the Bank in para
8.03 in this respect is not correct. Therefore this statement must be remcved.'/
4.          In various parts of the report there are references to the effect
of the consultants on the completion of the project. We agree with the Bank that
the consultancy services have made certain contributions to the completion of
the project.   However, we are of the opinion that their normal duties as
consultants in this project are being exaggerated by the Bank. In this respect
especially, we have to point out our experience that the interest of the
consultants to the project declined while coming to the end of the project. The
preparation of PCR is a good example of this attitude.
5.          The power plant has been transferred to TEK's Operation department.
Therefore, we kindly request the deletion of the statement to the contrary in
para 8.01.V
6.          Related with the operation and maintenance activities in the power
plant, we want to explain the following points:
a)    In order to have better coal blending, several meetings have
been held with TKI. As a result, a better coal delivery is
being expected in the coming months.
b)    The lack of personnel for the operation has been overcome by
the employment of additional staff as of the end of 1989. A
basic training course was applied to this staff.
Now deleted.



- 10 -
c)    The operation and maintenance work has been done under the
supervision of Steag AG, West Germany as suggested by the co-
lenders.    In  the Afsin-Elbistan power  plant  a warranty
operation has been carried on between the dates of
November 1, 1989 and October 31, 1990 under the full
responsibility of Steag.
d)    The training of the operation personnel is continuing in
accordance with the contract for Technical Operation Management
(TOM) signed between Steag and TEK's Operation Department.
e)    Necessary spare parts for the proper operation of the power
plant have been provided.2/
f)    The  thermal  power  plant  has  been  operated  under  the
responsibility of Steag AG with an availability guarantee of
30% and loading guarantee of 335 MW since November 1989.
7.          The  electricity  generation  program  is prepared  by  TEK's  Load
Dispatching department for the power plants connected to the grid in coordinati.n
with the related departments.
This program is based on the relevant conditions of the system, such
as water levels at the hydro-power plants, yearly overhauling programs of the
power plants, trips and outages, transmission possibilities and especially the
generation costs. In the generation programs, prepared by TEK's Load Dispatching
department, the Elbistan power plant is also shown as a base load plant.
Because of the restrictions on the transmission lines and the high
water level in 1988, the generation of the Elbistan Power Plant was low. Also
at the beginning of 1989, the water input to the area reached up to 150% of the
long-term average. For this reason, the Keban and Karakaya hydropower plants
operated with full capacity and, within the possibilities of the transmission
lines, the Elbistan power plant was also operated with the possible capacity.
In the middle of 1989, the conditions became normal and the generation was
increased from 1947.3 GWh in 1988 to 5650.2 GWh in 1989. For 1990 also, this
same level of generation has been planned: during the first eight months of
operation, the generation was 3100 GWh, and it is expected that the generation
of 1990 will be 5500 GWh.
8.          Erection of the equipment for monitoring the stack emissions will
be completed by the end of September 1990 and it will be commissioned in the
first half of October 1990.
The EMl Energy Operations Division position is that this is not borne out
by Steag's monthly reports (through July 1990).
