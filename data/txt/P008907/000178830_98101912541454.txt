TURKEY
APPRAISAL OF
THE ELBISTAN PROJECT OF THE TURKISH
ELECTRICITY AUTHORITY (TEK) AND TURKISH COAL ENTERPRISES (TKI)
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a Project for the development of an open-cast
lignite mine by the Turkish Coal Enterprises (TKI, the governmental agency
responsible for coal and lignite mining development in Turkey) and of a mine-
based power station (four 300-MW units) and associated transmission lines by
the Turkish Electricity Authority (TEK, the governmental agency responsible
for power development in Turkey) to be located near Elbistan in east-central
Turkey.
ii.       The estimated cost of the Project excluding interest during con-
struction is US$963 million (foreign exchange: US$685 million) comprising
US$658 million for the power plant, US$277 million for the mine and US$28
million for the transmission lines. A Bank loan of US$123 million to TEK
is proposed towards the foreign exchange costs of the power plant and trans-
mission lines and of US$25 million to TKI towards the foreign exchange costs
of the mine. A European Investment Bank (EIB) loan of US$92 million and a
Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (kfw) loan of US$129 million equivalent towards
the foreign exchange costs of the Project are assumed in the financing plan.
iii.      Demand for electrical energy in Turkey has been increasing at an
annual rate of about 12% since 1960. This expansion has been marked by
the establishment of a national grid for power transmission and exploitation
of hydroelectric resources and, with the active encouragement of the Bank,
the setting up of TEK under the TEK law in October 1970 with overall respon-
sibility for power development in place of a number of governmental agencies
operating before. A growth rate of about 14% is expected in 1972-1977, about
12% in 1978-1982, and about 11% in 1983-1987. The Project is part of the
least cost program for meeting the projected growth of demand at discount
rates up to 12%. The estimated economic return on the Project is at least
17.6%.
iv.       Since 1952, the Bank has made six loans (total US$108.65 million)
and IDA has extended two credits (total US$25.7 million) for the development
of the power sector in Turkey. Expansion of TEK's transmission system fin-
anced by a loan of US$24 million (1971) is progressing well despite initial
delays caused by shortage of staff. Also, in 1967, the Bank approved a tech-
nical assistance grant of US$1.95 million for help in reorganizing the Turk-
ish power industry and about US$1.57 million has been spent in stages through
1972 on three phases of work. Implementation of consultants' recommendations,
with suitable modifications, is under way. No financial support has so far
been given by the Bank/IDA to the Turkish mining sector.



- ii -
v.        The Project provides an opportunity to resolve some problem  re-
lating to organization, management, personnel, and finances which have baen
apparent in TEK and which apply to some extent to TKI as well. The actions
summarized below would assure satisfactory execution of the Project.
vi.       Since commencing operations in October 1970 with the nucleus of
the Government organization previously engaged in the generation and trans-
mission of power, TEK has, as provided in the TEK law, taken over generation
and transmission facilities of municipalities and hydroelectric assets. Three
changes of General Manager in under four years have, however, detracted from
effective management in TEK. In addition, TEK has experienced an acute per- 
sonnel shortage, as high as 47% in July 1973 (48% inengineering>, owing
to low civil service salaries specified under a Personnel Law applicable
to all state economic enterprises from January 1971. Effective November
1973, Government has taken certain stop-gap measures to improve salary
levels which are expected to solve some of the immediate problems. Since
TEK's ability to execute the Project would be seriously in question should
this shortage of staff continue, Government has agreed to let TEK engage
staff on contract should such recruitment appear necessary in the opinion
of the Bank. To improve management performance, the Bank has also asked
Government to appoint the General Manager in future normally for a minimum
three-year term. Personnel problems arising from low salaries under the
Personnel Law also afflict TKI, and Government has agreed to take similar
steps as in the case of TEK to resolve these.
vii.      TEK's organizational structure, inherited from its predecessor,
is not entirely suited to its expanded responsibilities and was the subject
of a 15-month study by consultants financed under the Bank's technical as-
sistance grant and completed in December, 1972. TEK has agreed to complete
its reorganization based on this study according to a time-bound plan, with
needed emphasis on finance and accounting.
viii.     The Project is a complex one requiring smooth coordination of con-
struction of the mining and power components in accordance with a single
critical path schedule. Government has established a senior-level coor-
dination committee for policy decisions and is also setting up a sub-
committee which will meet more frequently. The Project consultants,
familiar with such projects, will have a clearly defined advisory`role
in the administration of the Project as well as in the technical and
engineering work.
ix.       The financing plan for the foreign exchange cost of the Proj-ect
is tied closely to completion of bidding for the principal items of equip-
ment. Under this plan, in addition to the proposed Bank loan of $148 mil-
lion, $129 million is expected from KfW and $92 million from the EIB. For
the remainder, three members of EIB have indicated that they would be pre-
pared to provide financing of about $45 million subject to their usual pro-
cedures, the Turkish Government would cover $118 million and the balance
of $153 million is expected to be provided by other bilateral lenders.
It does not seem unreasonable to expect collectively from all these sources
this amount; in the event such financing is not forthcoming, Government has
agreed to provide it.



- iii -
x.        The Elbistan power plant and transmission lines form 33% of TEK's
investment program in 1973-1981. The Bank loan of US$123 million would finance
about 5% of the total construction requirements; the KfW loan another 2%, the
EIF loan another 3%, internal cash generation 56% (assuming appropriate tariff
increases), State Investment Bank (SIB) loars 5% and other miscellaneous sources
2%. Government is sanguine of raising the balance of 27% as bilateral aid or
suppliers' credits on acceptable terms.
xi.       For the mine, the Bank loan of US$25 million would cover 8% of con-
struction expenditure, the KfW loan 22%, the EIB loan 4%, other credits tied
to contract awards 14% and foreign exchange resources of Government another
7,'. Further, SIB loans would finance 13%, Government equity contribution 13%
and Government equity/loan (whichever form Government assistance may take) 19%.
There will be no self-financing since TKI's other operations generate no funds
for the purpose.
xii.      Since satisfactory financial performance by TEK is essential for
its orderly growth, Government and TEK should take appropriate tariff action
before the proposed loan is made effective. TEK has not earned the minimnum
8% return on realistically valued net fixed assets required by the covenants
in the existing Loan Agreements, the shortfall varying from 1970 through 1972
(2.5% in 1970, 3.1% in 1971 and marginally in 1972); there would also be a
shortfall of about 2.3% in 1973. In the wake of the recent surge in oil prices
necessitating automatic recovery of increased fuel costs as fuel surcharge,
TEK's electricity sale price rose 42% in the two months of December 1973 and
January 1974 making difficult full tariff action to secure the 8% return and
make up the shortfalls as required by the covenant (which alone would require
a 30% increase) in the near future. To raise earnings to acceptable levels
in the present conditions in Turkey, Governmenit lhas agreed to establishi new
tariffs before loan effectiveness (which will secure TEK an increase in reve-
nues of about 22%) and also to raise tariffs a further 31% not later than
March 15, 1975. This will enable TEK to earn a return of about 3.5% in 1974,
5.4% in 1975 and 9.2% in 1976 on an asset base revalued to the 1973 level of
prices.
xiii.     Inadequate earnings have been a feature of TKI's operations also.
Without freedom to set its pricing policies and with coal and lignite prices
traditionally fixed by Government with reference to prices of oil, tlhe competing
energy resource, TKI lhas been operating at a loss since 1965 except in 1967 and
1969. Government, TEK and TKI will so fix the Elbistan lignite price as to
give a minimum return of 8% on TKI's original Elbistan mining investment as
revalued from time to time.
xiv.      Procurement of Bank-financed items would be according to the Bank's
procurement guidelines. In the case of items not financed by the Bank, it
would be ensured that technically satisfactory equipment is procured in time,
always on the advice of consultants.



- iv -
xv.       TEK and TKI will enter into an agreement for TKI's Elbistan lignite
sales to TEK, defining the principles of fixing the sales price and providing
incentives to TKI to minimize expenses and achieve efficient operation.
xvi.      The Bank has accepted the High Control Board as independent auditors
satisfactory to the Bank on the uncerstanding that its audit would include all
the items mentioned in the Terms of Reference furnished by the Bank.
xvii.     In view of the agreements as set forth in Section 8, the Project is
suitable for a Bank loan of US$148 million, US$123 million to TEK and US$25
million to TKI, for a term of 25 years with a 5-year grace period. Establish-
ment of satisfactory project coordination arrangements, actual revision of
TEK's books after asset revaluation as of December 31, 1973, and establishment
of new basic electricity supply tariffs yielding TEK an average net revenue
of 39 kurus per kWh would be conditions of loan effectiveness.



TURKEY
APPRAISAL OF
THE ELBISTAN PROJECT OF THE TURKISH
ELECTRICITY AUTHORITY (TEK) AND TURKISH COAL ENTERPRISES (TKI)
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      This report appraises the Elbistan Project in east-central Turkey,
comprising an open-cast lignite mine to be constructed by TKI and a mine-
based power station and associated transmission lines by TEK between 1973
and 1980. The planned mine output is 20.7 million tons p.a., 17.9 million
tons to be used for the 1,200-MW plant and 2.8 million tons to be dried and
processed in a special plant ancillary to, but not included in, the main Pro-
ject to produce 1.23 million tons p.a. of saleable doirestic fuel.
1.02      The estimated cost of the Project excluding interest during con-
struction is LT 13,488 million (US$963 million) comprising LT 9,215 million
(US$658 million) for the power plant, LT 3,882 million (US$277 million) for
the mine, and LT 391 million (US$28 million) for the transmission lines.
A Bank loan of US$148 million (US$123 million for the power plant and trans-
mission lines and US$25 million for the mine) is proposed towards the foreign
exchange costs amounting to LT 9,595 million (US$685 million), excluding in-
terest during construction. TEK and TKI would be the borrowers and the Repub-
lic of Turkey the guarantor. This appraisal assumes that $92 million will be
lent by the European Investment Bank (EIB) and $129 million, including sup-
pliers credits, by Kreditanstalt fu~r Wiederaufbau (KfW) which have been con-
sidering the Project in close association with the Bank ever since its incep-
tion.
1.03      The rapid growth of the Turkish electric power system at some 12%
p.a. requires a balanced development of thermal and hydro resources. The
Project fits into such a development plan and has the added attraction of
utilizing an internal resource as distinct from an imported fuel.
1.04      The Bank has made six loans and a technical assistance grant (total
US$108.65 million) and IDA has extended two credits (total US$25.7 million)
for the development of the power sector in Turkey:
(a) Loan 63-TU of US$25.2 million in 1952, for the multipurpose Seyhan
dam, 36-MW power plant and associated irrigation and transmission
works;
(b)  Credit 34-TU of US$1.7 million in 1963, for a third unit of 18-MW
at the Seyhan hydroelectric station;
(c) Credit 59-TU of US$24.0 million in 1964, for a 100-MWI thermal
station at Mersin, a 70-MW hydro2e1ctric station at Kadincik and
associated transmission works;



- 2 -
(d)  Loan 623-TU of US$11.5 million in 1969, for the second stage of
Kadincik (50-MW); and
(e) Loan 775-TU of US$7.0 million in 1971, for transmission
facilities and to cover increased foreign exchange costs
of the second Kadincik hydroelectric project.
These five loans/credits were for works in the service area of
the Cukurova Electric Company (covering the four southern provinces on the
Mediterranean) and were re-lent in whole or in part to Cukurova. All projects
have been completed or are progressing satisfactorily.
(f)  Loan 568-TU of US$25.0 million in 1968, which was re-lent to
Etibank (TEK's predecessor) for the 380-kV transmission lines
from the Keban hydroelectric project to Istanbul with the asso-
ciated substations;
(g)  Loan 763-TU of US$24.0 million in 1971, for expanding TEK's
transmission system;
(h) Technical Assistance Grant of US$1.95 million in 1967 for help
in reorganizing Turkey's power industry. About US$1.57 million
has been spent in stages on three phases of work in Etibank and
TEK through 1972 (paras. 6.04 and 6.13). Government's proposals
for using the balance of about US$0.38 million are under considera-
tion; and
(i) Loan 892-TU of US$14 million in May 1973, for the electricity
construction program of the Istanbul Electricity, Tramway and
Tunnel Co. for 1974 and 1975 and for studies to determine the
long-term electricity, transport and gas organization for
Istanbul.
1.05      The Project presents an opportunity for involvement in the Turkish
mining sector to which no financial support has so far been given by the
Bank/IDA.
1.06      This report is based on the findings of a Bank mission consisting
of Messrs. I. Nathai, T.B. Russell, J.N.M. Green and H. Reinbach (mining
consultant) which visited Turkey between September 17 and October 9, 1973,
on a feasibility study conducted by a consortium of consultants led by
Fichtner Consulting Engineers GmbH of Stuttgart, Germany, and on information
supplied by TEK, TKI and the consultants. Prior to the appraisal, several
Bank- missions had studied the Project at various stages of its preparation
beginning from March 1971; there was also a special study in October 1971
by Mlr. D. Anderson, with the assistance of Mr. Orhan Tarkan of TEK, of the
Elbistan power station's position in the overall development of Turkey's
power system. A preappraisal mission reviewed the feasibility of the Project
in March 1973, and another reviewed that of the proposed domestic fuel opera-
tion in July 1973.

2. THE COUNTRY AND THE ECONOMY
The Country
2.01      Turkey is geographically a link between Europe and Asia bordered
by Greece, Bulgaria, the USSR, Iran, Iraq and Syria, and with a long coast-
line (8,210 km) stretching from the Black Sea t:o the Mediterranean. The
total area is 780,000 km2; 24,000 km2 in Europe and the rest in Asia.  The
estimated population at mid-1973 was 38.2 million, growing at about 2.5%
p.a. Rivers are distributed throughout the country but their flow is mostly
irregular. Considerable climatic variations exist, from typical Mediterranean
climate in the south to severe continental climate with hot summers and cold
winters on the high plateaus and mountainous regions of the interior.
The Economy
2.02      Turkish development strategy since the foundation of the Republic
fifty years ago has been based on modernization within a mixed economy, the
main emphasis being on industrialization and self-sufficiency, a policy
pursued with increased vigor following the launching of the first five-year
plan in 1963. Since 1962, GNP has grown at nearly 7% p.a., industry at over
10% p.a. anid agriculture at 3.5% p.a.; the other sectors (construction, trans-
port, housing and services) have grown at about 7% p.a. As a result, the
structure of the economy has changed considerably; the respective shares of
industry, agriculture and other sectors in GDP in 1972 were 23%, 28% and 49%,
compared with 16%, 37% and 47% in 1962. Government estimates an acceleration
of economic growth to about 8% p.a. and a steady rise in industry's share of
GDP to 34% by 1987. GNP per capita would rise from US$420 in 1972 to nearly
US$1,000 (in 1972 dollars) by 1987.
2.03      The combination of rapid industrialization and urbanization (urban
population rose from 28% to 36% of total population in 1962-1970) has resulted
in a correspondingly rapid increase in the demand for electricity (para. 5.01).
This led to shortages in 1972 and 1973 since the generating program had not
kept pace with demand. The projected future trend of economic growth and of
urbanization (urban population is projected to reach 62% of total population
by 1987) implies continued high rates of growth of electricity demand, which
TEK's development program is designed to meet.
3.  TIE SECTOR
Energy Resources
3.01      Turkey has indigenous resources of lignite, coal and hydropower
plus some oil, geothermal energy and uranium but depends on imported oil for
about 50% of commercial energy requirements. Traditional fuels (firewood and
"tezek" -- dried dung) are also important in the interior of the east, meeting



-4-
about one-third (7 million tons petroleum equivalent) of total energy consump-
tion at high economic cost, but the proposed dried lignite scheme (Annex 10)
associated with the Project will mark an important step in reducing this
dependence, Lignite reserves are estimated at 5,000 million tons, of which
the Elbistan deposits constitute 60%. The quality is low, the calorific
value ranging from about 1,000 kcal/kg at Elbistan to 2,500 kcal/kg elsewhere.
The main coal deposits are in the Zonguldak basin on the Black Sea. Proven
reserves are about 150 million tons, with another 800 million tons of probable
and possible reserves. The quality is relatively poor (calorific value 4,000
kcal/kg). In 1972, about 1 million tons of coal (23% of total output) and
1.2 million tons of lignite (14% of output) were used in power stations,
accounting for 26% of total electricity generation.
3.02      Estimates of proven oil reserves, at Batman in the southeast and
near Iskenderun on the Mediterranean, vary widely from 20 to 70 million tons,
equivalent to only 6 to 20 years' supply at the 1972 production rate of 3.5
million tons. This represented about 36% of total oil consumption, the
balance being met by imports. Despite intensive development of indigenous
resources, dependence on imported oil is expected to grow; prior to the price
increases in late 1973 imports were projected to rise to 21 million tons by
1980 and to nearly 40 million tons by 1985 but they may now be less. Consump-
tion for electricity generation is not expected to increase significantly above
the 1972 level of 1.3 million tons if the Project is implemented.
3.03      Estimated usable hydroelectric potential is 73,000 GWh p.a.
(16,000 MW at 50% plant factor), distributed over 26 river basins. Of this,
31,000 GWh is in the Firat (Euphrates) basin. Installed hydro capacity at
end of 1972 was 880 MW, generating 3,200 GWh (30% of total); by 1974-end,
these figures are expected to be 2,050 MW and 8,200 GWh. The State Hydraulic
Works (Devlet Su Isleri - DSI) plans to develop virtually all the known econo-
mic potential of over 7,000 MW (34,000 GWh), including 4,000 MW (20,000 GWh)
on the Firat, by 1990.
3.04      Geothermal resources, although widespread, have been evaluated so
far only in southwest Turkey (about 30 MW of potential), but development
for power may have to await improved technology. Uranium reserves are esti-
mated at about 3,000 tons of uranium oxide equivalent in low grade ores (less
than 0.05%) hut systematic prospecting for uranium and thorium is just beginn-
in,,. The identified reserves, thought to be commercially exploitable, could
support a modest nuclear power program. The first nuclear station is planned
for 1984. After 1990, electric power development is expected to rely heavily
on nuclear energy.
305)^     A major objective of Government energy policy is optimum utiliza-
tion of indigenous energy sources to restrain the growing dependence on im-
ported oil. The proposed Elbistan lignite development is a logical step in
this direction, a step which gains added justification now with the recent
increases in petroleum prices.



- 5-
Organization of the Power Sector
3.06      The Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources controls the electric
power sector. At the time of the formation of TEK in October 1970, four
state organizations, a half-dozen or so private companies, a large number
of private industrial firms and more than 600 municipalities and villages
were involved with generating, transmitting and distributing electricity.
In place of the four state organizations which included a planning and
statistical organization responsible for all planning in the sector, DSI,
responsible for development of hydro projects, and Etibank, a State Economic
Enterprise (SEE), whose power group constructed and operated all major thermal
production plants and transmission lines throughout Turkey, selling energy to
the distribution agencies and large industries, there are now only two:
(a) TEK, responsible for the major part of the generation and
tranmission of electrical energy in Turkey; and
(b) DSI, responsible for hydropower development including
planning.
3.07      Amongst the private utility companies, by far the largest is the
Cukurova Electric Company which operates in the Adana area. The largest
municipal distributors are in Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir; Istanbul and Izmir
buy all their energy from TEK but Ankara still generates part of its require-
ments. Other municipal authorities buy energy from TEK or Cukurova.
3.08      Law 1312 which established TEK charges it with resporsibility for
planning the general electrification of Turkey including management of a
village electrification fund; for constructing thermal electric plants and
transmission and distribution lines; for operating the national transmission
system and all the interconnected power stations except those privately
licensed, and for selling energy to consumers in bulk or individually. DSI
still plans and builds hydroelectric projects but only in cooperation with
TEK. The law also provides means whereby TEK can take over other power sector
enterprises.  TEK has already tzaken over operation of all the power stations
previously owned by Etibank and DSI, together with their staff, and also
those owned by municipalities and Iller Bank, an SEE previously providing
electric facilities at the smaller municipal and village level. Private
utility companies are not affected by the creation of TEK. Distribution
networks mav continue to be owned and managed by municipalities, though TEK
mav take these over by mutual agreement with the municipalities or if they
fail to pay their bills promptly. Development programs for distribution are
initiated and implemented by each municipality with TEK coordinating the
various programs.
Existing Power Facilities
3.0()     The installed capacity of public utility generating plant in Turkey
at the end of 1973 was 2,489 MW, consisting of 2,101 MW (84%) in systems
operated by TEK, 298 MW (12%) in Cukurova's system and 90 MW (4%) in small



- 6 -
;nstallations.  In addition, private generation, mostly industri~.al, totals
a20ut 300  W.  The interconnected system operated by TEK which serves the
western and central parts of the country supplies 95% of the demand. At
t.-Ie end of 1973, apart from 49 MW of isolated installations, TEK's plants
in the interconnected system comprised 817 MW of hydro plant, and 1,235 MW
of thermal plant including a 630-MW oil-fired plant at Anbarli near Istanbul.
3.10      Owing to inadequacy of capacity (about 12% short of demand) in 1973,
TEK shed up to 5% of peak load through frequency and voltage reduction. In
October 1973, the situation was aggravated by plant failures necessitating
interruption of supply for one hour per day to most customers on a rotating
schedule.
3.11      TEK's present wholesale tariffs (including sales to municipalities
and large industry), averaging 24.82 krs (UISd1.8) per kWh before the recent
surge in fuel surcharge (para 7.16), have been in force since July 1, 1971,
when the previous tariff was raised by about 50%.  Retail tariffs are set by
eaclh municipality, generally to meet cash flow objectives, typical retail
tariffs being almost twice the wholesale tariffs, e.g. 45.68 krs in Istanbul
and 46.20 krs in Ankara; however, in municipalities, surplus electricity
revenues are often diverted into non-energy operations such as transport.
Development Program
3.12      The planned national investment in generation and transmission
including DSI hydropower stations during the period 1973-1981 is LT 49,412
million (US$3,529 million).  With the exception of gas turbine and nuclear
plants, the plan would concentrate on the development of internal lignite
and hydro resources to minimize dependence on imported fuels.
3.13      The first 600-MW nuclear plant is due in 1984 to be followed in
1987 by another of 750-MW capacity (see Annex 1). Annex 2 shows the forecast
growth of maximum demand for the interconnected system.
3.14      Technical transmission system studies to the year 1987 have been
made and the development program is geared to meet the anticipated require-
metnt. 8,300 km of 380-kV power lines are expected to be commissioned in the
period 1974 to 1987.
Village Electrification
3.15      Of the 36,000 villages 1/ in Turkey, only 268 were electrified prior
to 1964 and of these only about 10 had received Government assistance in
installing their power supplies. The pace of development has accelerated
g>reatly following the launching of a planned program of village electrifica-
tion in 1964. In the period 1964-67, 810 villages were electrified, or an
I/   Average population 610, but ranging from below 50 to over 2,000.



- 7 -
average of some 200 p.a.  A further 3,722 villages (620 p.a.) were electrified
up to September 1973, by which date some 4,800 villages had been electrified
and construction of facilities was under way in a further 2,500 villages.
The present program, which since 1970 has been the responsibility of a
special organization within TEK, envisages a future rate of electrification
of 1,000 villages p.a., an ambitious target which is likely to stretch TEK's
resources to the limit. The program is financed by village contributions
(25% of capital costs), a levy of 1 kurus/kWh (USd0.07) on non-village con-
sumers of electricity excluding large industrial consumers, and contributions
from the Government budget. The village networks are operated by the villages
themselves under TEK's technical supervision. Villagers pay for electricity
communally, the whole village being centrally metered and charged at 35 kurus/
kWh (US.^2.5).
4. THE PROJECT
Description
4.01      The Project would comprise:
(a) a thermal power station with four 300-MW lignite-fired units
delivering, after meeting the power station and mine loads, an
estimated 1,048 MW and 7,030 GWh p.a. to TEK's interconnected
system;
(b) 380-kV transmission lines, about 540 km long, connecting
Elbistan with Kayseri and Ankara by 1978 and 1979 respectively
(Map IBRD 10774);
(c) an open-cast lignite mine (described in Annex 3) with a planned
capacity of 20.7 million tons p.a., 17.9 million for the power
station and 2.8 million for processing for sale as domestic
fuel, including the cost of land and of restoration of the
worked-out mining area (Map IBRD 10748);
(d) separate permanent housing for power station and mine staff
and roads between these and the works as well as Elbistan town;
and
(e) consultancy services.
4.02       The domestic fuel drying plant estimated to cost about US$75.5
million has been excluded from the Project because a final cost estimate
cannot be made before completing bulk lignite sample tests leading to final
enigineering design, and its construction will be at about the time of comple-
tion of the Project when lignite production will surpass the power plant needs.



-8-
4.03      The power station is conventional except that the fuel is lignite
having a relatively high (12 to 25%) ash content, moisture of about 55% and
mean calorific value of 1,050 kcal/kg requiring boilers suited to this low-
grade fuel. Emphasis has been placed on a proven and reliable design. Water
supplies of suitable quality for the boilers and the condensing system will
be derived from the dewatering wells of the open-cast mine. A fuel blending
and stock pile will receive the mine output of varying quality and hold
1,000,000 tons which is a three-week reserve at 74% station load factor.
4.04      The mine will utilize the Kislakoy lignite deposit.  A part of the
output will be screened out as lumps in the size range from 80 mm to 150 mm
for the domestic fuel plant (Annex 10 and Ma, IBRD 10748), and the balance
delivered by belt conveyors to the powerhouse during the 25-year planned life
of the workings.
4.05      Excavation of overburden and lignite will be by bucket wheel ex-
cavators of a capacity of 3,000 m3 per hour of compacted material, amongst
the largest in the world. All units will be of this size to allow flexible
application to overburden or lignite working compatible with a uniform size
of conveyor belt system throughout the mine.
4.06      Permanent housing will be constructed for senior and skilled operat-
ing staff of the power station and mine at two separate sites. During
construction, this housing will accommodate contractors, consultants and
Project management staff.
4.07      The water table at or near the mine will be lowered by bore hole
pumps. Groundwater conditions are still being investigated to verify expected
iniflows from the karstic formations in the adjacent Kizildag range. Indica-
tions so far are that these can be handled within the estimated Project pro-
vision. Two drilling rigs are actively in use in this work. The Bank has
been furnished the proposed drilling program for 1974 and TKI will keep the
Bank -informed regarding progress of the program.

of contract have been incorporated in the estimates. For this equipment,
physical and price contingencies have been calculated as allowed in bid

(a)  for the power station, at 6% on foreign costs and 9.9% on
local costs;
(b)  for the mine, at an average of 2.6% on foreign costs as
the majority of the investment consists of self-contained
units of mobile equipment capable of precise definition in
performance and numbers, and an average of 8.3% on local
costs; and
(c) for the transmission lines, at 10% on both foreign and
local costs.

Price contingencies for items other than those for which bids have
Deen received have been provided at the following annual percentage rates in
both foreign and local costs:

1976-1978                        7.5                 12
For boilers and turbogenerators an effective annual rate of 8% has
been allowed. The tenders for the mining equipment have been assumed to be at
fixed prices as required in the bidding documents.
4.10      Expenditure on the Project up to the commissioning of all four sets
and delivery of 17.9 million tons of lignite p.a. from the mine would extend
over the period 1973 through 1980. Further capital investment in mining equip-
ment for the progressive extension of belt conveying systems and dewatering
wells will be necessary over the 25-year life of the mine and has been allowed
in the estimates to the extent of LT 188 million (US$13.4 million).
Status of Engineering, Procurement and Disbursement
4.11      In September 1971, a consortium of consultants led by Fichtner of
Germany, in association with Rheinbraun Consulting GmbH of Germany, SOFRELEC
of France and Gemas of Turkey was appointed to produce a feasibility report
using the findings of Otto Gold GmblH who had prepared a preliminary report
on the lignite deposit in 1969. A contract dated July 1971 between TEK and
the consultants sets out the role of the consultants; it has since been
extended to include services to TKI in respect of the mining works and has
been further defined in the course of the appraisal to cover project manage-
ment.
4.12      It is expected that the proposed loan would be used to finance 30%
of the foreign exchange cost of the boilers, 70% of that of other selected
po%:er plant aiid imining equipment and 100%' of that of the general contractor,
.Aid of consultants after thie date of loan signing.  Thle KEfW funds (paras 7.14
andl 7.30) would be applied to mining equipment and the boilers and the proposed
LUi loan would be used to finance eligible costs of both power plant and mining
equipment.  Bilateral credits estimated at $198 million (of which $121 million
is reasonablv assured by EIB members and the balance of $77 million is expected
from otlhers in conjunction with bids) would be applied to eligible purchases
as bidding progresses. Down payments required before date of loan signing
and most cost escalation would be met from Government resources. These costs
are estimated as $118 million. In addition, the Government would finance in-
terest during construction of $130 million. No retroactive financing is pro-
posed. Participation of local suppliers would be permitted and Government
requested a preference of 15% for such suppliers for bid evaluation purposes.
In the event local suppliers are successful bidders, a percentage of the ex-
factory cost would be financed in the same manner as agreed for c.i.f. costs
of imported goods. The expected schedule of disbursements of the proposed
loan is given in Annex 5.



- 11 -
4.13      Bids for the boilers and turbo-generators were invited, with the
Bank's agreement, in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement.
Procurement of other items which may be financed from the Bank loan will also
be under international competitive bidding in accordance with the Guidelines
(except for consultants' services); procurement of items for which bilateral
or other restricted credits are to be used would be in accordance with applic-
able procedures. The Borrowers have agreed to furnish to the Bank for review,
bid documents, and before commitment, the evaluation report, and copies of all
contracts for the Project having a value in excess of $2 million, regardless
of source of finance, and to keep the Bank fully informed of the procurement
actions to ensure that such procurement is carried out with due regard for
efficiency, technical standards, and the Project schedule.
Construction Schedules
4.14      Work on the housing site and roads has started.  Major site works
are due to start in 1974. The mining development will be implemented so as to
deliver lignite as required by the power plant commissioning plan, No. 1 set
in September 1978, followed at six monthly intervals by Nos. 2, 3 and 4 sets
ending in March 1980. The transmission link with Kayseri is due to be com-
pleted in 1978 followed in 1979 by the link with Ankara. A 380-kV trans-
mission line, not part of the Project, from Keban to Seydisehir via Elbistan
and Osmaniye, is due to be constructed starting in 1974 and will also trans-
mit power from the Project.
Administration of the Project
4.15      For coordination of Project construction, Government has set up an
eleven-member coordination committee comprising the Councillor in the Ministry
of Energy (chairman), the General Aanagers of TEK and TKI, and representatives
of the Ministry of Finance and other concerned Ministries/Organizations, and
meeting once in three months, or more often if necessary. For more frequent
coordination of matters outside the delegated authority of the TEK and TKI
Project staff, Government is setting up a four-member sub-committee consisting
of a representative of the Ministry of Energy (chairman), and those of TFK,
TKI and the Ministry of Finance, and meeting once a month or more often as re-
quired. A representative of the consultants will be in attendance at meetings
of the sub-committee as an adviser and a record of the business transacted
will he kept.
Ecological Aspects
4.16      The Elbistan power station will be located in a sparsely inhabited
area.  The design of the power plant provides for ash removal from the flue
gases bv mean1s of electrostatic precipitators which remove 99% of the en-
trained ash particles.  At this level, the fallout of residual ash is well 2
within the accepted tolerance levels in developed countries, i.e. 0.32 gm/m
day, and is not inappropriate for Turkey. Improvement of ash removal from
98% to 99% efficiency (i.e. halving the discharge) involves a cost of US$0.6
million for equipment. To gain a further 1/2% of ash removal of 99-1/27 (i.e.
further halvinp the discharge) would cost US$2 million. Thus, reduction of



- 12 -
ash discharge below the design level can be achieved only at excessive cost
considering the environment in which this station will operate. TEK has
agreed to set up pollution monitoring stations and to inform the Bank of the
levels of pollution recorded and of the corrective action taken if this shall
be necesary.
4.17       The mining site area is at best sTarsely cultivated and is treeless.
It affords no shelter for wildlife such as would need to be conserved and the
Project envisages that the external overburden dump as well as the internal
dump will in due course be rehabilitated so as to allow resettlement and
reuse.
4.18       The lowering of the water table in the region of the mining activity
is likely to have local effect only and where otherwise, compensatory piped
water would be provided. Sewage will be treated. Noise pollution does not
arise.
5. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PROJECT
Market Growth
5.01       The Elbistan power station would form part of TEK's interconnected
system. Past sales in the system since 1960 (Annex 7) show a mean growth
rate over the period of about 12% p.a. For preparing forecasts of future
sales, TEK makes ten-year projections for each customer (excluding major
industrial customers) based on the past trend of kWh sales. Customers are
grouped by substations and then by regions. Separate projections are made
for major industrial consumers, existing and projected, to obtain total TEK
sales. To these are added projected sales by two concessionary companies,
expected to be fully connected to the TEK system by 1977, to give the fore-
cast for the interconnected system. The forecast is finalized in the light
of Government plans and projections for the development of the various sectors
of the economy and of the regions.
5.02       TEK's current ten-year forecast (Annex 8) implies an average annual
growth rate of 14.1% in 1972-1977, declining to 11.5% in 1977-1982. TEK has
also made an indicative forecast for the subsequent five years to 1987
(Annex 8), when the average growth rate declines to 10.8% p.a. These projec-
tions are reasonably consistent with the present stage of development of the
Turkish economy and its projected future growth (para. 2.03).  They imply
a rise in electricity production per capita from the 1972 level of 300 kWh to
1,150 kWh in 1987, the level achieved by Spain in 1966, which does not seem
unduly ambitious.



- 13 -
5.03      It is too early to judge the implications for economic growth and
electricity demand of the recent sharp increases in world oil prices.  How-
ever, to allow for uncertainty, the mission made an alternative "low" fore-
cast (Annex 8) assuming:
(a) a 10% lower annual growth in electricity demand in the
regions than in the TEK forecast; and
(b) an average slippage of one year in the development of the
additional maJor industrial loads projected by TEK.
Comparison of Alternatives
5.04      TEK's studies in recent years to determine the optimum future in-
vestment program for power indicated the need for a balanced development of
the country's hydro and lignite resources (paras. 3.01 and 3.03) over the
next fifteen years in preference to oil and nuclear energy, a conclusion
supported by an independent Bank study in 1971-72 using a linear programming
model developed in the Bank.
5.05      Subsequent detailed planning studies by TEK confirmed that, on the
latest forecast of demand, a new generating source would be needed of the
magnitude, unit size and timing envisaged in the Project. Were the annual
load growth two percentage points lower than estimated, the Project could be
delayed one year but, given the possibility of construction slippages of this
order, deferment on this ground would not be justified. The program already
includes development of Turkey's major hydroelectric resources (principally
the Euphrates projects, Annex 1) and in addition, construction of small hydro
projects to the limit of the implementation capability of DSI. Further dev-
elopment of additional hydro to replace Elbistan therefore is not a realistic
alternative. Similarly a nuclear station is not a feasible alternative on
this time scale, quite apart from TEK's lack of nuclear experience. Geothermal
resources are inadequately evaluated at present. The quantum of gas turbine
capacity in the system, present and planned, is already at its limit; by 1975
there will be 320 MW, representing 10% of installed capacity. The effective
choice, therefore, lay between a thermal station using oil and one using lig-
nite. Two alternative development programs covering the period to 1987 were
therefore compared, as described in Annex 9, one including the proposed Pro-
ject. In making the comparison, the Elbistan alternative was credited with the
net benefits of the proposed dried lignite operation (Annex 10). Since this
component of the proposed development also yields attractive social benefits,
TKI has agreed to undertake this, and should the dried lignite scheme prove
to be infeasible, Government has agreed to establish, within the same period
and after obtaining the Bank's views, an alternative facility yielding compar-
able benefits. To allow for the risks and uncertainties associated with each
alternative, a range of values with assigned probabilities was adopted for
the main variables affecting the comparison (station plant factor, capital
costs and oil prices).  As shown in Annex 9, this resulted in a range for the
equalizing discount rate of 9.9% - 16.3% and mean expected value of 13.4%



- 14 -
on the main load projection. These results were found to be relatively in-
sensitive to load growth, varying only fractionally if the low forecast (para.
5.03) is assumed. The effect of higher capital investment costs that now
apply to the Project has been tested relative to the commensurate higher cost
of an oil-fired alternative resulting in an equalizing discount rate of 12.3%
which is acceptable.
Economic Rate of Return
5.06      The economic rate of return on the Project is estimated to be at
least 17.6% (Annex 11) if benefits are measured by incremerntal revenue from
power sales attributable to the proposed Elbistan power station, plus net
benefits attributable to that portion of the mine's output used to produce
dried lignite for sale (Annex 10), and if financial costs are adjusted for
taxes, internal transfers, sunk costs and shadow-pricing of unskilled labor.
However, the incremental revenue understates the benefits consumers receive
from the Project since it is considered that a 10-20% increase in tariff
level would not reduce demand significantly. Sensitivity tests (Annex 9)
indicated that the rate of return would be about two percentage points lower
on the low load forecast (para. 5.03) but is relatively insensitive to in-
dividual changes in the values assumed for the other main variables (capital
costs, station plant factor, power tariffs, operation and maintenance (O&M)
costs and dried lignite benefits).
6.  THE BORROWERS
6.01      Although ideally this integrated Project should be carried out under
the primary responsibility of a single agency, TEK and TKI would respectively
carry out the power and mining portions separately because of their clearly-
defined responsibilities under the law for these activities. Nevertheless,
maximum TEK-TKI cooperation is imperative for achieving smooth coordination
of Project construction. The proposed lending arrangements promote this
objective and also attach to TEK and TKI sole responsibility for its own
financial obligations. With two separate agreements, the power and mining
portions could conceivably progress out of step with each other. A tripartite
agreement between the Bank, and TEK and TKI as the borrowers is therefore
proposed, but each enterprise would be severally responsible for its own
financial obligations and for carrying out its allotted parts of the Project.
Government, TEK and TKI have agreed to this arrangement.
A.   TEK
6.02      TEK, with headquarters in Ankara, is an SEE with an authorized capi-
tal of LT 20,000 million (US$1,429 million) consisting of:
(a) net capital transfers to TEK from Etibank's Power Group,
DSI, Iller Bank and municipalities;
(b) equity contributions from the Turkish general budget; and
(c) TEK's net profits.



- 15 -
It rav borrow in its own name with the Ministry of Finance as guarantor.  IJnder
the TEK law, TEK must earn a return of not less than 8% on net fixed assets,
and fix tariffs accordingly; however, the manner of computing the return is
not prescribed either in the law or in any separate guidelines issued by
Government.
6.03      SEEs, such as TEK, are required to run on commercial lines, are sub-
ject to taxation (e.g. income taxes of 41.7%), and are treated in other respectE
like private joint stock companies, but they operate under Law 440 (passed in
1964) designed to create more resources for investments by enabling them to be
run autonomously, profitably and productively. However, SEEs are still subject
to close Governmental supervision and autonomy is severely limited as illus-
trated by their lack of freedom in setting personnel policies and structuring
salarv scales (paras. 6.08-6.11) and Covernment's active role in dictating
pricing of their goods and services. Government's propensity to make quick
management changes has also constrained the development of any real autonomy.
Organization
6.04      TEK's organization (see Chart in Annex 12) is essentially the same
as that of the old Etibank Power Group without any significant change to
enable it to cope with the widened responsibilities under the TEK law. In
October 1971, TEK appointed Electricite de France (EdF) as consultants, with
funding from the technical assistance grant (para. 6.12), to recommend a
suitable organization structure and to help rationalize TEK's technical
operations procedures. Based on EdF's final report of March 1973 (Chart in
Annex 13), TEK has initiated satisfactory action on reorganization and is now
planiiinlg aln immediate reorganization in stages and according to a time-bound
plan, well aware that success will depend on solving the personnel problem
(para. 6.11,.
b.05      Accouniting and finance functions are now spread throughout TEK
making direction and control ineffective. In accounting, the Director of
Accounting is in charge of only the General Accounting D)ivision without func-
tional responsibilitv for work in other Divisions, each Division being respon-
sible for its own work; in financial matters his role is even less. Most ac-
counting and finance work should be centralized tnder a senior staff member
such as an Assistant General Manager (AGM), or an official of equivalent rank,
responsible solely for accounting and finance and not in addition to planning,
coordination, and other duties as at present. Ile should be assisted by a
Director of Accounting responsible for all of TEK's accounting and a D)irector
of Finance for financial planning, banking, investments, etc. TEK has agreed
to centralize accounting and finance. Government and TEK have also been in-
formed of the Bank's view that one of TEK's Assistant General Managers, or an
official of equivalent rank, should he made solely responsible for the manage-
ment of its accounting and finance divisions.



- 16 -
Management and Staff
Management
6.06      TEK has a Board of four Directors comprising the General Manager
((N) , ex-officio Cliairm.lan, nominated by tie Miinistry of Elnergy and Natural
Resources and appointed by the Council of M4nisters, one of the AGMs (also
nominated by the Minister of Energy and Nattural Resources) and a member each
nominated by the Minister of Energy and Natural Resources and Minister of
Finanice and appointed by the Council of Ministers. The law prescribes an
initial tern of three years for the two representatives of the Mfinistries
who mav be reappointed on completion of their three years of service; it
does not prescribe any term for the GIT and AGM who "may be replaced accord-
ing to the specifications of their appointment". In managing TEK, the GM is
assisted by five AGMs (appointed by the Council of IMinisters on the recommenda-
tions of the Minister of Energy and Natural Resources). Mr. Behcet Yucel,
previously AGM for Village Electrification, has been the CM since December
1'?72; the third in about three and a half years.  This frequent change of GMs
is one of TEK's handicaps and has detracted from effective management. To
insure continuity of management, Government should follow the same practice
in the matter of appointment of the GM as is prescribed in the law for the
two representatives of the Ministries, which is possible without any change
in the law. Government has been informed of the Bank's view that in future,
the General Manager should normally be appointed for a period of at least
three years.
Staff
6.07      On its formation on October 25, 1970, TEK took over the Etibank
Power Group's personnel. Other agencies whose facilities have been trans-
ferred to TEK have similarly transferred their staff. From a total of about
6,800 employees (690 technical, 900 administrative and other monthly-rated
categories and 5,210 daily-rated labor) at the end of 1970, TEK's total sanc-
tioned establishment rose to about 13,910 employees in July 1973 (2,230 tech-
nical, 3,060 administrative and other monthly-rated categories and 8,620 daily-
rated labor).
6.08      TEK's personnel policies conform to the general personnel policy
prescribed bv Government for all SEEIs. Labor is organized in trade unions,
and collective bargaining agreements are in force for daily-rated labor, valid
for two-year periods.  However, TEIK has had a major staffing problem arising
from the application of rigid and inadequate civil service salary scales to
its administrative and technical personnel under a common Personnel law
(effective January 1, 1971) applicable to all SEEs. In the three years or so
from January 1971 until November 1973, the already-inadequate salary scales
had become more so owing to a more-than-50% price increase without any com-
pensating salary adjustments, until TEK was faced with a crisis situation
arising from mounting resignations of experienced staff seeking better avenues
outsidie and difficulties in attracting new personnel. Out of a total of 2,229
positions in the technical establishment, 1,070 (48%) were vacant as of July



- 17 -
31, 1973. The overall shortage in all categories was 47% (see Annex 14 for
details). Government, fully aware of the problem, has been contemplating
various solutions including:
(a) legislation exempting aid-financed projects from the Personnel
Law -- time-consuming and therefore unlikely to provide imme-
diate relief;
(b) engaging essential professional staff on contract paying salaries
closer to market levels;
(c) upgrading present staff classifications under the law providing
more higher level positions, an inadequate step since the maximum
salary even for the GM is only LT 7,000 (UJS$500) p.m.; and
(d) providing larger and more additional payments as permissible even
now in cases involving arduous duties, job risks, and recruitment
difficulties -- again promises only modest relief since such pay-
ments have to be in line with the basic salaries.
6.09      The following proposals of TEK to Government show its perception of
the magnitude of the problem and necessary corrective measures:
(a) that 1,906 persons be given additional payments under the law
ranging from LT 400 to LT 2,300 p.m. involving a total of LT 37.4
million p.a. (cf the total 1972 wage bill of LT 165 million);
(b) that in addition, 195 key technical personnel in the field and
head office be engaged on contract on salaries as high as
LT 15,000 p.m., i.e. more than double the existing maximum
salary; and
(c) that there should be 54 positions in Grade I (salary: LT 7,000
p.m.) and 130 in Grade II (salary: LT 5,320-6,545 p.m.) as
against the then existing 8 and 51.
6.10      Effective November 27, 1973, Government has in response to TFK's
insistent pleas for relief sanctioned certain measures such as upgrading
staiff classifications under the law and providing larger additional payments
in cases involving arduous duties, job risks and recruitment difficulties.
An idea of the clhanges can be had from the following:
(a) thiere are now 57 positions in Crade I vs 8 existing earlier
(25 new positions and 24 upgraded from lower classifications)
and 140 positions in Grades II vs 51 existing earlier (45 new
positions and 76 upgraded from lower classifications);
(b) salary increases in typical staff positions in large and small
projects vary from 12% for the Accountant to 54% for the
Department Head (Annexes 15 and 16); and



- 18 -
(c) roughly there will be a 40% increase in the total salaries of
staff engaged on a large project such as the Elbistan Project
(Annex 17), e.g. a 45% increase for the Elbistan Site Manager.
TEK considers that these measures will alleviate, though not eliminate, its
staffing problems.
6.11      While the above stop-gap measures will resolve some of the immediate
problems, the real solution would be to grant TEK autonomy in personnel policies
as envisaged in the 1966 Minutes of Agreement between the Bank and Government
(Annex 18) and to structure salary scales always to suit changing needs and
market conditions. Since the staffing problem vitally affects Elbistan and
all of TEK's operations, Government has agreed to let TEK hire staff on con-
tract should such recruitment appear necessary in the opinion of the Bank.
Technical Assistance - Accounting
6.12      In 1965, the Bank made a technical assistance grant of up to US$1.95
million to cover the foreign exchange costs of studies and the implementation
of recommendations for the reorganization of the Turkish power sector. So far
about US$1.57 million has been spent from the grant; the balance will be used
as required for other schemes, e.g. assisting TEK in the proposed reorganiza-
tion (para. 6.04).
6.13      In Phase I of the technical assistance program, completed in 1969,
Stone & Webster Overseas Consultants (SWOCI) devised a new system of accounts,
budgeting and reporting and purchasing and stores procedures, and prepared
engineering standards. In Phase II, during November 1970-November 1972,
Arthur Young & Company (AY) worked as consultants inter alia to introduce a
comprehensive system of accounts, budgeting and reporting based essentially
on the SWOCI system, and to assist TEK in implementing it, and also to re-
commend a scheme of revaluation of assets. TEK has now a better accounting,
budgeting and financial reporting system-than before, though it lacks a satis-
factory accounting and finance organization and has yet to use the system for
management decisions. Also TEK has now to revalue its assets in accordance
with the agreed principles and procedures (paras. 7.04 and 7.05). Follow-up
visits by AY would be arranged to assist in further implementation of various
systems and in revaluation of assets.
Audit
6.14      Within four months of the end of each year, each SEE must prepare
a balance sheet and income statement, and a report on the year's activities
comparing actual results with the budget, and submit them to the Government's
High Control Board (HCB) for examination from the administrative, technical
and financial standpoints. Under Loan 763-TU, financial statements audited
by independent auditors satisfactory to the Bank should be submitted to the
Bank within five months after the end of each financial year.



- 19 -
6.15      Although the Bank has accepted HCB for the time being as "independ-
ent auditors satisfactory to the Bank", it has reserved the right to review
this decision during the period of the loan. HCB's audit is designed to
suit Government's requirements -- the audit team is headed by an engineer,
and includes a lawyer and an economist, but no accountant -- and is not geared
to secure the Bank's objectives, an aspect which has become increasingly clear
in the Bank's experience of the audit thus far. It is now considered neces-
sary, because of TEK's proposed large expansion program, that HCB's audit
should be more closely oriented to the Bank's requirements. To this end the
Bank has supplied Terms of Reference for such audit to Government, HCB, and
TEK. HCB has been accepted by the Bank as independent auditors on the under-
standing that its audit would include all the items mentioned in the Terms of
Reference, and the Bank would have the right to reconsider this arrangement
during the period of the loan.
B.   TKI
Legislation
6.16      TKI, an SEE with headquarters in Ankara, was established on September
1, 1957 under Law No. 6974 known as the TKI law. It has an authorized capital
of LT 1,500 million (raised in April 1972 from the original LT 750 millior)
consisting of:
(a) net capital transfers from existing state organizations in
the sector whose assets and liabilities it took over;
(b) Government's equity contributions from the Turkish general
budget; and
(c) TKI's net profits.
It may borrow in its own name with the Ministry of Finance as the guarantor.
The TKI law does not prescribe any specific financial objectives for TKI,
nor does Law 440, the law applicable to all SEEs.
Organization
6.17      TKI has been charged with the responsibility to develop Turkey's
coal and lignite resources and to sell its production of coal, lignite and
by-products. It comprises three enterprises with separate legal status and
finances including tax liability;'one for coal production, a second for
lignite production and a third for sale and distribution of these and for
production and sale of by-products, besides three smaller units for lignite
production (see Annex 19). Its present organization (Chart in Annex 20) re-
flects its development out of earlier existing organizations. Under Govern-
ment's traditional pricing policies for coal and lignite, these prices have been
fixed with reference to prices of oil, the competing energy resource, and not with



- 20 -
reference to the sector needs. TKI's development plans need to be properly
integrated with those of TEK, and Government and TKI would insure this by
keeping under constant study TEK's coal and lignite requirements, the produc-
tion capability of the entire coal and li3nite mining sector and possible lines
of improvement of the sector.
6.18      For administering the Elbistan Project, TKI plans to create within
TKI a separate establishment under Law 440 with separate legal status and
financing, including tax liabilityy similar to the three existing establish-
ments, sometime towards the close of 1974 as soon as the staff required to
operate the separate establishment is recruited. Agreement has been reached
with TK:  on this.
Management and Staff
6.19      TKI has a Board of six Directors nominated by the Ministry of Energy
and Natural Resources and appointed by the Council of Ministers for a term of
three years. It comprises the GMI (ex-officio Chairman), two Deputy GMs, one
for Finance and another for Administration, one member each nominated by the
Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Energy, and a workers' representative.
The position of Deputy GM for Finance has been vacant since December 1972.
The present management team is competent, but, as in other SEEs, TKI's opera-
tions are hampered by a severe lack of autonomy.
6.20      TKI's personnel policies also conform to Government's general per-
sonnel policy for all SEEs. As in TEK, it has trade unions and collective
bargaining agreements for daily-rated labor. Serious personnel problems
arising from low salaries prescribed under the Personnel Law exist but not
in the same degree as in TEK perhaps because of less market demand hitherto
for mining engineers. Solutions would be similar in both TEK and TKI though
differing in range and content to suit the special needs of each enterprise.
Government has already taken steps similar to those for TEK, which would hope-
fully alleviate TKI's staffing problems. As in the case of TEK, Government
has agreed to let TKI hire staff on contract should such recruitment appear
necesary in the opinion of the Bank.
Audit
6.21      Although it is proposed to limit the financial covenant to TKI's
Elbistan establishment, the Bank should obtain TKI's audited annual financial
statements to be able to judge the financial progress of the organization in
which the Elbistan establishment operates and also with a view to possible
extension of the Bank's involvement in Turkey's coal mining sector in future.
For the separate Elbistan establishment, separate financial statements would
be required under Government regulations. Such audited annual financial
statements for the Elbistan establishment, and for TKI as a whole, duly
audited by auditors satisfactory to the Bank should be sent to the Bank within
five months after the close of each year. Agreement has been reached with
TKI on this and an audit arrangement similar to that for TEK has been accepted
by the Bank.

7. FINANCES
A.   TEK
Highlights of Financial Position
7.01      The highlights of TEK's financial position are as follows:
(a)  under the TEK law, TEK must earn a return of not less than 8%
on net fixed assets, but the manner of computing the return is
not prescribed either in the law or in any guidelines issued
by Government;
(b)  since the tariff increase in 1971, there has been no purposeful
action to achieve the financial objectives set in the TEK law
and the Bank's Loan Agreements. TEK has not met the existing
rate of return covenants requiring an 8% return on revalued
net fixed assets by varying margins from 1970 through 1972
(2.5% in 1970, 3.1% in 1971 and marginally in 1972); a short-
fall of about 2.3% is also estimated in 1973. Under the coven-
ant, it is required to make up the shortfall (a 30% tariff
increase effective for tl}e second half of 1974 would be needed
for this alone), a requirement which would push up tariffs
unconscionably high in 1974 only to be reduced later on if
readjusted to make only the required 8% annual return;
(c)  though required by the covenant, TEK had not adjusted its books
by December 31, 1972, to reflect agreed asset values after re-
valuation. Government and TEK have agreed during negotiations
to have future revaluation of assets carried out according to
principles accepted by the Bank;
(d) Government has agreed: (i) to establish before loan effectiveness
new basic tariffs securing TEK an increase in revenues of about 22%;
and (ii) to raise tariffs a further 31% not later than March 15,
1975. TEK would then earn a return of about 5.4% in 1975, 9.2%
in 1976 and a little over 10% thereafter at present level
of costs on an asset base revalued to the 1973 level of prices;
(e)  if salaries are raised substantially in future to relieve the
recent 47% staff shortage, still higher tariff increases would
be necessary; and
(f)  it has not yet formed a firm financing plan for the bulk of the
foreign exchange costs of its investment program of LT 34,408
million in the period 1973-1981, the successful completion of
which is dependent on Government's ability to secure foreign
exchange financing of LT 13,067 million (US$933 million).



- 22 -
Tariffs
7.02      SEEs, like TEK, were originally generally free to determine the prices
of their goods and services but by a decree of 1967, prices of basic goods and
services such as electrical power, coal, cement, steel, rail transport, etc.
became subject to the approval of the Council of Ministers. Any loss to the
enterprise resulting from a price change ordered by the Council must be made
good by Government. Government is also required to take action on requests
for tariff changes within one month. In practice, however, tariff decisions
are reached more through informal consultations between TEK and Government,
thus avoiding any occasions for mandatory Government subsidies. Most of TEK's
sales are under a two-part tariff having a fuel-adjustment clause whereby
increases in fuel costs are automatically reccivered from consumers without a
general tariff revision, a provision agreed ir connection with Loan 763-TU.
Asset Revaluation
7.03      Periodic revaluation of assets is necessary to support the automa-
ticity of the tariff adjustment provision and consequent cash generation in-
herent in the rate-of-return earnings objective. TEK's assets, built up from
1948 onwards, are greatly undervalued because of substantial increases in
Turkish prices in the last two decades, as reflected in two devaluations of
the Turkish Lira; the first in 1958 to about a third of its exchange value
(from LT 2.8 to about LT 9 to the US$), and the second in August 1970 by about
40% (from LT 9 to LT 15 to the US$). From the end of 1970 through 1973,
prices again rose about 65%, i.e. about 20% p.a. Law 440 provides for re-
valuation, as does the TEK law for properties transferred to TEK from Etibank
and DSI.
7.04      In November 1970, TEK appointed AY as consultants to recommend inter
alia a method for revaluation of TEK's properties, but pending AY's study, a
basis was agreed between Government, TEK and the Bank for computing TEK's
rates of return for 1970-1972. Annual coefficients based on price changes
were established for revaluation and agreement reached for revaluing the
assets taken over from the Etibank Power Group and DSI as of January 1970,
increasing their net book value by LT 1,464 million. In addition, the ex-
penditure through 1969 on DSI plant brought into service after January 1,
1970, was also revalued to the 1970 price level, the related revaluation sur-
plus of LT 554 million being reflected in the financial statements as and
when the plant would be brought into service. Thus revaluation increased
the asset base by LT 2,018 million. The Loan Agreement under 763-TU requires
TEK:
(a)  to adjust its books by December 31, 1972, to reflect the
agreed asset values after revaluation; and
(b)  to establish revaluation principles satisfactory to the
Bank based on AY's recommendations of April 1972 for com-
puting the return from 1973 onwards.



- 23 -
7.05      The 65% price increase from 1970-enm to 1973-end necessitates a
further revaluation as of 1973-end so that the asset values may be realistic.
The coefficients used for revaluing the assets to the 1970 price level and
those now suggested for a further revaluation to the 1973 price level are
given in Annex 21. As prices change in future, similar revaluations based
on principles acceptable to the Bank would be necessary. During negotiations,
agreement was reached with Government and TEK on satisfactory principles for
revaluation. Actual revision of TEK's books after revaluation as of December
31, 1973, would be a condition of loan effectiveness.
Past Operating Results and Performance Under Existing Covenants
7.06      TEK has not met the rate of return covenant from 1970 (para. 7.01)
mainly because of less-than-expected load growth, slippage of Keban and other
projects, staffing problems, rising employment costs, ineffective management,
a general reluctance to raise tariffs even to catch up with costs, and Govern-
ment's unwillingness to approve tariff increases. In all these years, sales
growth has been well below appraisal estimates, 11% in 1970 vs 18%, 25% in
1971 vs 29%, 21% in 1972 vs 29%, and 10% in 1973 vs 27% mainly because of
less development of industrial load and shortage of power due to slippage
of schemes like Seyitomer, Keban, etc. The covenant also requires TEK to
make up any shortfall in one year within the next two years, to review its
earnings semi-annually in April and September of each year, and to inform
the Bank promptly of the results and the corrective measures proposed. Despite
frequent urging by the Bank, TEK has not complied with this review and report-
ing requirement.
7.07      Annex 22 contains TEK's income statements for the years 1970-72.
Present Financial Condition
7.08      From a debt/equity ratio for the Etibank Power Group of 78/22 for
1968 and 77/23 for 1969 reflecting the dominance of long-term debt as a
source of finance, TEK reached a ratio of 44/56 at 1972-end mainly by trans-
fer of DSI, nuunicipal and Iller Bank assets as constituting part of its capi-
tal following TEK's formation in 1970. At 1972-end, State Investment Bank
(SIB) loans provided 47% of loan capital and foreign loans 52%.
7.09      TEK has always had a cash problem mainly because of slow collection
of receivables despite a 15% discount for payment within one month and a pen-
alty of 1% per month for payments thereafter. Receivables at 1971-end and
1972-end amounted to 37% and 31% of annual revenues, i.e. around four months'
revenues, a very high level. Ankara municipality, the biggest defaulter, owed
nearly LT 153 million at end of November 1973, provoking even thoughts of a
TEK take-over of the municipal assets as provided in the TEK law. Non-payment
of bills by TEK's consumers including Government departments has forced TEK
into arrears in its payments due other Government organizations. Receivables
are also not analyzed regularly according to age and reported to the manage-
ment. TEK will introduce an effective procedure for review of its receivables
and will initiate measures for their prompt collection. Government will also
assist in prompt collection of TEK's dues from Government departments and
municipalities.

7.12      In the discussions between Government and the Bank leading to the
establishment of TEK, it was envisaged that TEK would assume all liabilities
associated with the assets transferred from DSI to help insure realism and
objectivity in power sector planning. However, the TEK law, as finally
enacted, provides for transfer of these installations free of debt, treating
their cost as part of TEK's equity capital.  This substantially reduces TEK's,



- 25 -
debt service liability and thereby raises its income tax liability. It also
raises its cash generation after debt service to a high level (56% after
taxes, of its own capital program in 1973-1981). However, for proper per-
spective, TEK's self-financing level should 3e related to the total capital
expansion requirements of the sector, i.e. including DSI's construction,
for DSI is constructing hydro-electric assets only for their eventutil transfer
to, and use by, TEK. On this basis, TEK's self-financing level would be only
39% in 1973-1981; if the estimated construction expenditure were increased to
allow for a 15% inflationary rate, lower than the current rate, the self-
financing level would be 30%. It would be still lower if TEK were responsible
for servicing the debts related to the DSI assets as originally envisaged.
Government has agreed that it might consider transferring to TEK these debt
service liabilities in 1976. The forecasts also show a cash surplus problem
for TEK in 1979-1981. This is however an illusory picture since the present
inflationary trends (20% or more p.a.) would tend to create greater and
greater need for funds in coming years to finance higher construction costs
and increasing operating expenses. Furthermore, if TEK's funds were used to
finance hydroelectric construction, which would be appropriate, TEK's cash
surplus would be adequately used.
7.13      The US$123 million portion of the proposed Bank loan allocated to
TEK, which has been assumed to bear interest at 7.25% and have a term of 25
years including five years of grace, will meet about 5% of TEK's 1973-1981
construction requirements. Two KfW loans estimated at US$30 million (30 years
including 10 years' grace, 2% interest) and US$29 million (about 15 years in-
cluding about 5 years' grace, 8.75% interest) will meet another 2%, and an
EIB loan estimated at US$78 million (30 years including 8 years' grace, 2.5%
interest) another 3%, and other foreign credits about 27%. Out of the foreign
exchange requirements, reasonable assurance exists only for US$258 million
(the KfW and EIB loans, and bilateral aid from EIB members of US$121 million)
in addition the proposed Bank loan. If the credits are not forthcoming,
Government would have to provide the funds from its own foreign exchange re-
sources.  Government has given an assurance to this effect.

ing interest during construction are:

7.15      Apart from the proposed Uank loan, the KfW and EIB loans and the
credits of bilaterals who are members of EIB are reasonably assured. A further
$14 million could be expected from other credits tied to bid awards, leaving
a gap of about US$96 million which could be covered by Government from its
own resources. The foreign exchange portion of interest during construction
would also be financed by Government from its own resources either as equity
or as loan. As regards the local costs, 50% would be met by Government as
equity and 50% by the SIB as loan at 10% interest.
Financial Forecasts
Future Earnings
7.16      It is unrealistic now to require TEK to make up shortfalls commen-
cing from 1970 strictly according to the covenant because it would mean frme-
diate tariff increases to high levels and subaequent reductions (para. 7.01(b)).
It is clear that a strict adherence to the existing covenant viz. earning an
8% return each year on an asset base, revalued continuously to reflect changing
price levels, at the same time making up past shortfalls, would result in a
tariff level which under present circumstances would be unduly burdensome,
and perhaps also unnecessary to meet the long-term sector needs. The recent
surge in oil prices has further complicated rhe position inasmuch as the
consequent fuel surcharge (para. 7.02) has scared from 3.5 kurus per kWh in
December 1973 and to 15.1 kurus per kWh in January 1974 as against a basic
average tariff of about 24 kurus per kWh, raising the price of electricity to
the consumer 42% in just about two months. In view of the time required for
the economy to adjust itself to such rapid price escalations without disruption,
Government urged, and the Bank agreed, during negotiations that a longer-term
approach for TEK to meet the required 8% return would be in the best interests
of the country. Agreement was therefore reached on the following:
(a)  for making the loan effective, Government will have established
new basic tariffs yielding an average net revenue of 39 kurus
per kWh, the base fuel oil price underlying the tariffs being
set at LT 1,260 per ton, a level which would secure TEK an in-
crease in revenues of about 22%;
(b)  not later than March 15, 1975, Government will establish new
tariffs yielding TEK a net average revenue of 51 kurus per kWh
i.e. a further 31% increase in tariffs;
(c)  not later than March 15, 1976, Government will take all steps
necessary so as to enable TEK to earn in 1976 an 8% return on
an asset base revalued to the 1975 level of prices; and
(d) from 1977 onwards the return will be computed on an. asset base
revalued in accordance with the agreed revaluation principles,
which may involve revaluation to the price level of September of
each year.



- 27 -
7.17      With the above tariff action (assuned in the forecasts), the return
would be 5.7% in 1974 and 7.6% in 1975 and around 12% thereafter on the current
asset base (1970 level), i.e. including the ad hoc revaluation increase agreed
under Loan 763-TU but without a second revaluation to the 1973 price level
(para. 7.05). On an asset base revalued to the 1973 price level, the return
would be 3.5% in 1974, 5.4% in 1975, 9.2% in 1976 and a little over 10% there-
after. With the present inflationary condit':ons (20% or more p.a.) causing
spiralling construction costs and operating expenses, the return would in fact
be much lower on an asset base revalued from time to time. With the steady
addition of large hydroelectric assets requiring comparatively little operating
staff and expenses, the operating ratio would fall from 82% in 1973 to 79% in
1975, and would be 62%/65% in 1976-1981. Annex 22 contains TEK's estimated
income statements for the years 1973-1981. The main assumptions underlying
these income statements are given in Annex 25.
7.18      Increases in wages could raise expenses and reduce operating income
substantially. In order to relieve the recent staff shortage, TEK had made
proposals to Government which would raise wages and salaries by well over
LT 50 million p.a. Government has already sanctioned some measures aimed at
redressing the situation but has not accepted TEK's proposals entirely (para.
6.10). In estimating the above returns, the likely impact of the measures
already taken has been provided for, but with further adjustments of wages
and salaries, the rates of return now estimated would be correspondingly less.
Any such increase in costs should be taken care of through tariff adjustments.
Fuel cost increases, being automatically recoverable through the fuel adjust-
ment clause in the tariffs, would not affect the estimated returns.
Proposed Financial Covenant
7.19      Loan 763-TU requires TEK to earn an 8% return on revalued net fixed
assets and to continue to revalue assets in future as prices change. Any
shortfall in a year is required to be made up within the next two years; an
overrun could be applied to offset any shortfall in one or more of the next
three years. Agreement has been reached with Government and TEK on this
covenant being extended to the proposed loan incorporating also the revalua-
tion principles accepted by the Bank, subject to the interim position for the
period through 1976 (para. 7.16).
7.20      In order to relate the covenant more closely to TEK's cash genera-
tion capability for financing capital expansion, the Bank in supervising the
Project should continuously test TEK's self-financing level including on a
pro forma basis DSI's requirements for hydroelectric development in its cons-
truction requirements and the debts associated with the DSI assets in its
debt service obligations. Should the 8% return only result in a low level of
self-financing of construction expenditure, TEK would be urged to attain a
return higher than the minimum 8%.
7.21      At present, TEK uses in its accounts depreciation rates permitted
for tax purposes but which are substantially higher than those agreed to by
the Bank as minimum rates in Loan 763-TU. Based on AY's recommendations, the



- 28 -
Bank has recommended revised rates to TEK for approval; these are lower than
those now used by TEK but are more realistic considering the service lives of
the assets. Adoption of the lower rates would also improve TEK's rate of re-
turn by a little over 0.5%. Agreement has been reached with TEK on these
depreciation rates being used in the financial statements for the Bank. They
would be used on a proforma basis as TEK is required under the tax law to use
in its books of account the same rates as are used for tax purposes.
Future Financial Position
7.22      Through a steady accretion of earnings of LT 23,433 million and
transfers of DSI assets on being brought into service (Gokcekaya, Keban,
Ayvacik, Oymapinar, Karakaya, etc.) valued at LT 22,112 million as additions
to TEK's capital without any debt liability, TEK's debt/equity ratio changes
from 44/56 at end of 1972 to 2G/80 at end of 1981. The current ratio also
improves from a low of 0.36 at 1974-end to a comfortable 2.41 at end of 1981,
reflecting a steady increase in the cash balance during the period.
7.23      Annex 23 contains TEK's estimated balance sheets as of December 31,
1973-1981.
Debt Limitation Covenant
7.24      The debt covenant under Loan 763-TU stipulates the Bank's prior con-
currence for fresh borrowing of long-term debt from January 1, 1973, unless
TEK's net revenues before depreciation and interest for the fiscal year next
preceding such borrowing or for a later 12-month period ended prior to such
borrowing, shall be at least 1.5 times the maximum debt including the debt to
be incurred. Agreement has been reached on extending this covenant to the
proposed loan.
B.   TKI
Past Operating Results
7.25      Since coal and lignite prices traditionally have been fixed by Gov-
ernment with reference to prices of oil, the competing energy resource, and
not related to the sector needs, TKI has been operating at a loss since 1965
except in 1967 and 1969, the loss being as high as LT 241 million in 1970,
LT 71 million in 1971 and LT 97 million in 1972. Accordingly (para. 7.02)
TKI has been receiving subsidies from Government, that in 1971 being as high
as LT 440 million including also prior years' losses. This pattern of opera-
tions is expected for 1973 as well as in fut9re.
7.26      Condensed Income Statements of TKI for the period 1969-1972 are
given in Annex 26.



- 29 -
Lignite Costs and TEK-TKI Contractual Arrangements
7.27      Proper contractual arrangements require to be made between TEK and
TKI for TKI's lignite sales to TEK setting out fully the basis of lignite
pricing so as to give an adequate return on investment after recovering full
mining costs at Elbistan, providing incentives to TKI to minimize expenses
and penalties to discourage inefficient operations, and avoiding undue fluc-
tuations in lignite prices from month to month on account of widely varying
overburden ratio and removal expenses. Such lignite pricing however involves
difficulties (details in Annex 6) arising from:
(a) long-range variations due to changes in overburden ratio,
lignite characteristics, and rate of production; and
(b) short-range variations due to rate of production, frequency
of intercalations, plant availability, extraction of lumps
for drying, seasonal interruptions and changes in calorific
value.
Varying overburden removal costs could be smoothed out and a uniform rate
determined by capitalizing such expenses and charging to the operations ac-
count on the basis of a predetermined cost allocation rate, with adjustments
at the close of each accounting period. During negotiations, the main provi-
sions of the lignite supply contract covering also the principles governing
Elbistan lignite pricing, were discussed. TEK and TKI will enter into an
agreement in form and substance satisfactory to Government and the Bank for
the sale of lignite to TEK.
Elbistan Lignite Pricing Policies and Rate of Return Covenant
7.28      The principles governing Elbistan lignite pricing would depend on
the rate of return covenant to be made with the Bank for the mining investment.
A covenant with TEK in which the Elbistan mine would be considered a part of
TEK's investment on a pro forma basis, regarding all expenses as related to
TEK and eliminating inter-enterprise transactions, and in which the return
would be computed on an asset base including the mine assets would avoid the
lignite pricing problem. However, this would not be acceptable because of
the difficulties of enforcing a rate covenant with TEK having elements over
which it has no control. Similarly, a covenant binding TKI to earn an ade-
quate return on all its operations would also not be acceptable since it
would involve the Bank in the Government's general pricing policies for coal
and lignite before having an opportunity to study the matter in depth. A
rate of return covenant providing say, an 8% return only on the Elbistan
investment (if the mine were TEK's, the 8% return in the TEK law would have
applied) could however secure the desired objectives. The return should be
computed on the original cost of investment, as revalued from time to time in
accordance with the principles agreed with the Bank (para. 7.05), since a
return based on a progressively diminishing value of assets without any ex-
pansion of investment would distort the earnings picture. This should not
be difficult since the Elbistan mine would be administered as a separate



- 30 -,
establishment in TKI under Law 440 with separate legal status and finances.
Government, TEK (being affected by the lignite prices) and TKI will so fix
the lignite price as to give a minimum return of 8X on TKI's original Elbistan
mining investment as revalued from time to time.
7.29      For the purpose of these forecasts, a sale rate of LT 50.51 per
ton giving an 8% return on the present estimated investment has been assumed
(Annex 27). With revaluation to cover inflation, the sale price would prog-
ressively increase in the future.
Financing Plan

- 31 -
7.31      The proposed Bank loan of US$25 million, assumed to have a term of
25 years with five years' grace, would finance 8% of the expenditure and the
KfW and EIB loans 22% and 4% respectively. The balance of the foreign ex-
change requirements would be met from tied credits ($47 millioa) or from
Government's own resources ($22 million). Government has agreed that any
shortfall in foreign exchange financing would be met from its own resources.
As regards rocal costs, 50% would be covered by SIB with a 20-year loan in-
cluding five years' grace at 10% interest and 50% by Government equity con-
tribution. Interest during construction would be financed by Government
either as equity or as loan.  TKI woulc not provide any self-financing stnce
its other operations do not generate any funds for the purpose.
8. PRINCIPAL CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01      Government will:
(a) establish project coordination arrangements satisfactory to
the Bank defining clearly the role of the consultants (para.
4.15);
(b) establish, within the same period and after obtaining the
Bank's views, an alternative facility yielding comparable
benefits, should the dried lignite scheme prove to be not
feasible (para. 5.05);
(c) let TEK and TKI hire staff on contract should such recruit-
ment appear necessary in the opinion of the Bank (paras. 6.08 -
6.11 and 6.20);
(d) assist TEK in ensuring prompt collection of its receivables
from Government departments and municipalities (para. 7.09);
(e) consider transferring to TEK the debt service liabilities
related to the DSI assets to help earn the required 8% re-
turn from 1976 onwards (para. 7.12);
(f) provide the funds from its own foreign exchange resources in
the event the expected bilateral aid and suppliers' credits
for the Project are not forthcoming (paras. 7.13 and 7.31);
(g) establish tariffs as agreed with the Bank in the period through
December 31, 1975 and thereafter take all steps necessary to
enable TEK to earn the required 8% return on a revalued asset
base (para. 7.16).
8.02      TEK will:



- 32 -
(a) complete its reorganization based on Edf's recommendations
according to a tPme-bound plan, and in amanner satisfactory
to the Bank, centralizing also accounting and finance functions
in one unit (para. 6.04);
(b) introduce an effective procedure for analysis of receivables
and initiate measures for their prompt collection (para. 7.09);
(c) use revised depreciation rates in the financial statements for
the Bank (para. 7.21).
8.03      lCB has been accepted by the Bank as independent auditors on the
understanding that its audit would include all the items mentioned in the
Terms of Rsference furnished by the Bank, and the Bank would have the right
to reconsider this arrangement during the period of the loan (para. 6.15).
8.04      TKI will:
(a)  establish the dried lignite scheme (para. 5.05);
(b) set up, by end of 1974, a separate establishment within its
organization under Law 440 for administering construction
and operation of the Elbistan mine (para. 6.18); and
(c) send the Bank annual financial statements for the Elbistan
unit, and consolidated statements for TKI, duly audited by
auditors satisfactory to the Bank within five months after
the close of each year (para. 6.21).
8.05      During negotiations, Government and TEK have agreed:
(a) to have revaluation of TEK's assets carried out according
to the principles accepted by the Bank to redetermine TEK's
asset values as at end of 1973 and thereafter (paras. 7.04
and 7.05); and
(b) to the rate of return covenant under Loan 763-TIJ being ex-
tended to the proposed loan incorporating also these re-
valuation principles (para. 7.19).
8.06      Government and TKI will so fix the Elbistan lignite price as to
give a minimum 8% return on the original Elbistan mine investment as revalued
from time to time (para. 7.28).
S.07      For contracts valued in excess of $2 million and not financed by
the Bank, TEK and TKI will inform the Bank in advance of the procurement pro-
cedures and furnish to the Bank the bid documents, evaluation report and
copies of the contracts (para. 4.13).



- 33 -
S. 08     TEK and TKI will enter into a lignite supply contract in form and
susstance satisfactory to Government and the Bank, covering also the prin-
cirles governing Elbistan lignite pricing (para. 7.27).
&.09      Tne Bank has informed Government of its view that:
(a)  one of TEK's Assistant General Managers or an official of
equivalent rank should be made solely responsible for the
management of its accounting and finance divisions (para.
6.05); and
(b)  in future, TEK's GM should normally be appointed for a period
of at least three years (para. 6.06).
8.10      Establishment of satisfactory project coordination arrangements
(para. 4.15), actual revision of TEK's books after asset revaluation as of
December 31, 1973 (para. 7.05) and establishment of new basic electricity
supply tariffs yielding TEK an average net revenue of 39 krs per kWh (para.
7.16) would he conditions of loan effectiveness. Since the financing plan
as finally agreed requires joint financing of discrete project components
with other agencies, appropriate cross-effectiveness clauses have been in-
cluded in the loan agreement.
8.11      Subject to the foregoing, the Project is suitable for a Bank loan
of US$123 million to TEK and US$25 million to TKI for a term of 25 years in-
cluding 5 years' grace with Government as the Guarantor.

ELBISTAN PROJECT
MINE
DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT
An open cast mine is to be established on the Kislakoy section of
the Elbistan-Afsin lignite deposit which was discovered in a special geological
survey in 1968. This part forms the north east section of the field and is
estimated to contain about 500 million tons of mineable coal. Other parts of
the Elbistan-Afsin deposit are believed to hold a multiple of this tonnage, but
under less favorable mining conditions.
The field has been explored by systematic drilling and is characterized
by rather wide variations in overburden ratio and quality of lignite, the latter
varying horizontally as well as vertically.  The average thickness of the lignite
seam is about 40 metres, but it is interrupted by several interlayers of varying
thickness. The overburden ratio, i.e. the thickness of the overburden to coal
over the wiole field to be worked is 2.76 to 1 including the intercalations.
The deposit is bordered on the east side by a Karst-type mountain
range, the Kizildag which rises some 500 metres above the plain. This mountain
contains unspecified amounts of water which.connected through aquifers.might
affect the safety of the open cut. This and similar geological features
characterizing the plain have received the special attention of the hydrological
section of the consultants. Rheinbraun Consulting, the consultants who are
highly qualified in the problem of dewatering similar open outs are satisfied
that the method proposed, namely the lowering of the hydrostatic level in the
border area by pumping, the proposed arrangement of wells and pumps and the money
provided for this work are adequate to meet the situation. The exploration work
on this sector continues and up to September 1973 the results of the piezometric
findings in the central area have shown nothing unforeseen. In fact, they have
been consistently better than the first assumptions. The work is continuing.
The lignite is of low quality, having an average moisture content
in sita of about 57% and an ash content of 16% with calorific values varying
between 800 and 1600 kcal/kg. A minimum value of 950 kcal/kg has been selected
for the proper function of the boiler plant and a mixing bunker of approximately
one million tons capacity is to be provided to meet unforeseen bad patches during
mining operations and on the whole help to supply an even grade of lignite to the
power station.
Mining is to be carried out by continuous operation type machines.
There are six shovel wheel dredges and five stackers for overburden. The
material is to be transported by a system of conveyor belts first to an outside
high level dump and laTer to worked out parts of the cut. The lignite is taken
to the power station or the drying plant via the mixing bunker by means of belt
conveyors, which are best suited to overcome the considerable differences in
height between the various levels. A conveniently located central station
enables the overburden or coal to be directed where required. At the same time
the ash from the power station is returned to the dump area by similar means.



ANNEX 3
Page 2 of 5
The saeaction of dredges and other major equipment is restricted
To types wh:-ch have proved satisfactory in similar circumstances. The capacity
of -the proposed r ning equipment is ample to maintain the rated output under all
foreseeable conditions,
The mining plan itself is designed to take account of the variations
in overburden thickness, inasmuch as the central sector of the field has a
more favorable overburden ratio than in the southern section, where the depth
of the cut increases considerably. In this area the direction of the cut
changes to -t]he west and it becomes necessary to dump more overburden outside
the cut.  This has been provided for.
The south-west of the Kislakoy field borders on a narrower deposit,
the so-called "korridor"  which contains substantial further lignite reserves.
The frequent intercalations of dead material interrupting the coal
deposit will be excavated by the dredge in a selective operation and the contents
will be dumped over the same conveyor belt system used for the coal and for
overburden (O/B).
Specific loading of the caterpillars cSrrying the dredgers, stackers,
etC. is limited to the low figure of 1 kg per cm to take account of the
reduced bearing capacity of certain parts of the overburden consisting of
yttia, a moist marl-like material of soft consistency.  The mining plan from
NNE to SSW and later the turn to WSW is conditioned by the outline of the
deposit and fally considered over its extent. These soil conditions preclude
the use of heavy, wheeled, earth-moving equipment.
Since the submission of the preliminary report of the consultants
in September 1972, a number of the unsolved questions have been brought nearer
to certainty. They were cited before as:
(a) Quality of lignite
Additional samples and analyses have been obtained under standard
conditions. They are being supplemented. The average heat value of the samples
obtained in 1972 has shown a higher moisture content and a lower calorific value
of the lignite than the former averages. Therefore the figures used have been
adjusted. The final figures of these values cannot be determined to any high
degree of certainty since drainage conditions in the cut, the effect of exposure
to atmosphere and many other variables enter to influence these values. The
present figures adopted are very safe.
(b) Proper cfies of Ash
It is still to be expected that the ash composition will vary in an
indeterminate way and any future information becoming available should be passed
on to the boi_er manufacturers without delay. The boiler specifications as at
present published do not cover the present full range.
(c) Scil x'.hanancs
Little is known about the features of the gyttia apart from the fact
that the samples obtained from the shaft where it penetrated to the gyttia layer
epoear to allay tha fears of uncontrollable consistency.  The limit of bearing
load selected now should be reasonably safe.

(d) Hydrology
The fact that the 1973 boring campaign has given consistently better
res.ts tnan formerly anticipated is a further warranty against unexpected
adverse surprises. During the last few months a more detailed program has
seen developed (within the framework of the earlier estimates) how to deal
with the greater part of the Karst-wate r by dewatering the Kizildag towards
the eastern range and thus diverting the water to the east. Whilst there
remain some unsolved factors, the work to make the Kislakoy open cut safe
against serious water inflow is progressing well. Within the limit of the
original plan no further difficulties are likely to be encountered requiring
additional capital.
Mine Capacity
The balanced supply-&dmand rate of production has been fixed at
20.0 million tons p.a.2IWith th(i addition of 2.8 million annually for the drying
plant, this leaves 17.2 million tons p.a. for the power station. For desired higher
load factors, the quantity on equal efficiency etc. would be (Fichtner, 3/128).
---------Tons p.ae -----------------
Total (+2.8)
75%          15.5 million            20.3 million
74%          17.2 million            20.0 million

85%          19.8 million            22.6 million
The present plan provides for a working time of 5,000 hours p.a.,
and sufficient capacity to obtain above quantity (20 million tons p.a.). It
should be possible without great strain to increase the working hours as shown
hereunder:
Million tons p.a.   kbrking hours            L.F.    %
20.0              4950                57.0   1.0
20.3              5000                57.6   0
21.4              5280                60.2 + 4.5
22.6              5580                63.5 +-10.1
Operation on increased load factors
The capacity of the excavating equipment is based on 5000 hours working
time p.a. which appears safe but low. This calculation takes account of the
reduced output of the dredges during the selective operation, when eliminating
intercalatious layers. In the planning of the operation it is intended to move
separately any dead layers about 50 cm thickness in which case about 15 cm above
and below would be discharged to dump. Much will depend on the skill and care of
tt.e  dredge personnel to achieve this but these limits are by no means exceptional.
Thie load factor of the mining equipment has been calculated to 5000
hours p.a. with due regard to the reduction during the selective mining.
This appears to be eminently safe.
1/ Assumes a mean long-term calorific value of 1,090 kcal/kg. Recently it has
been judged that the mean long-term calorific value is likely to be 1,050
kcal/kg which would require a mean extraction rate of 20.7 million tons p.a.
to supply the power plant at 74% load factor plus 2.8 illion tons for the
dried fuel operation.

In fact one should expect that on request production could be
increased by 10 per cent at least during the operation in favorable condi ions
and relative freedom of intercalations.  Due to the varying sequence of the
overburden, a somewhat diificult period can be expected in the year 1990 and
thereafter, but the rated oultput of 20 million p.a. should be easily
maintained over the whole life of the mine.
An examination of the probable load available to the power stit.ion
within the whole Turkish system has shown that given the availability, the load
factor could be materially increased. It has therefore to be assumed that
during the normal operation of equipment the annual output could be increased by
extending the working hours up to 22.6 million tons p,a.
Various possibilities exist to cope with the change in 0/B ratio in
the southern part of the Kislakoy field. From the various alternatives the
consultants select the variant which is tied to the maintenance of a coal
production of 20 million tons p.a. At the same time they have investigated
the possibility of increasing the annual production should it be possible to find
additional outlets for quantities above 20 million tons p.a., but in no case
do they anticipate extending the operation beyond the limits fixed more or less
arbitrarily at the end of the 1islakoy field. In the study of Dr. Gold the
'korridor",which evidently has not yet been fully explored, is given an 0/B ratio
not unlike the southern part of the Kislakoy field, although it appears that the
width of the deposit shrinks, thus making for less favorable mining conditions
by shortening the useful length of the cut.
Considering the very large gains which are to be expected by mining
the quantities necessary to increase the load factor of the power station, this
strict limitation (at one time they speak of the lifetime of the power station
being reduced by exploiting the Kislakoy field prematurely) is not justified.
The estimated 506 million tons in the Kislakoy field as determined by
the consultants will provide sufficient coal at 74 per cent load factor for 25
years with 20 million tons annual production.
On an 80 per cent load factor, the amount per year would increase to
21.4 million tons. At this rate, the reserve would be exhausted within 23.6 years
or would require an extra 30 million tons of coal for 25 years. On an 85 per cent
load factor and an annual demand of 22.6 million tons it would be exhausted in
22.4 years and would require an additional 59 million tons.
It has been assumed that during the normal operation of the equipment,
the annual output could be increased to 22.6 million tons by longer working hours.
The question now arises, how and at w1lt extra cost the additional
30 or 59 million tons could be extracted from the'korridor"and what extra ccs:
should be allowed for to remove the excess overburden which exists in rhe1co-rd-or.
Dr. Gold's report gives an overburden:intercalation:lignite ratio of
2.8:0.28:1 for the southern part of the Kislakoy field. In valuing these ratios,from
a mining point of view, the conditions in the"korridor"seem not any worse than
those in the southern part of the Kislakoy '.eld, comparing both O/B and inter-

calations expecially if the given heat values are considered (1,000 Kcal/Xg in the
Kislakoy field against 1,165 Kcal/Kg in the"'korridor'. In any case it is
obviously possible, and of considerable economic advantage, to plan for the
mining of this additional coal.
It is further clear that this question will only become acute around
the year 2000 and it is doubtful whether detailed accounts can be taken of
these matters at this stage of planning.
To repeat the problem, there are two interrelated factors which have
to be considered in assessing the changed economics of the project as a whole.
Due to the proven possibility to absorb the output of the Elbistan power plant
on an increased load factor of up to 85 per cent economically in the system
and the agreed availability of the power plant in excess of this figure, it
becomes imperative to be able to mine up to 22.6 million tons of lignite per
year. It is believed that the equipment at present provided will allow this.
But at the same time such sustained rate of coal production will
exhaust the reserve at present envisaged before 25 years, the planned life of
the power station. It would require an additional 59 million tons of lignite.
Furthermore any extension of the life of the power station beyond 25 years say
to 30 years would need additional coal. This coal exists in the so called
'korridor" between the Kislakoy and the Collolar fields. According to the
findings of Dr. Gold it contains sufficient coal of some slightly higher calorific
value but under less favorable mining conditions.  The increase in power and
lignite output could mean a decisive economic benefit to the project.
In now assessing this favorable plan it is sufficient to provide for
the extra cost of the O/B removal during the last few years of the operation.
The technical solution can be left to a later stage.  For the required 59
million tons after the year 2000, an O/B ratio of 3.0:1 must be expected
compared to 2.8:1 in the southern part of the Kislakoy field, equivalent to
about an additional 12 million cubic meters. This would have to be taken to an
outisde dump.
It is immaterial at this stage how these 12 million cubic meters are
to be excavated and moved. It is a comparatively small amount. It could be
mined independently by contractor or in the course of normal operation w.ith
existing equipment.  The cost should not exceed 14 LT/m3.  Hence an amouint of
168 million LT should be added to the O&M costs, spread over the last 3 years
of operation, the years 2001-2003. Otherwise the cost per ton of lignite has
not changed.
The calculations presented here were based only on coal extraction with-
out detailed consideration of O/B removal and the great variations in O/B ratios
of the field itself and into the"1korridor"  It requires a much more detailed
investigation to optimize the work plan for the mine as a whole for the increased
output. This applies similarly to the extension of the lifetime of the power
station to 30 years.

Lignite Costs and TEK-TKI 2ontractual Arrangements
Variations in costs of lignite energy are caused by the following
factors:
(1) Long range variations due to:
(a) Changing 0/B ratio
(b) Change in calorific value
(c) Rate of production
(2) Short range variation due to:
(a) Rate of produ6tion
(b) Frequency of intercalations
(c) Plant availability
(d) Extraction of lumps to Fleissner plant
(e) Seasonal interruptions
(f) Change in calorific values
There is a close interaction of these factors and their control.
Disregarding the change in boiler efficiency due to varying calorific
values of coal supplied we have the following possible variations:
(1) TEK constant energy demand, decreasing calorific value,
increasing lignite demands as a result, increased production.
Normally lower cost to TKI per ton of coal delivered.
(2) TEK increased energy demand, constant calorific value,
increased production, lower cost per ton of coal delivered.
(3) TEK constant energy demand, constant calorific value,
increased 0/B ratio,or increased intercalations, increased
cost to TKI per ton of coal delivered.
The problem:
A contractual arrangement which enables TEK to make use of the lower
marginal costs of lignite production, and by iusing lower or lowering fuel costs
in Elbistan to select the optimum loading of Elbistan,should be one of the aims.
On the other hand TEK has to protect itself against undue calorific value or
other quaality fluctuations, whereby at constant energy demand lignite require-
ments in tonnage might change.
At the same time TKI has to cover cost variations due to changing
energy demands, and therefore changing lignite demands, change in 0/B ratio or
intercalation ratio, change in calorific values.



ANNEX c'
Pag,e ^ of
In regard to calorific value and O/B intercalation ratios, TKI can
do little to level out fluctuations, apart from securing a level above the
critical 940 Kcal/kg limit. Other factors are uncontrol able bv- ordinary
means.
Against the breaking through the 950 Kcal/kg limits, TIU can
safeguard itself by: (a) selective reclaiming from dump, (b) mining on
different levels, (c) stopping supplies to drying plant. This latter is
based on the assumption that lump coal has a higher calorific value than
run of mine coal, which is likely but not yet proved.
In such unavoidable cases, where the 950 limit is broken, heavy
penalties from TEK to TKI are justified to pay for oil support.   i-Jecticn of
coal is not feasible.
It can be easily seen that the number of uncontrollable variables
create difficulties to devise a. satisfactory contractual arrangement between
the parties. The introduction of calorific value as a major factor into the
price, whilst it may be unavoidable, has the great disadvantage of possible
error. Sampling and analysis introduce a degree of uncertainty which expressed
in percentage would cause a wide fluctuation in price, and doubts irn the price
level. An example of TKI's existing contract for supply of ligrlite to TEK's
Izmir Power Station is annexed.
There is some compensation in the fact that if sliding scale
allowances are made by TKI to TEK for quantity, a certain benefit would arise
for TEK from the increased tonnage at unchanged total energy level.
It is suggested that one uncertain factor can be removed by assuming a
constant O/B ratio over a lengthy period and debit TKI pro rata per ton of
coal. This practice is common in other open cuts.
Adjustment can be made annually or over longer intervals.
Writing off of initial ren oval can also be done over a long period
unless this charge is capitalized, in which case it wll be eliminated in
another manner.



ANNEX 6
Page 3 of 3
Example of TKI's Existing Contract for Supply of Lignite to TEK's
Izmir Power Station
It relates to Lignite from Soma to the Izmir power station.
(1) Size requirements 0-2 mm should be less than 28%
(2) Basis for ash content as delivered is 17% and the basis for
moisture content is 22%
(3) Base price f.o.b. 105 LT/ton ex mine
(4) Three samples are taken simultaneously from the loading
point every day. One to TKI, one to TEK, and one is storedi.
If the analyses disagree, the third sample will be analyzed
by outside agency
(5) Penalties (they are based on a weekly average)
H20 + 1% moisture ± 1% price variation LT/t
Ash + l% ash        + 2% price variation LT/t
(6) Additionally, if moisture content exceeds 22%, quantity
reduction by 1% l/.
(7) Total ash and moisture should be below 45 per cent, against
an average of 49%.
(8) If ash and moisture exceeds 45% two weeks average is allowed.
If this still exceeds 45%, penalty for each per cent in excess
is 5% of the price (it does not say  which price).
1/ Comment: This clause (6) is not quite clear.  It may be that i, protects
TEK against excessive moisture which might be caused by other than
uncontrollable factors.

ELBISTAN PROJECT
Forecast Electricity Sales ard Generation
TEK Forecast
1.        TEK is responsible under the law for preparing forecasts of
electricity demand for the whole of Turkey. It has experimented with
various techniques of forecasting, including simple extrapolation and
econometric methods. Its present method is based on establishing the
past trend of kWh sales to each customer served (excluding major indus-
trial consumers) and making ten-year projections for each customer based
on these trends. Customers are grouped by sub-stations and the sub-
stations by geographical regions. The resulting figures are aggregated
for each region. Separate projections are made for major industrial
consumers including projected new industries, using information supplied
by the Ministries or State Economic Enterprises concerned, supplemented
by TEK's own contacts with industry. To the resulting projection of
total TEK sales are added projected sales by the two concessionary
companies (CEAS and KEPSZ), isolated municipal undertakings and auto-
producers to give a forecast of total sales for Turkey. The corresponding
projection of total production is obtained by adding estimated own con-
sumption by power stations and transmission losses, The projected totals
are finally checked, and revised as necessary, in the light of other Gov-
ernment plans and projections related to the development of the various
sectors of the economy and the regions.
2.        TEK's current projection on this basis to 1982, covering the
period of the next two five-year economic plans for Turkey, is shown at
Table 1 of this annex. For the subsequent five years, covering the final
quinquennium (1983-1987) of the Gcvernmentts long-term perspective plan of
economic development, TEK has made an indicative forecast as follows:
1981    1984   12C85   1986    1987
Total electricity generation, GWh    1.,600  46,200  51,300  56,700  62,600
3.        The TEK forecast implies an average annual growth of 114-1% in
1972-77, declining to 11.5% in 1"77-82 and 10.8% in 1982-87, The average
growth rate over the whole perio. 1972-87 is 12.1% p.a., which compares
with an actual average over the ten-year period 1962-1972 of 12.2% p.a.
4.        This continuation of a relatively high rate of increase of power
demand seems reasonably consistent with the present stage of development of
the Turkish econoay and its projected future growth. Given the expected
fairly rapid rate of population increase of about 2.5% p,a., it implies a
rise in electricity production Ter capita from the 1972 level of 300 kWh
to 1,150 kWh in 1987. This would mean that at the latter date Turkey would
reach the level achieved by Spain in 1966, which does not appear an unduly
ambitious expectation.



ANNEX 8
Page 2 of 4
5.        The mission checked particularly on the TEK projection of major
industrial loads (see Table 2 of this annex) by discussions with the Min-
istries and industries concerned. These confirmed that the projected increases
were based on definite expansion plans, where they related to existing plants,
and thatN the new plants shown in the projection had either been sanctioned or
were at an advanced stage of planning. In some cases, the mission found that
the projections understated industry's own expansion plans, although these
additional requirements would be conditional on TEK's ab-lity to meet them.
Alternative Forecast
6.        Although the TEK forecast is regarded as reasonable in relation
to the projected development of the Turkish economw, to allow for uncertainty
an alternative forecast was made based on the following more pessimistic
assumptions:
(a) a 10% slower rate of growth in regional electricity demand than
projected by TEK; and
(b)  an average slippage of one year in the additional major industrial
loads projected by TEK.
7.        This resulted in the following projection of total electricity
production, ccopared with the TEK projection:

TURKISH EIECTRICITY AUTHOR2ry (TEK)
ELBISTAN PROJECT
Comparison of Alternative 1/
Alternative Development Strategies
1.        TEK has carried out a number of studies in recent years to
determine the optimum future development of the power system in Turkey.
The resources available for this purpose are hydro, lignite, residual
fuel oil and nuclear energy. i   The broad conclusion of these studies
was that the optimum investment program would involve a balanced devel-
opment of the country's hydro and lignite resources in preference to oil
and nuclear energy over the next fifteen years. This conclusion was
s-upported by an independent Bank study in 1971-72 using a linear program-
ming model developed in the Bank.
2.        Following the completion in 1972 of the consultants' report on
the proposed Elbistan developments TEK undertook more detailed studies
with a view to confirming its place and timing in the optimum development
strategy in the light of its estimated costs in comparison with the alterna-
tives and of the latest forecast of electricity demand In Turkey. The most
recent of these studies (TEK report PKD-102, dated July 1973) compared
thirteen different strategies for power development in Turkey covering the
period to 1987. All these strategies incorporated the same hydro sites for
development, as determined by previous studies. Another constraint common
to all the alternatives considered was the assumption that the earliest
date for introduction of the first commercial nuclear station would be 1984;
given the lack of any nuclear experience in Turkey, this is a reasonable
assumption.
3e        The TEK study confirmed that, on the load forecast adopted,
further thermal capacity would be needed in 1978 and that the choice lay
between a development program incorporating the Elbistan Project in 1978-
80 and an alternative program in which equivalent oil-fired capacity was
substituted for Elbistan. The study concluded in favor of the program
incorporating Elbistan and a pre-appraisal study in the Bank, based an
the data in the TEK study, supported this conclusion.
Comparison of Alternatives
4.        The alternative to the program including the Elbistan Project
would be a program similar in all respects except that an equivalent
amount of oil-fired capacity would be substituted for the 1,200 MW
Elbistan station. The equivalent oil-fired station would be only 1,100 MW
(2 x 400 MW plus 1 x 300 MW), in view of its lower consumption for station
auxiliaries and the fact that it would not have to supply power for the
lj  bee note, page 7.
P/ There are also resources of geothermal anergy but their suitability for
electricity generation has yet to be confirmed and their contribution is
not expected to be significant.

lignite mine. The program including Elbistan would have a significantly higher
capital cost than the alternative but would involve lower system running costs.
The method adopted, therefore, was to find the discount rate which equalizes
the present worths of the cost streams of the alternatives over 25 years (the
estimated life of the Elbistan mine) on the assumptions adopted for the main
variables, as described below.
Assumptions
5.        The main variables in the comparison are capital costs, station
plant factor, oil price and load growth.  To allow for uncertainty, a
range of values was adopted and probability factors assigned to each value,
as follows:
(a) Capital Costs
As for the Elbistan Project, a cost estimate at September 1973
prices for the oil-fired station of US$262 million equivalent was obtained
from the consultants. In agreement with them, higher and lower capital
costs were also assumed as follows for the purpose of the evaluation:
Elbistan mine                - 10%
+  5%
Elbistan power station       + 5%
Oil-fired station           +  5%
The lower value assumed for the lower limit of the mine's capital cost
reflects the consultants' view that their base estimate for this part
of the Project might be particularly conservative. Equal probabilities
were assigned to each of the three values assumed for the capital costs
of each item.
(b) Station Plant Factor
The consultants had assumed a 74% plant factor.for the Elbistan
power station, which is the basis of the station's annual requirement cef
17.2 million tons of lignite. In their latest study of the Project
(PKD-102) TEK had assumed a 65% plant factor. Since the comparison of
the program including Elbistan with the alternative development including
an oil-fired station is sensitive to the plant factor assumed for the
Elbistan station, the Bank appraisal mission reviewed this question with
particular care. The consultants cornfirmed that there was no technical
reason why the Elbistan plant should not have an annual availability of
90% or more. In view of its low incremental costs, there will be a strong
incentive to operate it up to the limit of its availability. However, for
the present purpose, this was taken as 85% and, to allow for uncertainties,
the following range of values was adopted for the plant factor of the Elbistark
station:
Plant Factor     74%      80%        85%
Probability      0.2.     o.4        0.5
No difficulty is envisaged in mining the additional lignite needed for the
Elbistaz station at plant factors above 74% but this will involve extra
costs which have been allowed for in the comparison.



AN-EX F
Page 3 of 1l
Given the limitations on future bydro develupment and on the rate
at which nuclear capacity can be absorbed into the system, the Elbistan
station is expected to operate on base load over its life in view of its
low fuel costs and the projected growth of the base load. Thus, even if
installed nuclear capacity reached 15,000 Mt in 1990-05, this would still
represent no more than 50% of the base load at that time.
If the oil-fired alternative is chosen in preference to Elbistan
(i.e. the Elbistan lignite deposit is not developed for power generation),
it would not operate at base load in the early years of its life, owing
to the relatively small base load at that time and its high fuel costs.
With the subsequent growth in the base load, however, and the limitations
on hydro and nuclear installation, as indicated above, a portion of the
base load will have to be met by oil-fired capacity if this is installed
in preference to Elbistan. It has been assumed, therefore, for the pur-
pose of the comparison that the oil-fired alternative to Elbistan would
operate to the full extent of its availability from about 1987 onwards.
(c) Load Growth
The current TEK load forecast (see Annex 8) has been adopted for
the purpose of the comparison but the effect of assuming the lower projec-
tion given in Annex 8 has also been tested.
(d) Oil Price
The oil-fired alternative to Elbistan would use high-sulphur
residual fuel oil. At present fuel-oil reqtirements are largely met from
Turkish refineries., using mainly imported crude, but imports of fuel oil
are expected to grow, and a large oil-fired station would be dependent on
foreign sources of supply. At the time of the appraisal (i.e, before the
October/December 1973 increases in world oil prices) TPAO (the state petrol-
eum comparn) quoted different prices for _½4 sulphur fuel oil according to
the source of supply e.g. for oil shipped from Italy, the cheapest source of
supply, the landed price (excluding duty) in Turkey worked out at about
US$20/ton, compared with US$25/ton for oil shipped from the Persian Gulf.
To allow for uncertainties, the following values with assigned probabilities
were adopted as covering the likely range of possibilities (all prices ex-
pressed in 1973 US dollars):
Rate of increase
1980 Price             % p.a.
US $/ton      1980-1 5    Post-1985       Probability
25            1.5         1.0              0e2
28            3.0         2.0              o.4
35            4.0         2.5              o.4
The rates of increase assumed after 1980 imply prices (in 1973 dollars) by
the end of the century of US$32, US$45 and US$65 respectively.

(e)  Foreign Exchange
The current official exchange rate of LT lh = TJS$l is thought to
reflect reasonably well the scarcity value of foreign exchange and has there-
fore been adopted for valuing the foreign exchange costs (capital and operat-
ing) of the alternatives.
(f) Unskilled Labor
There is a surplus of unskilled labor in Turkey and this is
expected to persist over the foreseeable future.  A shadow price of half
the money wage has therefore been adopted for valuing the unskilled labor
inputs of the alternatives.
Results of Comparison
6.        The alternative developments were compared for the different
values of the main variables using the discounted cash flow method, This
was done in two ways, firstly by finding the discount rates which equal-
ized the present worths of the respective cost streams, and secondly, by
finding the net present value of the cost streams at a discount rate of
11% (assumed to approximate the opportunity cost of capital in Turkey).
Assuming the main load forecast adopted for the appraisal, this meant that
twenty-seven different cases had to be compared. The results are sunmarized
in Table 1 at pages 7-9 of this Annex. For simplicity a net benefit stream,
representing the difference between the cost streams for the two alternatives,
is given for each case. This is negative in the early years because of the
higher capital costs of the development incorporating Elbistan but positive
in subsequent years because of the savings in operating costs of this devel-
opment compared with the alternative.
7.        It will be seen from the table that the equalizing discoumt rate
ranges from 8.3% to 12.1% and the present worth of the net benefits of the
Elbistan development at 11% discount rate from - LT 2,250 million (i.e. a
cost penalty of this amount against Elbistan) to LT 472 million. Using the
probabilities assigned to the different values assumed for the main variables
in para. 5 above, it is possible to compute the mean expected value of the
equalizing discount rate (r), together with the mean expected value of the
present worth of net benefits (or excess costs, since it turns out to be
negative) of the Elbistan development at 11% discount rate, These were found
to be as follows:
Mean expected value of r:                 8.8%
Mean expected value of present worth
of excess costs of Elbistan at 11%
discount rate:                          LT 789 million
8.        The mean value of 8.8% is on the low side. However, it is not a
correct indication of the expected return on the extra capital outlay re-
quired for the Elbistan development compared with the oil-fired alternative
because it does not take into account:



ANNEX 9
Pa- 5 of 15
(a)  the fact tha-t part (2.8 million tons) of the output of the
Elbistan mine, all of which has been debited to the Elbistan
Project in the above comparison, will in fact be used to
produce dried lignite for commercial sale, the net benefits
of which should be credited to the Elbistan development in
comparing it with the oil alternative; and
(b) the risk of interruption of the imported fuel oil on which the
oil-fired station, if chosen, would be dependent.
Dried Lignite Benefits
9.       With regard to para. 8 (a), the net benefits from the proposed
sale of dried lignite in Eastern Turkey have been estimated as described
in Annex 10. The direct benefits, which result from the substitution of
dried lignite for existing fuels, amount to about LT 126 million p.a. The
indirect benefits arising from the use as agricultural fertilizer of the
substituted animal nanure at present burned as fuel are estimated at about
LT 175 million p.a.
Risk of Interruption of Oil Supplies
10.       With regard to para. 8 (b), recent events have underlined the risk
involved in dependence on imported oil, which has to be taken into account
in evaluating the oil-fired alternative to Elbistan. The cost of insuring
against the risk that supplies may be cut off, as has happened at periodic
intervals over the last twenty years, may be reckoned as the present worth
of a stock of oil, including construction and maintenance of the necessary
storage facilities, considered adequate to keep the oil-fired station runn-
ing over any likely period of interruption of normal supplies. The cost of
a six months' stock, which is regarded as the desirable level to guard against
this contingency, is estimated at about LT 560 million in present worth terms.
This is a legitimate additional cost to debit against the fuel-oil alternatuve.
11.       To take account of the additional benefits and costs referred to in
paras. 9 and 10 it is necessary to adjust the cost streams of the alternative
developments accordingly. For this purpose, two separate sets of cost streams
were determined, In the first set the Elbistan development was credited with
the direct dried lignite benefits of LT 126 million p.a. referred to in para.
9 and the fuel-oil development was debited with the cost of the six-months'
oil stock referred to in para. 10; in the second set, the Elbistan develop-
ment was credited in addition with the indirect dried lignite benefits of
LT 175 million p.a. The corresponding net benefit streams for the various
cases considered are shown in Tables 2 and 3 of this Annex. As seen from
Table 2, the range of the equalizing discount rate if the direct dried lignite
benefits and the oil stock costs are taken into account is from 7.3A -
Table 3 shows that, if the indirect dried lignite benefits are also inc'uded,
the range is 9.9% - 16.3%.  Using the assigned probabilities for t1he main
variables given in para. 5, the corresponding probability distributions of
the equalizing discount rate (r) and its mean expected value, together with
the mean expected present values of the net benefits of the Elbistan devel-
opment at 11% discount rate were calculated as shown below:

stock costs

10-15                        0.79
15-20                        0.20
Mean expected value of r:                       13.4%
Mean expected present value of net
benefits at 11% discount rate:         LT 1,030 million
Conclusion
12.       Summing up, therefore, the mean expected value of the equalizing
discount rate is 11.3%, if the direct dried lignite benefits and oil stock
costs are included, and 13.4% if the indirect dried lignite benefits are
also taken into account.  Putting it another way, the Project shows a mean
expected present value of benefits at 11% discount rate of LT 160 million
in the first case and of LT 1,030 million in the second.
NOTE: This analysis has been prepared using capital cost estimates and oil
prices prevailing as of the date of appraisal. A recalculation using
the final capital cost estimate (Annex 4) and an oil price of LT 763/ton
(assuming fuel oil at 75% of the estimated 1980 crude oil price of
$8.65/bbl f.o.b. Persian Gulf plus freight and landing charges) results
in an equalizing discount rate of 12.3% (c.f. 13.4% on the previous
estimste). Results for the sensitivity analysis cases would also change
on'.y marginally.

TURKIH ELECTRICITY AUTHORIFY (TEK)
EIBIS2AN PROJECT
Domestic Fuel Aspects
Introduction
1.        The Elbistan Project envisages an annual output from the mine from
1980 onwards of 20 million tons of lignite. The estimated requirement of the
proposed power station, assuming an annual load factor of 74%, is 17.2 million
tons. The intention is to utilize the balance of 2.8 million tons in the
domestic market (household, small industries and commerce). Run-of-mine
lignite from Elbistan contains a high percentage (85-90%) of fines, which
makes it unsuitable for sale in the raw state. TKI proposes, therefore, to
produce dried lignite using a drying plant based on the Fleissner process
(named after its inventor, an Austrian engineer). This process requires
lump lignite, which involves screening the run-of-mine lignite to obtain the
required quantity. TKI proposes to sell the dried lignite in Eastern Turkey,
where there is claimed to be a large potential market (see map IBRD 10757).
2.        A Bank preappraisal miss:;.on consisting of Messrs. T.B. Russell, N.
Green and H. Reinbach (consultant) investigated this part of the Project in
the period July 2-20, 1973. The main object was to determine whether the
proposal was technically and economically feasible. In Ankara up-to-date
information and data were obtained in the course of numerous discussions
and meetings with TKI, TEK, State Investment Bank., State Planning Organization,
State Railways, Agricultural Department, Ministry of Finance, UNDP Agricultural
Advisers' Department and TKI consultants. A three-day field trip was made to
investigate the fuel situation in the Elbistan area and the potential market
for domestic lignite. A visit was also made to Vienna for discussions with
the Austrian firm Voest-Alpine Montangesellschaft (VAN), which had been en-
gaged by TKI to prepare a design study and report on the proposed dried lignite
operation. Discussions were also held in Koln with TKI's consultants, Rhein-
braun and Fichtner.
3.        During the appraisal of the Elbistan Project further discussions were
held with representatives of VAM and Rheinbraun at the TKI offices in Ankaras,
mainly concerning the extraction of the coal for drying from the main coal
stream aid details of the drying process. Additional information was also
obtained on the costs and facilities for distributing the dried lignite by
road and rail in Eastern Turkey.
4.        This report describes the main findings of the Bank missions.  It
is divided into two parts, dealing respectively with technical aspects and
economic aspects.
I. TECHNICAL ASFECTS
The Fleissner Process
5.        VAM, a large state-owned organization in Austria engaged, inter
alia, in mining and steel production, holds the franchise of the Fleissner
process. This process is designed to dewater and improve lignite lumps by



ANNEX 10
Page 2 of 11
batch treatment under high pressure steam. It is used in Austria and Yugo-
slavia and generally confined to lignite which is not suitable for self-
Dinding briquetting. The dewatering is accompanied by an overall shrinkage
and consequent increase in strength and abrasive resistance. The process is
not very common but is vell-proven.
6.        The drying process takes place in vertical autoclaves designed for
high pressure steam at 30 at. They are generally arranged in sets of four to
enable progressive steaming and consequent saving of total heat requirements.
According to tests, the cycle for Elbistan coal is about 160 minutes and this
determines the capacity of the plant.
7.        The boiler plant will consist of at least two units to secure
continuous operation. The boilers are mill-fired with dried fines and/or
raw coal over the full range of mixture. Since no condensate is recovered,
a demineralization plant for the whole feed is required. The VAM design
also provides for a Rooth storage to level out the variations in steam
demand.
8.        The effluent from the plant is considerable and contains solids
and phenols. It is treated in a Dorr-type thickener before being discharged.
Quality of Raw Lignite
9.        The available information on Elbitatan lignite quality stems exclus-
ively from samples of small bore cores which are always physically disturbed,
yet suitable for chemical analysis and visual and microscopic examination.
hence, there is a degree of uncertainty which might be best described by a
translated extract from the draft report of VAM to TKI:
"The Oe. A.M.G. (forerunner of VAM) carried out the first tests
on drying Elbistan coal in 1968. Further tests were made in 1969. For
these tests, only bore cores in limited quantities were available. These
investigations established in principle the possibility of manufacturing
from Elbistan coal lump dried coal for domestic and industrial use. Because
of the limited samples, statements regarding the quality range of the dried
coal to be expected could not be made.  Therefore, the project technology for
the quality range of the dried coal is based on estimated values. Likewise,
it 1S aecessary to make assumptions about the required input into the drying
plant1 about ra-w coal quality and the range of raw coal quality."
10.       The latest analyses of Elbistan raw coal based on the outcome of
.)ores made by Rheinbraun in 1972 are compared in Attachment 1 with the sum-
mai;r.Y af 362 bores previously taken by Dr. 0. Gold.
II.       For the Fleissner process, screened lumps are extriacted from the
general coal stream and a composition somewhat different frcm the above
samples is to be expected.  Since it is proposed that dead pieces will be
eliminated by hand picking, it is likely that the ash and moisture content
wiU decrease. VAM has used conservatively 55% moisture and 15% ash as
basIs for the calculation, which are acceptable values. However, it is
cocmidered that the calorific value of 1,00 kcal/kg used by VAM is too
opt,imistic and subsequent calculations here are based on 1,220 kcal/kg, as
in the Fichtner report on the Elbistan Project.



ANNEX 10
Page 3 of 11
12.       The Elbistan deposit is very irregular. Variations in coal quality
are abnormally high in both the vertical and horizontal directions. Numerous
intercalations are found over the whole field necessitating selective mining
and consequently quick changes in the quality and quantity of coal delivered
from the dredges. It has therefore been planned to provide a large mixing
bunker of 1 million ton capacity with reclaimers, which will help to even
out such irregularities. For economic reasons it appears preferable to ex-
tract the lignite lumps to be dried after the mixing bunker. Lumps between
80 and 150 mm would be directed to the drying plant. They pass over a pick-
ing belt, where about 2% dead material would be eliminated. An intermediate
lump storage is also required to tide over interruptions. This could be in
the form of vertical storage bins. Naturally the hauling equipment must be
designed for gentle treatment of the lignite.   Thus about 2.6 million tons
of lumps (80-150 mm) would enter the driers. Fines would be directed to the
boiler plant or returned to the power station.
Quality of Dried Lignite
13.       It is not definitely known what initial and final moisture content
the coal will have but from limited samples and analogy it is expected that
the moisture content would decrease to about 20% after processing. This is
a normal figure. With the increased hardness that the process imparts,
accompanied by reasonable strength, the coal will be suitable for distribution,
storage and use in domestic appliances.
14.       Estimates of tonnages and quality based on a total available raw
coal quantity of 2.8 million tons p.a. are not possible on arithmetical cal-
culations alone, as a certain amount of ash is dissolved and fines are in
suspension in the effluent. Moreover, moisture is lost to.atmosphere in the
cooling process and C02 is discharged from the depressurized water. Only
appraximate figures are quoted from empirical values obtained by VAM. They
are summarized below:
Raw coal                             2.8 million tons p.a.
Raw coal treated                     2.6 million tons p.a.
Dried coal                           1.41 million tons p.a.
Saleable dried coal                  1.23 million tons p.a.
Calorific value of dried coal:
Theoretical value                2,670 kcal/kg
Predicted value (by VAM)
approx.                        3,000 kcal/kg
Dried fines and the balance of raw coal are consumed in the boiler plant or
returned to the power station.
15.       The Fleissner treatment has the important second purpose (after
drying) to preserve and even to strengthen the physical properties of the
coal. This is effected by the shrinkage of individual lumps during the
dewatering and subsequent stabilization.  Naturally, the degree of harden-
ing depends decisively on the structure of the coal and its cohesion. It
is impossible with the existing samples to predict figures or make the usual
tests designed to measure this factor. Hence, VAM has refrained from giving
any assurances or guarantees until undisturbed samples are available from the
large exploratory shaft now being sunk.



ANNEX 10
Page 4 of 11
16.       Obviously, quick progress in the construction of the shaft is vital
and TKI was requested by the preappraisal mission to speed up the rather slow
progress of shaft sinking by giving it high priority and introducing three-
shift work. The coal seams at the shaft are located between 76 and 127 m from
the surface. The first undisturbed samples from the shaft were inspected in
Ankara in September.  They indicate, on visual examination, an evenly struct-
ured awvphous coal of moderate hardness with enclosures of calcium sulphate.
Cursory inspection does not indicate any properties which may impede the pro-
per functioning of the Fleissner process. VAM will take samples under their
own direction as the shaft progresses.
17.       After examination of the undisturbed samples, a final report with
offers and guarantees can be expected from VAM.
Main Uncertainties on Lignite Quality
18.       The present lack of proper samples leaves the following main
uncertainties regarding lignite quality:
(a) Most suitable final moisture content
From sample testing and by analogy, it is expected that the coal
can be dewatered to about 20% residual moisture. This figure might vary
for coals from different depths.  It is a fairly common value and is not
expected to be revised materially.
(b) Coal characteristics
Figures given are based on a number of estimates (final moisture,
dry ash-free coal, heat value, etc.). They are correct as far as arithmetic
deduction is concerned, and uncertain because of uncertain basic data.
(c)  Physical strength of dried lumps
This remains open until undisturbed samples are available.  Tests
in 1968 with selected pieces from bore cores gave no reliable values.
(d) Combustion qualities
The ash content is high. This will affect ignition and combustion,
but it is not possible to say anything definite at this stage. Despite the
high ash content, it is unlikely that difficulties from clinkering will arise.
The most suitable grate bar spacing and the free grate area will have to be
determined by experiment.
(e) Behaviour in storage (open and/or covered)
Behaviour will probably be satisfactory in covered storage of lim-
ited height (about 8 meters).  Nothing else is foreseeable on this aspect at
present.
Dried Lignite Production Costs
19.       TKI provided the preappraisal mission with a cost estimate showing
a cost per ton of dried lignite ex drying plant of LT 100l The main assumptions
were:



ANNEX 10
Page 5 of 11
(a)  an annual input of 3 million tons of raw lignite (including the fuel
for the drying plant) at an average cost of LT 29/ton;
(b) capital cost of drying plant LT 300 million;
(c) saleable output of 1.3 million tons p.a. of dried lignite.
20.       The preappraisal mission reviewed this estimate with the assistance
of VAM in Vienna in July.  VAM had available a draft study for a drying plant
to handle a million tons of Elbistan lignite per year.  In this VAM had in-
eluded provision for all the coal preparation and handling equipment for the
total Elbistan lignite output of 20 million tons, thereby largely duplicating
the provision for this equipment already included in the cost estimates for
the mine. VAX said that to produce an accurate estimate for a drying plant
designed to handle 2,8 million tons of raw lignite annually, as proposed for
the Elbistan Project, would requi-e a separate design study. However, with
VAM's assistance a rough estimate of the cost was made ,by pro-rating the
comparable cost items for the h million ton plant and eliminating the coal
handling and preparation facilities attributable specifically to the mine.
This resulted in a figure of some LT 700 million. This estimate was further
reviewed by the appraisal mission in October, using updated information pro-
vided by VAM. This resulted in a revised figure (excluding interest during
construction) of LT 936 million (US$67 million), including LT 6h8 million
(US$h6 million) in foreign exchange. Details of this estimate, which is
still subject to final confirmation by VAM, are given in Attachment 2. It
results in an incremental production cost for dried lignite of IT 132/ton,
as shown in Attachment 3.
Timing of Dried Lignite Plant
21.       According to the preliminary report by Fichtner on the Elbistan
Project about 1 million tons of lignite would be available for the drying
plant in 1978 and the full quantity of 2.8 million tons in 1979. This assumed,
however, that the first turbo-generator at Elbistan would be instalUed on Decem-
ber 1, 1977. It now appears that this has slipped to September 1978, and a
similar delay should be allowed for the supply of lignite to the drying plant
and its commissioning. In these circumstances it does not appear advisable to
erect the drying plant in stages as was suggested at one time but to commission
it in toto by April 1979. This timing would require the contract to be placed
2½ years earlier i.e. September 1976.
Marketing and Transport
22.       An early study of marketing methods Is necessary (e.g. sales methods
for Fleissner coal in Austria or for brown coal briquettes in West Germany) to-
gether with timely market preparation, storage and distribution facilities.
Although quantities of lignite are now handled and distributed by TKI Sales Dep-
artment, the conditions for Elbistan are far more rigid. Early planning, adver-
tising and consumer eduction are essential. The missions found little evidence
that these factors had received any attention so far.
230       The Fleissner plant will be working fairly evenly through the year,
with shutdown for overhaul etc. in mid-summer. Domestic demand has a large
space-heating peak from December to April, superimposed on a low-level demand
throughout the year for cooking. Commercial demand for small coal will be even.
Despite any efforts to level out demand, summer storage by TKI will be necessary.
This can be provided at Elbistan, where it will fit in with the day-to-day fluctua-
tions of available transport, and at major towns like Malatya or Maras under the



ANNEX 10
Page 6 of 11
supervision of TKI personnel. Covered storage is by far preferable, light
structures not exceeding 8 meters in height being sufficient. Properly stored
and protected from rain and sunshine, the product can be stored for several
months with only some surface deterioration. Transportable stackers are recom-
mended. Attention to fire risk is necessary.
24.       It is necessary to design and provide suitable combustion appliances
for the dried lignite. The existing open hearths and stoves are useable for
lignite but can be much improved in design without major cost increase. Control
of air supply, proper grates, over-fire air, dampers, etc. can be embodied with-
out major extra cost. TKI should undertake engineering studies and get informa-
tion from the respective organizations in Germany. Jmportant aspects are bar
spacing, free grate air and ash disposal. In view of the high ash content of
Elbistan lignite, engineering studies should be commenced soon to design effic-
ient, cheap heating appliances for such fuel; open hearths should not be neg-
lected, since they may add appreciably to the potential market. The sooner
suitable a pliances are marketed -- and they will be effective for wood and
"tezek" I/ -- the easier will be the introduction of lignite into households
when the plant starts operation., Marketing household fuel - despite the par-
ticular situation in East Turkey - is a special field and it is most important
to avoid early failures. It would be bad policy to rely on the present fuel
shortage to ensure consumer demand in any circumstances.
25.       The Bank missions investigated the means of transport for bringing
the dried lignite to the consumers. It was found that the Railvway Department
has a definite project to provide rail transport for iron ore from the deposits
north-west of Malatya to the projected steel works at Iskenderun. For this pur-
pose the railway line from Malatya to Iskenderun is being improved, partly by
duplication, and is to be dieselized by 1974; part electrification will follow
in 1977. The traffic southwards for ore is to be 2 million tons p.a. ill 1976,
rising to 8 million tons p.a. in 1980. Empty ore trucks (50 tons capacity, with
bottom or side dumping provision) returning northwards could therefore be used
to transport dried lignite up to a capacity of 3,000 tons per day. This would
require enlargement of the present siding at Kapidere station (the nearest point
on the line to Elbistan) to handle the dried lignite at an estimated cost of
LT   million.  The road being constructed between Elbistan and Kapidere for the
delivery of plant for the mine and power station can be used for the transport
of dried lignite to Kapidere. Dispatch of dried lignite by rail is therefore
feasible and this widens the market considerably.
26.       For the supply of dried lignite to Mulatya, Maras and places west
of Elbistan road transport over existing highways is possible. The road lead-
ing east and west from Elbistan is to be improved before 1977 to No. 2 hig&way
standard. This is being done independently of the Elbistan Project, and irres-
pective of lignite traffic, in order to assist the development of the area.
27.       It seems, therefore, that transport of the dried lignite from Elbistan
by road and rail is feasible and assured.-

28.       Nevertheless, it needs to be emphasized that for the distribution
of a weather-and handling-sensitive commodity such as lignite of the Fleissner
type, considerable organization and infrastructure are necessary to bring the
commodity with a minimum of deterioration to the ultimate small consumer. It
cannot be done without studies and systematic build-up of the transport and
distribution section. It cannot be left to individual carriers. There is
little back-freighting in the Elbistan area and the need to fit in seasonal
fluctuations of other commodities requires a strong overall control.
II. ECONOMIC ASPECTS
Potential Market for Dried Lignite
29.       According to studies carried out by TKI's consultants, notably Otto
Gold in their 1969 feasibility study of the Elbistan Project, there is a large
potential market in Eastern Turkey for treated lignite from the proposed mine.
The potential market area is defined as the 18 vilarets, or provinces, surround-
ing the mining area, plus a further 8 provinces to the east of this area (see
map IBRD 10757). These provinces and their populations are listed at Attach-
ment 4. The area as a whole suffers from chronic scarcity of fuel. There are
only two existing lignite mines of any importance in the area, with a combined
annual output of about 200,000 tons. The main fuels used at present are "tezek"
(dried animal manure) and firewood.  In addition, 150,000 - 200,000 tons of lig-
nite, coal and coke are supplied by TKI from Western Turkey. Other fuels used
are liquid petroleum gas (LPG), mainly for cooking, and oil (fuel oil, diesel,
kerosene) but detailed data on quantities, in total and by province, were not
available.
30.       Details of estimated fuel usage in 1972 by province, according to
type of fuel, are shown in Attachment h. The figures of tezek consumption
were derived from the livestock figures for each province for 1969 (the latest
year for which figures are available), applying factors obtained from the Turk-
ish Agricultural Department for the annual manure production per capita for
each type of animal. This gave the gross output of manure for each province,
from which the quantities used for tezek production (as distinct from fertilizer)
were derived, as shown in Attachment 5, by using factors for each province
supplied by the Agricultural Department. The corresponding quantities of
tezek produced were obtained using a conversion ratio of 5:1 i.e. 5 tons of
manure give 1 ton of tezek. The data on firewood consumption were supplied
ty the State Planning Organization (SPO); they are based on the Forestry Dep-
artment's allocations for 1972, which were then doubled by SPO on the assump-
tion (which seems reasonable in view of the lack of alternative fuels in the
area) that actual consumption is at least twice the official allocations.
31.       As shown in Attachment 4, total 1972 consumption of tezek in the
market aret as defined by TKI was about 5 million tons and of firewood about
1 million tons, In addition about 14O,000 tons of lignite were supplied by
TKI from its mines in Western Turkey, plus some 10,000 tons of bituminous
coal and 40P,000 tons of coke. There is, therefore, an ample potential market
for dried lignite from Elbistan in substitution for existing fuels. Indeed,
according to Turkish studies, this substitution market could absorb the whole
of the proposed output of 1.23 million tons of dried lignite, 500,000 tons of
which, it is suggested, could be substituted for an equivalent quantity of
tezek and the remaining 723,000 tons for 540,000 tons of wood. These estimates
seem to have been based on judgments rather thlm detailed evaluation, however,
and the mission therefore made its own estimate of the scope for substitution,



ANNEX 10
Page 8 ofll
as described below. These are based partly on the results of a field survey
undertaken in the Elbistan area to obtain first-hand information on the fuel
situation (see Attachment 6).
Substitution of Dried Lignite for Existing Fuels
32.       The scope for substitution of dried lignite from Elbistan depends
on the costs to consumers in relation to the valuation they place on existing
fuels, as revealed either directly by the prices they actually pay for the lat-
ter or, where there is no normal market (as in the case of tezek), from other
indicators, such as consumers' subjective valuations.
33.       The relevant costs for this purpose are the incremental costs, given
that the costs of the raw lignite and power required by the drying plant are
already included in the costs of the Elbistan mine and power station. Further-
more, since we are concerned with economic costs, the unskilled labor employed
at the drying plant is valued at its opportunity cost, conservatively estimated
at 50% of the money wage. The supply cost of dried lignite to the consumer
depends on the production cost, selling costs, transport costs and the amount
of wastage in transit from the drying plant to the final consumer. The estimated
production cost is LT 132/ton (para. 20). TKI provided estimates of selling and
marketing costs varying from LT 12 to LT 16/ton, according to province. These
figures compare with current selling costs of LT 20/ton for two of their exist-
ing sales offices in Eastern Turkey and of LT 16/ton for the third. Although
there may be economies of scale associated with the much larger tonnage to be
handled from Elbistan, the figure of LT 20/ton is cautiously assumed here.
34.       The use of both road and rail transport makes it possible to supply
dried lignite over a wide area. Generally speaking, lignite supplies to the
west and south will be carried by road. Malatya will also receive its lignite
by road. Most other places to the north and east will receive railed lignite.
35.       Road haulage costs in the area are given by the Highways Department as
LT 0.3-0.35/ton/kn. TKI has indicated a range of LT 0.3-0.5/ton/km, said to be
based on studies of transport costs between major urban centers. It is consid-
ered that LT 0.6/ton/km inclusive of return trip is a fair and likely figure to
be achieved. The Highway Department and TKI agree with this estimate.
36.       Current rail freight charges for the transport of lignite from West
to East Turkey average about LT 0.13/ton/km, but this appears to be below the
marginal cost to the railways, estimated at LT 0.l7/tcn/km 2/, which is the fig-
ure assumed here. In addition, there is the cost of road haulage from Elbistan
to the railway station at Kapidere, estimated at LT 33/ton, including loading
charge. Reloading of lignite from iron ore trucks to ordinary rail trucks is
estimated to cost LT 8.66/ton, allowing for 1% losses. Delivery costs of lignite
from rail depot or siding to consumer including loading, unloading and losses are
estimated at LT 15/ton in the case of tezek substitution, LT 9/ton for firewood
substitution and LT 3/ton for western lignite substitution.

37.       Smmiarizing, therefore, the supply cost of dried lignite to consumers
is made up of the following elements:
LT/ton
Production cost                                        132.20
Selling cost                                            20.00
Transport cost per kn by road                            0.oO
Transport cost per km by rail                            0.17
Road transport Elbistan-Kapidere, including
loading charge                                        33.00 
Reloading from ore rail truck to ordinary
rail truck
Delivery from rail depot, including
loading/unloading and losses:
substituting tezek                           15.00
substituting firewood                          9.00
substituting western lignite                  3.00
To these costs has to be added an allowance for wastage, reckoned at 55p of
production plus transport costs.
38.       Given these cost assumptions, the extent of the substitution market
depends on the value of the fuel for which dried lignite is to be substituted,
since this sets the limit to the transport costs which can be supported. Since
this value differs for the various fuels, these are considered separately below.
Tezek Substitution
39.       There is no normal market in tezek., since each household as a rule
makes sufficient for its own requirements. The only province.where the-e were
said to be fairly regular quantities available for sale was Erzurum, one of the
8 most easterly provinces in the market area as defined by TKI (see map IBRD
10757). This may be connected with the fact that this is also the province
with the largest annual output of both manure and tezek (see Attachment 5).
The 1972 price quoted was LT 400-500/ton. )n a severe winter, the price is
said to rise as high as LT 2 per piece, equivalent to about LT 2,000/ton, in
the most easterly provinces, but presumably this is for relatively small quan-
tities. In the area visited by the mission during its field survey the highest
value quoted was LT 1 per piece, equivalent to about LT 1,000/ton, but this was
exceptionally high.  In general, the range of values obtained was UL 200-500/
ton. The valuLe assumed here is LT 300/ton, which is on the cautiious side. As
a check, the value of animal manure, as estimated by SPO, is LT 52/ton which,
at the conversion ratio assumed of 5:1, gives a figure of LT 260 for the value
of the manure necessary to produce 1 ton of tezek. Allowing for the costs and
inconvenience to the household in its manufacture, LT 300/ton seems a reasonable
lower limit tothe value of tezek.
40.       The estimated calorific value of tezek is 2,500 kcal/kg, which compares
with the calculated calorific value of dried lignite of 2,670 kcal/kg (para. 1h).
On a straight calorific comparison, therefore, one ton of dried lignite is thle
equivalent of 1.05 tons of tezek, with a value of LT 315. However, this com-
parison does not do justice to the superior characteristics of lignite as a
domestic fuel (e.g. greater comfort and convenience, slower burning, more
efficient heat output). Allowing for tnese, LT 350/ton would seem to be the
minimum value of dried lignite as a substitute for the equivalent quantity of
tezek.



ANNEX 10
Page 10 of 11
41.       As sho4n in Attachment 7, at this value of lignite to the consumer,
the maxnium transport costs for dried lignite to remain competitive with tezek
would be LT 182/ton by road,implying a maximm haul of 303 'em, and LT 136 by
rail7 implying a mnaximum haul of 800 km. Taking account of the road/rail
distances of the var-ious provinces from Elbistan, the scope for substitution
of lignite for tezek was calculated (see Attachment 7)4 This resulted in a
total of 764,000 tons of dried lignite which could be marketed in substitution
for tezek.
Firewood Substitutnio
42.       Unlike tezek, there is a regular market in firewlood in Eastern Turkey.
During its field survey, the mission found that current prices in the areas
visited are in the range LT 500-700/ton.  For Erzurum., one of the more easterly
provinces, the current price range was quoted as LT 650-750/ton.  Conservatively,
a value of LT 500/ton is assumed here. From the mission's survey it- appears
-That lignite would generally be used in preference to firewood. if it were
available in sufficient quantities at comparable prices.  The average calorific
value of dry firewood is quoted as 3,000 kcal/kg.  In calorific terms, tlherefore,
one ton of dried lignite is the equivalent of about 0,89 tons of firewood, worth
LT 445. This simple calorific comparison ignores the superior qualities of dried
lignite as a fuel; allowing for these, a ton of dried lignite could reasonable
be regarded as fully the equivalent of a ton of firewood. However, the value
for dried lignite in substitution for firewood has been conservatively assumed
here at LT 450/ton.
243.      At this value, the maximum transport costs for dried lignite to remain
competitive with firewood would be LT 276/ton by road, implying a maximum haul
of 460 kmo, and LT 237/ton by rail, implying a maximum haul ofC 1,394 km. The
estimated quantity which would be substituted for firewood is 355,000 tons
(see Attachment 7),
Western Ligite Substitution
24.       Current prices for lignite supplied by TKI from Western Turkey in
the areas surveyed by the Bank mission are in the range LT 300-600/ton, accord-
ing to quality.  Detailed information on the different qualities market,ed, and
the quantities of each quality, are not available, but it seems reasonable to
suppose that consumers would be prepared to substitute dried lignite from
Elbistan if it were available at a price of LT 400/ton.  it is assumed that,
as a matter of policy, TKI would cease supplying Westerna lign.ite (for which
there is a ready market in Western er-key) wherever dried lignite from Elbistan
is more economf1c, As sho-wn in Attachment 7, this would result in Western lignite
being fully replaced by dried lignite in all provinces in the potential market
area except, Kirselhir, Nevsehi:r and Nigde in the west, where access from Elbistan
is rather difficult@  The total tonnage replaced is about 111,000 tons,
Benefits of Substitution
45.       The preceding analysis 3uggests that the "substitution" market for
dried lignite from Elbistan can a ,sorb the whole output from the drying plant of
1,23 million tons0  The direct benefits to the consumers of this substitution
depend on the price they pay for the dried lignite in comparison with the
price they would be willing to pay i.e., as calculated here, LT 350, LT 450
and LT 400 per tan in substitution respectively for tezek, firewood, and West-
ern lignite.  Assumong that the price charged to each consumer is based on the
cost of suppl,y, the net benefit in each case, therefore, will depend on the



ANNEX 10
Page 11 of 11
transport costs. On the information available, these cannot be determined with
any precision, but rough calculations have been made, based on the estimated
average road or rail haul of dried lignite from the point of production to con-
sumers in the various provinces.  The results are shonm  in Attachment 7, from
which it will be seen that the annual net benefits amount to some LT 126 million.
460       In addition to the direct benefits of substitution, there will be in-
direct benefits to the extent that there are gains in terms of net value added
from alternative uses of the substituted fuels. The main indirect benefits would
arise from utilization of the animal manure no longer required for tezek as agri-
cultural fertilizer0 According to calculations by SPO, using data on the various
types of crop grown, the nutrient chemical content of animal manure and the result-
ing extra yield of each crop per ton of manure, an additional 9 million tons of
manure in the 18 provinces surrounding the Elbistan area wiould result in net
value added in agriculture of LT 414 million. This gives an average net benefit
of about LT 46/ton of manure, although the specific figure for each province
would depend on the crop pattern. Assuming this average figure applies in tne
area of tezek substitution, the annual benefit attributable to the substitution
of dried lignite for tezek amounts to LT 176 million (see Attachment 8).
47.       The resulting annual net benefits attributable to the substitution of
dried lignite for existing fuels are as follaws:
Direct Benefits                    LT Million
Tezek substitu'tion                        64.6
Firewood substitution                      51.3
Western lignite substitution               10
Tndirect Benefits
Additional agriculture output             175.7
TOTAL                        301.9
Assuming the substitultion market is developed to its full potential by 1980,
the resulting benefit in present worth terms (at 11% interest) is LT 1590 million.
49O       The above calculation takes no account of a further possible indirect
benefit from the substitution of dried lignite for wood, which could be used in
the manufacture of paper or fiber board. Shortage of wood is said to have been
a main obstacle to the establishment of these industries in Eastern Turkey
hitherto.  According to SP0, a paper mill utilizing 150,000 tons of wood per
annum would result in a net value added of LT 320 million p.a.; a fiber board
mill with a capacity of several hundred thousand tons of wood p.a. would give
a net value added of LT 560/ton of wood. Utilization for these purposes of the
wood made available through its replacement as a fuel by dried lignite could,
therefore, result in important additional benefits to t-he econonM. Assuminng,
for example, that a fiber board mill utilizing 350,000 tons of wood p.a, were
established by 1985, this would result in an additional benefit with an expected
present value (at 11% interest) of LT 420 million. However, since there are no
plans to establish such an industry, and its scale and timing are very uncertain,
the possibility of this additional benefit has not been taken into acco-unt here.

ELBISTAN PROJECT - DOMESTIC FUEL ASPECTS
Field Investigation of Fuel Usage in Elbistan Area
In order to obtain first-hand information on fuel usage in the
Elbistan area and the potential market for dried lignite, the Bank mission,
accompanied by Mr. Suat Seyhun (Project Manager, TKI), undertook a three-day
field trip, in the course of which 13 towns and villages were visited in six
provinces. At each place visited interviews were held with local officials
or kIowledgeable individuals to elicit the required information. The results
are summarized below.
KAYSERI PROVINCE
Kyseri
This is the provincial capital with a population, according to the
official estimate, of 168,000 but, according to the Mayor, about 250,000,
Fuels used are lignite, oil, wood and LPG. Availability of lignite for the
current year is estimated at about 100,000 tons (for the whole province), of
which TKI will supply about 34,000 tons from Western Turkey and the balance
will come from a private mine at Corum (north-east of Ankara). According to
the Mayor, shortage of fuel is holding back industrial development in the
province, which could use four times as much lignite if it were available.
Current lignite prices range from LT 380 - 600/ton, according to quality.
The current price of firewood is .bout LT 600/ton.
KIRSEHIR PROVINCE
Kirsehir
This is the provincial capital (population 36,000). Domestic fuels
uased are lignite, wood, LPG and diesel oil. The lignite is supplied from Corum,
the current price range being LT :o0-400/ton, including an estimated LT 80-loO/
ton for transport. Lignite is always in short supply. Average annual consump-
tion per household is 2.5-3 tons (when available) and the number of households
is estimated at 8,000.  The price of firewood is LT 600-700/ton, of LPG LT 30/30
kg bottle and of diesel oil IT 1/litre. A typical household would consume one
bottle of LPG every two or three months for cooking. "Tezek" is not used in
the town but it was suggested that, if marketed, its price would be about LT 1
per piece (a piece weighs approximately 1 kg). Prices of lignite stoves were
quoted as LT 150-500, according to size.
Kaman
This is a small town with a population of 12,h00. Fuels locaLly
available are lignite, wood, LPG and diesel oil.  The lignite comes from
Seyitomer and Corum. Current selling prices are LT 380-400/ton. A figure
of 3 tons was suggested as the typical annual consumption for a household,
subject to availability. Firewood is currently LT 500-600/ton, LPG LT 33/30 kg
bottle and diesel oil LT 1/litre. Small lignite stoves, suitable for ordinary
domestic use, were said to cost LT 200-300 and Large ones LT 500-600. No
"tezek" is tused in the town but a value of LT 1/piece was suggested.



AITEX 10
Att-achmenrt 6
Pge,52 of 4-
vi,lag
A smnl  village about 7 km from Kirsehir was visited. The iwuber of
households is abouv 100 and the fuels used are lignite, -wood and 'Te zek'". The
lignite costs T2 420/ton. Consumption per family is about 2 tons per araium.
Firewood is gathered locally, each family supplying its own.  CuiMsx.iPtion is
about 1 ton/household per annum. About 90% of the animaal manurn prPrduced is
used for "tezek", mnly 10% as fertilizer. An average household uses about
I ton of "tezek" in a year. Villagers indicated that if ligmi16ee were. avl1ai-
able at about LT 200/ton they would use it in preference to I'Vaek".k TOhey
said they would use the additional animal manure to improve the lulity of
the soil, but would not reduce their consumption of artificial fert.'ilizer
(for which they pay LT 1.30/kg) as a result. Households in this  llae
use a metal stove of rather flimsy construction suitable for all tylyas of
solid fuel. It costs LT 125-150 but has a normal life of onIly 2-3 yearsc.
MARAS PROVINCE
Elbistan
According to the Mayor, the present population of thi:e tv:mr is about
30,000 (6,000 households).and of the district for which it is the cenIter
about 120,000. The main fuels used in the town are lignite arLd wood.  -&.
1972 about 5,000 tons of lignite were supplied for the whole district. Of
this amowut only 34 tons were supplied by TKI from Western, Turkey (agadi lst
a request for 3,000 tons). The remainder came from a private nine at C:Lzre
in Eastern Turkey. The price ranges frcm LT 300/ton (for lignite wit h a cal
orific value of 2,000 kcal/kg) to LT 500/ton (4,000-4,500 kcal/kg). Firewood
consumption in the district is about 25,000 tons (1 ton per household), includ-
ing 15,000 tons a1located by the Forestry Department and 10,000 tons gathered
for individual use. A local stovemaker supplies a small type of domestic stove
suitable for wood or "tezek" for about LT 100 and a larger t-;pe for LT 10S  plus
the cost of piping (LT 10/meter). Lignite staves (not made locally) cost about
LT 300 for a small model burning about 10 kg/day and LT 600 for a larger size
burning 20 kg/day. The lignite stoves, which are of much more sclid construction
than the wood-burning type, are said to last about 7-8 years.  Th.ere are 6-7
private fuel merchants in Elbistan handling about 10,000 tons per elnum of lig-
nite and firewood.
Alemda
This is a village of abou-t 1,250 people (250 households) 23 ian from
Elbistan.  The fuels used are wood and "tezek". Most of the wood comes from a
forest about 20 km from the village, but small quantities are also gathered by
individuals from their own land. The wood consumption of a household of 10 people
was quoted as 3 tons per annum.  The price of firewood varies from LT 300-500/ton.
A wood-burning stove, with an estimated life of 2 years, costs IX 140. ALl the
animal manure produced is used to make "tezek". A single piece of "tezek", ready
for burning, weighs about 1 kg and consumption by a typical household is 15-20
pieces/day in winter and half this quantity or less in summer i.e. roughly some
3-4 tons per armum. There is no market in "tezek"5 each household making
sufficient for its own requirements, but villagers estimated. the value at
about 50 kurus/piece (about LT 500/ton).

Kamiscik
This village is about 30 km from Elbistan with a population of 800
(about 130 households). The main fuel is wood.  Only a few an-mals are kept,
hence "tezek" consumption is limited. The village is in a so-called "forest
area", entitling the inhabitants to free wood. The system is that the Forestry
Department nominates a day on which the villagers are allowed to take as much
wood as they can collect in the time. The quantity obtained in this way has
been diminishing because of over-exploitation of the forest. In 1972 each
household collected about 3 tons on average. The forest is about 15 km from
the village, Additional wood is available from forest workers for about LT
255/ton, the average household buying about 1/3 ton. Average annual require-
ments per family,, if sufficient wood were available, are estimated at about
5 tons per household. Wood-burning stoves are used, ranging in price from
LT 30 (for a  very simple type) to IT 150. Their average life is about 3
years.
Ketizmen - Tasburun
This village, with a population of about 700 (130 households),is
4 km from Elbistan. Wood and "tezek" are the main fuels. Wood from the
forest is bought for LT 500-600/ton. The average household requirement is
put at about 3 tons per annum but, owing to shortage of supplies, actual
consumption is about 1.5 tons per annum. Consequently, the village is very
dependent on "tezek". Lignite would be bought if available but it is unlikely
that it would be substituted entirely for "tezek"', since the land is either
barren or very poor in quality, offering only limited scope for agriculture.
Si&dilli - Kovri
This is about 40 km from Elbistan, with a population of 700 (about
100 households). The average household income is LT 4,500-5,000. Only three
families use lignite, costing LT 425-450 ton from Elbistan.  "Tezek" is the
main fuel, supplemented by firewood costing LT 600/ton. The average annual
requirement of lignite per household, if it were available, was put at 3-4
tons. It was indicated that lignite would be used in preference to "tezek"
if it were available at about LT 250/ton.
MALATYA PROVINCE
M4alatya
This is the provincial capital, with a population of 130,000 (about
30,000 households). The main industries are textiles, beet-sugar and tobacco,
The avprage family income is about LT 12,000. The fuels used are lignite,
hard coal, wood, oil (fuel and diesel) and LPG. Wood requirements are estimated
at 1-1½_ tons per household per annum, resulting in a total requirement for the
town of some 440,000 tons and for the whole pxovince of over 100,000 tons. Tne
actual allocation to the province by the Forestry Department for the current
year is 13,000 tons, of which 8,000 tons is for the town. The wood comes from
a forest 100-200 km away and is sold in the town by private merchants at LT
600-700/ton. The cost ex-forest is said to be LT 300-350/ton. The TKT 1973
allocation of lignite for the province from Western Turkey is 5,200 tons and
the price is LT 450 but this may not all be taken up, since lignite from Cizre
is cheaper (LT 350/ton).  The hard coal allocation to t,he province is 4,200
tons at LT 600/ton. Because of the shortage of lignite and coal, there is an

An average household consumes 3-4 tons per annum.  Lignite supplies are limited
to about 800 tons per annum at present, of -which about 75%, costing I!r 380-500/
ton, is from Western Turkey and the balance from Corum at ILT 350/ton. The local
population would prefer lignite to wood if it were available. X ton of lignite
is regarded as the equivalent of 1 ton of wood and the average household would
require about 2 tons of lignite per annum, plus ½n ton of wood  MTe expenditure
of an average household on fuel is said to be about LT 19,500 ,

ELBISTAN PROJECT
Economic Rate of Return on Project
1.        The economic rate of return on the Project is the discount rate
which equalizes the present values of the time-streams of the attributable
costs and benefits over the Project's life. For this purpose a period of
25 years, which is the assumed life of the lignite mine, was adopted. The
costs are the capital plus operating costs of the mine and power station
together with the associated transmission facilities. The benefits comprise
the following items:
(a) the revenues from the sales of power attributable to
the power station; and
(b) the net benefits attributable to that portion (2.8 million
tons) of the mine's annual lignite output which goes to the
drying plant to produce dried lignite for sale as fuel to
domestic, commercial and industrial consumers.
The detailed figures are shown in Table 1 at page 3 of this Annex and their
derivation is described below:
Attributable Power Sales
2.        On the main forecast of power sales (Annex 2), the output from the
Elbistan power station-will be needed to meet the incremental growth of sales
to the power market served by the TEK interconnected system, the annual require-
ment rising from 413 GWh in 1978 to 6,636 G7i in 1981, when the station will be
operating at its full capacity. The attributable revenues from these sales, as
derived from the financial forecasts in Annex 22, plus the village electrification
tax of 1 kurus/kWh payable by consumers, were taken as the measure of the benefits.
Net Benefits from Dried Lignite Sales
3.        The capital and operating costs of the lignite mine given in Table 1
relate to an annual output of 20.7 million tons, but only 17.9 million tons of this
are required for the power station (at 74% plant factor). The balance of 2.8
million tons will go to the proposed drying plant (Annex 10) to produce dried
lignite for sale as a fuel in Eastern Turkey. It is legitimate, therefore, to
credit the net benefits attributable to the resulting dried lignite sales as an
offset against the costs of the Project. Thiese benefits were calculated as
described in Annex 10 and are shown in Table 1.
Economic Rate of Return
4.        As shown in Table 1, comparison of the costs and benefits described
above results in a rate of return on the Project of 17.6%, which is acceptable,
assuming that the opportinity cost of capital in Turkey is around 11%.



ANNEX 11
Page 2 of 4
5.        The sensitivity of the rate of return was tested for variations in the
values of the main variables (Projtt capital costs, station plant factor, load
growth, power tariffs, 0 & M costszand dried lignite benefits).  The results
are summarized in Table 2 of this Annex. It will be seen that the rate of
return is relatively insensitive to individual variations in the variables,
except for the load forecast. Even if all the less favorable assumptions are
combined the rate is above 12% and it is nearly 22% if all the more favorable
assumptions are combined.
1/ Sensitivity tests were done using capital costs and tariff estimates as
of February 1974. They will be marginally l.ower at the final estimate
of capital cost and tariffs corresponding to the main assumptions (Table 6).

ANNEX 18

Minutes of Agreement Between the Bank
and Government regarding Reorganization of the
Electric Power Sector in Turkey
A number of meetings were held from January 19 to January 27, 1966
in the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources in Ankara, to discuss the
need to reorganize the electric power sector entities in Turkey and the
manner in which such reorganization could be accomplished.
Those participating in the meetings were: -
For the Government of Turkey:
Ibrahim Deriner,
Minister of Energy and Natural Resources
Kemal Noyan,
Under Secretary, Ministry of Energy and
Natural Resources
Tevfik Fikret Suer,
President, Energy Department
Kutlu Buyukdoluca,
Director General, EIE Idaresi
Rasim Kursuncu,
Assistant Director General, Etibank
Arif Onat,
Assistant Director General, DSI
Galip Mutdogan,
Energy Department, Assistant Director
of Study and Planning Division
For the World Bank:
Mr. M. Piccagli and Lord Hinton of Bankside.
At the end of the meetings the Minister of Energy and Natural
Resources decided to adopt the reorganization of the electric power industry
in Turkey as set out in these Minutes, insofar as his powers and authority
permit.  Accordingly, the Minister will pursue the steps necessary to achieve
the reorganization of the entities now making up the power sector which would
result in the setting up, under the Yinistry of Energy and Natural Resourc:es, of:
(1) An Electricity Authority, a new autonomous entity to be organized
by consolidating the responsibilities and staff now held for
power sector work by EIE, Etibank, Illerbank, DSI and some of
the functions of the Energy Department.



ANNEX 18
Page 2 of 4
(2) An Irrigation and Flood Control Authority, -which is to retain
the scone of activities and responsibility now held by DSI,
except for the planning design, construction and operation of
hydro-electric projects (incluiding those mul_ti-purpose in
nature) which would become the responsibility of t.he new
Electric Authority. However, the M11inister of Elnergy, on the
recommendation of the Coordinating Council for multi-purpose
projects, may authorize the Irrigation Authority to undertake
directly a multipurpose project where the power benefits are
small in dimensions, negligible in regard to system planning
and marginal in the justification of the project.
(3) A Coordinating Council for Multi-purpose projects.
- Electricity Authority -
A Bill will be submitted to Parliament providing for the immediate
establishment of the Electricity Authority.  (The Mninister -,ill also promote
the consequential changes in the present DSI Act which are entailed by his
decision.)  The Authority will be a fully autonomous entity under the control
of a Board whose members will be appointed by the Minister of Energy and
Natural Resources.  The Chairman of the Board will be appointed to serve full
time and will be the Chief Executive of the Authority. He will be chosen among
high ranking professionally qualified candidates with experience in matters
relating to electric power supply. The members of the Board, not to exceed ten
in number, shall also be full time and will occupy senior executive positions under
the Chairman (i.e. they will be the heads of the principal Departments of the
Authority.) The principal qualification for their appointment shall be outstanding
experience in the specific field of professional responsibility of each within the
.A.uthority,coupled iTth the necessary admirnstrative ability*  In order to ensure
stability and continuity in management the Chairman and members of the Board shall
be appointed for a period of at least 5 years and will normally be expected to be re-
appointed at the end of such period, it being agreed that dismissal or failure to
reappoint will only be decided on the bas;is of unsatisfactory performance of their
duties.
The Authority shall have full control of all activ:ities inherent in
the provision of adequate supplies of electricity in the entire territory
of Turkey, including particularly the following:
- planning, design, construction and operation of all generating
transmission and distribution facilities lhaich may be required
for the provision of such supplies.
- determination, subject to approval by an appropriate Division of
the Ministry according to rules which will lbe specifically laid out
in the Bill, of the charges and tariffs which will apply to the
provision of such electricity supplies.
The Authority will be responsible for maintaining detailed accounts
of its activities. In particular it will prepare, immediately after the end
of each fiscal year, a balance sheet and a profit and loss st;atement to be



ANNEX 18
Page 3 of 4
submitted to review by qualified independent auditors, the results of such
audit to become available not later than four months after the close of each
fiscal year.
At the time of vesting, the Authority shall assume the assets and
liabilities related to electricity operations, including in particular all
generating plants at that time owned by distribution authorities and
Municipalities, except as provided in later clauses dealing with licensing,
and an opening balance sheet shall be established. In such take-over of
facilities and establishment of balance sheet, revalued depreciated historical
costs or depreciated current replacement values shall be used.
The Bill establishing the Authority shall specify, inter alia, the
following:
- authority to borrow, in Turkey and abroad;
- authority to make reasonable use of public utility condemnation
proceedings;
- authority to hire and fire personnel of all ranks, and to set
salary and wage levels which will ensure the appointment and
retention of competent personnel;
- principles of financial policy (this may take the form of a
mandate to earn not less than a specified minimum return on net
fixed assets);
- authority to recommend to the MLnister the conditions under which
he should license third parties (municipalities or private
companies) in specific instances to construct and/or operate
electricity facilities.
In connection with the last point it was particularly discussed and
agreed in the meetings that the Authority would include a Distribution
Department. It was envisaged that this Department would undertake the
direct distribution of electricity to the ultimate consumers, probably through
a number of Regional Distribution Divisions. In the event that Municipalities
and/or other entities should apply to continue or undertake the distribution of
electricity in their territories and meet the requirements and conditions to be
laid out in the license to govern the technical and financial conditions of
service, the Authority could recommend to the Minister the issuing of licenses
or concessions to that effect. Such licenses and concessions would be revoked
and the distribution facilities and service taken over by the Authority in the
event of failure by the licensee to continue meeting the requirements and
conditions of license.

Co-ordinating Council for Multi-purpose Projects
In the organization set out for the power sector, the Electricity
Authority is responsible for the planning, design and construction of all works
required to provide an economic and coordinated supply of electricity, including
hydroelectric generating plant. An Irrigation and Flood Control Authority will
retain responsibility for irrigation, flood control, drainage, etc.
It is obvious that, in the development of river basins and in multi-
purpose schemes the two Authorities will have interests which are sometimes joint
and sometimes conflicting. In order to ensure, at all times, that the interests
of the two Authorities are properly and fully coordinated, the Minister of Energy
and Natural Ibsources shall appoint a  Coordinating Council for multi-purpose
projects.
This Council shall consist of an independent Chairman, the Chairman
of the Electricity Authority, the Chairman or Chief Executive of the Irrigation
and Flood Control Authority, and two impartial outside members. The Chairman
and the two outside members shall be appointed by the Minister for a term of
five years and the Council shall be responsible to the Minister. The Chairman
and the two outside members shall be part time and shall be men distinguished
in business or industry. The Council should meet not less frequently than once
every two months. Its terms of reference are to ensure that there is proper
coordination between the Electricity Authority and the Irrigation and Flood
Control Authority in all plans for river basin development and multi-purpose projects.

MAIN ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING INCOME FORECASTS OF TEK FCR 1973-1981

*Meeting pent-up demand which could not be met earlier.
2.   Tariffs
Existing tariffs (in force from July 1, 1971 when they were raised by
an average of about 50%) are assumed to continue through 1974. However the fore-
casts assume a 22% increase in revenues in 1974 as a result of application of the
fuel surcharge in the wake of the recent spurt in oil prices and subsequent pro-
posed refixation of basic tariffs. Tariff increases raising net average revenue
to 39 kurus per kWh from January 1, 1975 and 51 kurus per kWh from March 15,
1975 are assumed. No further increases are assumed thereafter.
3.  Fuel Costs
Fuel costs for 1973 and 1974 are based on mid-1973 prices. The fuel-
cost. adjustment clause in TEK's tariffs would compensate for any subsequent changes.
Effective January 1, 1975, new tariffs are assumed, the base fuel costs reflecting
a fuel oil price of LT 1,260 per ton. The forecasts from 1975 onwards reflect
these new base fuel costs.
Fuel consumption varies from plant to plant depending on plant charac-
teristics and age. The following estimated costs per kWh have been used for coal,
lignite and gas oil.
Coal    - 9.00 krs in Catalagzi and 21.49 krs in Istanbul
Lignite - Ranging from 5.10 krs in Seyitomer to 14.67 krs in Izmir
- For Elbistan 11.16 krs corresponding to a price of LT 50.51
per ton and fuel consumption of 2.21 kg/kWh
Gas Oil - Ranging from 51.26 krs to 58.28 krs
4.  Wages and Salaries
(a) Labor - In year for collective agreement - 20% increase
- In following year                 -  5% increase
(b)  Monthly-rated personnel - In each year - 5% over existing salaries
(c) TEK has proposed to Government higher salaries to staff to make
salary levels competitive, the impact of which is over LT 50 millisn
per annum.  Effective November 27, 1973, Government has taken some
measures, the estimated impact of which has been included in the
eatimates for 1974 and normal adjustments have been provided in future
years.
(d}  Additional staff is provided on estimated basis as and when new plant
le brought into service.

5.   Depreciation
Depreciation is charged on straight-line basis for the period during
which an asset is actually in service in a year. For 1973, the following rates
which closely follow the actual rates charged in the accounts for 1972 have
been adopted:
Thermal - 5%
Hydro   - 3.32% (2.7% for Gokcekaya)
Network - 3.66%
These rates are slightly higher than those established as minimums under
Loan 763-TU.
From 1974 onwards, the following revised average rates based on the
individual rates agreed for various types of assets have been adopted:
Thermal - 4%
Hydro   - 2.70% (except Keban and Karakaya, relatively larger assets,
for which 2.39% applies)
Network - 3.25%
6.  Income Taxes
Income Taxes are provided at 41.7% of taxable income.
