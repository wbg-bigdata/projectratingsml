Description  The proposed PRSC-1 i s the first ina series of operations supporting the
             implementationof the Government of Lesotho's (GOL) Poverty Reductionand
             Growth Strategy. The proposed operation i s part of ajoint effort by
             development partners inLesotho to provide predictable and performance-
             related budget support to GOL within a unifiedframework. As a result, the
             proposed measures are part of ajoint Performance Assessment Framework
             (PAF) agreedbetween IDA, GOL andkey development partners. The PRSC-1
             will support GOL reform efforts inthe following areas:

                 (0     Addressingits growth agenda, focusing on improving the business
                        environment and improving the quality of information for decision
                        making;

                 (ii) Enhancingtheeffectivenessofpublicexpendituresandsharpening
                        the strategic focus of the budget by strengthening its link with the
                        Poverty Reductionand Growth Strategy and the macroeconomic and
                        budget framework; and

                 (iii) Improvingservicedeliveryinkeysectorsbyenhancingaccessand
                        quality and capacity to deliver services at all levels of Government.

             The proposed operation i s an integralpart of the Bank's Country Assistance
             Strategy for Lesotho.

Benefits     The operation will contribute to strengthening the business environment and
             promoting economic diversification leading to broad-based and employment-
             generating growth. By supporting the improvement inthe quality of data,
             decision makingby policy makers i s expected to bebased on reliable
             information.

             It will enhance the oversight of public finances andthe procurement and



                                            V

             financial management systems, thereby increasing the efficiency and
             effectiveness of public sector spending, which currently accounts for about 50
             percent of GDP.

             Reforms supporting service delivery at the central and local level will improve
             the quality of life of the Basotho people.

            The PRSC will also contribute to the harmonizationagendathrough a greater
             alignment with key donors and Government systems. It is designed to
             strengthen and support domestic accountability, reduce transaction costs and
             develop and use Lesotho's own systems rather than setting up andusing
             parallel donor systems. A unified PAF will be used by Government and all its
             General Budget Support (GBS) partners to monitor and evaluate the
             implementationof the program, inline with the budget timetable.

Risks        The operation faces many of the risks identified inthe CAS, andare:

             (i)Administrative capacity and coordination, a problem often encountered in
             "Small States": Lesotho's relatively limited Government administrative
             capacity and coordinationamong relevant central and local agencies could lead
             to delays inthe implementationof key reformmeasuresparticularly related to
             service delivery. To mitigate this potential coordinationfailure,
             implementationarrangements for the PRSC seek to ensure oversight and buy-in
             at the political level. Capacity building initiatives underway with support from
             other Development Partners will also mitigate this risk;

             (ii)External risks associatedwith a small domestic economy and a huge
             reliance on external markets: These include a possible deterioration of the
             external environment, inparticular, uncertainty regarding the evolution of
             Southern African Customs Union (SACU) transfers, oil and food price shocks,
             garment exports, and remittances from Basotho workers inSouth African
             mines. Mitigating these risks depends on Lesotho's capacity to adjust to the
             shocks andthe Government's ability to manage the impact of the shocks. The
             ongoing export diversification efforts and further strengthening of the fiscal
             framework andpublic finance management under the PRSC will help mitigate
             these risks. Predictable and timely budget support through the PRSC series and
             from other development partners will also help mitigatethe external risks;

                                I. INTRODUCTION


1.      This Program Document proposes a First Poverty Reduction Support Grant for
SDR 4.4 million (US$7.2 million equivalent) and Credit for SDR 9.7 million (US$15.9
million equivalent) to the Kingdom of Lesotho. This is the first ina series of three annual
development policy operations (DPO), consistent with the CAS' to assist the
Government's reform program in support of Lesotho's Poverty Reduction and Growth
Strategy (PRGS). A new framework of budget support has been developed under the
leadership of the Government of Lesotho (GOL) with five participating development
partners, including IDA.*It comprises a multi-year Performance Assessment Framework
(PAF) and a review process aimed at reducing transaction costs for the Government and
the cooperating partners. While the PRSC operations together with the contribution by
the Joint Budget Support (JBS) Donor Group will provide reliable and timely financial
support for the implementation of the PRGS, each operation will be disbursed against
specific prior actions as identified inthe PAF.

2.      The proposed PRSC-I supports Government's reform efforts in the following
three areas: (i)achieving broad-based growth by improving the business environment and
improving the quality of information for decision making; (ii)enhancing the
effectiveness of public expenditures by strengthening the links between the PRGS andthe
macroeconomic and budget framework, and strengthening public finance management;
and (iii)improving access and quality of basic services through effective implementation
of sectoral programs and empowerment of communities at all levels of Government. In
parallel, Bank support directly enhancing Lesotho's growth potential i s being addressed
through on-going IDA investment projects in infrastructure (transport and water) and
private sector development.




 The currentCAS was discussedby the Board inApril 2006 (ReportNo. 35621-LS).
 The other development partners are the EuropeanUnion, United Kingdom (DFID),African Development
Bank (AfDB) and Ireland. Germany (GTZ), while not providing budgetsupport has been actively engaged
inthe processas well.

                        11. COUNTRY CONTEXT

                              A.     COUNTRYOVERVIEW

3.      Lesotho is a small country, with a population of around 2 million, fully
surrounded by and heavily dependent on South Africa.                 Many of the key
macroeconomic determinants in Lesotho are strongly influenced by the monetary union
and the pegged exchange rate with South Africa under the Common Monetary Area
(CMA), membership inthe Southern African Development Community (SADC), and the
Southern Africa Customs Union (SACU).        Reliance on: (i)remittances - from miners
and other laborers employed inSouth Africa; (ii) revenues from SACU; and (iii)
                                                 customs
sale of water to South Africa has played an important role inLesotho's growth path over
the past few decades.

4.      The dependence on South Africa has declined in recent years as the economy
has diversified. Until the 1980s, almost half of Lesotho GNP was generated in South
Africa, by its miningremittance income. B y the end of the 1990s, the situation was being
reversed. Lesotho now produces nearly 80 percent of its GNP. Much of its exports,
comprising 40 percent of GNP in 2006, came from an FDI-driven garments sector that
exports to the US market and that i s independent of South Africa. Infact, there i s now
FDI from South Africa in the garment sector that targets the South African economy.
Lesotho has, however, remained dependent on South Africa for many critical services
such as banking, medicalreferrals, higher education, and SACU revenues.

                           Box 1: Lesotho: Political Context

Lesotho was established as a British Protectorate in 1868 and became an independent
constitutional monarchy in 1966 after holding its first democratic elections in 1965.
However, the early years of independence were marked by conflicts between political
parties and power struggles between the civilian and military regimes. Constitutional
Government was restored in 1993 after seven years of military rule. In 1998, violent
protests and a military mutiny following a contentious election prompted a brief but
bloody intervention by South African and Botswanan military forces under the aegis of
SADC. Subsequent constitutionalreforms restored relative political stability and peaceful
parliamentary elections were held in 2002. Notwithstanding the political difficulties,
there was no substantial shift in Government policies. Following the 2002 elections, the
National Development Goals and the Vision 2020 documents were prepared, and a
Poverty Reduction Strategy was completed in 2004. The first ever multi-party local
Government elections were successfully held inApril 2005. More recently, the National
Assembly elections of February 2007 were hotly contested and aggrieved parties
continue to periodically contest the allocation of seats in the 120 member National
Assembly. Post election dialogue between the Government and the opposition parties is
beingfacilitated by the SADC Organ on Politics.

5.      Real economic growth averaged about 3.8 percent over 1991-2006, above the
average for sub-Saharan Africa. Growth was strongest in 1991-95, largely reflecting



                                            2

the impact of substantial public investment in the Lesotho Highlands Water Project
(LHWP). Growth slowedinthe later part of the decade, mainly dueto the political crisis
in 1997-98 which led to massive destruction of physical infrastructure, and a decline in
workers' remittances because of a sharp drop in miningjobs inSouth Africa. Real GDP
growth recovered during 2001-2003, averaging 3.7 percent. This growth was driven by
the garment industry arising as a result of preferential trade access under the U.S. African
Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). Overcoming the negative impact the strong loti
had on garment exports during 2002-2004, economic growth has surged in recent years
(see paragraph 10 below).

6.      Overall policy performance has been good and Lesotho stands among the
better African performers on a broad range of economic and structural policies.
Lesotho's CPIA was 3.6 in 2006 against the Sub-Saharan average of 3.3.
Macroeconomic management has been good and the Government has adopted prudent
fiscal policies over the last several years and has recorded a fiscal surplus since 2003/04.
Less than 10 percent of Lesotho's budget is funded by foreign aid. Public expenditure
management, though still weak, has been improving as well with the adoption of the
medium-term planning framework.         As a member of SACU, Lesotho's trade regime
under a common tariff structure is somewhat complicated and distorted. There is,
however, relatively easy movement of goods and services across its borders.

7.      Despite the relatively good growth performance, Lesotho remains a poor
country and there has been little if any improvement in its social indicators. Poverty
i s widespread. While new evidence from the 2002/03 Household Budget Survey shows
an overall decline inpoverty compared to 1994/95, over half of the population of Lesotho
still remains below the national poverty line of about US$1.50 per day. The overall
HumanDevelopment Index (HDI)for Lesotho also saw a significant decline from 0.57 in
1995 to 0.49 in 2004 (2006 Human Development Report). Life expectancy at birth
declined to about 35 years in 2004. Some improvement in life expectancy at birth has
been recorded in 2005, while the component related to education has remained
unchanged. Combined with an increase in per capita GDP (PPP terms), the overall HDI
index has improved to 0.55 in2005. However, major health and nutrition indicators are
stagnating, ifnot declining.

8.      The HIV/AIDS epidemic is an enormous challenge for Lesotho. According to
UNAIDS, Lesotho has the third highest HIV prevalence rate in the world, after
Swaziland and Botswana. In2005, the estimated adult HIV prevalence was 23.2 percent,
equal to 270,000 HIV infected people (UNAIDS, 2006). Some progress has been made in
terms of the provision of antiretroviral (ARV) treatment for HIV positive people: the
number of ARV sites increased from 68 in December 2006 to 104 a year later.
Correspondingly, the cumulative number of adults on ARV increased sevenfold from
4,414 in 2005 to 29,487 by end-2007. In 2007, Lesotho changed its medical eligibility
criterion for patients receiving ARV, from CD4 count of 200 to a more liberal 350, thus
increasing the number requiring treatment by getting them earlier into therapy. Using
this new criterion, only about 25 percent of adults and 26 percent of children are
receiving treatment. The challenge is daunting as the target i s to give ARV to 80 percent



                                              3

of the people inneed by 2010. A key constraint i s the lack of skilled health personnel.
As the AIDS epidemic spreads, so does the co-infection from tuberculosis (TB). TB
prevalence has increased dramatically from 75 per 100,000 people in 1990 to 171 per
100,000 people by 2007.

9.      The challenge for policy makers is to sustain growth at six to seven percent
per annumor higherwhile addressing the humandevelopment issues. This has to be
tackled under the backdrop of limited institutional capacity that is especially a problem in
small states. Deepening regional integration and exploiting its proximity to South Africa
and tailoring the spillover to its own advantage can provide an important contribution to
addressing these challenges by creating higher earning non-agriculturaljobs. This could
imply: (i) using the design of South Africa's institutions as a template for many of its
own institutions with appropriate modifications; (ii)using South Africa's superior
services more pro-actively to promote its own development goals, including
arrangements with South Africa's agricultural extension agencies to provide timely
services to Basotho agriculture and livestock farmers; (iii)  makingLesotho an attractive
investment destination for South African firms looking to improve their value chains
(e.g,. by manufacturing partsfor the auto industry); and (iv) twinning with South Africa's
tourism authorities to include andpromote Lesotho as a destination.


                       B.      RECENTECONOMICDEVELOPMENTS


10.     While growth has been erratic in the last few years, economic performance
was strong in 2006. Lesotho's growth path has been closely linked to the external
environment, weather conditions and the strength and weakness o f the randto which the
loti is pegged. Following a respectable growth of over 4 percent in2004, real GDP grew
by less than 3 percent in 2005, owing to the uncertainty about the extension of the
Agreement on Textiles and Clothing beyond December 2004. This was compounded by
the relatively strong rand, hence the loti, against the US dollar, which hampered textile
and clothing exports to the United States. Real GDProse 7.2 percent in2006, driven by
booming diamond production, a recovery of the garment industry, and good performance
inthe agriculture and services sectors. While drought returned in2007 and Agriculture's
contribution to GDP growth was negative, mining, garment industry, and construction
remained vibrant andoverall GDP growth i s expected to be about 5 percent.

11.     Fiscal performancehas been solid and a fiscal surplus has been registered
every year since 2003/04. The fiscal surplus in 2006/07 amounted to 14 percent of
GDP. While these favorable outcomes were made possible by strong SACU revenues,
domestic revenue collection also improved largely reflecting improved tax administration
since the establishment of the Lesotho Revenue Authority in 2003. Lesotho's SACU
receipts have risen sharply since 2003/04, repeatedly exceeding budget forecasts and
resulting in large "windfalls." The very large SACU transfers in recent years are mostly
due to rapid growth in South African imports and hence rising import duty and excise
revenues collected by South Africa and the transition from the old to a new revenue-
sharing formula agreed in 2002. Expenditure growth was moderate, with significant



                                             4

under-execution of capital expenditures, reflecting capacity constraints as well as
complex procurement procedures.                   Government has been prudent in using these
unexpected revenues and it has used the funds to retire high interest bearing commercial
debt andbuildits international reserves. The ratio of external debt to GDP declined from
58 percent in 2004 to 43 percent in 2007. Gross international reserves increased to six
months of imports in2006 and about eight months in2007.

12.     Reflectinghigh transfers from SACU and exports of textiles and diamonds,
the current account balanceregistereda substantialsurplusin 2006.The recovery of
the garment industry was facilitated by the extension of AGOA,3 a cut in corporate tax
rates, and a depreciation of the rand. Inflation has increased since the last quarter of 2006
owing to rising food and energy prices, but remains inthe single digits, broadly mirroring
trends in South Africa.             In July 2007, Lesotho and the US Millennium Challenge
Corporation (MCC) signed a compact for US$363 million (23 percent of 2007 GDP) to
be implemented over the next five years and covering the areas of water, health, and
private sector development.

13.      Broad money grew by about 35 percent in 2006. Combined with a decline in
the net domestic assets reflecting the fiscal surplus, net foreign assets of the banking
system increased substantially. Rising workers' remittances4 also contributed to growth
inmoneyandnet foreign assets.

               c.        MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBTSUSTAINABILITY

14.      The medium-term outlook for Lesotho is generally positive. Real GDP is
projected to grow by about 5 percent in2007 and could average nearly 5.5 percent inthe
mediumterm, drivenby continued expansion inmining, moderate growth of the garment
industry5,and a pick-up in construction driven by high public investment. The latter is
based on large grants that Government is expected to receive during the next five years
under the MCC compact. This will allow it to undertake significant capital investment in
the development of the country's health infrastructure and water supply, and private
sector development. In particular, the construction of Metolong dam with support of
MCC and other donors is expected to increase the potential for the location of "wet
industries" such as fabric production, which would allow Lesotho to take fuller advantage
of AGOA beyond 2012. Agriculture is expected to make a negative contribution in2007
due to the drought and its prospects are heavily dependant on the weather.




  AGOA has beenextended through to 2015 and its third-country fabric provision which was scheduledto
lapse in2007 has been extended through 2012.
  While the number of miners has been declining inSouth African mines, averagewages have been
increasing and there has also been an increase inthe non-miner remittances.
  The recovery is basedon the extension of AGOA and has taken place without new investments. The
potential is larger if the infrastructure bottlenecks, particularly limited factory space can be overcome.

15.      Continued use of prudent fiscal policies to maintain macroeconomic stability
is necessary. SACU revenues are likely to remain high at least through 2009/10 because
of higheconomic activity inSouth Africa. However, the highlevel of spending envisaged
inthe 2007/08budget-an            increase of 5 percentage points of GDP incurrent expenditure
and a more than doubling of capital expenditure to 16percent of GDP-could                           undermine
fiscal sustainability and spending quality. If the budget is executed as planned, the
Government will face its first fiscal deficit in five years, of about 3 percent of GDP.
Implementation of the budget i s critically dependent on the capacity of line ministries.
While there is an expectation that the budget will not be fully executed, the fact that the
appropriations are higher than what can be reasonably expected to be executed reduces
the budget's usefulness as a programming instrument. Inthis case, a small fiscal surplus

i s anticipated. Reflecting high SACU revenue, sustained non-SACU domestic revenue,
and strict expenditure policies, the medium-term fiscal framework projects fiscal
surpluses (excluding grants) through 2010/11, even though Government investment is
substantially above its level of recent years. This projection implies a significant
reduction in current expenditure as a ratio to GDP, which will be difficult to deliver.
While the projected revenue provides some margin of safety, the risks to revenue itself
makethis anon-sustainable solution.

16.      The current account balance is forecast to remain strong due to high
diamondand garmentexports,and continuedlargeSACU revenuesto 2010. Thenit
i s projected to deteriorate somewhat as SACU revenues revert back to more normal
levels. Remittances are anticipated to rise in nominal terms-although                  diminishing as a
ratio to GDP-as        the increase in average pay is expected to more than offset the decline
inthe number of workers resultingfrom structural changesinSouthAfrican mines.

 17.      Lesotho's externaland publicdebts are projectedto be sustainable,although
there is a moderaterisk of debt distress. This assessmentis basedon the updatedjoint
IMF-World Bank debt sustainability analysis (DSA), completed in October 2007.6 It
comprises external and domestic debt, and i s based on the framework for low-income
countries that takes into account indicative thresholds for debt burden indicators
determined by the quality of the country's policies and institutions:                     and comprises
baseline and alternative scenarios. Thus under the IDA 14 criteria, Lesotho i s a "yellow
light" country, receiving half its allocation inthe form of Grants andhalf as Credits.

 18.      In the baseline scenario, debt should continue to decline over the medium-
term. Lesotho's nominal public sector debt declined from 89.1 percent of GDP in2002
to 51.4 percent of GDP (US $746.0 million) at the end of 2006, reflecting in part, the
early repayment of non-concessional loans, limited new borrowing, and an exchange rate
appreciation between 2003 and 2006. The NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio, which was
fractionally above the threshold in2006, is expected to gradually decrease to 21percent
in2017, below the policy-based indicative threshold (40 percent); and the NPV of debt-
to-export ratio would also fall gradually to 41 percent by 2017, significantly below the
 150 percent threshold.

19.     Deterioration of the external environment poses a significant risk. The
evolution of the global regime for trade intextiles will affect Lesotho's export sector. In
particular, there is pressure to extend preferences to non-African countries similar to
those established by AGOA. Further, Chinese exports to the U.S. and EU markets are
expectedto be quota-free again in2008. Inthe absenceof actions to improve productivity
inthe sector, Lesotho's garment industry will not remain competitive inthe international
market.     Recognizing these risks, Government intends to strengthen infrastructure,
notably electricity and water, to support productivity increases and vertical integrationin
the textile sector. Short-run risks also emanate from the possible slowdown in the U.S.
economy which could affect orders for garment producers.

20.     A medium- to long-term risk, especially for the budget, concerns the
evolution of SACU revenues. SACU revenues (accounting for about 60 percent of total
revenues in recent years) are expected to remain high in the medium-term. However,
these could be affected by an economic slowdown in South Africa and trade
liberalization. While this will lower the revenue pool, South Africa has also called for a
review of SACU's revenue-sharing arrangements, although it has not submitted a
concrete proposal. In addition, the call for SADC to evolve into a customs union raises
uncertainty about the durability of existing rules. While these changes are not imminent,
Lesotho should consider their revenue implications inits planningandbudgetingprocess.

21.     Sensitivity tests show that while Lesotho's debt burden would worsen in the
event of an adverse macroeconomic shock or weaker economic performance, it
would remain below the indicative thresholds in most cases. Lesotho will face more
distress from lower rates of growth and a much lower level of non-debt creating inflows


                                                   8

such as FDI in the next several years. Borrowing on less favorable terms will lead to
some deterioration in the external debt indicators, but the indicators will still remain
below the indicative thresholds.



                111. THE GOVERNMENT'SPROGRAM


22.     Lesotho's Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) covering the period 2004/05 -
2006/07 articulates the Government's development agenda. This document i s also the
basis for coordination and harmonization with and among development partners. The
PRS identifies three key areas for Government action.

e       The first i s to facilitate economic growth that creates employment and income
        earning opportunities. The key objectives under this pillar are to create non-
        agricultural employment, improve agriculture and food security, and develop
        infrastructure while managing and conserving the environment.

e       The second i s to empower the poor and the vulnerable and improve their access to
        basic services. The objectives under the second pillar are to improve the quality
        of and access to health care and social services; and to improve the quality of and
        access to education and make it more relevant to the needs of the market.

e       The third is to deepen democracy and improve public sector performance, to
        ensure that policies and legal frameworks facilitate the full implementation of
        priorities. In addition to the three main pillars of the PRS, the GOL recognizes
        two major cross-cutting themes of national importance: HIV/AIDS, and gender,
        children and youth. The GOL plans to strengthen the legal, institutional and
        policy framework to the levels required to combat the HIV/AIDS epidemic,
        remove gender discriminative practices and address the urgent needs of children
        andthe youth of today.

23.     GOL has produced a PRS Progress Report.8The objective of the Progress
Report (PR) is to provide a comprehensive review of policy implementation, which will
guide the process of producing a new medium-term national development plan (NDP).
Government's implementationrecord on the PRS i s mixed. While some objectives have
been met and progress has been made inachieving other objectives, there are many areas
where the efforts have fallen short and no progress has been a~hieved.~Progress has
been made in attracting foreign investment. Progress has also been made in adoption of
appropriate farming technologies through pilots, however, extension services have not

seen a significant improvement and the National Land Policy is not yet finalized and
adopted.

24.     Given that the PRS expired inMarch 2007, the Government is preparing a PRGS
update. This update will be informed by recently available data from the Household
Budget Survey as well as the ongoing analytical work on Poverty, Gender and Social
Assessment, PRS Progress Report and a Growth Strategy. This update i s a reflection not
of a change in priorities but a stronger focus on broad based growth to achieve poverty
reduction. It will span the period till April 2010, by which time the Government expects
to have its five year NDP in place. Government confirmed that until the update i s
finalized, the existing PRS remains operational as a Government planning document and
supplemented by ongoing updates provides a sound basis for a budget support
framework. While the PRGS i s expected to be finalized by June 2008, the key elements
of the strategy are incorporated inthe Government's Performance PAF (paragraph 41).

Growth and Diversification

25.     The Government wants to buiM on the lessons and successes of the garment
sector, facilitating entry of other light manufacturing export-oriented activities and
strengthening the linkages of the export-oriented sectors with the domestic economy.
Lesotho has made great strides and gained much in terms of its success in the garment
manufacturing industrymade possible by AGOA. This Agreement, while extended from
its original expiration of December 2004, will expire in 2015 and the provision of
sourcing fabric from third countries i s scheduled to expire in2012. Lesotho now has the
window of opportunity to consolidate the current investment in the textile and clothing
sector while pursuing a product and market diversification strategy. Already some new
large investments sponsored by South Africa in the garments sector is gaining strategic
importance. These investments target the South African market with benefits beyond
2015 - when AGOA i s expected to expire. South African investors are also showing
interest in the tourism and agro-business sectors. This introduces opportunities for much
needed export diversification and a trend to connect the Lesotho and South African
economies inanew way.

26.     Together with Botswana, Mozambique, and Swaziland, Lesotho signed an interim
(goods only) Economic Partnership Agreement with the EU on 23 November 2007. The
agreement allows for duty-free and quota-free access to the EU market as of 1January
2008 (with transition periods for sugar and rice) and 86 percent liberalization by import
value by Lesotho. In order to benefit from these trade preferences, the Government
intends to facilitate the import of inputs to its clothing industry.    Inthis respect it
recognizes that it is crucial that the time taken to export and import is reduced from 44
and49 days, respectively (Doing Business Indicators, 2008).

27.     The Government has already established a Trade and Investment Facilitation
Center (TIFC) in September 2007, also known as the "One Stop Shop", which brings
under one roof the functions of approval of trading and manufacturing licenses, import
and export issuances, residency visas and work permits. While investment promotion



                                              10

activities have been successful to an extent, investors are being held back by insufficient
factory shells as well as lack of reliable electricity. These capacity problems that are
emerging in infrastructure will constrain the expansion of textiles and clothing and also
the development of new sectors unless urgently addressed. With the support of DfID,the
Government i s undertaking a feasibility study on the development of new industrial
estates that will provide crucial guidance to overcoming this bottleneck. The Government
i s now focusing on reforms in the domestic business environment which will seek to
stimulate private sector investment and employment creation. Plans are also underway to
establish a One Stop Border Post to bring down border related trade barriers and reduce
the number of days it takes to export and import from the current high of 44 and 49 days
respectively.

28.     Several institutional reform measures are underway in the transport sector to
improve the transport infrastructure.      O f principal interest is the consolidation of
management of the road network with the creation of a Roads Directorate inthe Ministry
of Public Works and Transport. Its establishment i s expected in late 2008 and will be on
commercialization principles. The Government in 2006 took the first step towards
sustainable financing for road maintenance with adjustments of user fees collected by the
Road Fund. Tolls were increased in April 2008. The Government plans to take further
steps during the lifetime of the Integrated Transport Project (fundedby IDA),resulting in
full financial sustainability of road maintenance. With the decentralization program,
ownership of part of the road network, mainly community roads, have been transferred to
local authorities. Gradual building up of capacities at local levels as well as in urban
areas needs to take place.

29.     Lesotho's    PRGS also focuses on supporting agricultural productivity
improvements. While the rural population remains large (over 60 percent), most rural
households get less than 20 percent of their food needs from agriculture, and about 40
percent report agriculture as their main source of income.        So this sector does not
function as food security for most households. Nor does it work well as a livelihood.
Thus, the priority to be given to new public investments in the sector needs to be
reviewed carefully. Public investments which bring in private investment to the sector
should be encouraged. Inthis context, it i s widely perceived that Lesotho's land tenure
system i s one of the key constraints to economic growth. Land i s leasedunder short-term
arrangements (share-cropping)        which   encourages degradation       and discourages
investment. Land held under common property arrangements is subject to overgrazing
and underinvestment. Individuals who under-use their land cannot sell the land to those
who would use it more productively, whether for agriculture or as loan collateral. It is
impossible for a foreign investor to buy or lease agricultural land in Lesotho. It is
prohibited to fence land hence the possibility of modem practices of range management
i s seriously limited. Land Reform encompasses a wide variety of social and economic
issues and Lesotho's draft Growth Strategy Paper i s trying to address them holistically.

30.      The Government recognizes the need to improve policy making ability for which
statistical information i s crucial. The quality of data at present i s uneven and not very
reliable in many areas. And there is no data strategy in place.       National accounts are



                                             11

under complete revision, agricultural production statistics are unreliable, household
survey data is collected infrequently. As a result, the data i s not very reliable and
informative for policy making purposes.       Statistical capacity building is crucial to
manage not only the formulation of policies but also their implementation and
monitoring. To this end, the Government has started the preparation of a National
Strategy for the Developmentof Statistics (NSDS).

Public Financial Management

31.     Government plays a substantial role in the economy of Lesotho, with public
expenditures accounting for about 45-50 percent of GDP, reaching levels of about 60
percent of GDP in 2007/08. As mentioned earlier, this high level of overall public
spending has been made possible by high SACU revenues. However, there have been
concerns regarding the effectiveness and efficiency of public expenditures. In order to
narrow the gap between sound policy objectives and the actual economic and social
outcomes envisioned in its PRGS, sound public expenditure management and control
mechanisms are essential.

32.     The Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability Assessment (PEFA)
finalized in 2007 noted some budgetary improvements. Lesotho has an orderly and
participative budget process, involving spending agencies and the political leadership in
accordance with a pre-determined budget calendar that is broadly adhered to. Cabinet
discussion of the budget has been enhanced by the establishment of a Cabinet Budget
Committee, chaired by the Deputy Prime Minister and comprising the Minister of
Finance and eight other ministers. While revenue outcomes are not significantly different
from budget estimates, expenditures vary significantly across ministries. Under-spending
inmany line ministriesreflects poor planningand lack of implementation capacity. The
PEFA also highlighted deficiencies in budget execution, internal control, accounting
delays, audit backlogs andpoor fiscal reporting.

33.     To address these weaknesses, the Government has embarked on a comprehensive
PFM reform program. And significant progress has been made on strengthening public
financial management in support of the PRGS. Areas of weakness have been identified
and three Task Forces, covering the areas of planning and budgeting, accounting and
reporting, and audit and oversight have been established. These have each developed a
program of deliverables and report to an overarching PFM Improvement and Reform
Steering Committee, chaired by the Principal Secretary of MFDP and comprising senior
officials of MFDP. The work of the planning and budgeting task force focuses on
integrating planning and budgeting processes through a medium-term expenditure
framework (MTEF). The work of the accounting and reporting task force aims to
develop effective budget execution and reporting systems. The work of the audit and
oversight task force focuses on: (i)providing technical support to the Auditor-General's
office to increase its technical capacity; and (ii)
                                                  providing technical support to upgrade
the capacity of the Public Accounts Committee.

Improving ServiceDelivery and Tackling the HIV/AIDS Pandemic

34.     Getting services to the general population, much less to the poor, remains a
challenge for the Government. The quality and efficiency of service delivery, and the
targeting of services to the most vulnerable sections of society remains a significant
concern.

35.     Health. The share of the health budget over the total Government budget has
increased steadily from 5.8 percent in 2000 to about 11percent in 2007. However, the
poor and rural areas have suffered worse health outcomes and benefited less from
essential health services. This persists across almost all the health outcomes (e.g. child
mortality, maternal mortality, and malnutrition) and health services (e.g., immunization,
antenatal care, and assisted delivery by medical staff). Although 79.5 percent of the
population has reasonable access (5km radius) to health facilities, large regional
disparities exist. The remote mountainous and Senqu River Valley areas have poor access
to key health services. Lesotho's human resources for health are in a state of crisis.
Despite recent major recruitments, about 18 percent of the established posts continue to
be unfilled (including 20-25 vacancies for doctors). Several key development partners
(including the Bank) are jointly supporting a long-term health sector reform led by the
Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MOHSW) in order to achieve a sustainable
increase inaccess to quality preventive, curative and rehabilitative health care services in
Lesotho. The support is organized through a Sector-wide approach (SWAP), with an
agreed sector expenditure framework, harmonized fiduciary systems, and common
performance indicators.

36.     Inits efforts to improve health services, Government has successfully completed
the tender of a new referral hospital to replace the Queen Elizabeth 2 hospital inMaseru.
The proposedhospital is basedon the principles of Public PrivatePartnership (PPP). The
new 390 bed public hospital will be designed, built and fully operated (including clinical
services) by the private operator for 18 years. The operator will also refurbish and
upgrade three semi-urban filter clinics to provide improvedprimary and secondary health
services to the public in the capital city of Maseru.       The project's innovative PPP
 structure enables Government to maximize the quality and quantity of health services
while remaining within the budget, while the private sector has been presented with a
new and robust market opportunity. Most importantly, this also means that patients will
have access to significantly better medical services without increasing the minimal
 charge they pay for public services today.

 37.     HIV/AIDS. To address the enormous challenge posed by HIV/AIDS,
 Government and NGOs are ramping up HIV prevention programs with the support of
 donors.   The updated National HIV and AIDS Policy document was adopted in
 December 2006. The Government is committed to the `Three Ones" principle of the
 United Nations: one coordinating body, one strategic plan and one monitoring and
 evaluation system. To this effect, the National AIDS Commission has been established
 with a broad mandate for multi-sector coordination; a National Strategic Plan for 2006-
 2011has been prepared to ensure decentralized and community driven national response;



                                             13

and a National Monitoring and Evaluation Plan has been prepared to track adherence to
the provisions of the policy as well as its implementationthrough the Strategic plan. It is
being implemented through annual Operational plans, starting with 2007.              Four focal
areas" have been identified for the successful management of the HIV and AIDS
epidemic: (i)     management, coordination, and support mechanisms; (ii)        prevention; (iii)
treatment, care, and support; and (iv) impact mitigation. However, a major bottleneck is
the shortage of workers, especially those knowledgeable about behavior change
communications.

38.     Education. There has been rapid growth in primary education since the phased
introduction of free primary education (WE) from 2000. The Net Enrollment rate has
reached 83 percent (2006) and continues to rise with new school construction in rural
areas, making it feasible that Lesotho will meet the MDG goals for primary completion.
The phased introduction of FPE and controlled increase inenrollment have enabled the
quality of education to be protected to some extent, but there remain concerns about the
rising proportion of untrained teachers (with 41 percent unqualified in 2006), lack of
textbooks for some subjects and grades, poor facilities in many schools, and weak
support and supervision structures. Enrolment i s lowest inmountain regions. The cohort
survival rate i s low, with only 38 percent of the 2000 intake reaching grade 7 on
schedule. Quality of learning outcomes, as indicated by the SACMEQ I1reading and
mathematics tests (451 and 447 respectively) was below the regional average (500). More
recent results from national assessmenttests suggestthat outcomes are improving slowly.

39.     Expenditure in the education sector is among the highest in the region at 27
percent (2006/07, including the bursaries provided by the National Manpower
Development Service (NMDS)). While 40 percent of education expenditure was devoted
to primary education, a further 35 percent was allocated to tertiary education, much of it
inthe form of bursaries to students (through the NMDS). This expenditure pattern leaves
little room for expansion of secondary education. Balancing these competing demands
with the budget constraints and the need to sustain the progress inprimary education will
be the major focus of planning in the coming years. The Government has developed an
ambitious Education Sector Strategic Plan (2005-2015) to guide the growth of the sector.
Part of this plan, endorsed by the development partners, involves a move to a more
coordinated SWAP and some progress has been made inthis regard.

40.      Some progress has been made on the decentralization agenda. After more than
35 years, the elected local Government system in Lesotho was reestablished in 2005
through the election of the Local Authorities (128 Community Councils (CCs) were
elected and formed the basis of 10 District Councils (DCs), incorporating traditional
authorities (Chiefs), alongside with the pre-existing district administration representing
the central Government. The new system of local authorities was home grown and
supported across the political spectrum, leading to a swift establishment of the elected
councils. Since then the Government has implemented the system and transferred staff,
functions and some resources in a gradual approach.                Decentralization is aimed to

areas.   The passage of the 2008 Local Government Service Act, 2008 makes the
provision for a local government service. Transfer of officers from other public services
can now apply for positions inthe Local Government Service.

41.     The Government's PAF builds on these priorities. Discussions to guide the
development of a PAFhave established consensus on the main areas to be included inthe
PAF and the nature of indicators to be included in the framework. A combination of
process and outcome indicators has been identified in the PAF. The PAF defines and
elaborates the main objectives and a number of indicators of progress inthe areas o f (i)
Economic Growth and Macroeconomic Performance; (ii)Governance and PFM; (iii)
Human Development; and (iv) Capacity Development. Under each of these pillars,
specific areas inwhich progress i s to be monitoredhave been identifiedas follows:


0       Growth and macroeconomicpe@ormance:investment climate; roadmaintenance;
        and industrial infrastructure.
0       Governance:decentralization; anti-corruption; civil service reforms; and Public
        Financial Management (budget process; financial management; procurement;
        institutional reforms; and PFMexternal oversight).
0       Human Development:HIV andAIDS; health; and education.
0       Capacity Development: strengthening of National Monitoring andEvaluation
        System; and development of national statistics.

42.     These key messages are also reflected in the Government's budget for 2008/09
financial year. The budget focuses on (i)               building the economic infrastructure; (ii)
continuing to invest in health and education; (iii)building a conducive investment
climate; and (iv) continuing public financial reforms. Reflecting the need for adequate
planningand more accurate identificationof required infrastructure to unleash the growth
potential, the budget allocation for infrastructure has not increased substantially in
2008/09." The Government has made a significant provision in the 2008/09 budget for
the establishment of a Pension Fund to be administered by an Independent Board of
Trustees to cuver contingent liability in the social security sectuJ2. This will change the
pension scheme from the current unfunded one to a Pre-funded one where Government
and the employee make annual contributions that go into the Fundthat i s invested. The
initial capital injection of M 600 million has been made to the Fund and a budget
provision of M 122.6 million has been made to cover the full annual cost of government
contribution. With regards to capital expenditures, overall, the share of General Services
inthe budget has declined from 3.3 percent of GDP in2007/08 to 3.2 percent of GDP.
and the share of Social services has increased from 3.7 percent of GDP to 4.0 percent of
GDP and the share of economic services has increased from 4.6 percent of GDP to 5.0



  While the share of the budgetallocation for the Ministry of Trade, Industry, Cooperatives and Marketing
increasedby 20 percent, the share of budget allocation for the Ministry of Public Works and Transport
declinedoverall from 7.5 percentto 7.2 percentof the total budget. The share of capitalbudget,however,
increasedmarginally from 19 to 20 percentof the total capital budget.
  This provisionis limitedto civil servants 40 years and old at the presenttime.


                                                    15

percent of GDP over the same period. Recurrent expenditures also show an increase in
the social and economic sectors.

43.    IDA and other Cooperating Partners will draw from the PAF when designing
disbursement arrangements for their general budget support programs.



       IV. BANKSUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S
                                    PROGRAM

                A.     LINKSTOTHECOUNTRYASSISTANCESTRATEGY

44.    The proposed PRSC is an integral part of the Bank's assistance to Lesotho as
outlined in the CAS. The current CAS was approved in April 2006 and covers a four
year period (FYO6-09). The CAS is fully aligned to the PRS and is designed to help
achieve four key outcomes: (i)   fighting HIV/AIDS pandemic; (ii)  sustainable pro-poor
growth and job creation through the creation of an enabling environment for private
sector development and investments, exploitation of growth potential in the rural
economy, improving infrastructure and access to basic services, and ensuring sustainable
use of natural resources; (iii) improving human development outcomes in health and
education; and (iv) decentralization and empowerment of local communities.

45.    The CAS identifies an increasing focus on programmatic support. Realizing that
successful reform often hinges on institutional bottlenecks, the CAS proposes a greater
focus on administrative and institutional reforms.     The CAS also envisages sector
programs to increasingly become part of the PRSC series. Interms of policy areas, as
envisaged in the CAS, the PRSC will support reforms aimed at: (i)   sustainable pro-poor
growth and job creation; (ii)strengthening the institutions of public management and
transparency and accountability in the use of public resources at all levels of
Government; and (iii)improved service delivery and addressing the HIV/AIDS
pandemic.


                 B.     RELATIONSHIPTO OTHERBANKOPERATIONS

46.     The Bank has a very limited portfolio inLesotho due to its small IDA allocation
(about US$15 million per year in this CAS period). The PRSC will complement several
of the current and planned (those proposed in the current CAS) investment projects in
Lesotho. These include the following ongoing projects: Private Sector Competitiveness
and Economic Diversification (PSCED) Project, Integrated Transport Project, and Water
Sector Improvement Project - all geared towards creating an enabling environment for
broad-based growth and improving infrastructure and access to basic services. It also
complements ongoing projects in the Health, Education, and HIV/AIDS geared towards
improving access and quality of services inthese sectors. The PRSC i s also linked to the
second phase of the WSIP (planned for FYO9) which will support long-term solution to
water supply for the capital city and surrounding lowland areas through the construction



                                           16

of the Metolong dam. This i s essential to avoid critical shortages in domestic supplies
and provide water required for continued industrial expansion, particularly inthe textile
industry.

              c.      COORDINATIONWITH THE IMFAND OTHER DONORS

47.    Maintenance of sound macroeconomic management will be a precondition for
implementation of the PRSC.          While there i s no Fund program in Lesotho, Bank
coordination with the IMF is strong and the Bank team participated fully in the review
duringthe FundArticle IV missioninAugust 2007. A joint DSA has also been prepared
within the framework for low income countries.           The staffs will continue this
collaboration throughout the PRSC period and discuss areas of common interest to be
included inthe PRSC program.

48.    The PRSC i s being prepared within the joint framework of budget support
developed under the leadership of the Government of Lesotho (GOL) with five
participating development partners, including IDA. The other development partners are
the European Union, United Kingdom (DFID), African Development Bank (AfDB) and
Ireland. Germany (KfW and GTZ) while not providing direct budget support at present
have beenactive participants inthis process.

49.    In May 2006, development partners established the guiding principles of a
possible future budget support program. It was agreed that a nationally-owned PRS and
an associated common performance assessment framework would provide the basis for
prospective budget support. It was also recognized that the program should align around
the budget timetable and MTEF process and should be mindful of the need to ensure
predictability in disbursements. The program should also aim for a judicious balance
between realism and ambition inthe overall results indicators that would set the basis for
these disbursements. The Government welcomed this approach, noting the importance of
budget support in securing the still fragile reform agenda whilst cautioning against the
use of unrealistic results indicators.

50.    The donors are collaboratingto support Lesotho inimplementing its development
programs by providing financial and technical support in a coordinated manner. A
Memorandum of Under~tanding'~being prepared between the Government of Lesotho
                                      i s
and the key budget support donors to provide a framework and to lay out procedures and
modalities for a multi-donor approachto budget support.


                                  D.      LESSONSLEARNED

51.     This is the first World Bank development lending operation in Lesotho. The
design of the operation i s therefore guided by the overall advice on DPLs provided by
OPCS, including the good practices principles on conditionality and also takes into
account IDA'Soverall experience with regard to implementation of projects in Lesotho.


l3The MOU is expected to be signed inthe coming weeks.


                                                17

It also takes into account the experience from the implementation of the EU budget
support operation inLesotho. These include:


8       The program should be selective, focusing on reforrn areas that will have a
        significant impact when completed.
8       The program should be realistic as to what can be achieved, mindful of capacity
        constraints.
8       Itshould be aligned with the Government's budgettimetable.

8       It should have limited conditionalities/milestones and indicators that are
        monitorable.
8       Where necessary, supporting operations should be inplace to provide technical
        assistance and buildcapacity for reforms.



               V.     THEPROPOSEDPRSCPROGRAM

52.     The proposed PRSC program is composed of three annual Operations supporting
a rolling program of reform underpinning the implementation of the PRGS. While no
major strategic shifts are expected inthe final PRGS, the policy and institutional reforms
to be supported under the second and third year of the program will be tightened after the
finalization of the Government's new PRGS.


                           A.     DEVELOPMENT      OBJECTIVES

53.     The proposed PRSC program aims to contribute to the Government's medium-
term development objectives as set out in the PRS and the Growth Strategy. While
Lesotho has achieved respectable growth rates in the last few years, poverty remains
widespread and unemployment levels are high. The growth fueled by a sharp increase in
miningoutput has not beenbroad-based as the sector is not labor absorbing and has few
forward and backward linkages in the economy. The garment sector employs about
50,000 workers, but prospects for further increases are uncertain given global
liberalization and erosion of preferences. Particular objectives of the growth strategy are
to address the most critical constraints facing the private sector to achieve private sector
led broad-based growth which i s considered to be an essential ingredient for poverty
reduction. High SACU revenues have made possible high levels of public expenditures.
For the Government to use these resources in a way that contributes to growth and
improved welfare of its citizens requires a further strengthening of its public financial
management systems and improvements in service delivery.               By supporting the
implementationof policy and institutional reforms, the proposed PRSC series i s expected
to contribute to broad-based private sector-led growth andpoverty reduction.




                                             18

                     3.     COMPONENTSOFTHEREFORM          PROGRAM

54.    The reform program is organized into three components:

       e      Thefirst component of the Program focuses on institutional reforms that
              can enhance growth by creating an enabling investment climate improving
              the quality of information for decision making.
       e      The second component is directed at enhancing the effectiveness of public
              expenditures and sharpening the strategic focus by strengthening the links
              between the PRGS and the macroeconomic and budget framework, and
              strengthening public finance management at all levels of governance. In
              particular, it focuses on strengthening the fiduciary framework including
              financial management, accountability and transparency of budget
              execution as well as procurement.
       e      The third component aims at improving access and quality of basic
               services through effective implementation of sectoral programs and
               empowerment of communities at all levels of Government. Recognizing
              that successful implementation of decentralization takes a long time, the
              PRSC supports initial elements of reform in the area and focuses on
               sustaining Government efforts to improve the overall institutional setting
               for improved service delivery in health, education, and addressing the
               HIV/AIDS pandemic.

55.    These components directly support various aspects of the Government's PRGS as
reflected inthe PAF and are linked to the CAS objectives. Depending on progress made
inimplementing the reform program and availability of resources, sector programs may
become part of the PRSC in the last year of this series. Not all challenges identified in
the Government's program are included in the PRSC program. The strategic choice of
reform components has been made inlight of the overall program of support provided to
Lesotho by all its development partners. Provision of key infrastructure services such as
roads, water, and electricity are being supported by the Bankunder investment projects as
well as the European Union and MCA. A long-term health sector reform program, which
includes addressing the human resource crisis in the sector, i s being supported by key
DPs through a SWAP. The MCC is supporting the Government in the development of
land policy and a new land administration authority.       Civil service reform i s being
supported by GTZ.


                            C.     ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

56.     The preparation of the PRSC program has been informed by several analytical
studies and reviews. Some of these studies are still work in progress but are at a stage
where they can meaningfully contribute to the preparation of the program.

57.     The Country Economic Memorandum (CEM), Growth and Employment
Options Study (FY05), provides an analysis of the nexus between growth and
employment, and identifies cross cutting and sectoral challenges to economic growth; and



                                            19

proposes a broad-based, shared growth strategy that i s cognizant of external risks. It
identifies highvalue commercial agricultural production and processing as well as higher
value manufactured exports (diversified away from low-grade garments) as potentially
viable sources of growth for Lesotho. It identifies an increase inpublic investment inkey
infrastructure, an increase in private investment and increase in exports as necessary
elements to achieve the growth potential. The PRSC i s inline with the C E M findings. It
places emphasis on improving the investment climate to retain existing investment and
attract new investments for a more diversified manufacturing sector that can take
advantage of the know-how and successful experience of the garment sector; reform of
the land institutions which will allow commercialization of agriculture; and growth of
industries and services, particularly through foreign investment; increase the skill level of
its workforce to raise productivity and thus make Lesotho more competitive in the
international market; and support the provision of key infrastructure for expansion of the
manufacturing sector.

58.     The PRSC is also aligned with the findings and recommendations of the
Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) Report (2006) and the Private Sector
Development (PSD) Strategy (2005). A weak business environment and high costs of
doing business, including high cost and poor access to finance, weak market linkages,
inadequate skills and lack of institutional support to the private sector have been
identified as the key constraints. The PRSC is a vehicle for policy dialogue and
facilitating institutional reform, in particular addressing the issue of simplifying the
business environment and complements the support under the PSCED project.

59.     Considerable analytical and fiduciary work has been undertaken by the Bank and
other donors in assessing the effectiveness of public spending and public financial
management in Lesotho. These include Managing Public Finances for Growth and
Poverty Reduction, Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability
Review (PEMFAR, 2007), Country ProcurementAssessment Review (CPAR, 2007/08),
Public Financial Management (PFM) Inception Report (2005/06, prepared by the
Government with support from DfID) and periodic reviews of PFM program
implementation. These reports helped identify the strengths and main weaknesses of
Lesotho's fiduciary system and have guided the development of Government's PFM
reformprogram over the past two years.

60.     The PEMFAR analysis showed that sectoral allocations remained broadly
unchanged over the past several years, reflecting an incremental nature of budgeting
focused more on inputs rather than expected outcomes. Further, the alignment of the
budget with the activities identified inthe PRS was generally weak. The introduction of
the MTEF as suggested in the PEMFAR and the PFM Inception Report i s expected to
deepen these links and strengthen the implementation of priority programs. The PRSC
supports continued reforms inthis area.

61.      Preliminary findings from the CPAR note some achievements in regulatory and
institutional framework, including the adoption of the Public Procurement Regulations
2007, establishment of a Procurement Policy and Advisory Division and capacity



                                             20

buildingactivities beingundertaken. It also identifies the need for further reforms inthe
areas of legislative and regulatory framework, institutional framework, and management
capacity, procurement operations and market practices, and transparency and integrity of
the procurement system.

62.     Reform program identified in the decentralization and community empowerment
component has benefited from the analytical work carried out during the preparation of
the Local Governance, Decentralization and Demand Driven Service Delivery Report
(2007).    As part of this work, five reports were prepared: (i)The Status of
Decentralization, summarizing the status of implementation of decentralization in
Lesotho since April 2005; (ii)  Community Profiling Study that was carried out to gain in
depth understanding of key socio-political and institutional issues facing community
development inthe context of decentralization. A particular objective of this study was to
assess the status of community empowerment within the new institutional context; (iii)
Review of the (decentralization) Legal and Regulatory Framework, with a more specific
focus on gaps, overlaps, and conflicts among national, local, and sectoral legislation; (iv)
Study on Fiscal Grants and Revenue Raising Capacity of Local Governments. This study
i s in support of Lesotho's fiscal strategy and building its larger InterGovernmental Fiscal
Architecture (FA); and (v) Promoting the Scaling up of Promising Agriculture and
Natural Resource Management Experiences, proposing options and approaches to
promote effective and responsive rural service delivery within the framework of
decentralization.

63.      The analytical work will support the implementation of the Government's PRGS
and preparation of the program under the PRSC series. It aims to develop consensus on
the next steps with decentralization and community empowerment and provide guidance
on the development of the interGovernmenta1 fiscal system, and the accountability
mechanism for the use of funds by local Government and communities. The report
provides an initial assessmentof service delivery.

64.      The Country Integrated Poverty, Social and Gender Assessment is currently
ongoing.     Its objective i s to improve the diagnosis of the nature, causes, and
consequences of poverty and gender inequality and to understand the influence of the
country social and institutional context on poverty and exclusion using an integrated,
multi-disciplinary approach. The specific purpose i s to inform the Government in the
implementation and revision of its PRGS and more broadly to support the development
of pro-poor, shared growth policies supported by the PRSC.


                    D. THEPROPOSEDGRANTANDCREDIT (PRSC-1)

65.      The proposed PRSC-1 i s the first in the three year PRSC program and aims at
supporting actions already undertaken by the Government in all the components of the
program. The subsequent paragraphs in this section present background to the policy
reforms including challenges, measures already undertaken, and policy reforms being
envisaged, and their likely impact. Some of the measures already undertaken have been
identified as prior-actions for PRSC-1 while some of the measures being planned for the



                                              21

future constitute triggers for subsequent operations. A summary of prior actions and
triggers for subsequent operations are presented inTable 3.

Component1:Creatinga ConduciveEnvironmentfor PrivateSector LedGrowth

66.     The PRGS emphasizes that the private sector is the engine of growth.
Government plans to create an environment conducive to export-oriented foreign and
local investment. Given the small size of the domestic market, the Government strategy
i s mindful of the need to integrate trade issues in its growth and poverty reduction
programs. The goal i s to lower the cost of trading with South Africa, other SACU
countries and the rest of the world by removing barriers to trade and movement of capital
and labor within SACU and to establish a competitlve business environment through the
removal of administrative barriers, improving skills, improving access to finance and
providing supporting infrastructure.

Macroeconomic Stability

67.     A stable macroeconomic environment is necessary for sustained economic
growth. Lesotho's membershipinthe C M A allows it little oversight on matters regarding
monetary policy. Therefore, the Government's main instrument in sustaining a healthy
macroeconomic environment is its fiscal policy. As mentioned earlier, the GOL has done
a good job in creating a healthy fiscal balance. However, Lesotho faces a significant
medium-term risk with respect to the evolution of SACU revenues and so a continued use
of prudent fiscal policies to maintain macroeconomic stability i s               necessary.
Macroeconomic stability i s a condition for each year of program implementation.

Improving the BusinessEnvironment

68.     As pointed out earlier (paragraph 58), the ICA and Doing Business Surveys have
highlighted the various constraints to private sector development, one of which is
improving the business and regulatory environment for the private sector. Cumbersome,
lengthy and costly company registration and licensing regimes create significant
obstacles to firms' entry into the market. These are compounded by impediments to
firms' day-to-day operations, e.g. obtaining visas, work and residence permits as well as
import permits take a very long time. According to the Doing Business (2008), it takes
28 days to register a business and 73 days to start a business in Lesotho. Its rank in
overall doing business i s 124for starting abusiness and 146 for dealing with licenses.

69.     As mentioned under the Government's Program (paragraph 27), a "One Stop
Shop" has beenestablished. While this i s a welcome step inthe right direction, the TIFC
cannot be fully effective until the legacy systems that it i s implementing have been
streamlined and simplified. There are a number of significant outstanding issues to be
addressed before it can play an effective facilitation role such as a well articulated
institutional strategy (Le., agency vision and clarity on roles and responsibilities of the
TIFC), staffing policy (including staff incentives and issues of pay parity), empowering
the agency to provide approvals (rather than being a mailbox). The key next step for the



                                            22

TIFC is to develop a business plan clarifying the functions and powers of the
organization and the related HR policy along with job description and incentive
structures. It needs to embark in this process by actively involving the various
Government agenciedministries, beyond the Ministry of Trade, Industry, Cooperatives
and Marketing. This effort requires strong inter-ministerial buy-in and support, and the
PRSC will actively follow up on this matter.         The regulatory reform and business
environment reform workshop being planned in May 2008 would be a useful forum to
start the discussion on these issues.

70.      There is also a need for revision of the Companies Act and the Licensing
legislation. The objective of the company registration reform i s to consolidate business
registration processes to enable Company Registry to improve its effectiveness. Business
licensing reform is aimed at streamlining industrial and trading licensing regimes to
reduce the time and cost of obtaining licenses and limit licensing to essential regulatory
requirements. Drafting of the legislation is ongoing and the current initiative of the GOL
presents an excellent opportunity to create an enduring Companies law that is also
consistent with modern regulatory practices recommended by the annual Doing Business
Survey of the World Bank Group.

71.     PRSC-1 recognizes the establishment of the One Stop Shop (also known as the
TIFC) as a prior action and the extension of One Stop Shop services to include rebate
certificates, residence and work permits, and industrial licenses as triggers for PRSC-2.
Incorporation of Companies' registration to the One Stop Shop is a trigger for PRSC-3.
These reforms are expected to reduce the time taken to register a business from 28 days
to one day; reduce the time taken to issue export and import permits from 7 days to one
day, and consolidate many procedures at the TIFC, including incorporationof Companies
Registration and introduction of streamlined licensing procedures. However, mere
revisionto the Companies Act and the Licensing legislation will have a limited impact on
the business environment. The PSRC recognizes that these are small steps in the right
direction; but in order to achieve Lesotho's key development objective of creating
economic opportunities for the Basotho population, it needs to embark on a broader
businessenvironment reform strategy.

PRSC -1Prior Action: Establishment of the "One Stop Shop" - Trade and Investment
FacilitationCenter.

72.      Addressing the infrastructure constraint inparallel is critical to facilitate the entry
of new investment - foreign and domestic. Several international investors are currently
waiting for availability of factory space to invest in garment and non-garment
manufacturing. This expansion has the potential of employing over 4,000 people. The
seriousness of the Government is reflected inthe systematic approach adopted (with the
support of DflD) to identify and appropriately prepare for the development of industrial
infrastructure. Identification of industrial infrastructure sites and development of new
factory space are identified as triggers for PRSC-2 and PRSC-3 respectively.




                                              23

73.    The PRSC series will support strengthening of the statistical systems to ensure
that frequency and quality of data improves to such levels that they can provide
meaningful information to policy makers. The Government has made progress in setting
up the National Monitoring and Evaluation System. The Bureau of Statistics has also
taken important steps towards the development of a National Strategy for the
Development of Statistics (NSDS) based on the Paris 21 Principles. It has completed the
Inception report on the design on NSDS, conducted stakeholder consultations and
completed situation analysis in key line ministries. This is recognized as a prior action
for PRSC-1. Finalization of NSDS i s a trigger for PRSC-2. Implementation of the
NSDS Action Plani s a trigger for PRSC-3.

PRSC -1 Prior Action: Initiate the preparation of a National Strategy for the
Development of Statistics (NSDS) based on Paris 21 Principles.

Component 2: ImprovingPublicExpenditureManagementandthe Fiduciary
Framework

74.         Government is a key player inthe economy, with public expenditures accounting
for over 50 percent o f GDP. Weaknesses in the management of these resources have
resulted in less than favorable outcomes in terms of reducing poverty and fostering
growth. In order to increase the impact of these expenditures, the Government has
embarked upon a comprehensive reform program (paragraph 33).                                   The PRSC will
support the Government's reform inall aspects of the budget cycle.

75.         Comparing current PFM performance indicators of Lesotho with that of a few
countries in the region also engaged in similar reforms, Lesotho lags with regard to

76.     Lesotho needs further improvement in budget classification,           its recently
introduced MTEF, legislative scrutiny of the budget, and donor practices. Since the
assessment was done, progress has been made in a number of areas which have been
identified above in section V, including deepening of the MTEF, drafting of the Public
Financial Management and Accountability Bill, contracting out the procurement of an
Integrated Financial Management and Information System (IFMIS) and preparation of a
comprehensive action plan for its implementation, and adoption of new procurement
regulations. The PRSC will support continued implementation of reforms under the
Government's PSLRP.

Phnning and Budgeting

77.      Lesotho has an orderly and participative budget process, involving spending
agencies andthe political leadership inaccordance with a pre-determined budgetcalendar
that i s broadly adhered to. Cabinet discussion of the budget has been enhanced by the
establishment of a Cabinet Budget Committee, chaired by the DeputyPrime Minister and
comprising the Minister of Finance and eight other ministers. The budget i s normally
approved by the Legislature ina timely manner.

78.      However, the alignment of the budget with the activities identified in the PRS is
generally weak. Only about half of the activities identified inthe PRS are included inthe
budget, providing for less than half of the estimated incremental costs of planned Year 1
PRS activities. Inthe same vein, just about one half o f all sub-programs in the recurrent
budget (amounting to about 34 percent of the total value of recurrent sub-program level
allocations) were deemed to be directly poverty-related. As the PRS evolves with greater
focus on key priorities, it i s essential to strengthen the link between budget allocations
and the key priorities identified inthe PRS. Without strengtheningthese links which will
lead to some re-prioritization of expenditures, the PRS will not be successfully
implemented.

79.      To deepen these links and to strengthen implementation of the priority programs,
Government has initiated a phased introduction of a MTEF, starting with the 2005/06
budget. A Planning and Budgeting Task Force now focuses on integrating planning and
budgeting processes through a MTEF. Steady progress continues to be made in this
regard. Nevertheless, significant capacity constraints in some of the line ministries and
unrealistic expectations have limited the achievements on the MTEF. The budget format
has remained unchanged so far and budget estimates are provided for one year only and
there i s no integration of recurrent and development budget.

80.      As an integral part of MTEF development, a medium term fiscal framework has
been prepared. This includes 3-year macroeconomic, revenue, expenditure and debt
projections at an aggregate level. Three year expenditure ceilings have been given at the
ministrylevel. Inadditionto all ministriespreparingthree year budgetestimates, six pilot
ministries have deepened the process through developing detailed Budget Framework
Papers as an input into setting of the Ministry ceilings. The six pilot ministries are the

following: (i)Agriculture and Food Security; (ii)Health and Social Welfare; (iii)
Education and Training; (iv) Employment and Labor; (v) Tourism, Environment and
Culture; and (vi) Gender, Youth, Sports and Recreation. Together they account for about
a third of the total budget. Progress made by the Planningand BudgetingTask Force on
integrating planning and budgeting processes through a MTEF i s recognized as prior
action for PRSC-1. Development of budget framework papers by all ministries for
2009/10 - 2011/12 has been agreed as a trigger for PRSC-2 and the publication o f MTEF
documentation for 2009/10 to 2011/12has been agreed as a trigger for PRSC-3.

PRSC -1Prior Action: Medium term macroeconomic and fiscal framework prepared
for the central Government budgetand MTEFpiloted insix line ministries.

Financial Reporting

81.     Lesotho's fiduciary framework and public expenditure management are severely
hampered by weaknesses in its financial reporting. Reliable and timely in-year and
annual information to monitor budget execution is not available. Because o f weaknesses
of the Government of Lesotho Financial Information System (GOLFIS) there is heavy
reliance on manual accounting procedures, renderingthe accounting system and financial
reporting susceptible to inaccuracies and delays. Further, the lack of adequate numbers of
trained accounting staff has been a major contributing factor. This has preventeddrafting
and submission for audit of financial statements for the five years 1996/97 to 2000/01,
which in turn resulted in incomplete information on opening balances in financial
statements for subsequent years and qualified audit reports. The issue of opening
balances and the timely preparation and audit of public accounts should be addressed as
matter of urgency.

82.     An Accounting and Reporting Task Force aims to develop effective budget
execution and reporting systems through amongst other things: (i)       replacement of the
existing Government of Lesotho Financial Information System (referred to as GOLFIS)
by a new IFMIS, scheduled to become operational in the six MTEF pilot ministries
towards the end o f 2008; (ii)resolving the issue o f incomplete balances information, due
to the absence of financial statements for the five years 1996/97 to 2000/01; (iii)
increasing training inaccounting, IFMIS and internal control issues, including raising the
competence of financial controllers and the awareness of chief accounting officers; (iv)
establishing a new treasury organization within MFDP to undertake the new accounting
and cash management processes proposed under the IFMIS; (v) developing the internal
audit system into a hybrid arrangement under which internal auditors will report to the
top management of the ministry in which they are located, as well as to MFDP; and (vi)
reforms to the public procurement system based on standardized procurement
documentation and streamlining procurement systems.          The adoption of an IFMIS
implementation plan by MFDP is a prior action for PRSC-1. The submission of public
accounts for the years 2004/05, 200906 and 2006/07 to the Auditor General i s a PRSC-2
trigger.

PRSC -1Prior Action: MFDP adopted an IFMIS implementation plan incorporating
issues relating to PFM, ICT, change management, project and contract management and
humanresource management.


CashFlow Management

83.     Currently, there i s no formal system of cash forecasting and management. The
Central Bank acts as the Government's Banker and provides several bank accounts to the
GOL, but because of lack of Central Bank infrastructure outside of Maseru, the GOL also
utilizes a number of commercial bank accounts to effect transactions. Fullinformation on
the number and purpose of all GOL accounts i s not available. As a result, there are
significant deficiencies inthe management of Government cash flows and bank accounts
-weakfinancialcontrols, lack ofreconciliations, delays indepositingrevenues intothe
core GOL bank accounts at the Central Bank, and idle balances. Effective cash
management is further hampered by incomplete vote books, negatively impacting the
control over commitments for expenditure and information on cash flow requirements.
Previous recommendations in this regard, including the establishment of a central cash
management unit to manage Government cash flows efficiently, have not yet been
realized. The IFMIS project provides a unique opportunity for the GOL to address these
problems by rationalizing the bank account configuration and to establish a more
effective commitment control system insupport of expenditure and cash management.

84.     Phased roll-out o f the IFMIS starting with the six pilot ministries is a trigger for
PRSC-3.

External Audit and Oversight

85.     While public sector auditing in Lesotho is carried out in accordance with
international standards, it i s hampered by delays inaccount preparation, lack of financial
resources and skilled staff. A new Audit Act to strengthen the independence of the Office
of the Auditor General i s awaiting submission to Cabinet and Parliament. At the same
time the capacity of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) i s weak and needs to be
strengthenedto review reports issuedby the Auditor General and ensure adequate follow-
up of its reports by the Executive. The PAC should also consider having its meetings
open to the public on a regular basis to foster greater transparency andaccountability.

86.     The audit of public accounts for the financial years 2004/05 and 2005/06 by the
Office of the Auditor General has been agreed as a trigger for PRSC-2, with the audit of
public accounts for the financial year 2006/07 by the Office of the Auditor General being
agreed as a trigger for PRSC-3.

Public Procurement

 87.    With the adoption of the Public Procurement Regulations 2007 (PPR), Lesotho
has made significant progress in reforming and modernizing its public procurement



                                             30

system. The fundamental principles o f the PPR are sound and go a long way to ensuring
consistency with international practices and procedures. The new Regulation i s based on
a decentralized system in order to foster transparency and accountability. To that effect,
Ministries and District Councils are in charge of their own procurement management
through their Procurement Units while the former Central Tender Board has been
disbanded. The procurement process within each Ministry and District Council i s based
on distinct evaluation and award phases by an Evaluation Team and a designated Tender
Panelineach institution.

88.     A Procurement Policy and Advisory Division (PPAD), to support, monitor, and
enforce compliance at the ministries and districts has been established. According to the
Regulations, PPAD actually covers the major functions of developing relevant
legislation, providing means of controlling and enforcing compliance through audits,
channeling information relating to all procurement activities, managing the training
efforts, and providing an independent appeal mechanism. Other roles include guidance
and advice to procurement units as well as compiling an inventory of public assets.

89.     Training programs have been initiated under the auspices of the Chartered
Institute of Purchasing and Supply. On-going training sessions are addressed to Ministry
and District procurement staff and trainers themselves. A system of procurement
qualifications has been set up to conclude these training sessions.

90.     The CPAR identifies several areas where further clarity and reforms are needed.
Issues related to the legislative and regulatory framework, and the institutional
framework and management capacity are supported under the PRSC, while flexibility
will be retained to include other reform areas identified inthe second or third year o f the
Program.

91.     Legislativeand Regulatory Framework. The coverage provisions of PPR (entity
and contract) are unclear, particularly as they relate to the sub-central level and to state-
owned enterprises. They also appear to be in conflict with legislation applying to sub-
central authorities.   These potential inconsistencies need to be reconciled to avoid
potential parallel application of more than one set of rules. In terms of the procedures
themselves, there is a lack of clarity as to their use. Thus, while the open competitive
biddingprocedure seems to be treated as the default method, this is not explicit and some
provisions appear to say the contrary. It should be clearly stated that open competitive
biddingis the default method. The provisions relating to the constitution of the Appeals
Panel are currently insufficient to establish their independence and the procedures for
such appeal, inthe form of an operational manual or rules of procedure, are lacking. Its
creation is also underminedby the additional (non-independent) appeal which is available
to the PPAD whose current structure and staffing levels are not up to the task. Standard
biddingand contract documents need to be prepared to allow successful implementation
of the Regulations.

92.      Institutional Framework and Management Capacity. There is a lack of
integrationbetween procurement management, andbudgeting and financial management.



                                             31

The lack o f planning for procurement makes cash flow management unpredictable and
undermines the cost implications associated with the institutional changes caused by the
decentralization and procurement management reform. While the adoption o f IFMIS i s
expected to improve the links between budgetingand procurement planning, procurement
management implemented by the District Councils and the District Administrators needs
to be resolved. The organizational structure o f the PPAD established within the MFDP
needs to be aligned with the Procurement Manual.

93.     The PRSC supports the reforms identified in the CPAR and adopted by
Government.       These will further build confidence in using national systems for
procurement by donors under their various programs (not just budget support programs).
The adoption o f the Procurement Regulations i s recognized as a prior action for PRSC-1.
Incorporation o f suggested revisions to the Regulations i s a trigger for PRSC-2 and the
trigger for PRSC -3 will be refined when the action plan proposed under the CPAR has
been agreed and adopted by Government.

PRSC -1 Prior Action: Adoption o f the Public Procurement Regulations, 2007 by
Cabinet.

Component3: Improvingaccess andqualityof basic services

94.     Despite high public expenditures, particularly in the social sectors, getting
services to the general population, much less to the poor, remains a challenge. The
quality and efficiency o f service delivery, and the targeting o f services to the most
vulnerable sections o f society remains a significant concern. For example, in 2007,
outpatient visits per capita was low at around 0.4-0.5, below the target o f 0.7, and
certainly one o f the lowest rates in the world. The national average o f bed occupancy
rate in the same year i s only 38 percent, below the 80-85 percent target. While Lesotho
may achieve the MDG for primary school completion, the low enrollment rate inthe poor
mountain areas remains a challenge.

95.     In the health sector, the reform program, which commenced in 2000 with the
assistance from the Bank and other development partners, entered its eighth year in2008.
Since its start, the SWAP has been hndamental to harmonize efforts in order to achieve
the objectives o f the reforms. Progress has been made in achieving high immunization
rates, revitalizing the national Tuberculosis program, and improving access to HIV
testing, prevention and treatment. During the period, the MOHSW was committed to
addressing the well established human resource problem-an           emergency plan was
developed and more positions were filled and foreign nurses were recruited. Inaddition,
the organizational structure o f the MOHSW was reviewed inorder to improve efficiency.
The decentralization process o f health services has been slow but is gradually taking
shape-most     o f the DHMTs have about 60 percent o f core staff and are able to develop
their operational plans.

96.     Despite the above achievements, concerns exist under the health sector reform.
Lesotho i s off track to reach the health MDGs-with continuing high maternal mortality



                                            32

rate, high child mortality rate that i s being fueled by an increasing number o f orphans,
and the third highest adult HN prevalence in the world and, as a consequence, an
increasing tuberculosis prevalence. The human resource crisis persists at all levels; it
hampers the implementation o f the health sector reform program and severely weakens
service delivery. The unresolved issues around health service decentralization also
continue to cause problems in service delivery at the district level. Because o f these
factors, while the budget for health significantly increased in the last several years, the
expenditure level remains low.

97.      The PRSC supports GOL programs focused on key health and related
interventions that are doable within the three-year time-frame: (a) improvement in child
nutrition through greater food security at the household level to avert the adverse
consequences o f the drought and increasing level o f food deprivation o f orphans; (b)
sustaining disease prevention through immunization mainly by making vaccine financing
more predictable and sustainable; (c) improvement in case-finding and treatment o f
tuberculosis through the implementation o f the new national program on TB control; (d)
widening the ARV treatment and prevention program through more intensive
implementation o f the national HN/AIDS strategic plan, greater mobilization of donor
support and NGO involvement, and a more intensive local response; and (e) broadening
the support to orphans and vulnerable children through wide-scale registration of
beneficiaries and provision o f an essential package o f support to them, as delineated in
the National OVC Strategic plan. While the development ofthe National OVC Strategic
plan i s a prior action for PRSC-1, the completion o f nationwide registration o f OVCs i s a
trigger for PRSC-2. Needless to say, all o f these interventions hinge critically on more
intensiverecruitment o fhealthworkers to be deployed inunder-staffed districtdfacilities,
and stronger capacity building, staffing, and equipping o f district health offices to enable
themto manage healthinterventionsintheir localities.

imdementtheNational Strategic Plan for HIV/AIDS for 2006-2011.

98.      The success o f FPE policy is exerting pressure on the current physical capacity
for transition from primary to secondary school. In2007 a record 37,000 students passed
the primary school leaving examination. O f the current 48,000 Primary School Leaving
Examination candidates, 16,948 (35 percent) are orphans. This puts a lot o f pressure on
the systemto meet the fees and other support for these children. Further, 40 percent of
secondary school teachers are unqualified (2006) and this threatens planned quality
improvements. The teacher shortage i s more acute for science and mathematics, and less
than 10 percent of the teacher inthe Teacher training college anduniversity are training
inthese subjects. The PRSC supports animprovement inthe quality o fprimary education
with a progressive increase in the cohort survival rate (paragraph 38) and access to
secondary education over the PRSC series. Extension o f existing infrastructure to
accommodate additional entrants at the secondary school level has led to in a ten percent

 increase insecondary school enrollment. This i s recognized as a prior action for PRSC-1,
 Preparation and implementation o f a three year costed planfor the education sector aimed
 at increasing access to secondary schools are triggers for PRSC-2 and PRSC-3,

 Capacity Buildingfor Local Government Administration

 99.     After less than two years following the local Government elections and
 establishment o f Community Councils (CC) and District Councils (DC), the Councils
 have gotten deeply involved in natural resource management, allocation of land, range
 management, collection o f grazing fees and fines, development o f infrastructure (where
 they have resources), and HIV/AIDS related issues. However, Councils are by and large
 unable to deliver on the priorities o f communities because o f a lack of resources,
 capacity, and quite importantly the lack o f clarity with regard to the roles and
 responsibilities o f different levels o f Government. The experience so far indicates that
 the process could have greatly benefited from a clear and detailed implementation
 strategy and road map to ensure gradual and progressive decentralization to make sure
 that resources are matched with existing capacity.

 100.     A key issue hamperingthe process is the need for a clearer definition o froles and
 responsibilities, as well as relationships and accountability mechanisms among the main
 entities.   At district level, roles, responsibility and authority between the various
 institutions are poorly defined. The District Administrator (DA) i s head of central
 Government and District Council Secretary (DCS) i s the head o f local Government but
 their functional relationship is vague, andthis is a hindrance to efficient management. In
 addition, departmental teams have been divided between the DA and DCS and
 operational efficiency i s highly compromised. This i s exacerbated by the fact that there
 i s no clarity regarding the assignment o f staff to the DCS and local authorities. Local
 Government Service Commission was established under the Local Government Act,
 1997. The enactment o f the Local Government Service Act 2008 to support appointment
 and transfer of local government staff. The PRSC-1 recognizes this as aprior action. The
 development o f a National Strategic Plan for Decentralization and issuance o f a detailed
 description o f roles, relationships and responsibilities o f the various local Government
 entities are identified as triggers for PRSC-2. This component o f the PRSC will be
 developed hrther based on progress made by the Government by the time o f the first
 joint review inAugust 2008.

     Box 2: The Proposed PRSC and Good PracticePrincipleson Conditionality

Principle1: ReinforceOwnership
The proposed PRSC supports implementation o f Lesotho's PRS adopted by the
fovernment in2006 after extensive consultations with a broad spectrum o f stakeholders.
fovernment i s updating the PRS based on the lessons learnt from its implementation
zxperience and the development o f a home grown growth strategy. It requested joint
jonor budget support for implementation o f its PRGS and has prepared a PAF, which
provides a basis for monitoring the program o f overall budget support. The PAF consists
3 f a number o f relevant, monitorable, time-bound,   andrealistic targets related to priority
policy objectives. Prior actions and triggers to be supported by the PRSC have been
selected from the PAF.

Principle2: Agree up front with the Governmentand other financialpartnerson a
coordinatedaccountabilityframework
An M O U between the Government and the JBS Donor Group has been drafted. All
missions have been heldjointly and joint aide memoires have been prepared and agreed
with the Government. The broad principles o f budget support were agreed in May 2006
and are identified inthe May 2006 Joint Budget Support Aide Memoire. Reviews will be
carried out jointly inAugust/September each year, to fit inwith the Government's budget
preparation timeline. Disbursements o f budgetary support will be based on a positive
outcome o fthis review.

Principle3: Customizethe accountabilityframework and modalitiesof Bank
supportto country circumstances
The joint budget support review will be aligned to the country's budget cycle andwill be
held in August/September each year. Disbursements are expected to be made for the
following budget year starting inApril.

Principle4: Choose only actions criticalfor achievingresults as conditions for
disbursement
One o f the principles o f the joint budget support is that the PAF should consist o f a few
monitorable and realistic indicators. The triggers and actions for the proposed PRSC
represent only those actions that will be critical for achieving the program's project
development objectives and the various outcomes.

Principle5: Conducttransparentprogressreviews conducive to predictableand
performance-basedfinancial support
Inorder to improve predictability o fbudgetary support from donors, the JBS framework
requires donors to indicate levels o f budgetary support that they are planning to disburse
well inadvance o fthe start o fthe fiscal year, such that the amounts can be included inthe
Budgetsubmitted to Parliament, Once the mainannual PAFreview inAugust/September
has been concluded, all the JBS donors in Lesotho will indicate to the Government how
much they're planningto disburse inthe following fiscal year. The Government will use
this information duringthe budget preparation process.

                VI. OPERATIONIMPLEMENTATION

                              A.     POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACT

101.     The poverty and social impacts o f the reforms supported by the operation are
expected to be favorable overall. The benefits are expected from direct job creation in
the private sector and improvement in service delivery, particularly to the poor in rural
areas. The operation supports reforms that will create more wage jobs in the private
sector. Given that farming alone cannot provide sustainable livelihoods in the rural
sector and as confirmed by recent analysis o f the household survey data, an increasing
number of households are relying on more than one source o f income inthe rural areas.
Jobs in the non-fanning sector, in particular in manufacturing and petty trading are
becoming an important source o f income. Improved business environment and better
industrial infrastructureare expected to boost the private sector andcreatejobs.

102.     The creation o f new sites providing ARV treatment i s expected to increase the
coverage o f ART to affected people. Most o f the beneficiaries are expected to be under-
privileged who will be able to lead a better life with the availability o f treatment. The
increase inthe program o f support to the OVCs is expected to lead to an overall reduction
inthe social burdenassociated with caring for the OVCs. Increasingaccessto secondary
schools for the large cohort o fprimary school leavers (as a result o f the completion o f the
free primary school cycle) will provide better income earning opportunities to these
students when they enter the labor market.

103.     Many other measures envisaged in the program have an indirect poverty and
social impact through creating the conditions for improved governance and provision o f
public services -public finance management, and decentralization.


                  B.    IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORINGEVALUATION       AND

104.     The institutional arrangements for the implementation o f the operation fall within
the framework of the JBS. The proposed arrangements seek to ensure oversight and buy
in at the political level. A dedicated team of officials from Department of Development
Planning in the MFDP and the Bureau o f Statistics will monitor progress in
implementation o f the overall budget support program. This team acts as the Secretariat
for JBS implementation and monitoring. At the Ministerial level, dedicated teams o f
relevant officials responsible for implementation and monitoring o f activities16 will
monitor implementation o f PAF activities and collect data to verify achievement o f PAF
indicators and report to the Secretariat. The JBS Secretariat i s headed by Department o f
Development Planning and will report, on a quarterly basis, to the Improvement and
Reform Steering Committee (IRSC). Representatives o f the DPs are members o f the
IRSC, ensuring that they are also aware o f the progress being made inimplementation in
between the annual joint reviews. The Chairperson o f the IRSC will, in turn, report,
through Minister, MFDP, to the Budget Committee. The PAF progress report will be


       ~




 l6These teams are fiom within the ministries responsible for implementation o f the PAF activities


                                                   36

submitted by the Principal Secretary, MFDPto the Committee o f Principal Secretaries as
they are responsible for delivering on these indicators. This will be the forum for initial
discussions towards the required remedial actions where problems exist. The Principal
Secretary, MFDP, will also pursue these discussions bilaterally with affected
MinistriedAgencies for implementation o fthe required actions. Briefings to development
partners envisaging budget support will be provided at regular intervals.

105.   The PAF will be the basis for monitoring and evaluation of the program. An
annual progress report submittedby end-August o f each year will be followed by a joint
annual review o f progress, based on the PAF, to analyze progress towards agreed triggers
and targets. The main objective o f this review i s to come to ajoint view on performance,
which will serve as the basis for commitments for the following financial year.

                                   C.   FIDUCIARY     ASPECTS

Public Financial Management System

106.    Lesotho's fiduciary framework is adequate overall to receive the proceeds o f the
Credit, particularly in light o f the adoption o f a comprehensive PFM reform program and
the implementation progress made.         Implementation o f the PFM reform program i s
currently being supported by DfD, EU, and Ireland. The support will be deepened under
the auspices o fthe JBS.

107.    A PEFA Framework Assessment was conducted in 2006/0717. The assessment
found that Lesotho scored well in 7 areas (scored above C). These areas include
credibility and comprehensiveness o f the budget, orderliness and participation in the
budgetprocess, the introduction o f a MTEF andpredictability inthe availability o f h d s
for commitment o f expenditures. Inthe remaining 17 areas assessed, Lesotho scored C in
six areas. The major areas o f weakness are in the management o f expenditure arrears,
oversight o f aggregate fiscal risk from other public sector entities, effectiveness o f
internal control and internal audit, accounting, recording and reporting, external audit,
and donor practices.

108.    Since the assessment was done, progress has been made in a number o f areas,
including deepening of the MTEF, drafting o f the Public Financial Management and
Accountability Bill, launching a project for the design and implementation o f an IFMIS,
preparation o f outstanding public accounts up to 2006/07, auditing o f public accounts
(2004/05 was inprocess at the time of the preparation o f this operation) and adoption o f
new procurement regulations.        The PRSC will support continued implementation o f
reforms under the Government's PSRP.

                                                  AND

109.    Upon effectiveness, expected in June 2008, a single tranche o f SDR 9.7 million
(US$15.9 million equivalent) will be disbursed to the Government o f Lesotho. The
PRSC-1 will follow the Bank's disbursement procedures for Development Policy
Lending. Inparticular, the untiedbalance of paymentshudget support will be disbursed
against satisfactory implementation o f the development policy program and not tied to
any specific purchases and no procurement requirements will be needed.

110.    Upon receipt o f withdrawal applications from the Government, IDA will disburse
the Grant and Credit proceeds to a United States Dollar denominated account maintained
by the Central Bank o f Lesotho (CBL) and forming part o f the official foreign exchange
reserves o f Lesotho. Within two business days, the CBL will credit the loti equivalent o f
the Grant and Credit proceeds to the consolidated account maintained on behalf o f the
Government o f Lesotho for budget execution. The Accountant General will be notified
accordingly. The CBL will not impose any charges or commissions on the Government
for these transactions. The conversion from United States Dollars to loti will be based on
the prevailing exchange rate on the date that the finds are credited to the consolidated
account. The Government, through the MFDP will - (i)      provide a written confirmation to
the Bank within 30 days, that an amount equivalent to the Grant and Credit proceeds
from the Bank has been credited to the consolidated account, with an indication o f the
exchange rate applied; (ii)   provide evidence that the loti equivalent o f the Grant and
Credit proceeds was recorded as financing for Government budget; and (c) ensure that
the loti equivalent o f the Grant and Credit proceeds is subject to controls to ensure its use
for eligible budgeted public expenditures only. The administration o f this Grant and
Credit shall be the responsibilityo f MFDP.

111.    Auditing: The budgeted public expenditure partially financed by the loti
equivalent o f the Grant and Credit proceeds i s subject to external audit by the Auditor-
general under the normal auditing arrangements applicable to the Government. The
Association will have access to these audit reports.


                              E. ENVIRONMENTAL         ASPECTS

112.    The program is not expected to have any direct significant environmental
consequences. Improvements in the business climate are likely, however, to lead to
increased business activity, some o f which may have potentially negative impacts on the
environment, such as those involved in industrial production. In addition, the proposed
trade facilitation measures are intended to contribute to job creation in export sectors, in
particular the textile industry, posing additional challenges for the management of
industrial pollution.    Adequate capacity for handling and expediting the clearance
processes, and monitoring and enforcement to deal with potential adverse pollution
arising from increased investment activities i s lacking currently and needs to be
strengthened.




                                             38

113.    Inthis regard, it will be important for the Government to continue to strengthen
the legal and institutional framework for environmental impact assessment, monitoring
and enforcement.      The Environment Act 2001 has a number o f sections specifically
pertaining to Environmental Assessment (EA), and requires submission o f EAs to the
Authority, currently the National Environment Secretariat (NES). An Environment Bill
(2007) i s under consideration, and would establish a National Environment Council and
Department o f Environment, with Assistant Environment Officers appointed at the
District level.

114.    Separately, the reforms associated with the decentralization process aim, inter
alia, to assist local Governments and stakeholders to contribute to local development
through improved natural resource management. In order to strengthen the analytical
foundations for the continued buildingo f environmentalmanagement capacity at both the
national and local levels, it i s proposed that the Bank prepare in close collaboration with
the NES a Country Environmental Analysis focusing on these issues, the
recommendations o fwhich may be incorporated into the planned PRSC 2 and 3.


                                  F. RISKSANDMITIGATION

115.   The operation faces manyo fthe risks identifiedinthe CAS, and are as follows:

       (i)     Administrative capacity and coordination: Lesotho's relatively limited
               Government administrative capacity and coordination among relevant
               central and local agencies could lead to delays in the implementation o f
               key reform measures, particularly relating to decentralization. To mitigate
               this potential coordination failure, implementation arrangements for the
               PRSC seek to ensure oversight and buy in at the political level. Capacity
               building initiatives underway with support from other Development
               Partners will also mitigate this risk;

       (ii)    External risks: These include a possible deterioration o f the external
               environment, in particular, uncertainty regarding the evolution o f SACU
               transfers, oil and food price shocks, garment exports, and remittances from
               Basotho workers in South African mines. Mitigating these risks depends
               on Lesotho's capacity to adjust to the shocks and the Government's ability
               to manage the impact o f the shocks. The ongoing export diversification
               efforts and further strengthening o f public finance management under the
               PRSC will help mitigate these risks.         Predictable and timely budget
               support through the PRSC series and from other development partners will
               also help mitigate the external risks;

       (iii)   Political risks: There i s a potential risk that current political tension may
               exacerbate and negatively impact the investment climate. Facilitation o f
               the post-election dialogue between the Government and the opposition
               parties by the SADC Organ on Politics holds the promise o f mitigating
               this risk.

Dear Ms. Ezekwesili,


   Letter of DevelopmentPolicy for the PovertyReduction
                Support Grant and Credit (PRSC-I)

1. Iam writing on behalf of the Goverriment of Lesotho to request
approval of the first Poverty ReductionSupport Credit and Grant (PRSC-
I)intheamountofSDR9.7million(ofwhichSDR5.3millionisacredit
and the balance a grant) from the International Development
Association (IDA).

2.    This request is made within the context of the Memorandum of
Understanding (MoU) between the Government of Lesotho and
international cooperating partners towards General Budget Support
(GBS) amongst which the World Bank is a key member. The PRSC-I
Credit and Grant will assist Lesotho in its continued efforts t o reduce
poverty through increased economic growth and employment, as
reflected on otir Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) launched in 2004.


                                P.FC 1of13

The Strategy timeline ended in March 2007, however given that it was
not fiilly implemented, it remains our headline strategy for achieving
macroeconomic and poverty reduction objectives, Meanwhile, the
Government is preparing an updated strategy titled Poverty Reduction
and Growth Strategy (PRGS), which shall give more focus to shared
growth and take into account the capacity and resource liniitations
experienced with the current plan. The Strategy shall precede a more
comprehensive planning instnlment closely linked to the Vision 2020
and MDGswhich will be adopted in2010.


MacroeconomicPerfomlance

3.     Lesotho achieved a real annual average GDP growth rate of 3.9%
between 1980 and 2006 and the national economy reached M10.1
billion in 2006 (approximately US$1.5 billion at 2006 exchange rate).
The 2006 figures show that performance was driven by seven sectors
which recordedabove-averagegrowth (7%):

0     miningand quarrying (38.9%);
0     financial intermediation (14.5%);
      electricity and water (11.3%);
0     manufacturing (10.5%);
0     transport and communications (9.7%);
0     wholesale and retailtrade (8.9%); and
e     hotels and restaurants (7.5%).

4.     The textile industry bounced back from weak performance in
2005 which had been occasioned principallyby uncertainty on the side
of both producers and buyers regarding the impact of the end of the
Multi Fibre Agreement. Although exports by China, India, Bangladesh,
Vietnam, and Cambodia have squeezed Lesotho's competitive advantage
inthe United States, the pace has beengradual rather than drastic. The
diamond mining sector has continued to expand, resulting in a 14.5%
increase inexports in 2006.

5.     Lesotho is a very open and of course vulnerable econoniy that is
highly sensitive to global developments. The ratio of exports to Gross
National Income has hovered around 37-42% since 2002. Imports

                                 Page2 of13




                                     44

match nearly the gross domestic production figure and are nearly all
supplied from South Africa, a fellow member in the Southern African
Customs Union. The large resulting trade deficit is financed from
migrant remittances and the Southern African Customs Unionreceipts.

6.      O f the sectors that performed below the average1 agriculture and
construction are notable. Diamond mining and textile sectors provide
employment which is important for poverty reduction. However, their
linkages to the domestic economy are limited since most of their value
added in Lesotho is repatriated to outside shareholders. Agriculture i s
important for its strong linkages that affect particularly the poor of our
people. An effective poverty reducing strategy must therefore target
raising the value of agricultural activities. Inthis respect, Iwelcome the
positive steps taken by the World Bank to re-engage in agriculture and
hope for an earliest engagement with Lesotho.

7.     The construction is important for job creation. Itis also significant
as a gateway to the infrastructure development that is so key and
central to Lesotho's investment, trade capacity, and tourism. The
lacklustre performance means that the necessary investments in
transport and energy are not being undertaken. Of course one of the
main reasons is that these are lumpy and very costly investments, given
the Country's mountainous terrain. It has been extremely difficult to
find cheap and large sources of funding.

8.     The net balance of resources on the Capital and FinancialAccount
has declined consistently from an inflow of M1,177.8 million (16.3% of
GDP) in2002 to an outflow of M151.6 million (-1.5%] in2006. Although
foreign direct investment increased from M364 millionin 2005 to M623
million in 2006, commercial banks increased their holdings of foreign
assets by M615 million to take advantage of favourable interest rates.
Lesotho's gross foreign assets have consistently exceeded the
conventional target of 6 months of imports. The 2006 import cover
reached nearly 9 months of imports.

9.     The value of total external public debt was M4.5billion at the end
of 2006 and the ratio of external debt to GDP stood at 44.3% for the

iThese are public administration (3.6%); real estate and business services [3.5%): health (2.9%);
education (2.0%); agriculture (1.7%): community services (1.2%): and construction (0.6%).

same year. Barring a large currency depreciation, the ratio is projected
to decrease to below 35 % beyond 2009. Inflation inLesotho is driven
primarily by prices inSouth Africa, which remains the source of almost
90% of the country's imports for final consumption (even though the
textile industry has imported an increasing volume of intermediate
inputs froni Asia in recent years]. In 2006 the inflation rate reached
6.0% froni 3.4% in2005, driven largelybysteadily risingoil prices.

Government Policiesand DevelopmentOhjectives

10.   The Government's policy objectives continue to be guided by the
Poverty Reduction Strategy [PRS), which was adopted as a national
medium-term planning document in 2004. Inadequate resources from
cooperating partners and inadequate domestic implementation capacity
left many of the strategies only partially implemented. The 2004
document thus reniains the key planning document that guides
government interventions andwill remainso untilupdated.

11. Our observationhas beenthat no country, let alone a small one
with low implementation capacity, can operate several planning
documents, yet achieve focus on its plans. The PRS is an iiistrurnent
focused principally on reduction of poverty and not fully on the full
spectrum of services that Governments must provide. The Lesotho PRS
also fell short in enunciating fiilly the basket of specific strategies to
engender economic growth. It merely assumed that the market would
work its miracle and deliver the necessary investment. Finally, given its
proscribed scope, Government felt the need to draw up its National
Goals and Objectives document to cover the rest of the services
provided by Government, resulting in confusion for both Government
agencies and development partners alike, as regards the reference
policies and planning document.

12.    For these reasons, it is our intentioii to adopt a comprehensive
planning framework that would recognise:

a)    The fact that poverty reduction cannot be achieved within an
      environment of stagnant, lowor declining economic growth;

b)    the fullrange of public services;




                                     46

c)   need for accelerated, shared and sustainable economic growth
     that include measures to achieve poverty reduction objectives as
     outlined by Lesotho citizens and incorporated inthe current PRS;

d)    existing implementation capacity of government and its agencies;

e)   available total      resources      including realistic estimate of
     cooperatingpartner commitments; and

f )   need for full alignment with Lesotho's long-term planning
      document, the Vision 2020 andalso the global MDCs.

13.   Inthis context, Government will adopt in 2010 a new medium-
term pEanninginstniment akin to a national development plan that aim
at achieving the goals of the National Vision 2020. Meanwhile and in
recognition of the fact that sustained poverty reduction cannot happen
in an environment of stagnant growth, government will, during 2008,
produce a Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy that will focus on
shared economic growth and take cognisance of implementation and
resource limitations we faced inimplementation of the current PRS.

14.   As already indicated above, the over-riding objective of
Government is to attain an accelerated, shared and sustainable
economic growth rate of 6 to 7 percent per annum. Other important
objectives and policy goals of the Government for the medium and long
term, as stated inVision 2020 and PRSinclude:

      Scaling iip the fight against HIV andAIDS;

      Creating an environment conducive for increased private sector
      investment, rapid job creationandreduction inunemployment;


0     Developing infrastructure so as to make economic opportunities
      accessible to all segments of the population and to provide the
      basis for rapid industrializationand job creation;


0     Improving the quality of and access to education, skills training
      and healthservices for all Basotho;

                                  Page 5 of13




                                       47

     Enhancing food security by improving agricultural productivity
     and introducing high value cash crops, better farming practices,
     irrigation, water harvesting, afforestation, and realistic marketing
     arrangements;

*    Integrating youth, children and gender issues in all Governnient
     policies and programs;

     Promoting efficiency and effectiveness in the delivery of public
     services through enhanced public financial management, audit of
      Government    operations    and inore use        of public-private
     partnerships; and

      Consolidating democracy, peace and stability by fighting crime,
      promoting safety and security and by enhancing the role of
      Parliament, accountability andtransparency.


15.   Sustained increase in economic growth is a prerequisite for the
reduction of poverty inthe medium term. To achieve this, Government
will continue to maintain a stable macro-economic environment, to
create an enabling environment for private sector development,
including land reform and to provide good infrastructure, including
specific measures to accommodate increases inindustrial investments.

16.   Some progress has been made since the inception of the PRS: in
the employment creation and income generation front, the
Government has continued to work vigorously to attract. investment
from abroad by both improving the business climate at home and
promoting Lesotho in major markets abroad. In terms of the business
climate, a one-stop shop has been established to reduce the number of
procedures required to register and licence companies by the Ministry
of Trade and Industry, Cooperatives and Marketing (MTICM). A new
Companies Bill, that will give legal effect to the proposed investment
climate reforms has been prepared and will be presented to Parliament
during2008.

PRSC-1Prior Action: One Stop Shop established by the Ministry of
Trade and Industry, Cooperatives and Marketing and operational
for facilitation of the issuance of manufacturing and trading
licenses and processing import permits andexport visas.

17.   Import and export procedures have been reduced through
streamliningfrom 44 to 15days, while an application for nianufacturing
licence that took 16 pages to fill has been reduced to 2 and is now fully
automated. Moreover, the Goveriiinent has overhauled its company tax
policy regime, reducing the headline company tax and the rate for
manufacturers and zero-rating tax on income generated from extra-
SACUexportsfor firms withstrongcompliance records.

18.   Furthermore, as a means of promoting industrial development,
the Government intends to develop industrial facilities as a key
intervention.   This will involve upgrading of services to existing
industriallocations and buildingnewindristrialfacilities.

19. To further close the Infrastructure gap, significant achievements
have occurred in the electricity and teleconimunications sectors. The
number of connections serviced by Lesotho Electricity Company (LEC)
nearly doubled in just 5 years from 24,824 in 2001/02 to 48,794 in
2006/07. Even more astounding, the number of people with access to
telephone services nearly doubled in 4 years from 233,714 in 2002 to
411,049 inZOOS. The challenges for the future are to ensure reliable and
competitive supply of services and to strengthen the regulatory
institutionsthat have beenset up inthese sectors.

20.   Although success is evident in both the electricity and
telecommunications sectors, challenges remain with opening up road
coniinunication and recently with electricity generation, as a result of
shortages inthe SoutheniAfrican DevelopmentGoinrntinityPower Pool.
The required resources amount to an extra 40 percent ofthe anticipated
additional costs of implementing the PRS, over and above existing
budget provisions. Lesotho will of necessity look to the international
community for financing these big-ticket itenis.

21.   The achievement of effective policy implementation inthe pursuit
of growth and poverty reduction requires a continuing process of

                                    49

improvement inthe effectiveness of government institutions. A key goal
of Government is to strengthen public financial nianagernent and public
service delivery through improved representation at the local
government level.      New planning and budgeting, accounting and
reporting,    and    procurement     systems    are    presently   under
implementation, while local government authorities have been elected
and their administrations set up and are now beingstrengthened.

22.    Regarding Public Service Delivery under the improvement of
public financial management, the Government embarked on the process
of integrating      planning  and    budgeting to     strengthen   policy
iniplementation. Inthis regard, six ministries were selected to pilot the
MTEF approach and have now undergone two budget cycles. Although
some weakaesses still exist, significant progress has beenregistered.

23.    The MTEFprocess, which was piloted in6 government ministries,
has now been rolled out to all ministries for the current budget year
2008/09. Although the current budget was prepared based on Budget
Framework Papers prepared by ministries-a          key step in the MTEF
process--extensive training is now taking place to plan for further
consolidation of the MTEFinEy2009/2010 and beyond.

 2008 and rolled out to the rest of Government by end of March 2009.
The new system will include in automated fashion a budget and
procurement module and will also be amenable to coniputerised
 auditing. It will compile public accounts in real time and therefore will
 enable timely preparation of annual public accounts and better
transparency and accountability. The implementation of IFMIS comes

  established. Procurement has also undergone major refornis. There is a
  new Procurement Manual and new procurement procedures were
 launched in January2007 and will be strengthened and revised in 2008.
 The Central Tender Board has been abolished and a new body, the
  Procurement Policy and Advisory Division, has been established within
 the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning to oversee a faster,
 transparent,     and   accountable     procurement    process.   Certified
 procurement training has been established in collaboration with
 internationaland localinstitutions.

  26.    In the financial sector, the Government is strengthening bank
 supervision and has taken action against some large pyramid schemes.
  It has also passed anti-money laundering bill which is now under
 implementation. The Central Bank is speeding up the cheque-clearing
 system and is introducing a credit registry to facilitate faster credit
 referencing. The Government has also capped its pension liability for
  civil servants by creatinga defined contribution scheme.

 27.     Following legislation of the Local Government Act,            the
 Government has enacted the Local Government Service Act, which
 provides the legal basis for service delivery at the local government

28.   Despite progress in various areas, many challenges remain.
Poverty continues to be widespread with half of the population still
living below the poverty line. The problem is exacerbated by the HIV
and AIDS pandemic and continuing brain drain in key sectors such as
health and education, which have created significant capacity
challenges. The social sector is confronted with challenges associated
with access, equity, quality, efficiency, and inanagementwhich needto
be addressed to enable the sector to contribute effectively to the overall
povertyreductioneffort.

29.   In2006, the Government undertook the 2006 Census and found
that the population had grown by only 0.6 percent over 10 years, as a
result of the effects of HIVand Aids and migration.To curb the impact of
HIV and AIDS, the Government, through the NationalAIDS Commission,
has launched a nationwide programme to improve access to Anti-Retro
Viral treatment and information, education and communication to
prevent the spread of the pandemic. The Government has latinched a
nationwide programme of Know Your Status ( U S ) for testing every
personinthe country includingall children under 12years of age. Those
who are found free of HIV will be helped to remain so through,
prevention and other programmes. Those who are found to be infected
will be given care and treatment through ARVs and nutrition education
so that they can live longer and contribute to the economy. In this
contest, the Govenment is working with many development partners
including the Global Fund and the World Bank It is also working with
the EuropeanComniissionand UNICEFon orphans.

PRSC-I Prior Action: Annual Operational Plans prepared by the
National AIDS Commission to implement the National Strategic
Planfor HIV/AIDS for 2006-2011, starting with 2007

30.    With respect to education, the Government has since 2000
implementedthe Free Primary Education programme. The intention is
to consolidate the programme and enhance secondary education
facilities to be able to respond to increased demand resulting from
higher numbers of pupils completing the primary level. Initiatives for
training teachers and building and equipping secondary schools with
support from amongst others, China, japan, Ireland, Cyprus, World Bank
andAfrican Development Bank are under implementation.

31.     To be able to effectively monitor implementation of its strategies,
the Government will need to develop an efficient nionitoring and
evaluation system. One of the inediuni-term objectives will therefore
be to set up a monitoringand evaluation system, which will involve the
creatiaa of capacity for monitoring and evaluation of Government's
programmes including poverty reduction, the Vision 2020 and MDGs
and relatedprograms as well as for strategic resource allocation andthe
development of national capacity to collect, present and analyse
economic aridsocial statistics.


Conclusion

32.     The Government of Lesotho is fully committed to achieving the
Millennium Developrrient Goals and the Lesotho Vision 2020. The
actions and programmes to meet Government's objectives and policies
are those listed in the Perforninnce Assessment Framework [PAF) as
agreed with the donors involved in the General Budget Support
programme. These and further actions will be identified and articulated
in the Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy which will be available
during 2008 and the subsequent National Development Plan in 2010.
The programmes identified inthe PAF will be implemented, monitored

   Annex 3: GeneralBudgetSupport PerformanceAssessment Framework(PAF)

                                    1. GeneralBudgetSupport

        General budget support i s a development assistanceinstrument which has become
more prominent in recent years. Its basic characteristic i s that resources are made
available to be distributedthrough the budget by Government. Fundingi s not attached to
any particular programme, project or activity. In principle, therefore budget support
leaves Government with freedom o f action in allocating resources. Budget support can be
allocated at the recipient's discretion to both the recurrent and capital budgets. This i s in
conformity with the principles contained inthe Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, in
particular the need for partners to align behind Government plans, priorities and
procedures.

        Budget support provides an opportunity for the Government to expand
expenditures according to its own priorities. It also involves risks. The additional
resources could be dissipated on routine expenditures with little to show in terms o f
expanding productive capacity or increasing the well-being o f households. In accessing
budget support, Government therefore needs to have a focused spending programme to
utilize the additional resources to accelerate growth and improve pro-poor service
delivery.

        Another characteristic i s that budget support brings together a number o f funding
agencies which have committed themselves to using this instrument. However, the
various aid agencies may use somewhat different criteria in determining whether
sufficient progress has been made to warrant continued disbursement o f funds. This can
be managed by ensuring that the PAF reflects the concerns o f all the partners, so that
their individual programmes canbebasedon a selected sub-set ofthe PAFcomponents.

        One practical point that should be noted about this approach i s that as the funds
are not attached to any particular Government program, or ministry budget, the various
agencies o f Government responsible for deliveringthe components o f the PAF (including
the provision o f timely and accurate monitoring data) may see little advantage in
delivering the agreed targets. However, the availability o f additional funds will enable the
MFDPto fundmore ofministerialbudget requests.

        An importantpotential virtue of GBS is the possibilityo freduction intransactions
costs o f aid, both for the Government and partners. However, for these benefits to be
reaped there needs to be agreement regarding a workable and robust PAF.

                                    2. Preparationof the PAF

        At the meeting with donors on Review of Progress towards Budget Support in
Lesotho (8th-1lth 2007) it was agreed that a Performance Assessment Framework
                  October
(PAF) would be prepared by Government. The PAF provides the framework for



                                              56

negotiation and eventual monitoring o f a program o f general budget support. To prepare
the draft PAF Government organised a Workshop on GBS to which all concerned
ministries were invited, and this has followed with a round o f discussions with ministries
between4thand 12thDecember 2007.

        Following these consultations, the MFDPprepared a draft PAF outline which was
delivered to partners early January 2008. The GBS partners responded to the draft PAF
by consulting among themselves. Some general issues regarding the draft PAF were
presented to the Government inthe form o f a letter from the EC Delegate on behalf o f the
donor group. A more detailed discussion o f details o f the draft took place at a meetingat
the technical level between Partners and Government on February 14'h in Maseru. A
revised PAF was presented to a joint Government-partner meeting March 3'd-5th. This
revised draft reflects the discussions at that meeting.

        It is envisaged that there will be a joint partner/Government assessment o f
performance, based on the PAF, inSeptember each year.

        Given the fact that the PAF will be used to provide the basis for triggering the
release o f budget support, commitments and targets need to be very realistic, which
means that targets contained inthe draft PAF have been set with some caution. Indicators
for the first period (i.e. up to September 2008) targets are based on programs already
under implementation.

        Another challenge faced in the formulation o f the PAF related to data reliability.
Even such basic data as population are uncertain and issues raised in earlier donor
evaluation o f key performance data still have validityI8. This has meant that particular
indicators have been chosen for which reliable data are likely to be available, even if
indicator i s less appropriate than other possible indicators, for which reliable data are not
available. Although inthe case o f some indicators the population denominator i s suspect,
this may not affect the year to year movement ofthe indicator.

                                  3. The PAF and Sectoral Monitoring

        One issue which needs to be discussed is the relationship between the PAF and
other joint Government/partner monitoring exercises. In at least three sectors which are
critical components of Government development and poverty alleviation efforts
(transport, water, education and health, including HIV/Aids), there are established
sectoral evaluation frameworks, either under a SWAP or a SWAP-like arrangement.
These involve much more detailed performance assessments within those sectors than
would be appropriate for the GBS PAF.

suuuort uromamme inLesotho. (EC Framework Contract AMS 451 -Lot 8,28*. FinalReport March

                                                        57

           It is therefore proposed that the sectoral evaluations (e.g the Healthjoint annual
review) should be used to provide verification data for the GBS assessment, in order to
minimize transaction costs.
                                        4. The contents of the PAF

           The PAF should consist o f a number o f relevant monitorable, time bound and
realistic targets related to policy objectives. Monitoring in some areas may be based on
quantitative data, but some goals may relate to processes (e.g. implementation o f IFMIS)
and some may involve qualitative assessment. An important element o f the
operationalisation o f the PAF should be an agreement with partners regarding the method
o f assessment o fprogress inachievingtargets.

           Realism relates in particular to the timing o f target achievement. It i s a general
characteristic o f Governments that initial estimates o f the time and resources requiredto
implement actions are over-optimistic, often excessively so. Such optimistic targeting
may be no bad thing when the intention i s to bring pressure to bear to accelerate
implementationbut has unfortunate consequencesifincorporated into a framework which
i s to be used to judge performance, which inturn will determine the release o f funds.

           It has beenagreed with budget support partners that the PAF should be presented
interms o f four pillars covering the following areas (although this could be amended in
preparation, ifan alternative presentation proves to be more convenient):

         i.Growth and macroeconomicperformance: investment climate; infrastructure
             and skills development, agriculture, land tenure and other areas identified by

        *.   Government.
        11*  Governance and public        financialmanagement: budget process, financial
             management, procurement, institutional reforms, and PFM external oversight,
       ...   decentralisation, anti-comption, civil service reform.
      111. Human development:       health and education and HIV and Aids
       iv. Capacity development: strengthening o f NMES, development o f national
             statistics and related actions.

           It was agreed that it would be convenient for both sides to evaluate performance
annually around September. Therefore it is proposed that the first PAF should be
organised in terms o f three periods: to August 2008 (including some o f the agreed prior
actions in the Road Map which have already been implemented); September 2008 -
August 2009; September 2009 -August 2010.

           Also, as an operational tool, the particular agencies responsible for delivery
should agree to the timing.

           The following i s the proposed PAF Matrix as revised following negotiations with
development partners inMaseru from 3rd-5thMarch 2008.

budgetenvisages a high levelof spending. The overallfiscal batanceregistereda record
surplus in 2006107,the third in a row, The surpluswas the resultof high SACU receipts,and the
continuing sub-executionof capital expenditure projects. Most of the surplus in 2006was saved
at the Central Bankof Lesotho (CBL). The useof partof the SACUwindfall to retire
nonconcessionaldebt contributedto a decline in externaldebt-to-GDP ratioto 43 percentof
GDP in 2006. The 2007/08 budget envisagesa surge incurrent spending and a morethan
doubling of capitaexpenditure.

Broad moneygrew by 35% percent in 2006, with net foreign assets of the bankingsystem rising
strongly. NFA growth largely reflected high SACU receiptsand workers' remittances,as well as
the relativelygood performanceof the textile industry.

The outlook is broadlypositive, but subject to risks arising mostlyfrom the externalenvironment
and emergingfinancial sector vulnerabilities.

Executive BoardAssessment

ExecutiveDirectorscommendedthe Lesothoauthorities'commitment to prudent
macroeconomicpolicies,which have contributedto the country's strong economicperformance.
In particular,Directorsnoted the markedaccelerationin growth in 2006, the significant
improvementsinthe fiscal and external balances,and the build up of international resetves-
which have helpedconsolidatethe country's exchangeratepeg.

 Nevertheless,Directorsstressed that the country faces the considerablechallenge of sustaining
 rapidand broad-basedgrowth to reduce widespread povertyand make progresstowards the
 MDGs, and to help tacklethe high incidenceof HIVIAIDS.Achievementof these objectiveswill
 call for an accelerationof the pace of structural reformswith a focus on promoting privatesector
development,while ensuring strong medium-termfiscal and external positions.

 Directorsconsideredthat the medium-termoutlook for Lesotho is positive but subject to several
 risks.These includea possible slowdown in marketsfor Lesotho's exports as well as
 uncertaintyabout the revenue-sharingregimeof the SouthernAfrican Customs Union (SACU),
 prospectsfor globaltrade in textiles, and the outlook for remittancesfrom workers in South
 Africa. While acknowledgingthat these factors are largely beyond Lesotho's control, Directors
 encouraged the authoritiesto prepare for possible adversedevelopmentsthrough strengthened
 fiscal policyand public financial management,and prudentreservespolicies.

Directorswelcomed Lesotho`s prudent managementof SACU windfalls so far, and urgedthe
authoritiesto resistthe surge in spending envisaged in the 2007/08 budget. Lookingforward,
they noted that containment of recurrent spending over the mediumterm would help keep fiscal
policy sustainablewhile allowing the use of availablefiscal space for increasing productive
public investment. Directorsalso underscoredthe importanceof approachingthe upcoming
salary review and the possible pension reformwith caution, and more generally, of addressing
existing weaknesses inthe budget process and extending the Medium-TermExpenditure
Frameworkto all ministries. Equally, Directorswelcomed the authorities' intention to pursue
prudent debt management policies.

Directors encouraged the authorities to continueto use grantsas well as domestic resourcesto
boost public investment,especially in infrastructure.They calledfor efforts to improveproject
executionand full utilizationof external assistance, includingthe resources of the Millennium
ChallengeCorporation (MCC)--drawing on donortechnical assistance. Directorswelcomed the
authorities' recognition that, while public-private partnerships have a role in public investment,
they needto buildthe necessary capacityto managethem effectively.

Directorsencouraged the authorities to acceleratethe pace of structural reforms, andwelcomed
the preparationof a Growth Strategy Paper (GSP), They noted that envisaged programs-
namely, the Public Sector Improvementand Reform Program,the Private Sector Development
Componentof the MCC compact, and the World Bank-supported Private Sector
CompetitivenessProgram-would be key to relieving constraints on growth and enhancing
productivity. In particular,these programsaim at strengthening institutionbuilding, establishing
an appropriate legal and institutionalframework, and improving the investmentclimate for
domestic and foreign investors. Consistency betweenthe GSP and Lesotho`sPoverty
ReductionStrategy would be important.

Directors agreed that Lesotho's monetary and exchange rate regime has been beneficial and
should be preserved,along with the prudent policy mix that makes it viable. In particular,they
underscoredthat membershipin the Common MonetaryArea and the pegof the loti to the rand
have ensured stable and low inflation, and facilitatedcapital and commercial exchanges with
SouthAfrica. Fiscalrestraint in the face of strong SACU revenueshasensuredexternalstability
by helping keep net internationalresewes at levels consistent with the sustainability of the peg.
A few Directors advised that careful attention be paidto the risks associated with the volatility of
the rand, and the inflation differentialbetween Lesotho and SouthAfrica.

Directors notedthat, while the bankingsystem appears solid, the limitedaccess to its services
by householdsand small businesses has fostered the growth of weakly supervised credit
cooperatives. In this respect, Directorscalled on the authorities to step up their current efforts to
improve the regulationand supervision of credit cooperatives and to increase access to banking
services.

Directorsexpressed concern over the operationof unlicensed deposit-taking entities promising

liabilities,face constant rolloverrisks, and posesignificant risk of failure. The continued
operationof these entitieswould result infurther growth intheir liabilitiesand higherriskof
social and financial repercussions. Accordingly, Directorsurgedthe authoritiesto take prompt
actionto addressthis issue.
