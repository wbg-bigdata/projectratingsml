REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE AGRICULTURAL CREDIT CORPORATION
WITH A GUARAUiTEE BY IRELAND
,OR A LTVESTO-IK DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Agricultural Credit Corporation (ACC) for the equivalent of
US$25 million to help finance a livestock development project.  This loan
would have a term of 14 years including a grace period of five years, with
interest at 7-1,' percent per annum. The Government would guarantee the
loan and bear the foreign exchange risk.
PART I -- THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects of
Ireland" (R72-180), dated June 13, 1972 has been distributed to the
Executive Directors. Country Data are presented in Annex I.
3.        Ireland, the poorest of the EEC countries, had a per capita
GNP estimated at US$1,390 1/ in 1971, slightly higher than Greece and Spain.
Within Ireland there are striking imbalances in the distribution of income
and wealth, and counties such as Sligo, Mayo, and Galway have incomes far
below the national average. By joining the European Economic Community (EEC),
effective January 1, 1973, Ireland passed a turning point in its economic
development. Its access to a much improved market will open new export
opportunities for both industry and agriculture. At the same time,
competition from other EEC member-countries will intensify the pressure
on inefficient enterprises and force the pace of structural changes to
increase productivity. Closer business relations with European firms,
together with existing labor reserves could attract foreign private
investment, thus substantially supplementing domestic capital resources.
On balance these changes should strengthen the economy and after an adjustment
period during the next few years, should provide a new basis for continued
growth of production, employment and exports similar to that in the 1960's
when real per capita output expanded at an average rate of 3-1/2 percent a
year and exports rose at 12 percent annually.
4.        Ireland will only gradually assume the full obligations of EEC
membership over a transitianal period extending to 1977, but the Government
must, as a matter of urgency, embark on a program that facilitates and guides
structural adjustments. The nature and scope of these adjustments, and the
particular areas in which policy changes are needed, are being discussed in
detail between Ireland and the other members of the Conimunity.
1/ At 1970 market prices. It is reported that the Irish Government will
shortly publish a GNP series including 1972 data.



5^        In agriculture, expanded markets could lead to a
30-J 0 percent increase in the volume of agricultural output, and
suostantially higher EEC prices could result in an even larger
increase in its value within the next five years. Given Ireland's
comparative advantage in low cost cattle production from established
grasslands, beef output could expand rapidly. Pig, poultry and egg
production are also expected to benefit from the EEC entry, but fruit
and vegetable production may suffer. The proposed project is designed
to help the Irish take advantage of the expanding opportunities for beef
and pig exports. At the same time, the Government will need to maintain
and reinforce its development policies directed towards both the transfer
of agricultural labor into other sectors and the increase of agricultural
productivity through improved technology, land consolidation, more adequate
credit facilities and improvred farmer education.
6.        The outlook for Irish industry is less clear.  The more efficient
enterprises will certainly benefit from access to the enlarged European
market3 but many Irish firms may be too small to function efficiently under
increasingly competitive conditions. There is also a shortage of skLIled
labor, since technical training has been limited and the emigration of
skilled Irish workers, while diminishing, still continues. The Government
is well aware that new initiatives need to be developed to deal with these
problems -- for example, by promoting mergers, expanding and revising
training programs, improving State marketing aids and developing new
channels of credit to finance industrial modernization and expansion.
Meanwhile, industrial investment seems to have been discouraged somewhat
by the political violence in the North, and tourism has been discouraged.
7.        While the integration process calls for intensified endeavors
to face structural adjustment problems, attention will also need to
be given to short-term policy requirements, especially measures to
control inflationary pressures which could weaken Ireland's competitive
position. Consumer price rises have accelerated from a 5 percent
annual average during 1967-69 to 8.3 percent in 1970 and close to
9 percent in 1971 and 1972. This was largely the result of excessive
in.creases in wages and salaries. In 1971 for example, average incomes
rose by 12-13 percent, well above the 3 percent real increase in national
output.
8.        The Irish balance of payments has remained strong and
official international reserves are high. At the end of February 1973,
Ireland held $1.1 billion in external reserves, equivalent to about
six months of merchandise imports. Both 1971 and 1972 witnessed a
considerable accumulation of reserves, which should help Ireland face
the increased import bill expected in the first years of EEC member-
shinp.



-3-
9.        Ireland's net foreign borrowings rose in 1971 and 1972,
reflecting in part an increased current deficit in the balance of
paymlents as well as speculative capital movements due to
international currency conditions. Net capital inflows amounted to
b 157 million in 1971 (compared to an estimated annual average of
; 44 million during 1967-1970). The greater part of these borrowings
has been absorbed by the private sector. However, the Government and
public enterprises have also increased their external borrowings.
During 1969-71 public sector borrowing amounted to about 40 percent
(E 121 million) of the total net capital inflow. Public bond issues
(mainly in the German and UK markets) accounted for approximately
half the total public borrowing abroad.
10.       In spite of recent increases in public foreign borrowing,
Ireland' s service payments on external public debt were only 3 percent
of exports of goods and non-factor services in 1971. Including payments
on private foreign debt, Ireland's debt service ratio is in the order of
12 percent. Much of the private debt is related to commercial
transactions and of relatively short maturity. Ireland remains credit-
worthy for continued borrowing on Bank terms. Furthermore, Ireland
needs external capital and technical assistance to facilitate
structural reforms necessary if the opportunities opened up by member-
ship in the EEC are to yield their full benefit to the Irish economy.
PART II -- BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN IRELAND
11.       The proposed loan, the Bank's sixth operation in Ireland,
would bring total Bank lending to $97.5 million, of which $71.0 million
(including $52.9 million undisbursed) was outstanding and held by the
Bank as of April 30, 1973. Bank lending to Ireland began only in 1969,
with the first of three loans to the Electricity Supply Board (ESB);
a total of $49.5 million has now been lent to the power sector. These
loans were made in support of ESB's program to meet Ireland's rapidly
growing demand for electric power. Continuing industrialization and
rising standards of living have given rise to an average annual rate
of growth in pawer consumption of 10 percent since the early 1960's.
The Bank's loans to ESB have helped finance necessary capital develop-
ments for which Ireland had not been able to raise sufficient
capital on reasonable terms; now, hawever, ESB has begun to
meet its growing capital requirements through direct borrowing



-14-
n foreign capital markets and by using supplier credits.    Through
two other loans in 1971 the Bank also provided financing for an
industrial development finance company and for education; the latter is
in support of a major educational   reform aimed at more effectively
meeting  the manpower  demands of the  economy.   Annex II contains
a statement of Bank loans as of April 30, 1973 and comments on the status
of individual loans.
12.       A second loan for education is planned for FY 1974.  It is
expected to provide about $25 million to help finance a number of commu-
nity schools, five new industrial training centers, expansion of seven
regional technical colleges, the Institute of Higher Education at Limerick,
and the relocation and expansion of the Faculty of Agriculture at Univer-
sity College. Tne only other prospective project under active considera-
tion would provide assistance to Ireland in promoting the decen-
tralization of industrial development. This project, which could be ready
for lending in FY 1975, should be useful not only for its contribution to
Ireland's own industrial policy planning but could also serve as a pilot
project.
PART III - THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
13.       Agriculture is a key sector in Ireland, generating more than
20 percent of national income, employing 25 pereent of the labor force, and
accounting for over 40 percent of export earnings. Output, however, is
well below potential, mainly because of institutional obstacles.  For
example, although Ireland has high standards of research and substantial
knowledge of' temperate livestock production, insufficient use has been
made of this knowledge, especially by smaller farmers. Furthermore, Irish
farmers traditionally have been reluctant to-borrow for the expansion of
f'arm production facilities. The commercial banks' practice hitherto of
extending only short-term loans in the agricultural sector has further
deterred the expansion of on-farm investment. The Agricultural Credit
Corporation (ACC) -- a wholly-owned Government institution -- lends to
farmers on medium- and long-term as well as short-term, and holds
25 percent of all present loans outstanding to agriculture. The volume
of ACC's lending doubled in 1972 as compared with 1971, financed in part
by an unusually large short-term inflow of deposits; but its financial
resources alone are insufficient to meet the investment needs of the
agricultural sector.  The principal sources of ACC's financing are
exchequer advances, which have averaged L 7.7 million (TJS$18.5 million)
annually, and deposit accounts which reached an exceptional level of
A -1.1 million (US$50.6 million) in 1972.



- 5 -
14.       Not only do many farms need investment to be viable, but a large
number are too small to utilize modern farming techniques effectively.
Of a total of 200,000 farm holdings, 37 percent are less than 30 acres,
51 percent are from 30 to 100 acres, and only 12 percent over 100 acres.
A further indication of the generally small scale of Irish farms is that
85 percent are family farms, with all of the labor being supplied by
the farmer and his family. Land leases are short-term, and since the
Land Reforms of 1923, have customarily been limited to U months. As noted
in paragraph 27 below, the proposed project is part of Ireland's program to
overcome some of these structural difficulties.
15.       Within Ireland's agricultural sector, livestock production, parti-
cularly beef, offers great potential for development. Beef production in
Ireland has particular advantages, which make it internationally competitive;
the national herd is relatively disease-free, and the predominantly grassland
environment is conducive to low cost production. Given. Ireland's limited
advantages in other sectors, the expansion of livestock production offers
one of the best opportunities for significant income increases in the
immediate future and is therefore a very high priority choice for
allocation of Ireland's development resources.
16.       Ireland's exports of beef amounted to 145,531 tons in 1971, of
which nearly 75 percent was fresh/chilled, the remainder frozen. In addi-
tion almost 600,000 live cattle were exported in 1971. The UK was the
principal market, receiving about 70 percent of fresh/chilled and frozen
beef and nearly all the live cattle. Total exports of cattle, both live
and dead, have been increasing steadily, particularly since the Anglo-Irish
Free Trade Agreement came into effect in mid-1966. Under the Agreement
Irish products have free access to the UK market. Also the Irish Govern-
ment undertook to use its best endeavors to ensure that a substantial
supply of store cattle would be exported to the UK each year and this
obligation continues under EEC. With the entry of both UK and Ireland
into EEC, the UK guarantee payments (deficiency payments) for which
agreed quantities of Irish beef and lamb imports qualified under the
Free Trade Agreement, will be gradually dismantled by 1977.
17.        Irish products now enjoy unrestricted access to the EEC market.
Livestock production is expected to continue to be a major income earner
for Ireland. The proposed loan would expedite and strengthen the farmers,
response to this economic opportunity, particularly during the five-year
transition period before Ireland receives the full benefit of the EEC's
higher prices on agricultural products in January 1978. Irish agricultural
policies will have to be adjusted to the EEC's Directives for the Reform of
Agricultural Structures. Ireland will probably present its policy proposals
to the Council along with other new members in 1974, after the Council has
considered and approved the plans of the original EEC members. Government
policies implementing these Directives are not expected to enter into
effect before 1975.

Worxld production and consumption of meat 1/ has doubled in the
p,ast tYiom decadces. Much of the production increase is attributable to the
devel1oped cunttries, whereas in the developing countries  output has grown
less rapidly than population. The increase in volume of world meat trade
has a.lso outpaced the increase in output, and today about 6 percent of the
curr.rit rmeat output enters international trade (ccmpared to 4 percent in the
190 's)  Long-tern projections indicate a substantial global deficit in
important meat-. items, since demand is expected to continue increasing over
th  next *dcaea, ow-ing to rising living standards and population growth.
About 73 percent of this deficit, or 0.9 million tons annually, would be in
the EEC, Incremental beef output frcm the proposed project is estimated to be
iJ. 30 to ns p^-w year at full developmment and would amount to about 1.3 percent
anrd I.   rcen3 respectively of the projected annual world and EEC beef deficits.
The incremental beef outputt of the project would represent about 6 percent
of T.reland s total current output.
19.        ireland has not been a major supplier of beef to the original six
EEC coulntries. Lass than one percent of the EECs iLmports of bef tand cattle
in 1971 were iiroxm Ireland. More thaun 50 percenti of EEC imports were from
other EEC Countries, 21 percent from Eastern Europ:e, 1S percent from South
America, 9 percent from Western European countries outside the EEC, and the
remaining 5 percent from Australia, Canada, the US and other countries.  The
UK has been the major market for Irish beef. There is no doubt that the UK
wil-l remaLn irelandis major beef export market wnithin the enlarged EEC. The
buTk of Irish exports are projected to continue ini the form of fresh and
chilled meat or live cattle. The supply of fredh, chilled meat or live cattle
frcm South America to the EEC and the UK amounted to less than one percent
of imports. ,n 1971 nearly 95 percent of the EEC's frozen beef imports were
from South Aierica., -vehile less than one percent came from Ireland.  Frozen meat
imports are used primarily as inputs for manufactunred meat products. Fresh
and chilled beef imports, as well as meat from Inported live cattle, slaughtered
locally, a-re maiLly- marketed as fresh meat cuts clirectly to consumers.
2^0.      ITn .,cent years the fact that beef demtnd has been increasing
2"aster 4ha ,- '.unply brought about substantial increases in prices.  The
historic gro;wtih rate (1945/50 to 1961/66) in prodLcer prices for Irish fat
cattle was 3.6, percent per annum. In the period 1966/67 to 1971/72, the annual
increase in I3ish producer prices was 10.6 percent due to continued high
demand and Li part to the Anglo-Irish free trade agreement. In the past year
orices for Trish cattle have increased by 25 percent. These price increases
reflect market conditions ir the UK, -ehich imports 23 percent of its needs
anc( r1moted imoort le-vies in early 1972.

21.       Beef prices in the EEC are guided by an orientation price set
periodically at a level which allows farmers' incomes to reach parity over
time with urban incomes. Fixed import duties are imposed on cattle and meat
imports, at present 20 percent on beef and veal and 16 percent on live
cattle. If these rates are not sufficient to maintain the price of
imported meats at or above the orientation price, a supplementary import
levy is imposed. The duties can be suspended if the average market price
for beef in the EEC remains at least 13 percent above the recommended guide
price for any two Tueeks and at least 9 percent above it in all the individual
member-states. During most of 1972 and continuing today, EEC cattle prices
have been consistently over the orvientation prices, which were recently
increased marginally (i.e. by 0.3 percent). In early 1973 EEC prices were
more than 22 percent above the orientation prices, and the supplementary
levies were removed. It is expected that these levies will not be
reinstated at least through 1973. Beginning in 1973, prices for producers
in Ireland, UK and Denmark are to be guided by an orientation price series,
which is projected to increase by steps to the full EEC orientation prices
by 1978.
PART IV -- THE PROJECT
22.       The proposed project was prepared over a period of years by the
Department of Finance in cooperation with the Department of Agriculture and
Fisheries, the Agriculture Credit Corporation (ACC), and the Agricultural
Research Institute. Three World Bank missions provided guidance in its
preparation. An appraisal mission visited Ireland in April/May 1972.
Negotiations were begun in Washington, April 3 to 6, and concluded in
Ireland, May 10 to 12, 1973. A detailed description of the proposed
project is given in the report entitled "Appraisal of a Livestock
Development Project", (18-IRE), dated May 25, 1973, which is being
distributed separately. A loan and project summary is attached as
Annex III.   A map of Ireland is also attached.
Project Description
23.        The project is part of a larger government program designed to
encourage viable livestock farmers to exploit EEC markets promptly. The
project would provide credit and technical assistance to small and medium-
size family enterprises. Loan proceeds would be used by the ACC and parti-
cipating cammercial banks for sub-loans to farmers, who would borrow on the
basis of approved farm development plans prepared by the farmer with assist-
ance from the Farm Advisory Services of the government and the agricultural
officers of the participating banks in accordance with guidelines to be
prepared by the Project Director. Plans involving investment of b 30,000
or more would be sent to the Bank for review before final approval by ACC
and Irish participating banks. These farm plans will provide inter alia



- 8 -
for (a) expanding the calf crop (particularly the portion destined for
beef production), (b) raising the present level of productive efficiency
of participating farms (particularly by reducing the age of slaughter),
(c) encouraging the establishment of commercialized pig-breeding units,
and (d) establishing private or cooperatively owned pig fattening opera-
tions to provide an outlet for the increasing supply of "store" pigs
expected from the small breeding units. The major impact of the project
(abo:.rbing an estimated 90 percent of total costs) would be to increase
cattle production. Increased pig production accounts for the remaining
10 percent of total project cost. Specific improvements and enlargements
in farm installations would be needed to accommodate these expanded opera-
tions.  Typical on-farm investments would be for pasture improvement (inclu-
ding pasture renewal, consolidation of small fields through wall and hedge
removal, levelling, drainage, etc.), additional water facilities, fencing,
construction of buildings and silos and purchase of stock and equipment.
24.       Project assistance would be restricted to small and medium-scale
farmers who are viable or have potential for viable development. Farms so
small as to offer no prospects of becoming viable would be excluded, as
would the larger farms. Under EEC agricultural policy, elderly farmers
in the non-viable group would be eligible for pensions, and others in
this group would be considered for retraining programs.   Eligibility to
participate in the project would be restricted to bona fide farmers whose
principal source of income was their livestock unit, and whose pre-develop-
ment cattle herd sizes or pig carrying capacity would indicate a family
income per capita from livestock significantly below, and in most cases
very substantially below, the national GNP per capita. It is estimated
that about 3,500 farmers will participate in the project.
45.       Tne Bank would lend to ACC at 7-1/4 percent, of which part would
be onlent to sub-borrowers by ACC directly and the balance would be lent
by ACC to the participating banks at the rate of 7-3/4 percent repayable
over 13 years for their onlending. A 1/2 percent spread is required to meet
the estimated cost to ACC of operating the Project Unit.   A further spread of
2 percent on the proceeds of the Bank loan is required by ACG and the other
participating banks to cover the costs of onlending and to make participation in the
project attractive to the banks.   Thus the applicable interest rate for onlending
the Proceeds of the Loan would be 9-3/4 percent. Since subloans under the
Project would be financed by proceeds from the Bank loan as well as from
the oarticipating banks, sub-borrowers would be charged an interest rate
based on the wqeighted average of 9-3/4 percent and the commercial rate
applicable to the participating bankst portion. For example, the relevant
coinimercial rate in February 1973 was 11-1/4 percent; such a rate would
resut in a blended rate to sub-borrowers of 10-1/4 percent. Even though
tne difference between this rate and the commercial rate is small, it is



- 9 -
expected to be beneficial in attracting smaller scale farmers into the
project. It is expected that sub-borrowers would require 10 to 12 years
to repay their beef investment loans and 8 to 10 years for pig investment
loans, including two to four years of grace in both cases. The actual
term and grace period would be based on the projected cash flows of the
sub-projects being financed. It is envisaged that prospective borrowers
with farms above the project eligibility limits would be able to obtain
financing to implement their farm development plans at normal commercial
rates of interest with the banks financing such loans entirely out of
their own funds.
Organization and Administration
26.       The project administrative unit under the Project Director
would be located in the ACC, and would be given a high degree of autonomy.
A Project Account would be established in the Central Bank on behalf of
the ACC, from which disbursements would be made for sub-loans under the
project, both through the ACC and the other participating banks. The
Project Director, who would be appointed by the ACC, with the consent of
the Departments of Finance and Agriculture, would head the administrative
unit and would have the authority to determine the eligibility of invest-
ment plans for refinancing from the Project Account in accordance with
the project guidelines. In order to provide policy guidance an Advisory
Committee would be established with one representative each from the
Departments of Finance and Agriculture, the Central Bank, the ACC and
the Agricultural Advisory Services, and two representatives each from
the commercial banks and farmersl groups. The Project Director would
serve as Chairman of the Advisory Committee.
Institutional Changes
27.       The project has several elements that would either bring about
or reinforce desirable institutional changes.
a)  For the first time it is expected that the commercial banks
would be brought into a major long-term lending program for
the agricultural sector. This should result in channeling
rural savings back into agricultural investment, since
commercial banks already obtain a considerable proportion
of their funds through farmerst deposit accounts.
b) The number of agricultural officers in the participating
banks available to review agricultural loans would be
considerably increased. The ACC and commercial banks
already have scme staff who are experienced in reviewing
applications for short-term agricultural loans and who are



- I0 -
qualified to a-praise farm development plans required under
the project. The ACC has 18 agricultural officers,
stationed in 13 provincial area offices throughout the
country as well. as in Dublin, and it is training more
officers. Two major bank groups that would participate --
the Bank of Ireland Group and the Allied Irish Bank --
have four or five agricultural offficers, and they plan to
dobuble this nuniter in order to handle the additional volume
oL farm loan applications expectedi urnder the project.
c)  The technica.l.azssistance resourCes of the Farm Advisory
Services (FAS- ") woud be more extensively used, since all
prospective bcrrowers -.ould be working with them in
preparing individual faLrm development plans for presentation
to their banks.. The FAS, which is organzed on a country
Uasis, h-is about 00 officers, al"l graduates.
d)  In accordance wiith EGC policies, the Government intends to
pr-omote suita;le arrangements for leasing to encourage
consol.dation of small parcels oI land into larger units.
The larger farn units thlus assembled. would permit more
efficient agricultural practices, and long-term lease
arrangements would encourage younger, technically trained
farmers to reiaindn in farming.
Costs and Financing
28.       The total cost of the project is estimated to be $56 million.
The farmers would contribute ovar $'L1 million from their own resources, the
ACC and participating barnks $13 mill.on, Goverrnment investment grants some
$7 million, and the Bank $2fr million, The Government's investment grants
would be provided under an existing program, through which about 25,000
farmers have already rece:ived over $100 milliorl equivalent in 1967-71 to
help meet the costs of approved laxid reclamaticn and drainage schemes,
buildings aid ot}her structures.  This system has the advantage of giving
ornly selective subsidies to certain preferred types of investment.  The
Govenm.ent expects to continue thnis program, although there may be pressure
to alter the form of goverxnent assais-ance after a year or two when EEC
Cormon Agricultural Policy (CAP) di).'ectives are implemented.  To deal
with the possibility that the Government would discontinue its program
of :nvestment grants, the AEC and participatLng banks would agree to
increase their sub-loans to make up th_e difference.
2,i.      TLhe 2sOreig  exhan-o a costs of the pro-ect are estimated at about
$23.3 million, or L>2 -.ercent of total project cost.  Thus only about $1.7 mil-
lion of the Bank loan would be used to finance local currency expenditures.



Procurement and Disbursement
30.       Procurement of the goods and services required for the project
would be by individual sub-borrowers through normal commercial channels.
Many of the items (which would include building supplies, fertilizers,
pumps, etc.) are imported in finished condition, and major international
companies are actively represented; these companies are highly competitive
and have well-established networks of service and repair facilities in
Ireland. These facts, together with the relatively small size of indi-
vidual purchases and the fact that such purchases would be spread over
four years, make bulk procurement under international competitive bidding
inappropriate.
31.       Disbursements to individual sub-borrowers would be related to
the phasing of their investments and would be spread over three years
for beef breeding enterprises, two years for beef rearing/fattening and
dairy/beef enterprises, and one year for pig enterprises. As new farmers
would come into the project during the first two years for beef breeding
enterprises and the first three years for other enterprises, commitments
from the proceeds of the proposed IBRD loan would be spread over a three-
year period. It is expected that loan disbursements will be campleted
by December 31, 1977. (This assumes that all commitments for beef breeding
enterprises would be made before the end of the second year of the project).
Economic Evaluation
32.       Given the projected world deficits in beef supply, long term
projections are for a real increase of 1.1 to 3.25 percent per annum in
the price of internationally traded beef. Although Irish producers will
have the benefits of transitional orientation prices reaching parity with
other EEC members by 1977, the economic evaluation of the project was made
on the basis of the projected world prices. On this conservative basis
the estimated rate of return would be between 18 and 20 percent.
PART V -- LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHCRITY
33.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Agricultural
Credit Corporation (ACC), the draft Guarantee Agreement between Ireland
and the Bank, and a specimen participating bank agreement between the
borrower and a participating bank, the Report of the Committee provided
for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement and
the text of a resolution approving the proposed loan are being dis-
tributed to the Executive Directors separately.



- 12 -
3h.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI -- RECONMMEDATION
35.       I recommend that the Executive D,irectors approve the proposed
loan.

President

B.     STATThIENT OF IFC INVESTMENTS
(as  t April ,3, 0,
IC has not been active in Ireland so far. A brief reconnaissance
miss-on tc Ireland, was made by IFC in April 1972, but as yet no appropriate
procye(ts have been proposed for IFC financing.
C.     PRCd 3CT FEXECUTI0N AND DISBURSE;MENTSI:/
Disbursements on all loans to Ireland are now proceeding at a
generally satisfactory pace, although in one case -- the Industrial Credit
Corporation (ICC) imoplementation qas slot; to begin.
Ln. No. >9_ Pumped Storage PoAer Project; US$1L.5 million Loan of
t 1969;__
C1cs~n Date: March 31, 1°74.
This proj,ect consists of the construction of a 280 MW pumped
storage po--er station and attendant reservoir and turnelling. Constrnction
is uroceeding satisfactorily and is expected to be completed by March 171!,
on schedule.
Ln. No. 726 Second Power Pro,ect; US$20 million Loan of March 3, 1971;
Closing Date: March 31, 1976.
This project consists of the supply and installation of a single
.29 MW oil-fired thermal generation unit and associated equipment.   The loan
is expected to be disbursed by October 1975, and is also on schedule.
Ln. No. 74h Industrial Credit Project; US$10 million Loan of June 2, 1971;
Closing Date: June 30, 1975.
Implementation of this loan to a Government-owned bank that lends
for industrial development was slow during its first year due to a general
slolv-down in investment, resulting from uncertainty about Ireland joining
tlhe EC and the political troubles in the North. Investment levels have
picked up somewlhat since Irelald voted to join the EEC, and commitments
against this loarn have increased.
Ln. No. 785 Education Project; US$13 million Loan of August 9, 1971;
Closing Date: Decermber 31, 1976.
This loarn assists in financing the construction of 24 secondary
comprehensive schools, 3 secondary and higher level technical colleges;
it also provides for technical assistance from specialists in education
planning and construction. This loan became effective in November 1971
and Implementation is proceeding satisfactorily.   Some months' time will
be req,uired for completion of building designs, but an acceleration of
disbursements can be expected by the first quarter of FY 1974.

Ln. No. 303 Third Power Project; US$15 million Loan of March 3, 1972;
Closing Date: March 31, 1977.
This project provides for installation of another 250 W4
generating unit at the Tarbert station on the Shannon River. Imple-
mentation is proceeding satisfactorily.
V/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

market, particularly in the EEC. The project would also
promote improvements in the structure of farming and raise
the incomes of small farmers. The project would finance
the development of about: (a) 315 beef breeding farms;
(b) 1,085 beef rearing/fattening farms; (c) 1,855 dairy!
beef farms; (d) 210 pig breeding units; and (e) 55 pig
fattening units. The project would increase annual
output by an estimated 14,000 tons of beef and 7,500 tons
of pigmeat.
A Project Unit to be headed by a Project Director would be
established in the Agricultural Credit Corporation (ACC) and
would be responsible for project execution. The loan proceeds
would be disbursed against 66 percent of the Farm DevelopmenL
loans, against evidence of disbursement by the participating
banks, (including ACC) to the Project Farmers. Technical
assistance to farmers in preparing farm plans on,which to
base their loan applicationswould be provided by the Farm
Advisory Service, and officers employed by the Banks and ACC
would appraise the loan applications (including farrr plans)
and submit them to the Project Director for approval.   Loans of
over L 30,000 would be reviewed by IBRD before final approval
by the Project Director.
