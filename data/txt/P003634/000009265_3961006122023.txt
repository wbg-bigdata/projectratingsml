COMPREHENSIVE MATERNAL AND CHILD
HEALTH (MCI) PROJECT
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:     People's Republic of China
Beneficiaries:  Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) and Eight Provinces (Gansu,
Guangxi, Jiangxi, Nei Mongol, Qinghai, Shaanxi, Sichuan and Yunnan)
Amount:       SDR 61.9 ($90 million equivalent)
Terms:        Standard, with 35 years' maturity
Project
Description:  The project's principal goal is to reduce maternal and child morbidity and
mortality in the poorest areas of China. This would be achieved by:
improving the quality and effectiveness of MCH care at the primary and
county levels; increasing equitable access to and utilization of the basic
care; and improving MCH management. The project has four main
components:  basic health care delivery; health workers' training;
management improvement; and a national-level component. Under the
basic health care delivery component, the project would improve services
at the village, township, and county referral levels. At the village level,
the project would provide basic equipment, in-service training and
program support for obstetrics, infant/child care, health education, and
improved nutrition. At the township level, it would finance essential
equipment, in-service training, rehabilitation of physical facilities and
program support to improve MCH care and the supervision of the village
staff. At the county level, the emphasis is on improving technical
quality, referral capability, supervision and technical assistance, and
health education. To this end, the project would provide the county
MCH stations and the county hospitals with essential equipment, limited
rehabilitation of the physical facilities, staff training, and program
support. The health workers' training component would support in-
service training of all health workers concerned with MCH care at the
village, township and county levels in basic MCH, clinical care, and
management skills. The management improvement component would
improve management of comprehensive MCH programs at different



- ii -
levels through training, supervisory support and improved management
information. The national-level component would oversee the overall
management and monitoring of the project, carry out interdepartmental
and interprovincial coordination, provide technical support to the
provinces, prepare and appraise the second phase of this project and
disseminate the project experiences to nonproject areas.
Benefits:      The proposed project is expected to benefit about 100 million of the
poorest people from among China's economically most disadvantaged
provinces and counties. The most direct beneficiaries are women of
child bearing age, particularly during and after pregnancy, and children
under five years of age. The number of pregnant women and newborn
beneficiaries is expected to be about 1.5 million each per year or a total
of 15 million during the five years of the project. In addition, some 15
million women of child-bearing age would benefit from health education,
improved family planning advice and other care, including tetanus toxoid
immunization.
The main benefits of the project would be the sustainable reduction in
maternal, infant, and child mortality and morbidity in the country's
poorest regions. The project would also support nutrition education and
special programs to alleviate micronutrient deficiencies that should lead
to improved feeding practices and improved nutritional status of women
and children. Furthermore, the project includes specific interventions
designed to improve planning and management capacity of the Central,
provincial and county Govemments to prepare and implement similar
comprehensive projects and to replicate them in other parts of the
country.
Risks:         There are two main risks in this project. First, there is a risk that a part
of the poorest segment of the population will not be able to benefit from
improved services.  This risk has been greatly reduced as the
participating provinces are required to implement specially targeted plans
to benefit the poor and the first batch of four provinces have already
developed the plans to start implementation by January 1, 1995.
Secondly, there is a risk that the central and provincial officials will not
be able to oversee the implementation of the project activities. The
institutional strengthening measures already taken at each level, the
project's national component in MOPH to supervise and monitor the
project and the IDA supervision missions should minimize this risk.

1. MATERNAL AND CBILD HEALTH IN CHINA
A. POPULATION, HEALTH AND NUTRITION STATUS
1.1         Demographic Status. China's population was estimated to be 1.13 billion
in 1990. Since the Cultural Revolution, China has made serious efforts to limit population
growth. As a result, throughout the 1980s, its crude birth and death rates remained at
about 21 and 6 per thousand, respectively, stabilizing the annual rate of natural increase
at about 1.5 percent. The total fertility rate (TFR) has been held at 2.5 in the 1980s.
1.2         Health Status. Since 1949, China's achievements in health have been
remarkable and her population has attained a health status comparable to middle-income
countries. The country has been successful in creating a comprehensive network of health
services covering all counties, townships and villages. Every county has a county general
hospital, an epidemic prevention station (EPS) and a matemal and child health (MCH)
station. Each township has a small hospital (average 15 beds) which provides both
preventive and curative services to the population. Although many poorly qualified
"barefoot doctors" have left the health field, by 1990, about 86 percent of the villages had
a health clinic and the most of the remainder were covered under outreach programs. The
World Development Report (WDR) 1993 indicates that, in 1991, China's average life
expectancy at birth was 69 years, compared to 42 years for low-income countries and 69
years for upper-middle-income countries. According to the WDR's measure of the overall
burden of disease, China's per capita losses from disease are less than those of any region
except the established market economies (EMEs) and the formerly socialist economies
(FSEs) of Europe.
1.3         Nutritional status. Average food consumption in China compares well with
other developing countries. The Nationwide Nutrition Survey of 1982 indicated that the
average energy intake per capita was 2085 calories (102 percent of recommended daily
allowance or RDA) and 67 grams of protein (92 percent of RDA). The average Chinese
diet is not deficient although pockets of malnutrition exist in poorer areas. Micronutrient
deficiencies are manifested in the prevalence of anemia (between 30-80 percent of children
under seven and about 50 percent of pregnant women in the rural areas), rickets (about
50 percent of the children in certain areas), and iodine deficiency disorder.
B. MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH (MCE)
MCH Status
1.4         China's overall MCH status far exceeds that of most developing countries
and compares well with middle income countries. Its infant mortality rate (IMR) and



matenal mortality rate (MMR) compare well with countries with much higher per capita
income, as indicated by the WDR data shown below in Table 1.1. China was able to
attain these rates with fewer resources mainly because of the Govemment's policy to
establish an extensive health service network and to emphasize preventive health care.

La Although China's MCH status is undoubtedly better than most developing countries,
it is hard to find reliable data on IMR and MMR. For consistency, China's IMR and
MMR data in Table 1.1 were from official sources as used elsewhere in this report
(see the source reference in Table 1.2).
Source: WDR, 1993.
1.5         Concealed behind the favorable national statistics, however, are serious
differences in health status among regions of China. As seen in Table 1.2, IMRs (deaths
per 1,000 live births) in Beijing, Jilin, and Shandong are 11, 27, and 17, respectively,
compared to 68, 50, and 74, respectively, for Guizhou, Guangxi, and Yunnan. Similarly,
MMRs for the first group of provinces are 40, 47, and 40, respectively, for every 100,000
live births compared to an average of 170 for the second group. (For further detail, see
Table A1.2 in Annex 1.)
MCH Institutions
1.6         Maternal and child health care is carried out by several different agencies
in China. Under the Ministry of Public Health (MOPH), the Maternal and Child Health
(MCI) Department is the main technical department responsible for establishing policy to
safeguard women's and children's health.  It has four divisions-women's health,
children's health, family planning, and general administration-and a special project office
to manage the 300-County Project,i/ supported by the United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF), the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), and the World Health
1/    The official namo of the 300-County Project (a commonly used phrase) is 'Strengthening MCH-FP
Services at the Grassroots Level Project."

Organization (WHO) (see para. 1.14). The four divisions are small with few professional
staff. The provincial MCH bureaus mirror this organization. The County MCH stations
are responsible for coordination and supervision of all MCH activities within the counties,
including townships and, through the townships, at the village levels.
1.7         The Medical Administration Department (MAD), of MOPH, is responsible
for developing policy and providing technical guidance for clinical and hospital care,
including MCH referral and emergency services at provincial, prefecture, county, and
township levels. County and township hospitals provide curative, obstetric, gynecological
and pediatric services. Village clinics provide these services at the lower level. Each level
supervises the activities of the next level below. In addition, the State Bureau of
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) runs a parallel network with TCM hospitals in most
counties and at higher levels. Many TCM hospitals also offer Westem obstetric and child
care services.
1.8         The Department of Disease Control of MOPH is the technical authority for
immunization, including the extended program of immunization (EPI) for children and
tetanus immunization of adults. This department is also responsible for policy and
technical support of county-level epidemic prevention stations (EPS), county health
education units, and epidemic prevention staff at lower levels. The Medical Science and
Education Department of MOPH is responsible for health workers' training, including the
MCH subject areas. A separate Endemic Disease Office provides technical guidance for
control of iodine deficiency disorders at the national level, but this program is incorporated
into EPS at the county level.



C. MAJOR ISSUES AND CONSRANTS
1.9         The regional disparity in health status is a serious problem in China (Table
1.2), and the quality of health services also varies greatly among the provinces and
counties in China. While many rich provinces of the coastal east and the major urban
areas offer sophisticated services to the population with health insurance provided by the
organized sector, many in the poorest and remote areas of the southwest and northwest
lack even preventive and basic curative services. As illustrated by Table 1.2 above, IMR
and MMR in poorer provinces are far greater than the national average. Similarly, there
are striking differences in nutritional status among provinces. For example, 33 percent to
45 percent of the rural children are underweight in Yunnan, Sichuan and Guangdong
compared to between 12 percent and 16 percent in Shandong, Zhejiang and Heilongjiang.
The main problems in the disadvantaged areas include inadequate staff training, equipment
and materials for prenatal and obstetric care; inadequate treatment of children with
respiratory and diarrheal diseases; virtual absence of tetanus immunization of pregnant
women; and inadequate programs to ameliorate micronutrient deficiencies.
1.10        Reduced resources, along with increased emphasis on cost recovery, have
started to affect maternal and child health adversely. Since health services are being asked
to recover an increasing part of their costs, there is a widespread tendency to emphasize
lucrative, and often unnecessary tests, drugs and clinical services at the expense of
preventive care. This problem is illustrated by the fact that, while the real per capita
health spending (from all sources-budgets, fees and insurance) rose faster (11 percent)
than economic growth (8.7 percent) between 1980 and 1988, budgetary spending declined
from 30 percent of the total health spending to 19 percent during the same period.
Shortage of funds to pay village doctors has already led to decreased coverage of some
essential programs, including EPI. Such budgetary limitations are considered to be an
important factor responsible for the lack of significant reduction in national IMR and MMR
in the 1980s despite high rates of economic growth experienced during this period.
1.11        Access to health services has become increasingly difficult for many poor
people since the introduction of financial reforms in the 1980s. Until the late 1970s, a rural
cooperative insurance system provided low-cost and subsidized health care to most of the
rural families. After the abolition of the cooperative health system, many rural families
do not have health insurance and they must obtain care on a fee-for-service basis. As a
result, even simple preventive and basic MCH care have now become out of reach for a
large number of peasants.
1.12        Functional coordination among various MCH  service providers is
unsatisfactory, resulting in duplications and gaps. For example, in most counties, both
county hospitals and MCH stations provide obstetric services, often in underutilized
facilities located close to each other. The current requirement that the health service units
must generate revenue to cover increasing parts of their expenditure has aggravated the
situation. This also distorts incentives, taking the service units away from preventive care
and leading to "over servicing" with costly care.



D. GOVERNmENT POLICY AND PROGRAMS
1.13        The Government is fully committed to improving the health status of the
mothers and children of China. In 1991, China signed the Declaration and the Plan of
Action of the World Summit for Children and in 1992 passed a National Program of
Action (NPA). NPA targets for the year 2000, compared to 1990, are to reduce infant and
under-five mortality by one third and maternal mortality by one half. It aims at reducing
moderate and severe malnutrition by one half. Its other goals include improved antenatal,
delivery and postnatal care for women, elimination of neonatal tetanus and iodine
deficiency disorders, eradication of polio, high breast-feeding rates, and improved
management of diarrhea and acute respiratory infections in children. While there is real
progress in implementing many of the programs initiated by the Government, the progress
in improving MCH has been significantly hampered by the declining level of resources
available for health care (see para. 1.10). The proposed project would significantly
improve the resource situation in the project areas (see para. 5.2).
1.14       In support of the Government's own efforts, several projects and programs
are being implemented under the sponsorship of a large group of external agencies,
including the Bank (see para. 1.15). Most notable in the widespread implementation of
MCH interventions in China is the 300-County Project which is being implemented in 300
poor counties in 27 provinces assisted by UNICEF, UNFPA, and WHO. That project
focusses on upgrading the technical skills of village and township staff as well as health
education and management improvement. The proposed Bank project would allow the
Government to achieve the NPA goals in about a further 300 counties of eight of the
poorest provinces.
E. BANK GROUP INVOLVEMENT IN THE SECrOR
1.15       Past Experience. The Bank Group involvement in China's health sector
began in the early 1980s and, to date, the Group has supported five projects and completed
two sector studies in health (in 1984 and 1990) and one in poverty alleviation (1992). The
Rural Health and Medical Education Project (Credit 1472-CHA), approved in 1984, was
completed in 1991 and a Project Completion Report (No. SecM93-680) was prepared in
July 7, 1993. The Rural Health and Preventive Medicine Project (Credit 1713/Loan 2723-
CHA) approved by the Bank in June 19, 1986 has been completed except for the vaccine
production component. Both these projects included activities to improve MCH care in
limited areas. Under these two projects, a total of 96 counties in 8 provinces and one
autonomous region were covered and both projects have been very successful. The
Integrated Regional Health Development Project (Credit 2009-CHA), started in 1990, also
includes programs to improve MCH care in 30 counties of three provinces. It provides
essential inputs but emphasizes improved regional planning and management. The
project's progress has been satisfactory. In 1991, the Bank approved the Infectious and
Endemic Disease Control Project (Credit 2317-CHA) to help control tuberculosis in twelve
provinces and schistosomiasis in eight provinces. The project is also progressing well.
A fifth project, the Rural Health Workers Development Project (Credit 2539-CHA),
became effective in November 1993. In addition, two other projects, the Medium-sized



Cities Development Project (Loan 3286-CHA/Credit 2201-CHA) and the Rural Water
Supply II Project (Credit 2336-CHA), also include substantial components to improve rural
health.
1.16         Our experience with previous projects has provided important lessons for the
preparation of the proposed project. While experience with a number of projects in the
sector has demonstrated that the Chinese agencies are fully capable of implementing
complicated projects with several components, the lessons specified in the Project
Completion Report 2/ of the first health project are still very pertinent. Specifically, the
design of the proposed project has paid particular attention to three major precautions
mentioned in the Completion Report. First, it would have well-organized and staffed
project management offices at all operation levels. Secondly, because of its innovative
features, clear guidelines were developed for the preparation and implementation of the
project. Thirdly, selection of medical equipment under this project were made only after
careful studies to determine their appropriateness.
1.17        Rationale for IDA Involvement. Consistent with China's recent priorities
and the Bank's emphasis on poverty alleviation, the Bank Group seeks to focus its health
sector activities mainly towards the poorest and most vulnerable sections of the population.
This is in line with the recommendations of the recent sector studies on health and
poverty.a/ The recent poverty alleviation report makes a strong case for investment in
matemal health. Also, the most recent health sector report recommends the restoration of
adequate public funding for primary health services to the poor. The Association is in a
position to increase much needed financial resources for MCH care, through the Credit as
well as through the increased domestic allocation for counterpart funding. Equally
important is the Association's role in directing the attention of the Government, at different
levels, to essential policy reforms. The main policy reforms expected to be carried out
under the project include improved access to health services for the poorest sections of the
population; improved MCH management through better functional coordination; and
increased commitment to preventive care.

2. PROJECT BACKGROUND
A. PRoJEcT DEVELoPMENT
Project Design
2.1         The proposed Comprehensive Maternal and Child Health (MCH) Project was
designed under two basic premises. First, the project should reduce maternal and child
mortality and morbidity in the poorest areas of China, to the maximum extent and in the
shortest time possible, applying techniques and methods that have proven effective for
widespread application.  Second, it should be economically and administratively
manageable and be replicable, in whole or in part, in other provinces in China.
2.2         A large number of projects, including research and demonstration projects,
have addressed various health problems of mothers and children in China and helped show
the possibility for substantial reductions in maternal and child mortality and morbidity.
The Bank's own experience under three previous projects (see para. 1.15) has
demonstrated such possibilities in relatively small areas but under more intensive
management and with varying levels of inputs and resources. On the other hand, the 300-
County Project (see para. 1.14) is being implemented successfully in very large areas, but
with more limited resources, focussing on upgrading the technical competence of health
workers at the grassroots, with emphasis on preventive care. In addition, multiyear studies
of childhood pneumonia and diarrhea in the late 1980s have shown that good case
management can significantly reduce mortality in China.  Another study in Henan
Province, from 1990 to 1992, showed impressive results in reducing maternal mortality.
2.3         The design of the proposed project has benefitted from these experiences in
China and from similar efforts elsewhere by focusing on priority health problems. A
comprehensive approach was chosen for widespread implementation of complete MCH care
mainly at the primary level but with active complementary support from higher levels
which would include basic preventive care, cost-effective clinical care and referral
services, upgrading of health workers' skills, improved MCH management and specific
measures to increase access of the poorest sections of the population.
Project Preparation Process
2.4         The preparation of this project was carried out with active involvement of
the health staff at the village, township, and county levels, the relevant technical
departments and bureaus at the center and provinces, and a number of external specialists.
In April 1992, initial discussions were held in Beijing with most line departments of
MOPH and the resident international agencies concerned with MCH. Following those



- 8 -
discussions, a project Identification Mission visited a number of villages, townships, and
counties in three provinces in September 1992. This was followed by the selection of the
first batch of four provinces (see para. 2.6) and the participating counties, field visits to
the other two provinces, and the organization of a series of workshops to carry out the
iterative process of project preparation. A Project Preparation Mission visited China in
July 1993 followed by the Preappraisal Mission in November 1993.
2.5          At the outset, two pilot counties from each of the first four provinces were
asked to prepare the first draft of the project proposals encompassing the needs of each
village and township as well as the county level, within broad guidelines developed after
the identification mission. The Bank missions, including several resident and visiting
consultants reviewed the draft proposals with Chinese officials and by visits of the pilot
counties. The project preparation process then expanded to cover all 155 counties in those
four provinces.  Each stage improved the earlier proposal and refined the project
preparation guidelines, through document reviews, field visits, and workshops. Finally,
MOPH officials and the Bank staff worked jointly in the finalization of this staff appraisal
report.
2.6         The project was designed to be prepared and appraised in two batches of
four provinces each from among eight of the poorest provinces of China (see para. 2.9).
The first four provinces were Guangxi, Shaanxi, Sichuan, and Yunnan and covered 155
selected counties, with a total population of about 67 million. 1/ The Bank staff worked
very closely with the national and provincial-level officials in the preparation and appraisal
of the programs in the first phase. The preparation and appraisal of the programs in
second four provinces-Gansu, Jiangxi, Nei Mongol, and Qinghai, with a total population
of about 32 million in 127 counties-are being carried out under MOPH's supervision,
following the procedures and guidelines developed in the first phase. The involvement of
the Bank staff would consist of providing advice and support to MOPH when requested and
reviewing and approving the project proposals. This process is consistent with IDA's
objective of developing local capacity to prepare and appraise good quality health projects.
Guidelines for project preparation and appraisal are summarized in Annex 16.
B. PRoJEcT AREAS
Selection of Project Areas
2.7          Selection Criteria. Since the main objective of the project is to improve
maternal and child health in the poorest areas of China, the most important criteria used
to select the project provinces were their MCH indicators, as measured by MMR and IMR,
supplemented by information on rural per capita income and the poverty level designation
1/    Two prefectures in Sichuan are counted as two counties although they are composed of 31 small
counties.



- 9 -
by the Central and Provincial Govemments.Z/ Another important factor determining
selection was the level of commitment of the concemed provinces and their readiness to
participate in the project. Finally, consideration was also given to the size of poor
population which the project would affect. The selection of counties followed the same
principles as those of the provinces but excluded those counties already covered under the
300-County Project or other MCH programs.
2.8         Project Size. Approximately one third of China's provinces exceed the
adjusted national average IMR of 35 for every 1,000 live births and the average MMR of
approximately 88 for every 100,000 live births. Even these national averages represent
unacceptably high figures if compared with those in the best third of the Chinese
provinces. Therefore, initially, this raised a strong desire to implement the project in a
large number of provinces. However, after careful consideration, it was determined that
the project resources would be spread too thinly to create a significant impact if it included
more than eight suitable provinces. Similar considerations were used in deciding the
number of counties, which were limited to about one third of the total number of counties
in each province.
Project Areas
2.9          The project would cover 30 counties in Guangxi; 35 counties in Shaanxi; 50
counties in Sichuan; 40 counties in Yunnan; 31 counties in Gansu; 31 counties in Jiangxi;
42 counties in Nei Mongol; and 23 counties in Qinghai. Compared to the national average
IMR of 35/1,000, MMR of 88/100,000, and household income of Y 709, the project areas
represent the poorest sections of the population. Comparison of the provincial and project
areas basic indicators are presented in Table 2.1.
I/    There are 331 centrally and 368 provincially designated poor counties in China which are eligible
for Government assistance. Jiangxi, Guangxi and Gansu have the greatest proportion of their
counties in the poor county list-67 percent, 58 percent and 57 percent, respectively. (Source:

3. THE PROJECT
A. PRoJEcT OBJECTIVES
3.1         The principal goal of the project is to assist the Government in reducing
maternal and child morbidity and mortality in the poorest areas of China. The specific
objectives are to:
(a)   improve the quality and effectiveness of maternal and child care, especially
that provided by primary health workers at villages and townships and by
referral levels;
(b)   increase access, affordability, and utilization of basic maternal and child
care; and
(c)   improve the planning, resource allocation, coordination, and management
of maternal and child care services.
B. PROJECT DEsCRWHON
3.2         The project would comprise four main components: (a) basic health care
delivery; (b) health workers' training; (c) improvements in MCH management; and (d) the
national-level component. Detailed descriptions of the project are in Annexes 2 to 5. A
summary is given below.
Basic Health Care Delivery
3.3         The project would improve the basic MCH care services at the village,
township, and county referral levels. Main activities would include maternal care,
including primary, referral-level and emergency care; child care, including immunization
and nutrition, management of acute respiratory infections and diarrheal diseases;
immunization against neonatal tetanus; health education, including the promotion of breast-
feeding and improved weaning practices; and other area-specific programs. The project
would finance essential equipment, limited rehabilitation of facilities, and program support
critical to improve the service delivery. Support for the improvement of basic health care
delivery at different levels is described below. The provinces would institute special
programs to help the poor increase their access to MCH care. Details of this component
are provided in Annex 2.



- 12 -
Health Workers' Training
3.4         The clinical skill level of the health staff is deficient in most of the project
areas. Funds are inadequate for regular in-service training, especially for the lower level
staff. There is also a need to review and upgrade the training programs.  The project
would improve the technical and managerial competence of all staff involved in MCH care
by establishing a system of regular refresher training which can be sustained and replicated
by the project provinces. Training activities are divided into short term (about one week)
and longer-term (3 to 6 months) courses and focus on improving health service skills,
especially MCH skills, and various aspects of management. Comprehensive packages of
teaching, learning, reference, and assessment materials would be developed, building on
the experience of earlier programs in China, notably the 300-County Project. The project
would finance development, improvement and production of training materials, trainers'
training, and also the cost of operating the training programs during the project period;
limited rehabilitation and expansion of the county-level training facilities and training
equipment. A detailed description of the health workers training program is in Annex 3.
Management Improvement
3.5         The project would improve MCH management at all levels, with three
objectives: (a) to improve the mechanism and skills for better planning and coordination
of MCH services; (b) to improve the quantity and quality of supervisory support between
levels; and (c) to improve the function and use of the existing management information and
surveillance systems for MCH. The project would provide training for staff at provincial,
prefectural, county and township levels in management skills relevant to their roles.
Institutions responsible for MCH services would be strengthened and management
procedures streamlined. Programs to improve the management information system and
operational research studies would be implemented at the central and provincial levels.
The project will finance expansion of administrative areas in MCH stations, supervision
vehicles and management related equipment, and the operating costs of increased
supervision, information system, evaluation and administration activities. (Further details
are provided in Annex 4!.
National Level Program
3.6         The role of the Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) at the national level is
very important in this project. Therefore, a financially modest National Level Program
would be included in the project and located in MOPH (see paras. 4.1 and 4.2). This
component would have the following specific responsibilities:
(a)   Project management and supervision, including implementation, monitoring
and compliance with progress reporting, procurement and other
requirements;
(b)   Coordination of technical and operational tasks of various agencies at the
national level and the provinces;



- 13 -
(c)   Preparatory activities concerning health workers' training, including the
formulation of clinical protocols, development and quality assurance of
training materials, and sponsoring major trainers' training.
(d)   Technical support for the provinces, for management improvement, health
education and operational research activities, and the implementation of
studies in areas of common concerns (see para. 3.7);
(e)   National level research and studies;
(f)   Preparation and appraisal of the MCH programs in the remaining four
provinces (see para. 2.6), including the formulation of the project
management manual; and
(g)   Dissemination of project experiences to other areas.
A detailed description of this component is in Annex 5.
3.7         Studies and Operational Research. MOPH is expected to organize and
oversee the implementation of a limited number (possibly, four or five) studies during the
whole project period. This includes a study aimed at improving functional coordination
of MCH service providers that would be common to several provinces (see para. 1.12).
Assurances were obtained at negotiations that MOPH would (a) not later than March 31,
1995, appoint consultants in accordance with IDA's procedures to carry out the study on
functional coordination of MCH services; (b) not later than March 31, 1996furnish to the
Association a time-bound action plan for the implementation of the recommendations; and
(c) thereafter, carry out the recommendations and the action plan, taking into account the
Association's comments. Assurances were also obtained that the Borrower would carry
out any other studies under the project only in accordance with proposals and terms of
reference approved by the Association.
Project Support at Different Levels
3.8         At the village level, the project would improve the effectiveness of MCH
services by providing equipment, training of village staff, and program support to carry
out increased activities in preventive public health programs such as health education,
nutrition, childhood immunization (including hepatitis B), tetanus toxoid immunization, and
iodine deficiency control measures; and clinical program such as care for pregnant women,
mothers and sick children. Regular supplies of drugs, vaccines and other consumables will
continue to be provided under existing arrangements.
3.9         At the township level, the project would finance limited rehabilitation of
MCH facilities; essential equipment; basic transportation; training of health workers; and
costs of implementing the project activities including MCH management in the townships.
At the referral (central) townships, the project would also provide additional equipment,
including operation facilities and equipment for newborn care, additional training and



- 14 -
emergency vehicles in selected cases. These inputs will support both direct health services
and management of the village level programs.
3.10        At the county level, the project would strengthen the technical assistance and
supervisory role of the MCH stations through training, limited improvements of physical
facilities, equipment necessary to improve their ongoing MCH care, and operating costs
for supervision and health education. The project would improve the MCH work of the
county general and TCM hospitals through limited repairs of physical facilities, provision
of essential MCH equipment, training (including trainers' training), and operating costs to
improve supervision. For the epidemic prevention stations (EPS), the project would fill
any shortages in the cold chain equipment and provide training and program support to
carry out tetanus immunization.
3.11        The province and prefecture levels would coordinate all project activities in
the province, including supervision and monitoring of project implementation, providing
technical guidance and, in some cases, clinical training to the lower levels. The project
would provide program support to help in the increased management activities, technical
assistance, training, and a limited amount of equipment and civil works where necessary.
3.12        Access to the Poorest. As stated above (see para. 1.11), inadequate and
declining access of poor families to essential clinical services has been a very alarming
problem in most parts of rural China. The inability of current programs to assist families
who cannot pay for these services contributes to high mortality and morbidity. To ensure
that benefits under the proposed project are also shared by the poorest, each project
province would establish a "MCH poverty relief fund" which would fully or partially
subsidize the health care for essential obstetric and pediatric inpatient and outpatient
services (see Annex 6!. The fund is expected to improve access and MCH service
coverage to at least the poorest five percent of each county's population and is expected
to provide a demonstration of the cost-effectiveness of such access to health services in
reducing maternal and under-five mortality and morbidity. The basic standards of the
poverty relief fund have been discussed and confirmed with each of the first-phase
province. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that each participating province would
establish a poverty relieffund designed to fully or partially subsidize essential obstetric and
pediatric services to the poorest families under arrangements and time schedule acceptable
to IDA. At least four provinces are expected to establish this fund by January 1, 1995.
3.13        Operational Research. Each province is expected to carry out a limited
number (two or three) of operational studies during the project period to test different
MCH interventions, such as those in epidemiological or health finance areas, or to test
certain initiative in small pilot areas. Methodologies to select the topics, to prepare the
terms of reference, and to choose the consultants have been broadly discussed with MOPH
and the provincial officials.  Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the
participating provinces would carry out operational studies in accordance with the
proposals and the terms of reference approved by the Association.

1998 and 1999; for civil works, 20 percent for 1994, 12 percent for 1995, and 10 percent
in 1996; for foreign expenditures, 1.2 percent for 1994, 2.4 percent for 1995, 3.2 percent
for 1996, 3.4 percent for 1997, and 3.2 percent for 1998.
3.16        Project Financing. The proposed credit of $90 million equivalent would
finance about 65 percent of the total project cost, including about $23.35 million in foreign
exchange. The participating provinces and counties would finance the balance of the
project cost. The financing plan is shown in Table 3.2.

3.17        The Government would allocate $1.69 million equivalent to the National
Level Program and $88.31 million equivalent of the proceeds of the Development Credit
to the provincial programs for 20 years, including a 5 year grace period, at a fixed annual
interest rate of 1.1 percent. The provinces would further allocate part of their proceeds
of the credit to the counties under similar terms. Project provinces would bear the foreign
exchange risk. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the Borrower would onlend
the credit proceeds to the provinces at not more than 1.1 percent per annum, for at least
20 years, including a grace period of 5 years; each province would make the proceeds
available to its counties on a grant basis or other terms whereby the counties would pay
interest at not more than 1.1 percent per annum for at least 20 years (including five years'
grace) and would not bear the foreign exchange risks; and each province would provide
adequate funding for project activities to be carried out both at the provincial and local
levels within the province.

4. PROJECT ORGANIZATION AND IMPLEMENTATION
A. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
National Level
4.1         Management and Coordination. The Ministry of Public Health (MOPH)
would be responsible for the overall direction, coordination and oversight of the
implementation of the project. To carry out these responsibilities, the Government has
established a Project Leading Group under the Chairmanship of the Minister of Public
Health and including the directors of MOPH departments of Maternal and Child Health
(MCH), Medical Administration, Disease Control, and Medical Science and Education,
the Endemic Disease Office, the Center for Health Statistics and Information and the
Foreign Loan Office (FLO). FLO, which was established specifically to help implement
other World Bank supported health projects, would act as the secretariat of the Leading
Group. FLO is well-equipped to coordinate and oversee the implementation of Bank-
assisted projects.  FLO would be responsible for all operational aspects of project
coordination, including progress monitoring and complying with procurement,
disbursement, audit, and other requirements. Assurances were obtained at negotiations
that the Borrower would maintain the Project Leading Group, with membership, terms of
reference and resources acceptable to the Association, throughout the project period.
4.2         The MCH Department is the most important participant in the proposed
project as most of the project activities fall under its responsibility. However, because of
its comprehensive nature, this project would also require active involvement of a number
of other line departments and offices at the Center as well as in the provinces. Therefore,
under the Leading Group, a Project Coordination Group has been established which is
chaired by the Director of FLO, with the Director of the MCH department as deputy, and
includes the heads of the Maternal Health and Child Health Divisions of the MCH
Department, and division chiefs from other relevant departments and offices of the MOPH.
To carry out the national level programs the Project Coordination Group would establish
a Technical Unit of 3 or 4 full-time staff. The Unit would also establish expert groups
from time to time to carry out specific tasks as assigned by the Project Coordination
Group. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that the Borrower would (a)
maintain throughout the project period the Project Coordination Group with membership,
terms of reference and resources acceptable to the Association; and (b) establish not later
than January 31, 1995, and thereafter maintain, a Technical Unit, to assist the Project
Coordination Group, with terms of reference, staffing and resources acceptable to the
Association.



- 18 -
4.3         Project Preparation and Appraisal. As discussed earlier (see para. 2.6),
the MOPH would prepare and appraise the maternal and child health programs in the
remaining four of the eight project provinces. The Bank's role would be quality control
and advisory support as well as to review and approve the project proposals prepared and
appraised by MOPH. The procedures to be followed to prepare and appraise the programs
in these four remaining provinces have been discussed fully with MOPH and are described
in Annex 16. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the provinces would be
eligible to participate in the project only when the Association has notified the Borrower
of its approval of the proposed programs. Assurances were also obtained on Project
Implementation Provisions under which the provinces would participate in and carry out
the project. Written commitment to those Project Implementation Provisions by at least
four provinces would be a condition of credit effectiveness.
Provincial and Prefecture Levels
4.4         Management and Coordination. The provincial organizations mirror those
of the Center. Each province has already established a Leading Group under a Vice
Governor and comprising senior representatives of the provincial finance and planning
bureaus and the heads of the departments and bureaus dealing with health. Each province
has a Foreign Loan Office in the Bureau of Public Health, and has established a Provincial
Project Office (PPO) headed by a project director, and a Technical Advisory Group.
Officials at the prefecture level will also participate in project coordination and supervision.
Assurances were obtained at negotiations that each participating province would maintain
the Leading Group, the PPO and the Technical Advisory Group throughout the project
period with membership, staffing and terms of reference satisfactory to the Association.
County Level
4.5         Present MCH Responsibilities. At the county level, MCH care is provided
by the MCH Station and other health service facilities. The Station is responsible for the
overall planning and supervision of MCH activities in the county; training of township and
village level MCH staff; health education; nutrition-related activities; handling of MCH
management information; and carrying out preventive activities and some clinical work.
County Epidemic Prevention Stations are responsible for immunization programs. County
hospitals provide full obstetric, emergency and pediatric cares, usually dealing with a
relatively high volume of high-risk deliveries. County TCM hospitals also offer MCH
care.
4.6         Project Coordination and Implementation. The bulk of proposed project
implementation is expected to take place at the county level and below. Each county
would establish a Project Leading Group of senior officials, including the county-level
planning, finance and health officials, under the chairmanship of the head or deputy head
of the county. Each county would also establish a Technical Advisory Group and a project
office. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the participating provinces would
cause each project county to maintain a Leading Group, a Technical Leading Group, a



- 19 -
Project Office headed by a project management officer and a training officer, with
membership, staffing and terms of reference satisfactory to IDA.
B. PROCUREmENT
4.7        Items to be procured and financed partly or wholly with credit proceeds
include civil works, equipment, vehicles, training, technical assistance, operation research
and program support. Civil works ($17.27 million) include new construction and
rehabilitation. Virtually all construction will be small, simple and inexpensive, scattered
over a very large area, mostly in remote counties, and carried out over a three-year period.
Therefore, all civil works estimated to cost $50,000 per contract or less, up to an
aggregate of $14 million will be procured on the basis of comparing quotations obtained
from at least three local contractors and community organization groups. Force account
procedures may be used for the construction and repair of township level facilities for
works estimated to cost less than $25,000 up to an aggregate amount not exceeding
$1 million. All other civil works, approximately totaling $2.27 million, would follow local
competitive bidding (LCB) procedures acceptable to the Association. IDA review prior
to inviting bids, contract award would be required for each contract estimated to cost more
than $300,000. The rest would be subject to random sample review by supervision
missions. Construction supervision will be organized by the construction engineering units
where construction is taking place. Standard bid documents prepared for China will be
used for LCB.
4.8         Equipment and Medical Vehicles ($28.62 million) would largely consist
of medical and teaching items. Most individual equipment items will be inexpensive but
in fairly large quantities while some items will be relatively advanced medical diagnostic
equipment but in limited quantities. Office equipment, including computers, will also be
acquired to support project management and offices to support improved MCH program
management. Goods procurement by the provinces will be consolidated centrally to allow
for LCB and ICB following IDA's Procurement Guidelines. Contracts estimated to cost
between $25,000 and $300,000 equivalent, in aggregate not exceeding $15 million, may
be procured through LCB procedures acceptable to the Association. Goods estimated to
cost less than $25,000 per contract, and in aggregate not exceeding $5.0 million, may be
procured through local shopping procedures under contracts awarded on the basis of
comparison of price quotations obtained from at least three eligible foreign or local
suppliers.  International suppliers may compete in these procedures.  Contracts for
proprietary items and items required for the purposes of standardization, subject to the
approval of the Association on a case-by-case basis, may be awarded after direct
negotiations with suppliers, in accordance with procedures acceptable to the Association.
Under ICB, local manufacturers would be eligible for a margin of preference in bid
evaluation of 15 percent or the prevailing rate of custom duty, whichever is lower.
4.9         Equipment and medical vehicles will be procured in phases spread over three
years with the bulk of the medical equipment procured during the first two years of
implementation. During the first year of implementation, 20 percent of the equipment will
be procured. The next phase of equipment procurement will occur at about the time of



- 20 -
completion of the civil works, at which time 60 percent will be acquired. In the third
year, all the remaining equipment will be procured. Equipment would be grouped, to the
extent possible, to form packages in excess of $300,000 for each contract. Proposals from
the provinces would be forwarded to FLO for bulk purchases by the China Machine
Corporation which has experience with ICB procedures using the Association's
Procurement Guidelines. FLO will be responsible for procurement under LCB procedures
acceptable to IDA and use other procurement procedures including local shopping. For
contracts exceeding $300,000 each, prior IDA review of bid evaluation reports and "no
objection" would be required before contracts could be awarded and signed. For other
contracts, random sample review of bid evaluation reports and contracts would be carried
out by supervision missions.
4.10        Equipment lists have been prepared by the participating provinces and
reviewed by MOPH and the Association. The standardized equipment list according to
health service levels is detailed in Annex 7.
4.11        Technical Assistance ($3.47 million).  Technical assistance under the
project includes both consultant services at the national and provincial levels and contracts
for carrying out operational research. Employment of local consultants, to the extent
possible, will be encouraged, whenever such expertise exists in China. Consultants will
be hired in accordance with principles and procedures satisfactory to the Association on
the basis of the Consultant Guidelines published by the Bank in August 1981. Contracts
with firms of $100,000 equivalent or more and contracts with individuals of $50,000
equivalent or more will require prior Association review or approval of budgets, short
lists, selection procedures, letters of invitation, proposals, evaluation reports, and
contracts.
4.12        Training ($27.43 million local and $0.78 million overseas). Local training
activities will be carried out by existing institutions on the basis of the training program
as described in Annex 3. Approximately 90 percent of the local training costs will be
financed by IDA and the remaining will come from counterpart financing. Overseas
training plans are described in Annex 14 and will be reimbursed at 100 percent by IDA.
4.13        Program Support ($47.98 million). Based on the MCH service package,
65 percent of the program support will be provided by IDA subject to standard Association
reimbursement requirements. Program support includes medical and other supplies,
transportation, accommodations, meals and allowances for nongovernment employees.
C. DISBURSEMENTS
4.14        The proposed Credit of SDR 61.9 million ($90 million equivalent) would
be disbursed over a five-year period as follows:
(a)   30 percent of the costs of civil works;

(b)   100 percent of CIF expenditures of imported equipment, 100 percent of
local expenditures (ex-factory cost) and 40 percent of local expenditures for
other items procured locally;
(c)   90 percent of expenditures for local training and 100 percent of expenditures
for overseas training;
(d)   100 percent of consulting services and of operation research studies, and;
(e)   65 percent of incremental recurrent expenditures.
4.15        Statement of expenditures (SOEs) would be used for reimbursements of less
than $300,000 equivalent against contracts for civil works and equipment, and for training
and incremental recurrent expenditures; this limit is justified based upon experience, and
the nature and complexity of the project. Consultants' contracts of $100,000 equivalent
or less for firms and $50,000 equivalent or less for individuals would also be made on the
basis of SOEs. Documentation supporting the SOEs would be retained by FLO in MOPH
and the PPOs in the provinces and made available for random sample review by IDA
supervision missions.
4.16        The estimated disbursement forecasts closely follow the disbursement profile
for human resource projects in China (Annex 12).
4.17        Special Account.  A Special Account with authorized allocation of
$6 million, based on four months' average expenditures, would be established in a bank
satisfactory to the Association. Applications for replenishment of the Special Account
would be submitted monthly or whenever the Account has been drawn down by about
50 percent of the initial deposit, whichever occurs first.
4.18        Retroactive Financing. To ensure the timely start of the project, retroactive
financing of up to SDR 5.5 million would be available for eligible expenditures, incurred
after March 1, 1994, covering consulting services, training and incremental recurrent
expenditures.
D. AccouNTs AND AuDrrS
4.19        Separate accounts showing expenditures for project activities would be
maintained by each province. Assisted by the MOF, a total project account would be
maintained by the FLO in two books, one for project expenditures for each province and
the other by category of expenditures for the whole project. MOF would maintain a
separate account showing amounts expended under SOEs for each fiscal year and would
maintain the Special Account. Project accounts would be audited by the State Audit
Administration (SAA) and/or its local offices in accordance with standard practices in
China which have been found acceptable to IDA. Assurances were obtained that the
Borrower would submit to the Association, within six months after the end of each fiscal



- 23 -
year, an annual audit report, by independent auditors acceptable to the Association,
including an audit of the Special Account and a separate opinion on the SOEs.
E. PROJECr MONITORING AND EVALUATION
4.20        Implementation Schedule. The proposed project would be implemented
over a five year period with an additional one year for the completion of payments and full
withdrawal of Credit proceeds. The project is expected to be completed in June 2000 and
closed on June 30, 2001. A project completion report would be submitted by FLO to IDA
within six months of the closing date. A chart showing the implementation schedule is in
Annex 11.
4.21        Performance Monitoring. Baseline surveys in all project counties have
been carried out during the project preparation which has provided reliable basic
indicators. To monitor the progress of the project and to evaluate the project outcome,
three sets of performance indicators have been prepared, as explained in Annex 13. They
are (a) input indicators; (b) process/output indicators, which would measure project
activities; and (c) outcome indicators (health status). The provinces and FLO would ensure
that these indicators are analyzed at the agreed frequency.
4.22        Progress Monitoring and Reporting. The MOPH would coordinate project
implementation and monitor its progress. Each province would be required to provide
semi-annual progress reports to the MOPH, including the performance indicators (see para.
4.21) as appropriate. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that the MOPH would
prepare and furnish to the Association semi-annual progress reports, including national-
level and provincial activities, in accordance with the performance indicators satisfactory
to IDA.
4.23        Project Evaluation. Evaluation of the project progress and adopting
necessary corrective actions are important elements of the project. Therefore, in addition
to the regular project and progress evaluation activities, a special mid-term evaluation
would be carried out after two and two-and-half years of project implementation, jointly
by the Borrower and IDA to review the objectives, design, and implementation of the
project and to recommend any necessary modifications. Assurances were obtained that,
by June 30, 1997, the Borrower would submit to IDA the project's mid-term evaluation
report, carried out jointly with the participating provinces, indicating the project's progress
from the inception and proposing any measures to further the objectives of the project.
4.24        Supervision Schedule. Project supervision would be a joint responsibility
of MOPH and IDA. Regular supervision of all aspects of the project is an important
function of the Project Coordination Committee. Because of the complexity and the large
area covered by the project, IDA's supervision requirement is also expected to be higher
than most health projects in China. A supervision plan is given in Annex 15.



- 24 -
F. SPECIAL IMPACTs
4.25        Impact on Environment. The project would have no significant impact on
the environment. It would, however, train health workers to promote health education,
to improve sanitation, and to protect the health of the villagers from any local
environmental effects.
4.26        Impact on Women. Since the project's main objective is to improve the
health of women and children, its impact on the population of the project areas is expected
to be very high. As described in para. 5.1, the project would directly benefit 1.5 million
women each of the five years of the project with maternal care with substantial impact on
maternal mortality and morbidity. In addition, 15 million women would benefit from the
projects activities. The net effect would be better health, increased productivity and other
benefits to the whole family. The project is also expected to benefit disproportionately
large number of women health workers through training and improved job performance
since more women are in MCH work.
4.27        Poverty Impact. The project is specifically directed towards 100 million
of the poorest population of China. Approximately seven and a half million each of
pregnant women and children would be the most direct beneficiaries, through their
increased coverage by improved quality essential preventive and curative services. This
would directly improve their quality of life by reducing mortality and morbidity, which
would in turn provide an improved setting for increased productivity and living standards.



- 25 -
5. BENEFITS AND RISKS
A. BENEFS
5.1         The proposed project is expected to benefit about 100 million of the poorest
people from among the economically most disadvantaged counties of some of China's
poorest provinces. The most direct beneficiaries are women during and after pregnancy,
children under five years of age, and women of child-bearing age. The number of
pregnant women and newborn beneficiaries is expected to be about 1.5 million each per
year or a total of 15 million during the five years of the project. In addition, some 15
million women of child-bearing age would benefit from health education, improved family
planning advice and other care, including tetanus toxoid immunization.
5.2         The main benefits of the project would be the sustainable reduction in the
very high maternal and infant/child mortality and morbidity in the country's poorest
regions. The project would also support improved feeding practices, that should lead to
improved nutritional status of women and children, and special programs to alleviate
micronutrient deficiencies. The project also includes specific interventions designed to
improve planning and management capacity of the national, provincial, and county
governments to prepare and implement similar comprehensive projects and to replicate
them in other parts of the country. Furthermore, the project addresses the problem of
recurrent cost, periodic in-service training, operational costs of preventive programs and
program management and, at least in part, the problem of inability to pay for essential
clinical services, all of which are expected to demonstrate to government the value of
maintaining such recurrent costs.
B. SUSTAINABHITY AND REPLIcABIxrIy
5.3         Sustainability. The proposed project would require an additional allocation
of approximately $0.18 million over five years in each county as counterpart financing, or
about $0.1 (Y 0.8) per capita per year. Total project base costs come to about Y 1.9 per
capita per year, including the longer-term investment costs such as civil works and
equipment. This compares to Y 36 per capita of total health expenditures in China in
1988. Although the government health expenditures in 1989 totaled Y 6.4 per capita or
only 2.5 percent of total government expenditures, the government's primary health care
objectives for the year 2000 would raise the health expenditures to 8 percent of government
budgets. Therefore, the recurrent costs of the project are well within the government's
targets, even for poor counties.
5.4         Replicability. The proposed project is built upon experience gained in a
large number of different projects implemented in various parts of China with which



- 26 -
Chinese officials are well acquainted. The training programs under the proposed project
are patterned after the ongoing 300-County Project which is implemented in different parts
of each province participating in the proposed project. Additional expenditures required
for replication are not excessively high as indicated in para. 5.3. Two likely constraints
are inadequate technical and managerial capacity; and the lack of political will to allocate
the critical minimum amount of resources required for the improvement. The project
would significantly improve the technical and managerial capacity at all levels and this
should adequately strengthen the capacity to replicate the program in other counties.
Considering the additional resources, as stated in para. 5.3 above, the additional burden
is not very large and, it is expected, that the positive effects of the proposed project would
provide important impetus to persuade the provinces to allocate the resources necessary to
replicate the project elsewhere. The annual per capita project cost will be equal to
24 percent of the 1989 per capita government health budget or 0.6 percent of the 1989 total
government budget.
C. RISKS
5.5          There are two main risks in this project. Firstly, there is a risk that the
provinces will not take special steps to ensure that the poorest population benefits from
improved services. While the proposed project is not expected to fully resolve the present
health financing problems in China, each project province will be required to institute a
plan to support the poor in a manner satisfactory to the Association (para. 3.12).
Secondly, there is a risk that the central and provincial officials will not be able to oversee
the implementation and coordination of the project activities.   The institutional
strengthening already made at each level, closer monitoring by IDA supervision missions,
and the strengthened Unit in FLO (MOPH) should minimize this risks.

MATERNAL AND CHILD ]HEALTH IN CHINA
A. HEALTH SECTOR IN CEHNA 1/
Demographic Transition
1.          Demographic Aspect. China's population was estimated at 1.13 billion in
1990 in which 27 percent are under 15 years old while 9 percent are over 60 years old.
The country's population is projected to grow annually at 1.3 percent till the end of the
century. In 1991, crude birth rate (CBR) was estimated at 22 per 1,000 population while
crude death rate was estimated at 7 per 1,000 population.
2.          Role of Family Planning. The dramatic decline in China's population
growth is reflected in the projected stabilization of the net reproduction rate (NNR) to a
level of one by 1995. This will have been achieved despite an increase in the proportion
of women in child bearing age from 45 percent in 1965 to 56 percent in 1991.
Contraceptive prevalence rate among married women of childbearing age was estimated
to be 72 percent in 1989, one of the highest rates in the world, and achieved through very
strong state commitment.
3.          Health Status. Given the level of China's development, the health status
has improved remarkably in the last 30 years. Life expectancy at birth, one indicator of
a country's health status, was estimated at 43 years in 1960, and by 1990 it was 69 years.
In comparison, life expectancy in 1991 among high and middle-income economies were
77 years and 68 years, respectively, while among low-income economies it was 62 years.
In 1975 China's mortality rate for children under 5 years was 85 per 1,000 and this was
halved to 43 in 1990. This 1990 rate was slightly better than the combined rates for the
established market economies (EME) and formerly socialist economies (FSE) of Europe
in the 1960s. Another health indicator, loss of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs)
reflects a society's overall burden of illness and premature deaths. For 1990 it was
estimated that China lost 178 DALYs per 1,000 population compared with 117 for EMEs,
168 for FSEs, 574 for sub-Saharan Africa, 240 for other Asia and islands, and the world
average of 259 per 1,000 population.
4.          Health Strategy. China's exceptional accomplishments in health were
achieved to a large extent through development of a comprehensive network of health
services and an emphasis on prevention through mass campaigns. Every county has a

Health.



- 30 -                         ANNEX 1
general hospital, an epidemic prevention station (EPS), a maternal and child health (MCH)
station, and often a county health school and a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM)
hospital. Each township has a small hospital of about 15 beds which provides preventive
and curative services to the population. Although many inadequately trained "barefoot
doctors" left health work in the early 1980s, as of 1990, about 86 percent of the villages
had a health clinic and many of the remainder were covered by different health outreach
programs.
5.          Problems and Constraints.2/ In spite of great success in the past years
in the health sector, there are still problems to be addressed in order for China to complete
the first health care revolution. The total "medically vulnerable" population (below age
five and over age 50) is expected to increase from a ratio of 38 percent to 60 percent of
the working age population by the year 2025. Apart from the growing size of this group,
health benefits must be realized in the poor areas of the country. The ongoing economic
restructuring, the escalation of health costs and the growing emphasis on curative medicine
have made the poor more vulnerable through reduced access to quality basic health
services. Health financing will have to be reformed to avoid reduction in the health
coverage of the most disadvantaged groups and to ensure that the present achievements are
maintained and spread equitably throughout China.
Nutrition
6.          Average food consumption in China compares well with other developing
countries. The National Nutrition Survey of 1982 found that the average energy intake per
capita was 2085 calories (102 percent of the recommended daily allowance or RDA) and
67 grams of protein (92 percent of RDA). In general, therefore, the average Chinese diet
is not deficient although pockets of malnutrition exist in poorer areas, especially among
women and children. Available data indicate that the proportion of infants with low birth
weight (LBW) in the period 1985-87 ranged between 6 and 9 percent.j/ Estimates from
the decade 1980-90 give the prevalence of stunting (low height-for-age) among children
aged 2-4 years as 41 percent while wasting (low weight-for-height) for children between
12 and 23 months was 8 percent. A sample survey in nine provinces in 1987 found over
24 percent of children between ages four and five years were underweight based on the
WHO standards for this age while 39 percent of the same age group were stunted. The
survey results by province also indicate children in rural areas were nutritionally worse off
than their urban cohorts. The data suggest that the nutrition problems are related to poor
weaning practices and possibly to reduction in growth caused by infectious disease.
Micronutrient deficiencies affect certain sections of the population. The prevalence of
anemia in pregnant women until the 1980s was estimated at about 25 percent while iodine
deficiency is known to affect a significant portion of the rural population.

B. MATERNAL AND CIL  HEALTH STATUS
7.          China's MCH status far exceeds that of most developing countries and
compares favorably with middle income countries shown in Table Al.l below. These
rates were attained with much lower expenditures on health than the richer countries.
China's health expenditure in 1990 was only 3.5 percent of her GDP while the EMEs were
spending on the average 9.2 percent of GDP in the same period.

8.          The favorable national MCH statistics obscure serious regional disparities
as indicated in Table A1.2. In 1990, available estimates for IMR ranged from a low of
11 per 1,000 live births in Beijing to a high of 94 in Tibet. MMR in 1989-91 ranged from
a low of 40 per 100,000 live births in Beijing to as much as 170 in several southwest
provinces.

BASIC HEALTH CARE DELIVERY COMPONENT
Introduction
1.          The project would improve the basic maternal and child health (MCH)
services at the village, township, and county referral levels by supporting a number of
program activities under this component. The main objective of the component is to
improve efficiency and effectiveness of the current MCH care delivery system in poor rural
counties of China and to reduce maternal and under-five mortality and morbidity. The
project would finance health workers' training (Annex 3), equipment (Annex  ), civil
works (Annex 8), and program support to carry out the program activities. The program
support would include incremental budgetary supplements to carry out health services in
the areas of health education, promotion of breast-feeding and improved supplemental and
weaning food practices, tetanus immunization for neonatal tetanus control, and support for
iodine deficiency control. At present, funds are inadequate to carry out these basic MCH
service activities effectively.
Program Activities
2.          The following program activities will be improved in the project provinces
and counties:
(a)   Health education
(b)   Primary level maternal care
(c)   Emergency communications and transport
(d)   Referral level maternal care
(e)   Management of common perinatal problems
(f)   Management of acute respiratory infections (ARI) in children
(g)   Management of diarrheal diseases in children
(h)   Tetanus toxoid for neonatal tetanus control
(i)   Promotion of breast-feeding and improved supplemental and weaning food
practices

(j)   Support for routine childhood immunizations
(k)   Support for iodine deiiciecncy control
(1)   Others-Province specific or to be developed
3.          Health Education. Well planned and targeted health education is a cost
effective strategy in preventive care, leading to improved knowledge of families to prevent
and manage illnesses at home and better use of local health services. With the high level
of contact between families and health providers either already achieved or planned under
the project, the main health education approach will be through interpersonal
communication during these contacts, with additional special activities, such as meetings,
campaigns, and mass communication for specific programs listed in para. 2 above. The
project will finance the development and production of health education materials at the
national and provincial levels.
4.          Primary Level Maternal Care. This includes prenatal, labor and delivery
and postnatal care for normal pregnancies. The project will emphasize the use of iron
supplements to prevent and treat anemia in pregnancy, the use of high risk criteria for
early identification of women needing special care or referral level deliveries, careful
monitoring of labor to identify complications needing emergency referral, and improved
primary level management of common complications.
5.          Emergency Communications and Transport. In addition to transferring
high risk pregnant women for delivery at the referral level, reduction in maternal mortality
will require timely management of unexpected complications in all women.
6.          Referral Level Maternal Care. WHO has identified key "first referral
level" obstetrical interventions (such as operative deliveries and blood transfusion
capability) that are crucial as a backup to primary services in the case of complications that
require a higher level of resources and skills. Based on the WHO guidelines, the project
counties have selected referral level facilities, balancing needed capability and proximity
to the population. All county hospitals, and the few county MCH stations which already
provide this level of service will be strengthened. Where needed according to the
guidelines, one or more central township hospitals per county were selected to provide
referral level services but in many cases they will require improvement in facilities,
equipment and staff training before they can function in this capacity. On average, one
referral level facility will be available for each 200,000 population under the project.
7.          Management of Common Perinatal Problems.  Prematurity, neonatal
asphyxia and birth trauma account for a high percentage of under five deaths. Improved
management of labor, delivery and care of the newborn, both at the household and hospital
level can greatly reduce the mortality from these conditions.
8.          Management of Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI) in Children. ARI
is the major cause of death in infants and children under five. Improved recognition and



- 35 -                          ANNEX 2
standard case management protocols can reduce mortality from these conditions. Standard
WHO case management guidelines for both primary and small hospital levels have already
been adapted for use in China and will be used in this project.
9.          Management of Diarrheal Diseases in Children. Diarrheal diseases are
still a leading cause of under five mortality in project counties. Standard WHO case
management guidelines which are simple and highly cost-effective treatments that have
been introduced in several previous projects will be used in this project.
10.         Tetanus Toxoid for Neonatal Tetanus Control. Up to now, China has
used training of village birth attendants in clean delivery as the sole method for control of
neonatal tetanus. However the rate of clean delivery remains low and tetanus, formerly
thought to be uncommon, is a major cause of neonatal death. The project will promote
improved delivery practices, but also provided tetanus immunization of all eligible
reproductive age women in all counties with neonatal tetanus rates of one or more per
thousand as determined by the baseline survey. This activity is in accordance with China's
national plan of action for elimination of neonatal tetanus. The two approaches are
expected to reduce neonatal tetanus mortality to less than one per 1000 live births. In
addition to the regular funding, project funds will specifically finance:  (a) all the
preparatory activities for the tetanus toxoid campaign, including the cost of planning and
advocacy meetings; (b) the registration of eligible women; (c) the cost of vaccine,
supplies (needles, syringes, sterilizations); and (d) the labor cost of the village vaccinators
during the mass immunization and the subsequent "mop-up" immunizations.
11.         Promotion of Breast-Feeding and Improved Supplemental and Weaning
Food Practices. Although breast-feeding rates in rural areas are high, inappropriate
weaning practices lead to a rapid decline in the rate of growth faltering in Chinese children
between six and 24 months of age. The project will focus on programs to educate parents
regarding the need for exclusive breast-feeding for at least four to six months followed by
appropriate supplemental foods. Special attention will be given to education on foods and
practices to reduce childhood anemia and rickets and supplementation programs for vitamin
A may be introduced. In addition, funds will be used for activities to establish "Baby
Friendly Hospital" status in the obstetrical units at all county and township levels.
12.         Support for Childhood Immunization.  The expanded program  on
immunization (EPI), which protects against six common childhood diseases in the first year
of life, has been one of the most successful primary health care programs in China, due
to a high level of political commitment and funding support of transport and storage of
vaccine, and payments to village doctors to immunize children. Although high levels of
immunization were reached by 1990 even in poor counties, the program has since suffered
from decreased attention and financial commitment. Under the project, the county
government is required to maintain or restore financial support for EPI at least to 1990/91
levels, enough to maintain high immunization rates. Project funds will only be used to
purchase cold chain equipment if present supplies are inadequate.



- 36 -                         ANNEX 2
13.         The government has initiated routine use of hepatitis B immunization in
newborns, but families must pay for the vaccine, limiting its availability to the poor. The
project encourages provincial and local governments to make this immunization available
at reduced price or free to those who cannot pay.
14.         Support for Iodine Deficiency Control. China is committed to elimination
of iodine deficiency disorders by the year 2000. This project will build on the work of a
UNDP/UNICEF supported iodine deficiency project that provides training and technical
support to the county level in salt and iodine deficiency monitoring and in promotion of
family use of iodized salt. The project will also fund the routine annual surveillance of salt
iodination and iodine deficiency in those counties without a surveillance system, in
accordance with the revised national program.
15.         Other Health Services. All provinces plan to include support for better
family planning counselling under the project. Yunnan and Sichuan provinces have also
specified the treatment of common gynecological infections and the correction of late
complications of delivery (uterine prolapse and obstetric fistulas) as health services to be
supported by the project. There is provision for additional health service interventions to
be added during the implementation of the project, subject to agreement during progress
reviews.
Essential Services Package
16.         Each county in the project is expected to work to achieve high levels of good
quality coverage for each of the following health services. This means that all health
facilities and health workers at each level in the county will follow standard case-
management guidelines for their level (as indicated in project training materials), and that
services will be organized to achieve the highest possible coverage of the entire county
population. The essential services package includes:
(a)   Maternal Care
(i) Prenatal care with special emphasis on health and nutrition
education, iron/folate supplementation to prevent and treat anemia,
tetanus toxoid immunization, and improved identification and
management of high risk and complications.
(ii)   Labor and delivery care with special emphasis on improved
management referral of complications to reduce maternal and
perinatal morbidity and mortality.
(iii) Postnatal care
(iv)   Tetanus toxoid for child-bearing age women following the
National Plan of Action guidelines promulgated by the government.



- 37 -                         ANNEX 2
(b)   Sick Child Care
(i)   Management of acute respiratory infections in children (para. 8).
(ii)   Management of diarrheal diseases in children with special
emphasis on ORT and feeding (para. 9).
(iii)   Newborn resuscitation and management of sick neonates (para.
7).
(c)   Well Child Care
(i)   Nutrition interventions through nutrition education on breast-
feeding and weaning foods. Counties are strongly urged to include
routine vitamin A supplementation and periodic deworming,
especially for children being seen for other reasons (para. 11).
(ii)   Routine childhood immunization through the Expanded Program
of Immunization (para. 12).
(iii)  Iodine deficiency control through iodine status monitoring (para.
14).
17.         During project implementation, other priority health services may be added
to the above list if suitable strategies and materials are developed. Two possible areas are
'clinical diagnosis and presumptive treatment of gynecological infections, including
sexually transmitted diseases" and "health education for the prevention of childhood
injury".

HEALTH WORKERS' TRAINING COMPONENT
Introduction
1.          Issues in health workers' training. In most rural areas of China there is a
fairly complete network of small hospitals for each township and most administrative
villages have one or more village health staff (either village doctors, health workers, or
birth attendants). The number of staff at referral level (central township and county)
facilities for clinical care and for management support are also usually adequate.
2.          The health care practices and skills of health staff at all levels are
problematic. Treatment of common illnesses such as pneumonia or diarrhea, is often
inappropriate. Complications and high risk conditions in pregnancy, such as anemia, are
often not managed correctly, monitoring of labor is rarely done in township hospitals and
referral of emergencies is not planned in advance. Health education skills and knowledge
of correct messages are poor. The managerial skills of township, county and higher level
supervisors and managers are limited.
3.          Planning and funding of regular in-service training is inadequate, especially
of lower level staff. Suitable training courses and materials at all levels are seldom
available. The most common training method is lectures, often based on simplifications
of university texts, which are usually inappropriate for lower level trainees and often out
of date. Training is generally not closely linked to actual work performance and training
for the trainers and supervisors is rarely carried out.
Objectives
4.          The objectives of the training component are (a) to improve the competence
of health workers at each level in their tasks and responsibilities for maternal and child
health; (b) to strengthen the capacity of the provinces to plan, organize and deliver
appropriate training; (c) to establish a system of in-service and refresher training which is
sustainable by the provinces after completion of the project; and (d) to identify and
strengthen mechanisms for dissemination of lessons from the project experience in training
to nonproject areas.
Strategies
5.          The component will focus primarily on in-service training, building on the
experiences of earlier projects in China, particularly that of the "300 County" Project
which is currently being implemented by MOPH in 27 provinces with support of UNICEF,
UNFPA, and WHO. Training will be provided for all health workers with MCH

responsibilities covering clinical, preventive, communication and decision-making skills,
and for supervisors, managers and other support staff in the appropriate skills for their
particulaw roles. The largest groups of traineees will be village workers, and the MCH, out-
patient clinic, obstetric and pediatric staff of township, central township, county and
traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) hospitals and the county MCH station. Other smaller
categories include the staff of epidemic prevention stations (EPS) who are responsible for
immunization, control of iodine deficiency and health education, the teachers of county
health schools and the staff responsible for statistics and information management.
6.          The trainers will be trained to use modem  training methods, stressing
competency-based, problem-oriented, and participative learning. Comprehensive packages
of teaching, learning, reference, and assessment materials will be developed by selected
working groups to enhance training effectiveness. Close links between in-service training
and supervision of the workers will be established, through involvement of the supervisors
as trainers, through team training for workers in geographic areas, and through assessment
of staff competence and service improvement in the work situation by the supervisor after
training. Training content and methods will be adjusted and improved according to this
assessment.
Training Program Activities
7.          The project's training activities are divided into short term (about one week)
and longer-term (3 to 6 months) courses. Training content is divided between health
service skills and various aspects of management. For health service skills, the short
courses, for groups of 15-20 staff, will cover village, out-patient and out-reach work,
disease control, and health education. This training will be organized on an annual basis
throughout the project, reaching on average all village workers and about half of concerned
higher level workers each year. (It has been estimated that this is the proportion of
workers with MCH responsibilities.)
8.          Within the short course stream, much of the training will be delivered to
mixed groups of health workers from a particular facility (such as township hospital) or
geographic area, in order to improve understanding of each other's roles and build team
cohesion in service delivery and problem solving. This type of training is very important
where service effectiveness depends on referral between levels and feedback of information
for patient follow-up, or on division of work to improve service coverage.
9.          The longer-term health service courses will be clinical placements of 3-6
months in designated hospitals, for improving competence in clinical procedures and the
care of inpatient and emergency cases. This training will be taken by 4-6 staff (doctors
and nurses) from each township, central township, county and TCM hospital, and 6-10
from each county MCH station, once each during the project. Some provinces will also
give longer term basic training to new village MCH workers.



-40 -                            ANNEX 3
10.         The training for management improvement, both short term and longer-term,
will cover different aspects of program management and supervision for staff with these
responsibilities (see Annex 4!.
11.         Training of Trainers (TOT). Training of trainers will be organized on a
two or three step basis, originating from a peak group of master trainers for each of the
major training activities, drawn from the province and prefecture levels. These master
trainers will be responsible for training the second tier at county level and for helping
county staff to train township level trainers.
12.         The project design stresses the overlapping nature of training from level to
level, with shared or team teaching between the levels. Trainers from province or
prefecture will assist county staff in training at the township. Since the training ability of
the township staff is usually very low, county level trainers must go to the townships to
help teach at every courses given to village workers. This requires that the township to
village training courses be spread over time, instead of all townships giving the same
village training all at once. It also requires that sufficient county level staff receive TOT
so they can help with this work.
13.         Content of Training. About 20 topics have been identified for the training
program in the three major areas of child care, obstetrics and gynecology (including family
planning) and communication and management. The high priority topics in each area were
selected by a workshop of provincial staff and regional university representatives in
September 1993 and cover the prevention and management of the common causes of
serious illness and death in mothers and children, as well as health education, and
interpersonal communication (Table A3. 1). The topic list may be enlarged or priorities
changed according to experience during the project.
14.         Development and Production of Training Materials. The package for
each major subject area will comprise learning objectives, (based on expected job
performance and standard case management protocols for each level), curriculum, training
guidelines, essential content, reference materials, assignments and worksheets, print and
audio-visual training aids, evaluation and assessment tools, criteria for certified competence
and guidelines for supervision. Suitable materials from other projects, with revision or
supplementation as indicated, or new materials to be developed in the first two years of
the project will also be incorporated in the training packages.
15.         Pre-requisites for Training Activities.
(a)   Drafting of Service Protocols and Standards. The project will support
development of standard case management protocols for the management of
common health problems at both the primary and referral level. Training
materials and programs, and evaluation of service quality will be based on
these protocols. Protocols will be prepared by national/provincial teams and
incorporated into training materials. Similar guidelines will be developed
for MCH program management.

(b)   Preparation of Clinical Training Bases.  For the 3-6 months clinical
upgrade training, suitable hospitals at the county or prefecture level will be
identified as clinical training bases and then p--pcr^l to Prsm-e tt thlwt
meet agreed criteria to conduct this type of training. In each province one
or more provincial level institutions will be selected, and special training in
clinical teaching techniques will be provided to a core of master clinical
trainers. They will in turn provide this training to the staff of the training
bases. The curriculum, training materials and assessment methods for
clinical upgrade training will be based on those prepared under the 300-
County project, with modifications as needed.
(c)   Management Training. For training in MCH program manag',ment, the
same elements of course development, materials development and training
of trainers (TOT) will be carried out, using a suitable institutional base, to
design a practical, relevant training experience for the county, prefectural
and provincial managers concerned, and aiming for capacity to continue this
training beyond the project period and in other parts of the country.
(d)   Prior to full-scale project implementation, short orientation and review
workshops will be arranged for government and community leaders and for
heads of the health agencies at township, county, and province levels.
Organization and Implementation
16.         National Level. National support for the provincial training initiatives will
be provided, particularly to assist the development of provincial capacity, with training of
the provincial master trainers, writing of clinical protocols, curriculum and materials
development, quality control and overall supervision, monitoring and evaluation. The
national level will also take part in analysis of the training experience and dissemination
of results and guidelines to non-project provinces. This support will be provided through
suitable universities and other professional institutions, supplemented with external
technical assistance, particularly in the initial stages.  The national support will be
coordinated through the project's proposed technical unit (Annex 5)
17.          Below National Level.  Management of the training program  at the
provincial, prefectural, and county levels, will be the responsibility of designated full time
staff of the MCH bureau in cooperation with the project office (PPO). Annual training
plans will be made. Indicators for assessing progress and outcomes of the training have
been decided (see Annex 13) and the MIS of the MCH program will be modified to ensure
that the required data is collected, and routinely collated and analyzed at county level, with
summaries forwarded to prefecture and province. Assessment of the effectiveness of
training of individual workers will be the responsibility of line supervisors (who will be
trained for this). Special investigations of particular aspects of the training program will
be conducted from time to time, when problems arise and at the mid-term stage of the
project. In the second half of the project, cost-effectiveness studies will be carried out to



- 43 -                            ANNEX 3
assist in defining the budget implications for sustaining a system of in-service training after
project completion.
18.          Program  Inputs.  The project would finance (a) the development and
standardization of the clinical protocols as a prerequisite of the training activities; (b)
revision or new development and production of training materials; (c) operational costs of
the training courses; (d) cost of management, monitoring, and evaluation requirements; (e)
some institutional improvement for designated clinical training bases including limited civil
works construction for classrooms; (f) limited classroom audio-visual equipment for
training; and (g) training of trainers (TOT).



-44 -                           ANNEX 4
MANAGEMENT IMPROVEMENT COMPONENT
1.          The project will address the shortcomings in management expertise and
procedures which are an important constraint to improving MCH service delivery in China.
This intervention recognizes that the major approaches for improving health status of
mothers and children do not require expensive, sophisticated technology or highly
specialized staff. Rather the need is to implement key basic strategies that already exist
and are known to be effective.
2.          Issues in MCH Health Service Management:
(a)   Lack of Coordination. At the county level and above, responsibility for
preventive and curative health services for women and children are shared
between MCH stations, epidemic prevention stations, and general and TCM
hospitals.  Planning tends to be work unit-oriented rather than health
problem- or population-oriented, often with little communication or
coordination between units having complementary or overlapping roles.
Similar coordination problems occur among staff of different categories at
the township hospital and even at the village level. No higher level unit
takes full responsibility for comprehensive planning of the MCH program.
(b)   Lack of Management Skills.  Managers and supervisors often lack the
skills needed to improve their programs within the resources they have or
could obtain. Most have not undertaken management training of relevant
content and methodology for their work.   Many are unfamiliar with
procedures for quality assurance, for assessing service coverage, for
evaluating the health knowledge or attitudes of the population, or for
estimating the resource and productivity implications of alternative service
arrangements. They may be inexperienced in critical aspects of personnel
management such as supervision, performance appraisal and on-the-job
training.
(c)   Deficiencies in Collection, Presentation and Use of Information. The
current management information and surveillance systems do not provide all
the information needed, in appropriate format or frequency, to support
managers in their problem identification and resource allocation tasks.
Managers often do not know how to recognize errors in or to interpret data
that is available. Reporting and feedback of information is often not done,
or not presented for easy interpretation and use by the managers.



-45-                            ANNEX 4
(d)   Insufficient Resources for Management.   Although the numbers of
management level staff are usually adequate, their level of activity is often
very low due to lack of funds for supervision and monitoring visits, for
meetings or for other operational needs. Equipment needs for management
include transportation and basic office equipment.
3.          Objectives.  The overall purpose of the management improvement
component is to strengthen managerial support for the MCH program in order to contribute
to improved coverage, quality and utilization of MCH services, and thus reductions in
maternal and under five mortality and morbidity. The component objectives are:
(a)   to improve mechanisms and skills for the better planning and coordination
of health services related to mothers and children;
(b)   to improve the quantity and quality of supervisory support between levels,
and;
(c)   to improve the function and use of existing management information and
surveillance systems for MCH.
4.          Management improvement activities: In order to achieve the objectives,
MCH management improvements will be targeted at two levels. At the highest level, a
National component (Annex 5) will carry out the technical and operational coordination of
the project. This will include formation of management expert groups under the project
technical unit, who will investigate management issues at all levels, design improved
methods, and introduce these to the project provinces by training or other means. At the
provincial and lower levels, the project will support the following activities:
(a)   Training will be provided for staff at provincial, prefectural, county, and
township levels in management skills relevant to their roles. The three
broad areas of management to be covered are skills in planning/coordination
(including program coordination, resource allocation, financial planning,
etc.), supportive supervision (both of direct service health workers and of
lower level managers), and the management information system (focusing
on better use of available information and collection of what is most needed
for program management). This training will be developed with appropriate
national and international technical assistance, using workshop and field
based experiential learning methods, drawing on the past experience of
MOPH and core health management training institutions in the country.
(b)   Improved Coordination of MCH Services. Multi-sectoral leading groups
and technical groups set up under the project, with representation from
planning, finance, MCH, medical administration, and epidemic prevention
institutions, will coordinate those programs providing services for mothers
and children. County MCH stations will be responsible for monitoring the
overall health status of women and children in the county, reporting to the



- 46 -                          ANNEX 4
health bureau and leading and technical groups and coordinating the
planning for improved services.
(c)   Strengthening of existing management procedures within the MCH
program, including planning, implementation and review of services,
procedures for management of personnel, finances and information,
procedures for community liaison and the introduction of mechanisms and
processes to monitor and improve service quality (also referred to as quality
assurance, total quality management (TQM) or continuous quality
improvement (CQI)). The development of these procedures and associated
standards and guidelines will be closely linked to the management training
initiatives.
Supervision and review of activities of lower service levels by higher levels
will be one means in which MCH management can be strengthened.
Regular interactions among the staffs of different service levels will allow
experiential learning and enhance managerial capacities in MCH health
management and coordination.
(d)   Increasing the Area Orientation of MCH Services.  At each level,
especially township hospitals, health service managers will be encouraged
to take responsibility for all persons living in their catchment area, not only
those presenting for service, to measure service quality and effectiveness
according to coverage of and use by the families in the area, and to reorient
service activities and adjust staff duties on this basis.
(e)   Operation Research. Special studies at the provincial levels with assistance
from qualified institutions and specialists in the areas of epidemiology,
health services utilization, and health financing. All of these are geared
towards improving health service management in China.
Each province will carry out 2 or 3 studies during the project period. The
first phase provinces have selected a number of possible topics but they need
further definition. Details of each operational research studies, including
the qualification of the specialists and the institutions who would carry out
the studies, would be submitted to IDA for its "no objection."
5.          Program Inputs. The limited construction at the county MCH station, and
all construction at prefecture and provincial levels will be to support their administrative
and supervisory functions (Annex 8). Equipment for administration and information
management, such as typewriters and computers, will be provided and each county MCH
station will receive a vehicle for supervisory work (Annex 7). Furthermore, since
recurrent budgets under the current system are almost exclusively for salaries, funds are
inadequate for management activities.  The project, under the "program  support"
expenditure category, will support the following recurrent costs.



- 47 -                          ANNEX 4
(a)   The cost of regular supervisory activities from province, prefectural, county
and township levels to lower levels, including labor, transport, meals and
accommodations costs where appropriate.
(b)   Periodic meetings for village staff at township level and for township staff
at county level for management purposes. Costs of management meetings
at higher levels.
(c)   The costs of special studies, meant to supplement routine information
reports.
(d)   Consumable supplies for the operation of the information system, such as
data forms and computer disks.
(e)   The costs of project evaluations and project administration.

NATIONAL LEVEL PROGRAM
Introduction
1.          Three major project points require special attention from the National level.
Firstly, the project will be implemented by a large number of provinces at several service
levels. Secondly, the comprehensive nature of the project necessitates the involvement of
many departments and bureaus at different levels of government. Finally, the Ministry of
Public Health (MOPH) must have the capacity to carry out the preparation and appraisal
of the project in four remaining provinces as well as to ensure replication of successful
experience to nonproject areas. Therefore, a financially modest national-level component
is included in the project to establish and strengthen capacity of the central government to
carry out the following specific functions:
(a)   Project management and monitoring;
(b)   Coordination, including interdepartment and interprovince;
(c)   Health workers' training program;
(d)   Technical support to the provinces;
(e)   National level operational research and studies;
(f)   Preparation and appraisal of the project's second phase; and
(g)   Dissemination of project experiences.
Organization of National Level Program
2.          Overall direction of the project is the responsibility of a Leading Group
chaired by Honorable Minister of Public Health and comprising directors of the MOPH
departments of Maternal and Child Health (MCH), Medical Administration, Disease
Control, and Medical Science and Education, the Endemic Disease Office, the Center for
Health Statistics and Information, and the Foreign Loan Office (FLO). FLO will provide
the secretariat to the Leading Group. Below the Leading Group, a Project Coordination
Group will be responsible for overall planning and implementation of the national-level
project activities, including the common training activities, consolidation, interpretation and
feedback of management information, management of special operational research studies,
and technical assistance for the provinces. The Group is chaired by the director of FLO
with the Director of MCH Department as its Deputy Chief, and consisting of the division



-49-                            ANNEX5
chiefs of Maternal Health and Child Health Divisions of the MCH Department, and
division chiefs from other MOPH departments and offices.
3.          The Project Coordination Group will establish a small technical unit of 3 or
4 professional staff who will be recruited from an institution (probably a University) that
will be contracted to carry out the detailed planning and day-to-day management of the
training activities [para. 6(c)]. The Technical Unit will receive institutional support from
the contracting agency as well as from outside as required. They will be responsible for
preparation of clinical protocols and appropriate training materials and for necessary
workshops. They will also assist provinces in the preparation and implementation of other
key MCH-related intervention, including the improvement of MCH management and health
education.
4.          The Project Coordination Group will review and approve each segment of
the program which has been prepared by the contracted technical unit, including the
relevant budgets. It will also be responsible for quality assurance review of the training
materials produced for the project. The Group will request the Bank's comments on all
training modules developed for the project.
5.          Administrative, financial, and logistical requirements of the project will be
the responsibility of FLO, which will also provide facilities for planning international
technical assistance and overseas studies (training) for the center and for assisting the
provinces in this respect.
Inplementation of Key National Level Activities
6.          The national-level activities, which will be carried out by the Project
Coordination Group assisted by the Technical Unit and the FLO are as follows:
(a)   Project Management and Supervision. The FLO will be responsible for
the monitoring and supervision of the project implementation and to ensure
the compliance of procurement, progress reporting and other requirements.
Specific activities to be carried out under the central component would
include the following:
(i)   Management Information. Operationalization of the MIS including
the collection and processing of the agreed indicators for the project.
Information from the provinces will be forwarded annually in
standard format to the Center for Health Statistics and Information
and FLO for analysis of project inputs, expenditures, and process
indicators. Reports of the review will be fed back to the provinces
and forwarded to relevant departments of MOPH to monitor progress
and for planning of future activities. The project activities will then
be evaluated and adjustments made in accordance with the project
guidelines and resources.



- 50 -                         ANNEX 5
(ii)  Supervision Visits. Supervisory visits from the center to the project
areas will be used to assist the provinces to improve their project
implementation.
(iii)   Mid-term Review. The project mid-term and completion reports to
be prepared and submitted to the World Bank.
(b)   Coordination.
(i)  Intraministry Coordination.   Coordination of planning and
implementation of activities of various MOPH departments.
Although the MCH Department will have the main role, several
other line departments will also be involved in project
implementation.
(ii)  Interprovincial Coordination. Sharing and dissemination of issues
and experiences among project provinces and carrying out common
tasks efficiently and economically.
(iii)  Interagency Coordination. Coordination of activities with 300-
County Project and among other externalinternal agencies like
UNICEF, UNFPA, WHO, World Bank, SPC, and Ministry of
Finance.
(c)   Health Workers' Training Program. The National-level Component will
carry out the following key activities related to the training program, mainly
through assistance from the technical unit:
(i)  Formulate Clinical Protocols. Standard MCH clinical protocols
will be developed at the national level, with provincial participation.
These protocols will form the basis of project training initiatives and
be used for supervision and performance assessment (Table A3. 1,
Annex 3). These clinical protocols, covering preventive and curative
care, will be prepared by local experts with previous experience in
preparation of similar protocols for the 300-County Project, with
some initial external technical assistance. Drafts of the protocols
will be field tested before finalization. The process will commence
immediately after the project is appraised.
(ii)   Develop Training Materials.  Based on the clinical protocols,
packages of suitable training materials will be developed,
incorporating materials (revised if necessary) from the 300-County
Project, other programs implemented in China, the village doctor's
upgrading training from MOPH and relevant directions and guidance
issued by the Medical Administration and Education Departments.
An expert group will review all existing materials from other



- 51-                           ANNEX 5
relevant sources with some initial international assistance. They will
produce training packages consisting of texts and teaching aids,
teacher guides, etc. The provinces will be responsible for bulk
reproduction and distribution of these materials to all provincial
county and township trainers.
(iii) Develop Training Skills. A series of training of trainer (TOT)
classes will be sponsored by the Center in the project provinces,
primarily to train provincial master trainers and to ensure the desired
standard is maintained in the transfer of new knowledge and skills
to the lower levels (Annex 3).
(d)   Technical Support for the Provinces.
(i)   Support Management Improvement. A key input at the national
level is the development of new initiatives and technical assistance
for management improvement to strengthen MCH management skills
at provincial and prefectural levels and supervisory skills at county
and township levels. Main interventions are expected to include:
management training; strengthening of supervision capability; and
improvement in management information system. To advance these
goals the Project Coordination Group will establish a team of experts
from appropriate institutions in China, including those of project
provinces. This team will identify training needs, develop training
materials, and assist the provinces in establishing MCH management
training in a designated institution in the province.
(ii)   Health Education Initiatives.   A  team  will be established
comprising experts from various health education institutes, including
those of project provinces, and experts from university departments.
This team will assist provinces to develop and implement health
education programs.  The team  will also provide support on
research, evaluation, and training to provinces.
(iii)   Operation Research. Assist and advise provinces in designing and
implementing individual operational research studies that would be
carried out by the provinces. The central unit will endeavor to
arrange domestic and external technical assistance to the provinces.
(e)   National Level Research and Studies.  In addition to the operational
research studies at the individual provinces' levels, certain studies can only
be carried out efficiently at the central level and are described below.
(i)   Coordination of MCH Functions.  The project has included a
study to review, analyze and recommend efficient method of
functional coordination of the responsibilities among various county-



- 52 -                          ANNEX5
level agencies dealing with MCH, including those performed by the
county MCH stations and the county hospitals. The research will be
designed and carried out by a Chinese research institute with
assistance from international experts.
(ii)   Other Studies. A number of other studies, to benefit multiple
provinces, could be considered either financed under the project or
through other resources. One study that has been identified is the
operational research in the use of the risk-approach management in
a comprehensive program of maternal and child health. Others
could be developed during the project implementation.
(f)   Project Phase Preparation and Appraisal. The FLO will be responsible
for coordinating the preparation and appraisal of the programs in the
remaining four project provinces in the project. A major part of this work
is the preparation of the Project Management Manual (PMM), based on
documents and materials developed during project preparation workshops,
including the existing county and provincial guidelines, and the internal
management regulations and procedures agreed upon with the Bank. This
manual will be used for project implementation in the first four provinces
and to guide project preparation as well as implementation in the remaining
four provinces.
(g)   Dissemination of Project Experience. Dissemination and replication of the
successful project activities in other parts of the country is an essential task
of the central component.  The Center will issue technical reports,
newsletters, arrange demonstration visits, and employ other means of
communications to publicize project progress.

BASIC HEALTH SERVICES FOR THE POOREST
Introduction
1.          The purpose of the MCH poverty relief fund (PRF) is to improve access to
essential clinical health services for the poorest families in the project provinces, and
thereby help in reducing maternal and under five mortality. Although the fund is not
expected to completely solve the problem of financing essential health services for
disadvantaged families, it can make a substantial impact and will provide experience in this
approach to improving health in poor counties. Improving financial access for the poorest
will work synergistically with the other major project strategies of improved service
quality, and directly funded public health services and health education programs.
2.          Target Population Size and Identification. Although the proportion of the
population that cannot use essential MCH services due to inability to pay varies among
counties, the MCH poverty relief fund under the project is only required to cover at
minimum the poorest five percent of pregnant women and children under five in each
county. A higher proportion may be covered if circumstances allow. The poorest families
can be identified through existing procedures established for the use of local civil affairs
and poverty alleviation offices in carrying out their programs.
3.          Health services covered by the fund include those judged to be the most
cost-effective in reducing maternal and under five mortality and morbidity. The five
service categories are routine maternal care, hospital delivery for high risk pregnancy,
management of serious obstetric complications, outpatient treatment of serious childhood
infections (special emphasis on pneumonia and diarrhea), and inpatient treatment of severe
childhood illnesses. Within each service category standard treatment guidelines as
introduced under the project training component will be used to ensure that essential
services are covered in a cost-effective manner. The list of services covered may be
modified based on experience.
4.          Estimated costs of the fund would be based on the population covered, the
rate of subsidy for services in the covered population (100 percent versus a sliding scale),
the number of target pregnant women and children in the population, the rate at which the
target women and children are expected to require the services covered, and the estimated
cost per case. It is estimated that funds equal to about 0.1 yuan per capita of the entire
county population per year is enough to cover the poorest five percent of pregnant women
and children. This is the minimum amount that each county PRF will provide each year
of the project. Eligibility and coverage of subsidized services will be modified as
experience on actual costs is gained.



-54 -                          ANNEX6
5.          All funds for the MCH poverty relief fund will come from government
sources, with sharing of costs between county, prefectural and province levels. The money
allocated for the PRF would not be part of the project cost. Full funding is required over
the life of project and unused funds in one year should be used to expand coverage rather
than to reduce government obligations.
6.          Management of the MCH Poverty Relief Fund. The fund shall exist as
a special account managed by the county project office. Criteria for identification of poor
families will be established by the province and county levels, with actual identification
taking place at the village and township levels. Pregnant women and children under five
of the poorest families will be informed of the services they can avail free (or partially
subsidized), and educated on what these include and when to seek them. Health providers
will be educated in PRF procedures, standard treatment guidelines and records to be kept,
and will be reimbursed by the county project office for essential services provided to
eligible women and children.
7.          Supervision, Reporting, and Evaluation. The county project office will
regularly visit a sample of poor families to check on registration of eligible individuals,
service coverage, and reporting accuracy. At minimum, annual visits will be made by the
province/prefecture level. Annual reports from the counties to the provinces will allow
calculation of rate of eligible persons being registered, rate of usage and average cost of
each service type by subsidy level, mortality rates, and changes or suggestions for changes
in fund operations. Summary reports will be forwarded to the national level. Evaluation
of the fund will focus on coverage, correct usage, content of services, costs, effects on
mortality, and administrative feasibility.
8.          Preparations, Start-up, and Initial Operation. The provinces and counties
will promulgate the specific services covered, review the standard treatment guidelines and
their expected costs, and recommend for record keeping and reporting to the national level.
Each of the four first-phase provinces would provide its detailed plan to the Association
by October 31, 1994 and implement its plan by January 1, 1995.
9.          Sustainability. It is expected that if, after five years operation, the MCH
poverty relief funds can show a substantial cost-efficient impact on service utilization and
mortality for those covered, many or most county governments will be willing to continue
to provide funds after the project, or even expand the fund eligibility and service coverage.

STANDARDIZED PROJECT EQUIPMENT
Introduction
1.          The list of maternal and child health (MCH) care equipment was developed
with two objectives in mind. The first objective was to prepare a guide which the counties
and provinces could use in preparing proposals for various levels under this project. The
second objective was to start a process to help the Government to eventually standardize
basic equipment lists for maternal and child health services throughout the country. A
fundamental principle applied was that an absence of basic minimum equipment can
weaken the effectiveness of health services and, at the same time, procurement of
ineffective equipment can be wasteful and even hazardous. It is, however, understood that
any standard list should have enough flexibility and should be adjusted whenever fully
justified. This project equipment list was prepared based on discussions among the Bank's
mission, ministerial staff, and external technical consultants. The mission recognized that
this list differs slightly from the standard ministry equipment guidelines. To achieve the
second objective, it is the intent that during project implementation, a revised ministerial
guideline will be finalized for nationwide use.
2.          There are two lists of equipment:  (a) essential equipment list and (b)
optional equipment list. The standard lists for various service levels are given in Table
A7. 1.  Each facility is expected to have a complete set of essential equipment
recommended for that level. If for some reason, a given facility will not carry out its
normally designated functions, it will not need all of the essential equipment in the
standard list and its equipment plan will be modified. The optional equipment items are
those which a health facility requires to do additional MCH services or procedures over
and above those specified in the project activities. These items can be considered under
the project based on their appropriateness and cost-effectiveness. The appropriateness of
a piece of equipment must take precedence over its cost-effectiveness.
(a)   Appropriateness Criteria
(i)   The clinical activity is appropriate for the level or institution.
(ii)   The technology of the equipment can produce information to realize
the desired outcome.
(iii)   The technology is appropriate for the level of service.



- 56 -                          ANNEX 7
(b)   Information needed for Cost-Effectiveness
(i)   Number of cases per year;
(ii)   Cost of the equipment and its required associated supporting
facilities;
(iii)   Cost of training the users; and
(iv)   Cost of operation, maintenance and related consumable.
Standard Equipment
3.          As a reference to first phase project provinces, and to facilitate the
preparation by the second phase provinces, essential equipment lists were developed for
each service level for the clinical MCH services, training and management components of
the project. These lists were based on the recommendations of the Ministry of Public
Health (MOPH) and officials from provincial health bureaus, the lists prepared by
UNICEF for use in the 300-County Project, recommendations of WHO for essential
obstetric functions at first referral level, and the suggestions from a number of external
specialists.
4.          In quantifying their requirements under the project, the provinces and
counties took into account currently available equipment. The project will ensure that all
service units either already have or will procure all "essential" items listed for that
particular service level. A mechanism for review and modification of the standard
equipment list, and for approving procurement of equipment not in the list is provided.
The proposals will be submitted to MOPH and the Bank for concurrence. Only upon
agreement by MOPH and the Bank will the changes be made and funds from physical
contingencies allotted for the additional procurement.
Equipment Under the Project
5.          The project equipment proposals were submitted by the project provinces
and counties and discussed in detail with the national level and the Bank mission. In
certain cases, proposed optional equipment were included only after the proponents made
their justifications (para. 2) in furtherance of the project's objectives.  "Optional
equipment" may (a) represent items that were requested for one type of facility found only
on the essential or optional list of another facility and (b) items not on any recommended
list but were added upon justification by the provinces. In cases where these have been
accepted, the provinces assured the Bank mission that the functions of the institutions
involved would warrant use of such equipment.
6.          The total cost for equipment for the different levels are summarized in Table
A7.2 for each province.

CIVIL WORKS
Introduction
1.          Although adequate capacity exists in most current facilities to carry out the
clinical work of the project, many buildings are in poor condition and unattractive to
patients. In order to improve the quality of MCH services and increase the utilization of
the existing health facilities, limited rehabilitation and construction of labor, delivery and
obstetrical wards or other related clinical services will be supported by the project. These
civil works constructions are essential requirements in the conduct of MCH activities
including training. Civil works construction at the provincial and prefectural levels will
be to support the training and management improvement requirements.
2.          General guidelines agreed upon by the Bank and the participating provinces
in civil works constructions are as follows:
(a)   New construction and rehabilitation will only be funded by the project if
these will improve the quality of MCH services and support the
administrative and teaching areas;
(b)   New construction and/or rehabilitation will be limited to a maximum of
300 m2 per county except that Sichuan (which has very large county
population) could include up to 500 m2;
(c)   Project funds will only be used to finance construction from the township
level and above. Village level construction or rehabilitation will be the
responsibility of the local community.
3.          Specific Guidelines. Level-specific guidelines are as follows:
(a)   Township Level
(i)   New construction or rehabilitation of existing rooms will be funded
if they will lead to improvements in obstetric services.
(ii)   Delivery rooms and obstetric wards should be clean and well-heated
and well-lighted so they are suitable places for work and attractive
to patients.



- 60-                           ANNEX 8
(b)   Central or Referral Township Hospitals
(i)   This level construction expenditure will be for renovation to
rehabilitate existing facilities to provide suitable lighting, water
supply, heating, and hygienic walls and surfaces for operating areas.
(ii)   Funds will also be provided to meet routine maintenance of newly
constructed or rehabilitated buildings.
(c)   MCH Station
(i)   Conditionality of funding:  Project funds can only be used to
improve preventive and support services.
(d)   County Hospital
(i)   New construction will be funded if existing facilities cannot be
rearranged to meet project objectives.
4.          The civil works constructions' physical requirements and their corresponding
cost are detailed in Table A8. 1.

PROJECT PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
1.          The indicators selected for monitoring and evaluation are intended to help
health managers to focus on actions that will be effective in meeting the MCH program's
objectives, to assess progress in implementation and identify problem areas in a timely
manner, so that corrections and adjustments can be planned. The indicators also provide
information necessary for the Association to monitor progress in project implementation
and evaluate the impact of the investment in relation to the project's development
objectives.
2.          Three sets of indicators will be used to monitor the implementation of this
project: input indicators, process/output indicators, and outcome indicators. The data will
be collected through current reporting mechanisms, modified if necessary, and from some
additional periodic surveys and studies. Detailed arrangements for collection, processing
and reporting of the selected indicators will be decided at the Project Launch Workshop
(see Annex 15).
3.          Input indicators will track planned resource inputs such as fund
disbursement, technical assistance (staff-months), enrollment and time (staff-months) in
training programs and procurement of goods and civil works.
4.          Process/output indicators will enable the program managers and the Bank
to assess annually the activity and utilization patterns under the three project components.
Eight indicators will be tracked to assess the Basic Health Care Delivery and Management
components:
(a)   antenatal and postnatal contact rates;
(b)   "new method" delivery rate;
(c)   home delivery/hospital delivery ratio;
(d)   incidence of low birth weight (collected through surveillance points);
(e)   coverage of tetanus toxoid immunization (for women of childbearing age or
pregnant women);
(f)   coverage of Immunizations (EPI), tetanus, polio;
(g)   breast-feeding rate at four months; and



- 72 -                          ANNEX 13
(h)   number of supervision visits from county to township, township to
village, compared with target.
5.          Eight indicators will also be tracked under the Health Workers' Training
Component, four for short courses and four for longer-term training:
Short Courses
(a)   number of trained trainers available compared with target;
(b)   number of training courses held compared with target;
(c)   number trained compared with target; and
(d)   number (percent) of trained staff with satisfactory case management
observed during field assessment by supervisor six months after training.
Longer-term Training
(e)   number of designated clinical training bases meeting agreed criteria
(compared with target for the year and cumulative);
(f)   numbers completing training to a satisfactory standard compared with target;
(g)   number (percent) of facilities with enough clinically trained staff compared
with target; and
(h)   number (percent) of trained staff with satisfactory case management
observed during field assessment by supervisor six months after training.
6.          Outcome indicators will track change in health status of mothers and
children, improvements in which constitute the overall development objectives of the
project. The indicators selected are considered to be sensitive to the project interventions
(although also affected by other influences) and will be available through routine
information systems or special surveys:
(a)   infant mortality rate (IMR),
(b)   maternal mortality rate (MMR),
(c)   under 5-mortality rates (U5MR),
(d)   neonatal tetanus mortality rate (NTMR), and
(e)   neonatal mortality rate (NMR).

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND OVERSEAS STUDIES
Introduction
1.          International technical assistance and overseas studies will be provided to
expose the MOPH departments and project provinces to good modem practice in (a)
matemal and child care and (b) MCH service management including the optimum training
of appropriate personnel.
2.          Consultants and institutions will be sought experienced in development of
MCH program in developing countries which have similar maternal and child care
problems to those of China. They may be able to maintain contact in the future for the
benefit of sustaining the improvements expected to be brought about by the project.
Principal Technical Assistance Needs
3.          The provinces have strongly identified four areas in which international
assistance will be required, namely, (a) safe motherhood initiatives; (b) modern programs
for care of well and sick children; (c) MCH program management; and (d) the training and
performance evaluation of health staff responsible for care of pregnant women and children
age 0-4 year.  Other areas including MCH related health education, management
information systems, perinatal medicines, and health financing for benefit of the poorer
families have also been identified as important international TA needs.
International Technical Assistance Inputs
4.          International Technical Assistance. The project will require 28 person-
week of international consultant service for the central component and 20 weeks for the
provinces.
5.          Study Tours.  Study tours including at least one delegate from each
province and one from the Center, with an interpreter if necessary. The subject areas will
be those identified in para. 3. Each study tour should be of 3 or 4 weeks duration and the
countries to be visited should include both developed and developing countries of special
interest or acknowledged capability.
6.          Overseas Training/Fellowships. About 30 study fellowships of varying
duration have been requested, six for the Center and the remainder for the provinces. The
subject of study cover a wide field and it will be important to spread the experience and
knowledge gained as orderly as possible throughout the project provinces by means of
presentation at technical meetings, in-service training programs, conferences, publication
of reports and direct technical assistance by the returned student to those who may need
it.

duration specified would allow two fellowships.
Overseas Study Tours
7.          The needs of most topic areas mentioned by the provinces and the national-
level component are satisfied by the following four study tours (one per year from 1995
to 1998):
(a)   Safe motherhood initiatives in countries which can demonstrate programs
relevant to China;
(b)   MCH program management in rural areas including care of the poor;



- 81-                         ANNEX 14
(c)   Community-based child care programs in rural areas; and
(d)   Modem MCH training programs for health providers at rural and semi-
urban levels including evaluation methods.
8.    While excellent approaches may be found in the USA, Europe, and other developed
countries, it will be important to include developing countries which have successfully
addressed MCH needs similar to those in the project. Each study tour should be three to
four weeks in duration and should comprise at least one delegate from each province and
one from the center.

PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
IN ADDITIONAL PROVINCES
Introduction
1.          This project was designed to be prepared and appraised in stages for greater
flexibility and manageability as well as to develop local capacity to prepare and appraise
good quality projects. Therefore, it was decided that the project would be prepared and
appraised in a total of eight provinces, divided into two phases of four provinces each.
The first phase covered four provinces, namely, Guangxi, Shaanxi, Sichuan, and Yunnan;
and the second phase is expected to cover another four provinces, namely, Gansu, Jiangxi,
Nei Mongol, and Qinghai. The preparation and appraisal of the programs in the first four
provinces were closely supervised by the Bank staff. The programs in the remaining four
provinces are being prepared and appraised by MOPH, closely following the experience
of the first phase. The role of the Bank staff in the second phase would be to review and
approve the project proposals to ensure project quality and offer technical assistance to
MOPH whenever necessary.
2.          The size of the first phase program is roughly two thirds of the total project
and is expected to use roughly two thirds of the IDA credit, leaving about one third for the
remaining four provinces. MOPH expects to start the project implementation in the four
second phase provinces approximately six months behind the first four provinces. The
purpose of this annex is to outline the procedures expected to be followed in carrying out
the project preparation and appraisal after the first phase.
Project Preparation Process and Agreed Conditions
3.          The project preparation steps and conditions are as follows:
Step A:     Selection  of Provinces  and  Counties.    The  final four
provinces-Gansu, Jiangxi, Nei Mongol, and Qinghai-were selected
under the same principles and criteria as applied for the first four.
They were selected from among those with the highest maternal
mortality rates (MMRs), the highest infant mortality rates (IMRs),
and the lowest per capita income. The list of counties is shown in
Table A16.1 below.
Step B:     Baseline Survey. A baseline survey in all project counties were
conducted following the experience of the first phase provinces but
with shorter and more relevant questionnaires agreed with the Bank.



- 84 -                        ANNEX 16
Step C:     First Workshops. In order to familiarize the second phase project
provinces with the general design and procedures for project
preparation, representatives of all four provinces attended both the
pre-appraisal and appraisal meetings between the Bank, MOPH and
first phase provinces in November 1993 and March 1994
respectively, and discussed project procedures with the MOPH.
Step D:     Provincial Feasibility Plans. In February, 1994 the second phase
provinces submitted indicative plans to the MOPH with plans and
project costs per county, local government commitment and
availability of counterpart funds.
Step E:     County Magistrates' Workshops. Workshops were held in each of
the second phase provinces with representatives of the MOPH (FLO
and line departments) (April-May 1994). The workshops:
(a)   reviewed the national policy and commitments;
(b)   introduced the objectives, conceptual framework, and
procedures for preparation and implementation of the
proposed project;
(c)   provided   specific  guidelines  for  county  and
prefecture/provincial proposal preparation based on phase one
materials;
(d)   provided guidelines for calculation and presentation of county
and prefectural/provincial cost tables and;
(e)  invited provinces and counties to suggest modifications in the
project design based on their local situations.
Step F:     County and Provincial Proposal Preparation. Each province will
have collected a project proposal from each individual county,
review the proposals for their consistency with the project
guidelines, add prefectural and provincial components (not to exceed
10 percent of total base costs), determine the first year's detailed
annual plan for the project and submit the unified proposals to the
FLO/MOPH.
Step G:     Review and Field-Check of Provincial and County Proposals
(September-November 1994). MOPH will have thoroughly reviewed
each provincial proposal, visiting each province (including a number
of counties as required). MOPH will have also made random review
and evaluation of the counties' proposals to make sure that the
planned activities are within the parameters and guidelines agreed in



- 85 -                        ANNEX 16
the first phase preparation.  Most important, that the planned
activities will have been checked to ensure their consistency with the
resources and the project objectives. MOPH will have provided the
detailed feedbacks to the provinces to revise the proposals before
appraisal. Any province with severe problems will have to delay
appraisal and the start of its implementation until they are corrected.
Step H:     World Bank's Review of the Staff Appraisal Report prepared by
MOPH following the agreed guidelines and procedures (expected
November/December 1994).
