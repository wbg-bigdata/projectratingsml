                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The revised Project Development Objective (PDO) of this Technical Assistance project is “to assist the three Eastern Nile countries in examining joint water resources development
                         possibilities on the Abbay/Blue and Main-stem Nile, taking economic, social and environmental sustainability issues into account in an integrated manner.? ENTRO has adapted its
                         project plans on several occasions, to respond to challenges. Changing plans in Blue Nile infrastructure development on the Abbay/Blue Nile and slow progress with the main studies
                         caused the need for a restructuring of the project, approved in September 2011. After that time, contracting issues and a freeze in participation of two governments prevented
                         ENTRO and its consultants from conducting field work and consultation. Subsequently, the client discontinued the Strategic Social and Environmental Assessment (SSEA) process.

                         In June 2012, the client developed a new plan to work towards the PDO, including the reduction of the scope of the main studies into two Working Papers and several other outputs.

                         The project has produced valuable information and analysis relating to Blue Nile development, despite several challenges in the course of implementation. In order to produce the
                         working papers, ENTRO has consolidated its available information base, produced maps of large stretches of the Blue Nile, and has conducted hydrological modeling of the Nile

                         using a number of modeling tools. ENTRO has drafted two Working Papers based on the data that is available, including a Roadmap outlining future work needed for Blue Nile/
                         Abbay cascade development, which among other things, calls for a proper SSEA to be conducted in the future. The Working Papers are not meant to replace a formal SSEA or site-
                         specific studies. They are instead meant to highlight the main social and environmental issues implicated in Blue Nile/Abbay River development, and indicate areas for further study.

                         Because of the reduced scope of project activities and outputs, the project is projected to expend ~$3.6 million of the $7 million project funds.

                         project outputs once larger hydropolitical issues are resolved. The World Bank strongly encourages ENTRO to hold consultation and disclosure of project outputs, in compliance with
                         ENTRO's commitment to the "NBI Strategy for Addressing Environmental and Social Safeguards."
