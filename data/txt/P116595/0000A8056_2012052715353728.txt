                         The objective of this Recipient-Executed Technical Assistance project is to assist the three Eastern Nile countries in examining joint water resources development
                         possibilities on the Abbay/Blue and Main-stem Nile, taking economic, social and environmental sustainability issues into account in an integrated manner.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         This is an update ISR to reflect the project status to date, based on ongoing dialoge and an interim technical support visit to ENTRO held in January, 2012.

                         The development objective (DO) and implementation performance (IP) of the project remains “moderately unsatisfactory? since late 2010 to date, mainly due to the delay and poor
                         quality of the draft outputs to date. The Implementation Progress and the Likelihood of Achieving the Project Development Objective both remain rated as Moderately Unsatisfactory.

                         The JMP1 ID project is significantly behind schedule for various reasons, including complexity of the first phase of studies [Strategic Social and Environmental Assessment (SSEA I)]
                         and delay of the consultant in completing the studies. Complex hydro-politics of Eastern Nile basin also affected the timely completion of the studies. The SSEA I report submitted by
                         the consultants has been reviewed by the Independent Panel of Reviewers, who concluded that the quality of the document is not acceptable for public disclosure. Additionally, they
                         noted a need to formally revise the “JMP Process,? to reflect the new purpose of the project.

                         The closing date of the project was originally September 30, 2011. However, the Eastern Nile Technical Regional Office (ENTRO), which is the executing agency of the project on
                         behalf of the three Eastern Nile Countries, requested an extension of the closing date until December 31, 2012. Despite, the moderately unsatisfactory performance ratings of the
                         project and poor progress on the studies, the Bank approved an extension of the Grant closing date until December 2011 as a part of a restructuring in September 2011, in response
                         to ENTRO’s request. This decision was taken by the Bank on exceptional basis, considering the strategic and developmental merits to be gained from such an extension, namely the
                         information to be gained through the studies. Elements of the restructuring included revision to the Project Development Objectives and the Results Framework to reflect recent
                         changes in plans for hydropower development on the Abbay/Blue Nile and revisions of project component costs.

                         ENTRO is currently reviewing modalities for implementing the remaining work.

                         ENTRO's request for restructuring was approved by the World Bank in September 2011. The approved restructuring includes: i) extension of the grant closing date from September
                         30, 2011 to December 31, 2012; (ii) revision to the Project Development Objectives and the Results Framework to reflect recent changes in infrastructure development on the Blue
                         Nile; (iii) adjustments to the grant expenditure categories, and (iv) additional measures to reduce the risks of project delays and to enhance the quality of project outputs.

                         The new Project Development Objective is: "to assist the three Eastern Nile countries in examining joint water resources development possibilities on the Abbay/Blue and Main-stem
                         Nile, taking economic, social and environmental sustainability issues into account in an integrated manner."

                         Changes to the project results framework are now reflected in this ISR.

                         Further details of this restructuring are included in the Restructuring Paper and the updated Integrated Safeguards and Data Sheet, which were also disclosed.
