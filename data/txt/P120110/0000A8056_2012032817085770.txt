                         The proposed Project's development objective is to contribute to the Government of Haiti's response to the cholera outbreak and strengthen institutional capacity to
                         respond to disease outbreaks effectively.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Haiti Cholera Emergency Response Project was approved by the Board on January 18, 2011, signed on January 20, 2011 and made effective on February 7, 2011.
                         Implementation progress was initially slow, but progress has been made since the last ISR, namely the roll out of community mobilization and prevention activities by the three NGOs
                         (PIH, World Vision, and Save the Children) in Artibonite, Centre, Ouest, and Sud-est departments. However, public sector activities (i.e. the implementation of the departmental
                         cholera plans) continues to suffer from delays and will only be launched by end March 2012.
