                         The proposed Project's development objective is to contribute to the Government of Haiti's response to the cholera outbreak and strengthen institutional capacity to
                         respond to disease outbreaks effectively.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Haiti Cholera Emergency Response Project was approved by the Board on January 18, 2011 and made effective on February 7, 2011. The PDO indicators related to i) knowing
                         cholera symptoms and prevention and ii) improved water sources will be determined when the endline survey is complete (expected June 2013). The PDO indicator related to
                         building institutional capacity has already been achieved. In addition to the PDOs, the Project has delivered a number of significant results: over 1,600 communities have received
                         targeted health education, over 5,300 community and institutional personnel have been trained, and are operational across the six departments and over 3 million people have
                         benefited from prevention and hygiene promotion activities. Departmental plans for all six departments were updated in December 2011 and are currently being implemented. As of
                         April 30, 2013, US$12.8 million have been disbursed, representing 85.6% of the grant.
