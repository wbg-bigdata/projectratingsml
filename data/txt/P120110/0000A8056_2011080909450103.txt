                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Haiti Cholera Emergency Response Project was approved by the Board on January 18, 2011, signed on January 20, 2011 and made effective on February 7, 2011.
                         Implementation progress was originally slow due to delays in the finalization of preparatory activities with partners, including MOH and the Water Department. However, preparatory
                         activities have now been completed, including the finalization of departmental cholera response plans for six departments, including community mobilization and prevention activities,
                         treatment of cholera cases, epidemiological surveillance and monitoring and supervision activities. These activities are expected to be launched by end July 2011. Moreover, two of
                         the three contracts with NGOs (PIH and Save) have been signed and activities launched in Artibonite, Plateau central and the south. The third contract with World Vision was
