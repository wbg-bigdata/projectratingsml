           HAITI – CHOLERA EMERGENCY RECOVERY PROJECT
                               P120110
                         IDA GRANT H639-0-HT

                                  Restructuring Paper



1.    The closing date for the Haiti, Cholera Emergency Recovery Project, Grant IDA
H639-0-HT, P120110 will be extended from June 30, 2013 to December 31, 2013.

2.       The project objectives continue to be achievable and the progress toward the
Project Development Objective and Overall implementation progress are rated
Moderately Satisfactory. The Project has delivered a number of significant results: over
1,600 communities have received targeted health education, over 5,300 community and
institutional personnel have been trained, and are operational across the six departments
and over 3 million people have benefited from prevention and hygiene promotion
activities. The Project is also providing support to the Directorate of Epidemiology
Laboratory and Research (Direction d’Épidémiologie de Laboratoire et de Recherche,
DELR) for the update and implementation of the National Surveillance Plan. Despite the
progress, challenges on the financial planning have delayed payment of agreed contracts
and completion of activities has slowed implementation of the Project.

3.     The Project is financed through the IDA Grant H639-0-HT, which was approved
by the Board on January 18, 2011 and became effective on February 7, 2011. As of May
31, 2013, US$13.10 million have been disbursed (85.9 percent) and the remaining
US$1.9 million are expected to be disbursed by December 31, 2013.

4.      The proposed extension will allow the Government to finalize the remaining
rehabilitation work, which already started in May 2013, taking into account possible
delays due to the upcoming rainy season. Specifically, it will allow the completion of: (i)
rehabilitation of rooms for infectious and diarrheal diseases; (ii) installation of
incinerators for proper waste management; and (iii) additional support for
epidemiological surveillance. In order to achieve these objectives, the Project team has
prepared an action plan to be implemented during the extension period. This plan was
submitted along with the request for the extension by the Ministry of Finance and is
found to be satisfactory to the Bank. Moreover, this extension will ensure no gaps in
service provision and a smooth transition of the cholera activities that will be continued
under the newly approved project “Improving Maternal and Child Health through
Integrated Social Services?.

5.     This will be the first and only extension for the Project.
