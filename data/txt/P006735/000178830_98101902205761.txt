INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EKECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON
A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE REPUBLIC OF COLOMBIA
FOR A THIRD EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and reccmmendation on a pro-
posed loan to the Republic of Colombia for the equivalent of US$21.2
million to help finance a +tird education project.   The loan would
have a term of 30 years, including ten years of grace, with interest
at 7-1/4 percent per annum.
PART I:  THE ECONOMY
2.        The Bank's most recent economic report (Economic Position
and Prospects of Colombia, 138-CO) was distributed to the Executive
Directors on May 18, 1973. A number of indicators drawn from the
economic report are presented in Annex 1.
3.        The Colombian economy has shown impressive gains in the recent
past. The rate of economic growth has accelerated to more than 7 percent
per annum, and the expansion of non-traditional exports has been remark-
able.  Such improvements are very much needed in order to accelerate
employment generation. Colombia also needs to spread more widely
benefits from growth in order to surmount problems of poverty and
population pressures in both rural and urban areas. Concentration
of land ownership, technical backwardness and underemployment charac-
terize most rural areas. In urban areas, pressures of population
growth, compounded by heavy migration from the countryside, have
generated serious unemployment. Prospects for coping with these
problems lie in the accelerated growth path upon which the Colombian
economy has recently embarked.
4.        Recent Government administrations have reacted to rural
poverty and urban unemployment in a more systematic fashion than in
the past but much remains to be done. In spite of the passage of an
Agrarian Reform, Law in 1961 and the creation of the Agrarian Reform
Institute (INCORA), also in 1961, only modest results have been
achieved in alleviating rural poverty. Recently, additional agricul-
tural legislation has been enacted, enabling a faster advance in land
reform and introducing a tax on presumptive agricultural income. In
recognition of the problems of urban concentration and unemployment
the Government is now placing greater emphasis on urban development,
particularly in the housing field. Through this program it hopes
to stimulate a pattern of demand that will maximize urban employment.
The programs have necessitated and will continue to require a strengthen-
ing of the fiscal effLort.



-2-
5.        During the five-year period 1968-72 current revenues of
the national government have risen at an average of 9 percent per
annum in real terms. During the past year the National Government,
pursuant to its program announced at the Consultative Group meeting
of February 1972, took new fiscal and other measures which are
expected to raise revenues by Col$1.0 billion per year (6 percent
of the 1972 total revenue). This should enhance its ability to
generate local currency needed to support foreign-assisted projects.
At the latest Consultative Group meeting held in June 1973, members
of the Group expressed the view that growing needs for public invest-
ment and o,her public expenditures called for further increases in
do. ,stic fiscal efforts. The Government has expressed the intention
to further increase revenues by new tax measures now pending before
the Colombian Congress and by increasing the savings of public enter-
prises. It is also in the process of improving tax administration
wlhich should increase collections. The Bank intends to continue the
discussions with the Colombian authorities of their fiscal program.
6.        To support the accelerated growth of the economy3 measures
have been taken to strengthen the export sector and thereby reduce
the foreign exchange constraint to sustained growth. A substantial
measure of success in this area has been achieved through policies
to encourage non-traditional exports. These have continued to grow
rapidly and their total value approached the value of coffee exports
in 1972. Although Colombia has not yet surmounted its dependence on
coffee, the rapid growth of non-traditional exports, if continued,
should achieve this result in the foreseeable future. Merchandise
export earnings during the past year exceeded US$800 million, and
were some US$150 million above the preceding yearts export earnings.
Net international reserves of -the Bank of the Republic doubled in
1972 as a result oL groTwth in exports, and reached US$345 million
by year end.  Since then1 they have grown to US$437 million.  This
provides an import coverage of about 5 months. In order to preserve
the gains already achieved and to sustain the process of rapid
diversification by expanding both agricultural and industrial exports,
it is particularly important that Colombia continues its policy of
frequent exchange rate adjustments. I'he Government has declared its
intention to do so.
7.        The strong growth in GDP has been accompanied by upward
pressure on prices. Contributing to this pressure has been central
bank lending to finance part of a 30 percent real increase in
government investment during 1972.  High coffee prices also
increased demand, and there is evidence that the export boom
reduced the supply of some commodities, e.g. beef, on the domestic market
while the rise in import prices was an additional important factor.



-3-
As a consequence consumer prices are estimated to have risen by
some 11.4 percent in 1971 and 13.5 percent during 1972, as compared
with a 7.5 percent average increase for the 1967-70 period. Infla-
tionary predsures have continued to accelerate during the first few
months of this year. The authorities are aware of the danger this
presents and the fiscal measures referred to in paragraph 5 should
bring about some improvement.  Further action is also being under-
taken, such as the issuance of special bonds to reduce excess
liquidity resulting from the boom in coffee exports. Another anti-
inflationary measure placed into effect was a substantial liber-
alization of imports.
8.        The public external debt repayable in foreign currency
amounted to US$2.2 billion at the end of 1972, or US$1.4 binllion
excluding undisbursed commitments.   Service on this debt is not
high (14.8 percent of foreign exchange earnings in 1972), relative
to many other developing countries. Since exports have risen at
the same rate as debt service in recent years, there has been no
increase in the debt service ratio, at a time when economic growth
has accelerated. The debt service ratio may be expected to rise
to about 20-21 percent in 1977-78 as a result of greater capital inflows
assc-_ated with a sustained high growth rate.  Should economic growth
contaaue at a rapid pace which appears feasible, and should that growth
be accompanied by a further strong expansion of non-coffee exports and
sound economic and financial policies, Colombia should find it possible
to secure the large amounts of external capital it needs and to manage
servicing the indebtedness that this volume of borrowing would generate.
Some of this capital will have tobe provided to finance local costs
if foreign assistance is to make a significant contribution to projects
of high priority such as those in the social sectors, with a low foreign
exchange component.
PART II: BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN COLOMBIA
9.         The proposed loan --the fifty-fourth to be made to Colombia--
would bring the total amount of Bank loans to Colombia to US$l1,048.9
million (net of cancellations). Of the foregoing amount, DS$77145
mil'lion is now held by the Bank. IDA has made one credit of US$1965
million for highways in Colombia in 1961.
10.        Disbursements have been comrpleted on 29 loans and the one
IDA credit. IFC has made effective investmrents and under-writing



commitments in 18 enterprises in Colombia, cotalling about
US$19.7 million of which IFC now holds US$9.7 million. Annex II
contains a summary statement of Bank loans, the IDA credit, and
IFC investments as of May 31, 1973 and notes on the execution of
the 23 on-goiLng'pojects.
11.       Bank d-isbursements as a percentage of total disburse-
ments by official lenders to Colombia are expected to peak at
about 40 percent in 1973-74 and then decline. The Bank's share
of total debt service is projectedtopeak at about 31 percent in
1974-75, and the Bank group share of total debt disbursed and
outstanding can be expected to fall from 28 percent in 1972 to
24 percent in 1978.
12.       A Bank loan is in an advanced stage of prepaiatiofi
for a sixth railway project. OVer the past few years, BankC
lending in Colombia ha.s become increasingly diVersified a-s
activities have expanded and as the Bank assumed greater    -
responsibilities as head of the Consultative Group for Colombia.
Increasingly, projects involving Bank loans in agriculture,
industry and the social sectors were developed. While so far our
efforts in these sectors have been mainly production-oriented in
support of economic growth and related export expansion objectives,
we are now seeking to develop projects in such a way as to combine
increasing output with maximum benefits in terms of employment
and improving the inccme of the poor, particularly in ru.ral areas.
Such a flurther shift in emphasis of Bank lending, however, will
require a new approach in many instances and hence project preparation
and appraisal are likely to be more time-consuming. Also, at least
in the initial stage, such projects are likely to be of much smaller
size than the traditional large infrastructure projects.
13.       We expect over the next several years to make an increasing
contribution to the agricultural and industrial sectors, with
perhaps as much as 60 percent of our total lending, in those two
oectors.
14.       The other major focus of our activities would be in such
social sectors as education and water supplv, as well as in other
project areas such as the traditional sectors of Bank lending
--electric power and trniisportation-- in cases where support can be
given to strengthening institutional- 6veIopment.  In addition the
Bank would continue to cooperate with the Government in its efforts
to improve the fiscal system and in developing institutions capable
of increasing public savings.



15.       The operations of external lenders in Colcmbia are shown
in Annex I, page 3. While IBRD, IDB, and AID provided about four-
fifths of total external financing to Colombia in the 1961-71
period, their share decreased tSo 53 percent in 1972. This results
from unusually low IBRD lending in that year as well as from recent
medium and long-term borrowing Abroad from commercial banks and
bond issues on an unusually large scale. The IDB has assisted
projects in law-cost housing, university education, agrarian reform,
ports, electric power, water supply, transportation, and industry.
AID has shifted the emphasis of its lending in recent years from
program to sector loans, particularly for education, urban develop-
ment, and agriculture.
PART III. EDUCATION IN COLOMBIA
16.       Colombia has a rapidly developing educational system
and has achieved a literacy rate of 74 percent which compares
favorably with other countries in Latin America. Almost 5 per-
cent of the GD? is devoted to education, about the same as in
neighboring countries. Enrollment of the respective age groups
in 1970 was 70 percent for primary schools, 19 percent for secondary
schools and 3.5 percent for universities.  Private schools and
institutions play an important role in secondary and higher education,
accountirng for 54 percent and 44 percent respectively of enrollment.
17.       While the overall ac omplishments of the education system
are good, there are serious flaws. Primary education starts at
,age seven and lasts five years buit is hampered by a shortage of
schools many of which have orly one, two or three grades. About
30 percent of primary school students are over-age students who
either started late or are among the large number of repeaters.
The drop-out rate is high: of each 100 students beginning primary
school in 1964, only 22 graduated five years later.
18.       In secondary education, the academic type of school
aiming at university entrance accounts for 70 percent of enrollment,
exceeding by far the economic need for this type of training. Many
of the private secondary schools are overcrowded and can not afford
the equipment investmentF needed for vocational schooling. The
academic course consists of six years divided into a lower cycle of
four years and an upper cycle of two years, leading to the
"Bachillerato" degree.  The attrition rate is high, about 40 percent
in the first cycle and 30 percent in the second cycle. Primary
teacher training accounts for 9 percent of secondary education
enrollment and various vocational options for 21 percent. The Bank-
financed type of "diversified secondary" schools described below are
gradually assuming an increasingly important role but their capacity
is still far from meeting requirements for trained manpower.



-6-
19.       In 1970, total enrollment in universities and post-
secondary institutions was 78,000 or 3.5 percent of the 19-24 age
group. The uncontrolled rapid expansion of university education
has resulted in a proliferation of institutions and hi    drop-
out rates.  Of those who entered the university, only 5 per-
cent graduated, and yet an over-supply of uni-versity graduates in
various fields, including engineering, already exists. In recent
year-s, waves of student strikes have had the effect of keeping
higher education in turmc.L', thereby absorbing much of the energies
of the highei officials of the Ministry of Education.
20.       In the area of non-formal training, SENA, the National
Apprenticeship Service, has assumed a dominant position. SENA's
main function is to provide speciiic technical training -- most of/it
in its own training institutions-- for workers at various levels.
Between 1958 and 1970, SENA trained 2,000 instructors and over
700,000 workers in about 25,o0o courses. The activities of SENA
are financed by an industrial payroll. tax of 2 percent which gives
SENA a strong financial position. Accion Cultural Popular (ACPO)
is a non-profit institution whose main goal is basic education of
the masses, especially the adult rural population, by radio.   In
1971 the number of listeners was 150,000 with fifty thousand hours
of transmission time. The Ministry of Education, through its
Division of Adult Education, admdnisters literacy and general
education programs for adults thxiough 400 centers and 2,500 teachers.
21.       Thers has been an improvement in the qualifications of
teachers, mainly in the primary schools, but the proportion of
teachers which can be considered to be adequately qualified remains
low --56 percent in primary schools and 33 percent. in secondary
schools. Primary school teachers are trained in normal schools
which pursue the academic program during the first four-year cycle
followed by a two-year professional cycle.   Secondary teachers are
trained in the pedagogic faculties of the universities in four-
year courses. Existing facilities for training of teachers in
vocational subjects are insufficient to meet the needs generated
by the proposed Third Education Project which therefore includes
a component for technical teacher training.
22.       The rural areasT backwardness is becoming an increasing
concern  of the Government.  In these areas public services, particularly
for education, health and transportation, are poor.   The education level
of the rural population is very low; 40 percent are illiterate as
against 16 percent in the urban areas. Only 3 percent of the rural
primary school entrants complete the five-grade course, as ccmpared
with 45 percent in urban schools. Secondary education and vocational
training facilities are virtually non-existent in the countryside.



-7-
The Government has initiated a program for establishing rural
development centers and is increasing its input for general rur-l
education; this effort is being supported by USAID. The proposed
Bank project also includes components intended to promote rural
education, mainly at the secondary level.
23.       To improve management capability, the Ministry of Education
has decentralized same oL its functions by establishing a number of
semi-autonomous agencies and expanding the functions of existing
agencies. Nevertheless, the Ministry is still too burdened with
administrative work, while policr -making and planning is receiving
insufficient attention.  A draft.eneral Education Law, presently
awaiting action by the Congress, proposes centralization of policy
making in the Ministry and delegation of administration to a new
semi-autonomous Institute for Education and Teachers' Services
(INCAES). The UNDP will provide technical assistance to help
reorganize the structure of education administration and to
strengthen it.
24.       Between 1965 and 1970, the proportion of the national
Government's budget spent on education remained at about 15 per-
cent but because of the increase of the budget this constituted a
rapidly increasing share of GDP. The Central Government finances
only 55 percent of total education expenditures; departments and
municipalities 22 percent, and the remaining 23 percent comes from
private sources.
25.       The Government gives high priority to a further implemen-
tation of the secondary education reform program and has defined
the broad outline for the development of other levels of education.
The key to education development is the system of diversified
secondary education. Through the proposed project, the diversified
curriculum will be extended to existing secoi__ary schools and new
schools in the rural areas. The philosophy of diversified secondary
education would also exercise its influence downwards through an
integration of the present five-year primary cycle with the lower
four-year cycle of diversified secondary education into nine years
of basic education. An integrated nine-year cycle is conceived to
be the minimum schooling needed to enter and compete successfully
in the labor market and would become compulsory in the long run.
Upwards there would be an influence on higher education as the more
practically oriented technological institutes are strengthened as
an alternative to a further overexpansion of the academically
oriented programs of the universities. The Government recognizes
that its objectives are essentially long term in character and
that there is a need to work out a strategy for education develop-
ment indicating timing, priorities and means for the i.nplementation
of its objectives in view of manpower and financial constraints.



-8-
Meanwhile, projections show that the expenditure of 5.7 percent of
GDP in 1980 (as compared with 4.8 percent of GDP in 1970) would
make it possible to offer primary education to all 7-11 year olds
and secondary education to 33 percent of the 12-18 age group,
without compromising the improvement of teachers? qualifications
and salaries.
PART IV: THE PROJBCT
26.       The main purpose of Bank lending for education in Colombia
hag' been to assist the Government in introducing and spreading the
diversified system of secondary education in order better to meet
the needs of the economy for trained manpower, while at the same
time easing pressures on the universities. The first Bank loans
of US$7.6 million (1968) and US$6.6 million (1970) were for the
equipping and construction of 19 diversified secondary schools in
the larger cities wThich when completed later this year will enroll
78,000 students.  The physical execution of the first two projects
has been slower than expected but the main bottleneck, the procure-
ment of equipment and furniture, is being 6vercome through strength-
ening the implementation agency's procurement capacity.   The new
diversified curriculum is being implemented properly and a number
of innovations have been introduced successfully.  As a result, the
diversified secondary schools are having an impact on the whole
education system. This impact would be further broadened in the
proposed Third Education Project with the establishment of 24 common
facilities centers, providing workshops and laboratories for an
additional 109,000 secondary students mainly in medium-size cities
and of 13 rural comprehensive secondary schools enrolling 7,000 students.
lhe latter institutions will give opportiunities forilower--se6ondary-
education which now are lacking in rural areas and be the basis for
an education extension service needed to support rural development.
27.       The third project was appraised in November 1972 and loan
negotiations were held in May 1973. The Borrower's delegation was
led by the Deputy Minister of Education, Dr. Guillermo Alberto
Gonzalez. A Loan and Project Summary is attached as Annex III to
this report and an appraisal report (132a-CO) is being circulated
separately to the Executive Directors.
Description and Purpose of the Project
28.       The project consists of (a) construction and equipping of
24 common facilities centers; (b) construction and equipping of 13
rural comprehensive schools; (c) a special program for the training
of technical teachers; (d) an extension of the rural development
center in "Las Gaviotas" i-n the Eastern Plains; (e) technical
assistance for a sector survey and sector studies. The 24 common
facilities centers would provide the necessary workshops and
laboratories to enable a total of 91 existing secondary schools
to adopt a diversified curriculum combining practical and academic
subjects. These schools are in general too small to make separate
provision of such facilities economic.



-9-
29.      TIhe 13 lower-cycle secondary schools (grades 6-9) in rural
areas would have a total enrollment of 7,000 students in one shift, in-
cludinig 1,700 boai,ding places. These schools would have a curriculum
similar to that of other diversified secondary schools but with
fewer options and an orientation towards agricultural activities.
The schools would provide a broad introduction to practical skills
as a basis for SENA-courses, agricultural training programs and
on-the-job training. The rural secondary schools will form part
of a government program for the establishment of 39 such schools.
Tho remaining 26 need only an extension of facilities expected to
be financed by AID. The latter is also assisting the completion
to all five grades of the primary schools in the areas involved.
These primary schools will become the feeder schools for the
comprehensive schools. A third element of the project is a program
for the training of 2,000 teachers in industrial and other practical
subjects over the period 1974-77. This program would provide the
technical teachers for the proposed common facilities centers and
rural comprehensive schools.
30.       The Project would also provide for the completion of the
existing pilot rural development center in Las Gaviotas in Vichada
Department in the Eastern Plains; it would establish three affili-
ated centers in nearby areas. In addition to agricultural extension
services arid training, each center is intended to provide primany
education, health services, general supply availabilities and a
mechanical workshop. Las Gaviotas is supported by government and
private organizations.
31.       Thus, the proposed project is designed -to ac1.ieve  several
important results. First, it will reinforce the ongoing program of
reform in secondary educiation, raising substantially the percentage
of secondary students receiving diversified secondary education and
thus reduce the proportion of students in the academically oriented
secondary schools from 70 percent to 55 percent. Secondly, the Bank
will became associated with the field of rurnal education by supporting
the Government?s program to extend secondary diversified education
to about 21,000 students in the countryside.  Thirdly, the prcposed
project will assist a successful pilot center for rural development
services which later could be expanded in the vast areas of the
Eastern Plains. Finally, the proposed project is expected to support
important institutional improvements in the field of education
administration and planning.
Technical Assistance and Special Studies
32.       Successful implementation of the proposed project will
require specialists in various fields where expertise at present
available to the Government is lacking or inadequate. Such assistance
will be required to reorganize education administration, st,rengthen



- 10 -
education planning, organize a vocational education supervisory
service, develop and improve teaching in industrial and agricultural
subjects and develop curricula and syllabi for the technical teaching
training program. The major part of the technical assistance in
question will be provided by the UNDP and has been authorized in its
1972-76 Country Program; the necessary detailed agreements have been
made.
33.       Provision would be made under the proposed project, for an
initial period,for ACP0 (see paragraph 20 above) to operate an
education extension service and mobile community development units
based in the rural comprehensive schools and train the personnel to
carry on these services. A contract has been negotiated with ACPO
and the Bank would finance 80 percent of the cost. In addition the
project would finance a sector survey to evaluate the past development
of the education system and to design policies and priorities for
further development. Studies would also be carried out on manpower
needs, experience with the Bank financed secondary schools and on the
local production of school equiLpment and learning materials.
Cost and Financing of the Project
340       The total cost of the project, excluding interest during
construction, is estimated at US$33.5 million, and its foreign
exchange component at US$16.9 million, (for details see Annex
III, Loan and Project Summ2,i,rS)  The proposed Bank loan of
US$21.2 million would finarnce the estimated foreign exchange
component, andUS$2 million of furniture and equipment expected to
be ordered in Colombia after international ccmpetitive bidding.
In addition, the loan would finance (a) US$0.5 million representing
the local cost of technical assistance which ACPO would provide, and
(b) US$0.2 million of the local cost of civi'l works for the rural
development services centers (in addition to the estimate-d foreign
exchange cost of' those centers).  Finally, the loan would financ~e
US$1.6 million of interest and other charges on the Bank loan during
construction. The remaining local cost of US$13.9 million equivalent
would be provided by the Government.
Management Arrangements
35.       For the implementation of the first two-Bank financed
education projects, a Project Unit was established in ICCE, the
school construction unit of the Ministry of National Education.
Given the satisfactory performance of ICCE (Inshituto Colombiano de
Construc(,iones Escolares), it is proposed that the agency also be
charged with the implementation of the third project. The draft loan
Agreement provides that new appointments of staff in charge of
construction and pedagogics be made in consultation with the Bank;
their salaries and other operational expenditures for project admin-
istration are included under the project.



Procurement and Disbursement
36.       All contracts for the supply of equipment and furniture
and for the const,ruction of schools would be awarded under interna-
tional competitive bidding. F4uipment and furniture items would
be grouped to form sizable bid. packages for bulk purchasing.  Except
for equipment, it is unlikely that many foreign bidders would be
interested, since Colombia has a well-developed furniture industry
and a large, highly competitive construction industry which is
expectedtowin all contracts. Local bidders for goods would be
granted a margin of preference of 15 percent or the applicable
customs duties, whichever is lower.  Colombia is a member of the
Latin American Free Trade Association (LA?TA) and of the Andean Pact.
Preferential treatment under these agreements, however, does not
apply in this case, since the Ministry of Education is exempt from
duties on imported equipment.
37.       The proposed loan would be disbursed according to the
schedule in Annex III, i.e., in aboitt three and a half years.
PART V: LEGAL INSTRUMNTS AND AUTHORITY
38.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Republic
of Colombia, as well as the Report of the Cormaittee provided for in
Article III, Section 4 (iii), of the Articles of Agreement and the
text of a draft Resolution approving the proposed loan, are being
distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
39.       The draft Agreements contain provisions to reflect the
various arrangements described in Part TV above, and contain the
provisions custaaary for education projects.
40.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI: RECOMNDATION
141.      I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the
proposed loan.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTIONI/
aumarized below is the current status of all loans signed but not
fully disbursed:
Loan 502 - Irrigation (Atlantico I), US$9 million, June 1967.
Implem-entation of the project financed under loan 502-CO remains
two years behind schedule due to difficulties in the selection of
areas suitable for irrigation and technical probiems in the
construction of major irrigation and drainage works. As a
consequence of this and poor project management, agricultural
development is still limited to a small area and mainly
restricted to dry farming. However, the few agricultural results
obtained on a small number of farms are very promising. To complete
the scheduled works, a second extension of the closing date by one
year beyond the revised closing date of December 31, 1973 may become
necessary.
Loan 534 - Development Finance Comparies II, US$12.5 million, May 1968.
This loar is fully committed for approved sub-projects, and the
undisbursed balance of US$0.3 million is expected to be disbursed
shortly.
Loan 536 - Water Supply (Bogota I), US$b4 million, June 1968.
The major part of the First Bogota Project is in operation.
Water service in mosti areas writh poor service is rapdily improving
The operating performance of the Empresas is good and the remaining
works should be completed by the end of 1973, The Closing Date has
been prolonged to Jurne 30, 1974 to permit completion of the project
and payment to suppliers.
Loan 537 - Electric Power (Bogota), US$18 million, June 1968.
The project financed by this loan is substantially completed. Lower
than anticipated participation of joint financing agencies together
with foreign cost increases due to the devaluation of the U.S. dollar
led to a re-allocation of funds in mid-1972 among the loan categories.
Delays in the definition of the distribution expansions have caused
late bidding for distribution equipment.   The Closing Date has been
extended to the end of 1973 to allow completion of the project.
/ These notes are designed to inform the Excecutive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them.  They should be read fn this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.



ANEX II
Pe     of 7
Loan 550 - Highways V, US$17.2 million, July 1968.
There have been substantial cost overruns and delays in the civil
works financed under this loan. The project is about 90 percent
complete; the present closing date of June 30, 1973, already
postponed for one year from the original, will be postponed
for one more year.
Loan 552 - ducation I, US$7.6 million, July 1968.
School construction is virtually completed. All furniture and
75 percent of the equipment has been delivered to the schools
and procurement of the remainder is under way. However, procure-
ment of furniture and equipment is considerably behind schedule
and this is reflected in slower than expected disbursement.
Improvement is expected now that the procurement unit has been
strengthened.
Loan 575 - Electric Power (Interconnection), US$18 million, December 1968.
The project as originally described in the Loan Agreement
started operation in November 1971. Mainly due to the fact that
the joint financing arranganents raised more funds than expected
during the appraisal, the 230 KV line Cuatape-Barrancabermeja,
which will incorporate the northeastern region into the inter-
comected system., was included in the loan. Completion of the
extension is scheduled by mid-1974.
Loan 624 - Agricultural Credit II, US$17 million., June 1969,
The Project continues to be far behind schedule. However, recent
changes in Project management and organization and an increase in
technical personnel provided the basis of the Bank's approval of
Colombia's request to enlarge the Project area and include lending
to small farmers under the Project. The Project has now begun to
move fairly well.
Loan 625 - Development Finance Companies III, US$25 million, June 3.969,
US$24.9 million of this loan is comnitted for approved sub-projects.
To pemrit completion of disbursements the Bank has agreed to extend
the original Closing Date from September 30, 1972, to December 31,
1973e
Loan 651 - Livestock II, US$18.3 million, December 1969,
This Project moved slowly from effectiveness in March 1971 until
mid-1972. In October 1972, the Bank and Caja agreed on certain
modifications to the Project, including appointnent of one Project
General Director with overall responsibility for the Project,
extension of the Project area and greater flexibility in regard to
tems of sub-lending. At the same time it was agreed that increased
sub-lending should be directed towari\s small holders. These changes
have resulted in all increase in the rate of sub-lending under the
Project and it is now expected that the Loan will be fully disbursed
by mid-1976.



ANNEX II
Page 5 of 7
Loan 679 - Education II, US$6.5 million, June 1970.
All major civil works for five of the nine project schools had been
completed at the time of the last supervision mission in December
1972 and the remaining four were expected to be completed by mid-
1973. There has been scme delay in project execution owing to slow
procurement of furniture and equipment. Improvement- is expected now
that the procurement unit has been strengthened. The Closing Date
was recently postponed by one year to June 30, 197)4.
Loan 680 - Highways VIT, US$32 milLon, June 1970.
In general, there have been substantial cost increases and serious
delays on the civil works. The most serious problem confronting
the project relates to the financial difficulties of the Colombian
contracting industry, leading to a temporary halt in construction
on several groups of the Paving Prograr. In this situation, where
some of Colombia's major contracting firms were facing bankruptcy,
the Government has recently taken drastic steps to resuscitate
operations. Estimated cost increases for ci.l works now amount to
about 30 percent of original contract amounts, while consultant
services will be about double the original amount. Civil works
are nearly 40 percent completed, but are about one year behind
schedule. The situation is more satisfactory on the other two elements
of the project, the construction of the Barranquilla bridge and of
the El Pailon-Buenaventura road.
Loan 681 - Electric Power (Chivor I), US$52.3 million, June 1970.
Progress of the main civil works contract is generally satisfactory
and in agreement with the contractual dates. Bidding for the rest
of the civil works financed by the Bank is proceeding as planned.
Higher than expected prices for equipment, due partly to the
revaluation of various European currencies and the yen, together
with changes in the access road program, have substantially increased
the total cost of the project.  Recently we have received a revised
cost estimate and as of March 1973 total project costs are estimated
at US$140 million, that is, about US$25 million more than estimated
in the Appraisal Report. ISA plans to finance the cost overruns with
unallocated funds of the IBRD and the IDB loan and with suppliers
credit and a direct loan from a group of foreign banks. The Bank
has reassessed the economic and financial viability of the project
in view of the cost overruns and found that Chivor I remains the
best alternative.
Loan 682 - Cali Water Sapply and Sewerage, US$18.5 million, June 1970.
The project was delayed for about one year due mainly to a change
in the Cali Municipal Government that occurred after theloan was
signed. The Board of EMCALI has appointed a new manager and taken
remedial actions suggested by the Banlc in order to improve EKCALI's
acninistrative capacity and f inancial performance.



ANNEX II
Page 6 of 7
Loan 738 - Palmira Water Supply and Sewerage, US$2 million, May 1971.
Construction on this project was delayed due to slow project
design and administrative problems with the consultants and the
Borrower. Lower than anticipated sales of water and a shortfall
in projected local borrowing has resulted in an unsatisfactory
financial performance of the Borrower. As a consequence the Bank
has proposed to Empresas Publicas Municipales the rephasing of the
project to reflect the above inentioned financial constraints.
Loan 739 - Land Settlenent Caqueta I, US$8.1 million, May 1971.
During its first year, the project has achieved about 75 percent
of its appraisal objectives. Sablending is being delayed by
administrative procedures associated with cattle purchase and
the provision of technical assistance. Arrangements have been
made to improve the organization, and there are prospects that
1973 operations will be on target. The benefits from the project
are likely to be higher than appraisal projections while the cost
estimates are likely to be about the same as envisaged at apprai.sal.
Loan 740 - Telecommunications II, US$15 million, May 1971.
The recent currency revaluations have caused an estimated cost
overrun of US$2-4 million. The Bank and the Borrower are considering
various alternatives of financing this overrun.
Loan 741 - Water Supply (Bogota II), US$88 million, May 1971.
The principal civil works component of this project, the Chingaza
tunnel construction, is behind schedule. The Borrower is reviewing
the latest measures proposed by the contractors to improve performance.
Recent information shows that revenue from water sales is lower than
forecast. The Bank has suggested actions to assure that this short-
fall will not adversely affect the financial performance of the
Borrower which has been satisfactory hitherto.
Loan 742 - Development Finance Companies IV, US$40 million, May 1971.
Only US$0.7 million of this loan remain uncammitted. Disbursements
are ahead of schedule.
Loan 842 - Developrment Program and Expansion Project, US$60 million, June 1972.
The second tranche (US$30 million) of this loan was cancelled
because coffee prices exceeded the upper limit set in the Loan
Agreement for release of the second tranche.

Loan 849 - Irrigation (Atlantico II), US$5 million, June 1972.
This loan became effective on November 14., 1972.
Loan 860 - Medium-Size Cities Water Supply and Sewerage Project, US$9.1 million,
A                  October 1972.
This loan became effective on March. 7, 1973. The Borrower has
experienced difficulties in the initial phase of the project; however,
the recent stationing of a Bank water supply specialist in Bogota
is helping solve these problems. Construction of several subprojects
has recently began.
Loan 874 - Guatape II Hydroelectric Powrer Project, US$56 million, January 1973.
Construction of the Santa Rita dam (2nd stage) has started.

Arrangements:       All contracts for the supply of equipment and furniture
and for the construction oL schools would be awarded under
international competitive bidding. Local bidders would be
granted a margin of preference by adding 15 percent or the
applicable customs duties, whichever is lower, to the foreign
bids. The Ministry of Education is exempt from customs
duties; the bidding would therefore not be affected by
regional preferences.
