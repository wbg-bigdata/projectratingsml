H. Baritsch (Technical Educator, UNESCO)).



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
COLOMBIA THIRD EDUCATION PROJECT
(LOAN 920-CO)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) of the Third Education
Project in Colombia, for which Loan 920-CO was approved in the amount of
US$21.2 million on July 19, 1973. The original Closing Date was June 30,
1977; the last disbursement was made on August 16, 1982. The remaining
balance in the Loan Account in the amount of US$2,143,786 was cancelled on
August 13, 1982.
The Completion Report was prepared by the Latin American and Carib-
bean Regional Office following a mission to Colombia. The PCR is based on the
findings of the completion mission; reports and other documents in the
Bank's files that relate to this project including the Appraisal Report (No.
1292a-CO) dated July 5, 1973; the record of the Board discussion of this
project on July 17,1973; and the Loan Agreement (920-CO) dated July 19,
1973. The project experience has been discussed with Bank staff associated
with the Project.
The Operations Evaluation Department decided not to audit the
project and sent copies of the draft PCR to the Government in July 1983. An
English translation of the comments received from the Government is reproduced
as Attachment I.

THIRD EDUCATION PROJECT (LOAN 920-CO)
Highlights
A Loan of US$21.1 million equivalent to assist in financing the
Third Education Project in Colombia was approved and signed on July 19,
1973. Total project costs were estimated at US$33.5 million. The project
included the building and equipping of 20 Common Facilities Centers, 13 Rural
Development Centers, the expansion of one rural Development Services Center
at Las Gaviotas, technical assistance and a teacher training program. Its
main objective concentrated on the improvement and expansion of diversified
secondary education in medium-sized cities and rural areas. Other objectives
included the improvement of training for technical education teachers,
preparing education sector studies to strengthen the capacity for educational
planning and strengthening rural development capability by improving the
facilities of the Las Gaviotas Rural Development Services Center.
The project has been completed after undergoing significant changes
during the implementation process in 1977 and less significant modifications
in 1981. Completion was delayed by almost five years. The Loan was not
completely disbursed, and a remaining loan balance of US$2.1 million was
cancelled. Total project costs amounted to US$29.3 million which is 12X
below the appraisal estimate of US$33.5 million owing to reductions in
project scope.
implementation was delayed by:
(a) significant policy changes enacted into law by a new government
that assumed power within eight months after the date of
effectiveness and which suspended implementation for almost two
years while the policy changes were being processed;
(b) periodic shortages of counterpart funds; and
(c) weak project management.
In 1977 the government proposed modification in project scope which
the Bank eventually accepted. As a result of these modifications the
structures of the Common Facilities Centers and Rural Development Centers
were altered, the sector studies were deleted, and the teacher training
program was reduced. These changes did not result in obtaining a greater
degree of support for the project on the part of the government, and in 1978
the government proposed to cancel a significant portion of tne project.
Before the proposal was resolved a new government assumed office and
committed itself to implement the project. The changes that were effected in
1981 reduced the number of Common Facilities Centers from 23 to 20 and
deleted the rural satellite schools that were associated with the 13 Rural
Development Centers.



- vii -
The experience of implementing this project points out the
importance of the following matters:
(a) The risk of implementation delays when a government's
educational priorities change (paras. 6.01 and 6.04).
(b) The need for flexibility in project content and objectives so that
changes can be accommodated during implementation (para. 6.06).
Cc) The need to synchronize technical assistance, teacher training and
equipment procurement with construction; when construction is
delayed, they should be rescheduled (paras. 6.06, 6.08 and 6.16).
(d) The difficulty in giving proper attention (either by the Government
or the Bank) to the implementation of components outside the main
focus of the project (paras. 6.07 and 6.09).
The main finding is that the project has succeeded in establishing
the Common Facilities Centers as a viable alternative for extending
diversified education in urban areas. It appears that the centralized
workshops and science laboratories do provide a less costly way to supply
diversified secondary education in areas where large new secondary schools
are not feasible.
The Rural Development Centers have not met with success because of
policy changes that have been made during the implementation period and weak
management of this component.



I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      This Project Completion Report (PCR) is based on the findings of a
completion mission that visited Colombia from June 29 to July 17, 1982. The
mission consisted of four members who together used a total of 52 staff/days
in the field.
1.02      A PCR was prepared by a private consultant contracted for that
purpose by the Borrower between March and June, 1982. However, that PCR was
found unacceptable by the Borrower on the grounds that it was too critical of
the project implementation process. The Bank's PCR was, therefore, prepared
without the benefit of ;4 Borrower prepared PCR.
II. PROJECT BACKGROUND
Educational Development Strategy
2.01      The Government's strategy for educational development in the late
1960s ascribed a high priority to reforming secondary education through the
Introduction and extension of a diversified curriculum. 1/ That priority led
the Government to seek, and obtain, the Bank's financial7assistance for the
First and Second Education Projects. Those two projects produced 19
diversified secondary schools (INEMs, Institutos Nacionales de Educacion
Media) between 1970-1975. Since those schools were located in the larger
cities, the Government saw the need to take the next step in fulfillment of
its policy by extending diversified secondary education to existing schools
in medium-sized cities and, through new schools, to rural areas.
2.02      This educational strategy also sought to bring about a greater
integration of the five-year primary cycle with the lower four-year cycle of
diversified secondary education. 2/ By effecting such an integration the
Covernment sought to increase the length of basic education for all children
from five to nine years.
Project Generation
2.03      Project development progressed from the first reconnaissance
mission to Board approval in 18 months.  In January 1972, a Bank
reconnaissance mission visited Colombia in response to the Government's
1/ Diversified secondary education, which is synonymous with comprehensive
secondary education, integrates practical and academic subjects into a
balanced general education program that prepares students for a broad
range of possibilities in employment and further training.
2/ The Colombian pre-university system of education consisted of 5 years of
primary (grades 1-5) and 6 years of the secondary education which was
divided into 4 years of a basic cycle and 2 years of an upper cycle.



-2-
expressed interest in a Third Education Project. 3/ The Government's initial
request for Bank assistance included:
(a)  fifty Common Facilities Centers (Centros Auxiliares de Servicios
Docentes, CASDs) to extend diversified secondary education to urban
centers;
(b) thirty rural comprehensive schools to extend diversified education
to rural areas;
(c) improvement of the quality and supply of technical education
teachers; and
(d) faculty training and other needs in post-secondary and higher
education.
2.04      Through the first reconnaissance mission the Bank and the Borrower
agreed to:
(a)  continue supporting the reform of secondary education through the
third project; and
(b) prepare a project consisting of 50 Common Facilities Centers, 10
comprehensive rural schools, expansion of technical teacher
trailing, and technical assistance.
The Bank decided to limit itself to secondary education because that was the
only level of education where the Government was actively implementing
reform, and the third project was seen as a follow-up to the previous two
Bank-financed projects.
2.05      Project preparation was to be accomplished between January and June
of 1972 by a task force of the Ministry of Education (MOE), but that work wa
not completed until the arrival of the appraisal mission in November 1972.
The delay in preparation was caused by changes in high level personnel of the
MOE including the Minister, and ineffective coordination among the various
agencies that would participate in the project. During preparation the MDE
reduced the number of Common Facilities Centers from 50 to 25 and increased
the number of rural schools from 10 to 13. This overall reduction was made
to keep the project within available financial resources.
2.06      When the project was appraised in November, the number of Common
Facilities Centers was reduced from 25 to 24 because one of the proposed
Centers (Arauca) was of uneconomic size and could not be justified. Also,
two new components were added:
(a) the extension of the Rural Development Services Center of Las
Gaviotas; and
3/ At that time Colombia was implementing two consecutive Bank-financed
secondary education projects under Loans 552-CO-and 679-CO with the aim of
implementing the first phase of a reform of secondary education.



(b) assistance to conduct a sector survey and a series of sector
studies.
The appraisal also established that, as a condition of effectiveness, the
Borrower would submit to the Bank a detailed plan for implementing the
technical teachers training program.
2.07      Negotiations were held in May 1973, followed by Board approval in
July. However, it was not until January 9, 1974, that the loan became
effective because the Colombian institute responsible for preparing the
teacher training implementation plan had difficulty in getting technical
assistance for the task. The institute also had difficulty in organizing the
task force that ultimately developed the plan.
Project Objectives and Content
2.08      The project started with five general objectives that were to
assist the Government to:
(a) implement its pollcy of extending diversified secondary
education by constructing, equipping and furnishing:
Wi) 24 common facilities centers (grades 6-11);
(ii) 13 rural :omprehensive schools (grades 6-9); and
(b) establish a training program at four regional centers for
2,000 technical teachers;
Cc) improve the provision of services for rural development by
extending the Rural Development Services' Center of Las
Gaviotas and linking Las Gaviotas with three satellite centers
that would be established in the Las Gaviotas area;
(d)  assist in conducting an educational sector survey and specific
sector studies to help the MOE with future educational
planning; and
(e) provide technical assistance to carry out those project
components listed under (b) and (c) above.
2.09     Xlrhile the main thrust of the project was on the improvement of
educational quality and opportunity, the new facilities also provided
additional enrollment capacity as shown in the table that follows:

a/   This figure represented the total number of students that the centers
would serve, but 69,500 of those students were already enrolled in
satellite schools. The remaining 39,400 were supposed to be new places
made available at the satellite schools by the part-time attendance of
students at the Common Facilities Centers.
2 .10     The 24 Common Facilities Centers were to provide workshops,
laboratories and student counseling services on a part-time basis to students
from surrounding satellite schools that lacked such services. Each Center
was to serve from two to six satellite secondary schools and the enrollments
would be from 2,100 to 5,700 students. This was aimed at increasing the
national preparation of secondary students in diversified education from 4%
to 15% by 1980.
2.11      The 13 Rural Comprehensive Schools were to be part of 39 such
schools that the Government intended to create throughout the country in
order to extend diversified secondary education to the rural areas. These
schools were to cover only the first four years (grades 6-9) of the regular
six-year secondary program because the relatively small number of secondary
students in the rural areas did not justify establishing schools with the
diversified upper cycle (grades 10-11). The vocational orientation at these
schools were to be in agriculture, and serve as focal points for rural
development by offering a variety of services and training programs in adult
education, community leadership, adult agricultural production, health and
sanitation. In addition, the schools were intended to promote the
improvement of primary education in their respective zones of influence by
providing satellite schools with supervision, material assistance and
in-service teacher training.
2.12      Since the Common Facilities Centers and the rural comprehensive
schools would require vocational teachers when the supply of such teachers
was practically non-existent, the project provided supplementary equipment to
carry out a training program for 2,000 teachers of industrial and other
vocational subjects. The program was to be planned and coordinated by the
Colombian Institute for the Development of Higher Education (ICFES) and
implemented through a coordinated effort involving four regional
universities, technical schools, polytechnical institutes, and the National
Apprenticeship Service (SENA). This program was to serve various types of
diversified secondary schools, not just the project schools.



- 5 -
2.13      The project provided for the extension of facilities at the Rural
Development Center of Las Gaviotas and the establishment of three satellite
centers in that area. Las Gaviotas and its three satellites were to provide
agricultural, educational, health, general supply and communication services
to an estimated 1,100 to 2,000 families that were settling in an area of
about 50,000 Km. Las Gaviotas was also meant to conduct research and
experimentation in various aspects of rural development with an emphasis on
appropriate technology.
2.14      The sector survey that was included in the project was designed to
assist the Government to evaluate the status of its educational system and
formulate policies and priorities for its future development. Sector studies
were included in the project with the aim of helping to identify areas that
would merit future Bank lending. Those areas included manpower needs,
assessment of the INEM programs, and production of simple equipment and other
learning materials.
2.15      Technical assistance for the project provided for 40 staff-years of
specialists which were to be provided through the United Nations Development
Programme (UNDP) at an estimated cost of US$1.5 million. This assistance was
to be directed at strengthening educational administration, educational
planning, vorational supervision, industrial and agricultural instruction,
and developing programs for rural comprehensive schools and technical teacher
training. A non--governmental Colombian agency, Accion Cultural Popular
(ACPO), was designated to organize and supervise the educational extension
service of the rural comprehensive schools and to train its personnel.
Lastly, an evaluation of the project was to be based in part on a tracer
system that would involve the students of the project schools and a
representative group of students from traditional secondary schools.
Modification of Project Content
2.16      Project content underwent significant modification during
implementation due to changes in educational policies and priorities and
financial constraints. These modifications took place in 1977 and 1981 and
are outlined in the table that follows:

2.17    The project content revisions made in 1977 were mDtivated by
educational reform legislation enacted in December 1975 and January 1976.
That legislation (Law 43, and Decree-Laws 102, 088 and 089) restructured the
MOE and several autonomous educational entities, decentralized educational
administration, revised the system of educational finance, restructured
primary and secondary educational levels and revised their curricula. The
new structure for pre-university education became:
Pre-School                  - for children under six years of age
Basic                       - Grades 1-9
Middle Vocational           - Grades 10-11
Intermediate Professional  - Grades 12-13 (post-secondary)
2.18    The size of each of the 13 Rural Comprehensive Schools was reduced
and the Centers were converted to Rural Develoment Centers serving as primary
schools centers, because in those areas primary education opportunities were
considered so limited that they would not provide sufficient graduates for
the originally proposed secondary schools. It was agreed, however, that when
primary demands were met, the schools cou'! be converted or extended for use
as lower secondary schools. At the time of appraisal it was foreseen that
the student catchment area would have to be large for each school, and
dormitory and transportation facilities were planned accordingly. By 1977,
however, the Government had changed its position on this matter and wanted
smaller primary schools to serve smaller catchment areas without dormitory
and transportation facilities.
2.19    As regards the revision of the teacher training program, ICFES
withdrew from its commitment to the project because of financial
constraints. The MOE agreed to absorb this part of the program. ICFES also
withdrew from its commitment to the sector survey and sector studies and
these were deleted from the project. The reasons for this included: the
new Government did not think the studies merited a high priority and
financial constraints.
2.20    All of the changes made in project content in 1981 were based on
financial constraints affecting the Borrower.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Overview
3.01    The project required 8.75 years for completion instead of the
original estimate of 4 years. Implementation delays were primarily caused
by:
(a) significant policy changes enacted into law by a new govenment that
suspended project implementation for almost two years on the
grounds that project content was not consistent with newly
determined priorities;
(b) periodic shortages of counterpart funds; and
(c) weak project.



3.02    Within eight months after the loan had become effective a newly
elected Government assumed power and implementation, which had been slow from
the start, slowed dowa even more due to changes in the top level personnel in
agencies associated with the project. During its first 18 months in office
the Government enacted educational reform measures (para. 2.17) which altered
previously established priorities. This led the Government to suspend
implementation in mid-1975 until the project could be modified. Agreement on
project revision was reached between the Bank and the Government in 1977.  By
that time (1977) only 36% of the Loan had been disbursed.
3.03      Implementation continued at a  slow pace and in May 1978 (three
months before its term was to expire) the Government requested the Bank to
agree to a sharp reduction in the scope of the project (deleting all but 8 of
the Common Facilities Centers) and the cancellation of the balance of the
Loan (estimated at US$12.3 million) on the grounds that the project was not
consistent with priorities and development strategies of the Government.
This matter went unresolved until December 1978, four months after a new
Government came into office, when the Government withdrew its request for
cancellation and agreed to proceed with implementation but asked for, and
received, an extension of the Closing Date to December 31, 1981. Between
1978 and 1981 project implementation improved significantly, but delays were
encountered periodically due to shortages of counterpart funds and weak
management. However, by 1980 it became clear that financial constraints
would keep the Government from completing all components by the Closing Date,
but a formal request to reduce project scope was not submitted to the Bank
until July 1981. Agreement on the requested reduction of the project was
reached, and the closing date was extended a third time to March 31, 1982, by
which time project completion was accomplished.
Project Management
3.04    The Instituto Colombiano de Construcciones Escolares (ICCE) is a
semi-autonomous agency of the MOE. It has a staff of 917 employees and
maintains 26 regional offices located throughout the country. Its mission is
to plan and manage the national programs for school construction and the
procurement of school furniture and equipment. In 1969 the agency was chosen
to implement the First Education Project financed by the Bank and later it
also served as the PIU for the Second Education Project. ICCE's overall
implementation performance for the two projects was generally good.
3.05    In recognition of its past project implementation experience, the
Government, in agreement with the Bank, designated ICCE as the executing
agency for most of the project. Bowever, contrary to the appraisal mission's
recommendation that ICCE be the only agency responsible for the
administration, coordination and supervision of the entire project (SAR
para. 6.01), the Loan Agreement placed under ACPO the component related to
the education extension service (to be guided and supervised by the MOE), and
designated the Fondo Nacional de Proyectos de Desarrollo (FONADE) to
supervise the preparation of the sector studies.
3.06    During the first year of project implementation (1973/74), ICCE and
the MOE were effective in getting the project started, but for the rest of
the project's life (1974-1982) management was weak for the following reasons:



(a) Implementation responsibility and authority was concentrated in the
office of ICCE's Director General, but he and his top level
managers were unable to concentrate properly on the Bank's project
which represented only about 15% of ICCE's total budget for capital
investment in the period 1976-82.  In short, throughout mDst of the
implementation period the project did not receive the high priority
attention from ICCE that had been expected by the Bank. The Bank's
efforts to improve this situation were successful for short periods
of time, but a lasting resolution of this issue was not achieved.
(b) Staff turnover during the nine-year implementation period resulted
in changing the director general four times, and caused instability
among key staff members.
(c) In 1976, ICCE's pedagogical group was disbanded and tne MOE took
almost a year to establish separate units to guide the
implementation of the educational programs for the Common Facility
Centers and Rural Development Centers. Those units were finally
given legal status in 1979 but their coordination with ICCE was
consistently weak.
(d) Financial constraints of the Borrower made it difficult for the
Ministry of Finance to provide counterpart funds on time. 4/
Since this was a matter of priorities, the Government was
ill-advised in not giving the project the financial support that
had been promised because it jeopardized the success of the project
and the investment that it represented.
3.07      Project coordination between ICCE and the other agencies that
shared implementation responsibilites was consistently weak throughout the
life of the project. 5/ The Bank's recommendations to ICCE and the MOE for
strengthening coordination were not followed.  Those recommendations included
alternatives such as creating a coordinating committee or assigning specific
coordination functions to key staff members. In 1976, when the MOE was
reorganized and ICCE's pedagogical group was abolished, project coordination
between ICCE and the MOE became even weaker as ICCE's management insisted
that it had no authority over the staff of the MOE that was eventually
assigned to work on the educational components. In addition to hindering
implementation, this lack of effective project coordination also created
problems in the process of reporting project progress to the Bank. Progress
reports to the Bank were consistently late and incomplete from 1975 onward.
3.08    Most managerial problems could have been substantially reduced by
concentrating project implementation under a small coordinating office,
working exclusively for the project, and being responsible for the
administration of project funds independently of ICCE's experience in
implementing the previous two projets. In retrospect, it is evident that the
experience factors was offset by such things as changes in top level
personnel, a project that required more coordination than the previous two
projects, and organizational changes within the MOE and ICCE. To this must
be added the lack of solid support for the project manifested by the
Government during most of the period 1975-78, which led to a Government
request for project cancellation. That request was eventually withdrawn
after a new Government came to office and presided over the implementation of
4/ The Borrower agreed with this (see Attachment I, para. 2).
5/ The Borrower acknowledged that coordination was faulty (see Attachment I,
para. 3).



- 10 -
most of the project from 1978 to 1982, but even during that period ICCE's
management of the project showed the weakness already cited.
Sites
3.09    By July 1973 practically all sites for Common Facilities Centers and
Rural Development Centers had been selected; however, the 1976 revision of
the project required the selection of four new sites for Common Facilities
Centers that replaced original locations included in the SAR. Selection of
towns and neighborhoods included in the project was accomplished at an early
stage because a substantial number of poor urban areas lacking secondary
school services had been identified during project preparation. However,
good sites within those urban areas were difficult to find due to:
(a)  legal limitations which preclude ICCE from buying land; and
(b)  financial constraints of donors (departmental or municipal
governments) that provided poor sites that generally created
problems; for example:
(i) the poor quality of soils in Cartagena and Sincelejo required
unusual and costly reinforcement to foundations and structural
support of floors at ground level;
(ii)  suburbs poorly served by public transport and access roads in
bad condition (Fanja, Pasto, Quibd'o); and
(iii)  suburbs with public security risks (Medellin, Ibague and
Villavicencio).
3.10      Although in future projects, site-related problems would be
minimized owing to the current Bank policy which requires readiness for
project Implementation at the time of appraisal, the quality of sites should
be assured by including site acquisition in the cost of the project, so the
Government would be prepared to meet all necessary expenditures.
Design and Supervision of Schools
3.11      During implementation of the First and Second Education Projects
ICCE strengthened its architectural office by 1972 and enough manpower for
undertaking the preparation of the third project, including the design of all
24 Common Facilities Centers and 13 Rural Development Centers. Designs fully
prepared in 1973/74 were discarded in 1976 following the project revision,
and a second set of designs was prepared in 1978-80. Designs met the
educational purposes for which they were envisaged; pre-vocational occupation
orientation for the Common Facilities Centers and secondary education for the
Rural Development Centers.
3.12      Schedules of accommodation for the Rural Centers were drastically
reduced in the 1976 revision. The reduction was beneficial because designs
which are based on a modular system became more simple and coherent with the
current educational structure. This modest approach has proven to be good.
There are two large and complex non-project Rural Development Centers
(similar to those originally included in the project) that have been plagued
with problems, including critical levels of underutilization. Most project



- 11 -
Rural Centers would require to be expanded soon, but size of expansions
should be regulated by school mapping (para. 3.11).
3.13      In regard to the Common Facilities Centers, designs reflect little
or no improvement on what was prepared for INEMs under projects I and II.
The reasons for this situation are mainly:
(a) most benefits from direct experience of previous projects have been
lost due to staff turnover (para. 3.06); and
(b) poor client/architect communication between the MOE and ICCE,
particularly after the elimination of ICCE's pedagogical division.
There were problems of inconsistency between schedules of accommodation
(revised by ICCE) and curricula designed by the MOE reflecting poor
coordination between the MOE and ICCE. For example, in the construction of
the first group of eight Common Facilities Centers, ICCE included working
areas for carpentry, while the HOE was excluding carpentry from the
curriculum. However, it was possible to resolve this and similar problems
because the design of buildings was flexible enough to allow for the economic
conversion of facilities for current curriculum requirements.
Supervision (Civil Works)
3.14      ICCE's supervision of construction works operates at five levels,
two staff positions in the field (a field engineer/architect and a regional
manager) and three in Bogota headquarters (a division chief, an assistant
director for construction and the director general). Although staff
functions and responsiblities at each level are clearly defined, most
divisions of the field staff are actually designated at higher levels,
undermining authority of field staff who tend to approach issues with extreme
caution. This weakness appears at all levels, so the owner/contractor
relationship is not effective enough to maintain performance of contractors
within good quality standards. In sum, supervision of civil works was less
than effective and resulted in the development of various problems (para.
3.17).
Civil Works
3.15      As specified in the Loan Agreement, the Borrower initially called
for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) to award construction contracts,
but there was only a minimal response from Colombian firms of any consequence
and none from foreign firms. To remedy this, ICCE decided to use a revised
version of the official local bidding procedures for the project instead of
setting up a separate bidding method based exclusively on Bank guidelines.
The main aspects of the revised bidding procedures were:
(a)  pre-qualification requirements on the basis of financial, legal and
gross volume of productivity standards which generally yielded a
group of 80 firms out of about 300 contractors; and
(b)  bid evaluation included the comparison of each bid with an official
estimate (as required in local bidding). Generally, about 5OZ of
bids were rejected because they failed to satisfy all conditions.



- 12 -
Contrisetors
3.16      Although ICCE was unable to provide timely financing of its
construction program, constructors were generally cooperative in continuing
to carry out the terms of their contracts. However, construction workmanship
was generally mediocre, due in part to the weakness of ICCE's supervision
program and/or inadequate specifications. In the Common Facilities Centers,
the mission observed the construction problems that follow:
(a) rainwater seepage in 50% of the walls that have a northern
exposure, because joints in the brickwork are not water-tight;
(b)  in Ibague, roof gutters receiving rainwater from two cotr,;rg5ng
levels leak due to faulty workmanship;
(c)  in Cali, tile roofing is defective and rainwater leaks into 30% of
the rooms;
(d)  in Medellin, one of the structural columns is out of line; and
(e) in Sabanalarga, the lowered windows of the auditorium are bending
and falling out.
ICCE is attempting to have the contractors repair all known cases of
defective workmanship before the liability periods expire, but its cumbersome
procedures for dealing with such matters are time-consuming and often
ineffective.
Furniture and Equipment
3.17      The procurement of furniture encountered only minor problems, and
the quality of that furniture is generally good. However, the procurement of
equipment bad major problems that developed at an early stage of project
implementation. These problems were mainly due to the poor coordination
between the MOE and ICCE, the decision to purchase over half of the equipment
when school construction had barely begun, and underestimating the complexity
of storing so much equipment.
3.18      Taking into account the ill-timed and deficient supply of equipment
for the INEMs under two previous projects, at the time of project appraisal
the Borrower and the Bank recognized the need to strengthen the procurement
unit in ICCE. Therefore, steps were taken to upgrade the position of the
procurement officer to the level of an assistant director and to provide
additional staff. This move did little to improve procurement for the
project, however, because the procurement unit handled the national
procurement program for ICCE and the project was only a part of that program.
3.19      The first package of equipment to be procured was for the
implementation of the Teacher Training Program. Actions regarding this
matter were closely monitored by the Bank, which on several occasions urged
ICCE to accelerate procurement of that equipment. ICCE responded by
preparing architectural designs and equipment lists for all 24 Common
Facilities Centers and proposed the procurement of about 60% of the equipment



- 13 -
for both programs and Rural.Secondary Schools. ICCE also proposed plans for
starting the Common Facilities Centers construction program, and the Bank
accepted both proposal.
3.20      In late 1974 when the Borrower began to consider revising the
project, counterpart funds were sharply reduced and implementation slowed
down. This coincided with the adoption of Government regulations which ended
ICCE's privilege of import tax exemptions. Also, by 1975 educational reform
measures were being taken that would alter the organization of the Common
Facilities Centers and Rural Centers. These unforeseen developments had the
following adverse effects on the first phase of equipment procurement:
(a)  most of the equipment arrived at the port of Barranquilla in 1976,
where it remained for almost a year because ICCE did not have the
funds to pay the required taxes and customs fees;
(b)  while in customs, the equipment suffered from corrosion and
pilferage and ICCE reported that the loss was estimated at 2U,
however, the loss is suspected of having been higher (about 5%). A
more accurate review of the losses was hindered by incomplete
inventory records; and
xc)  about 10% of the equipment procured was no longer needed in the
Common Facilities Centers by 1976 because of the curricular and
school organizational changes that had been effected by the
Government's reform measures. Eventually, that equipment was
distributed to the satellite schools of the Common Facilities
Centers where it is being well used. Altogether, it is estimated
that about 10% of the funds spent on the first equipment
procurement may be considered as wasted.
3.21      In 1981, ICCE determined the balance of equipment and consumable
materials required for the 20 Secondary Centers and 13 Rural Primary Centers
as well as the equipment surplus available for distribution to schools
associated with the Common Facilities Centers. Procurement of this second
phase, amounting to US$3.2 million, was carried out within the last four
months of project implementation and most of the equipment had arrived by
July 1982. Delivery to the schools was expected to be completed by September
1982.
Maintenance
3.22      The Colombian educational system has very limited resources for the
maintenance of physical plant and equipment. Most preventive and routine
maintenance is under the responsibility of each institution, which is
allocated a relatively small amount of funds for maintenance in its annual
budget. In 1982 the 11 Common Facilities Centers that are in operation
received a total allocation of US$78,600 for maintenance, which represents
15% of the total annual budget per school. Furniture and equipment of
project institutions has not required major maintenance because most of it
has only had two or three years of use. Service to equipment carried out
under contract has proved to be successful (as in the case of Medelln where
classroom typewriters, that on the average have a weekly use of 50 hours, are
serviced regularly by contractors and remain in good condition). Buildings



- 14 -
of project institutions are new and do not require maintenance now. However,
in a few years the need for maintenance is expected to increase substantially
because inflation has resulted in the selection of more economical
specifications, which reduced the initial cost but will accelerate
maintenance expenditures. For example, wall paint in the last group of
Common Facilities Centers to be built is not of the washable type and will
require replacement about 50Z sooner (5-6 years) than it would take for
better quality wall paint. Expeditious maintenance during the liability
period is an unresolved problem. The MOE should undertake a study in order
to determine the real cost of maintenance of physical facilities and take
action for implementing it. It is well to point out that on the average most
equipment installed in project schools should be replaced in less than ten
years.  The Borrower has no provisions for making such replacements possible
because the necessary financial resources are simply not available.
Technical Assistance
3.23      Technical assistance for project implementation consisted of two
parts:
(a) assistance provided by the UNDP for strengthening educational
administration and planning, staff training; and
(b) assistance provided by ACPO to organize and supervise extension
service for the rural schools and train its personnel.
The UNDP in Colombia agreed to absorb a portion of the technical assistance
requirements of the project in its Country Program for the period 1972-76.
The total UNDP allocation to the education sector was about US$6.0 million
for the four year period, of which about US$1.5 million was designated to
cover the cost of 40 staff-years of technical assistance and related
equipment for the project. UNESCO served as the executing agency for the
program for the entire sector which initially consisted of 11 subprograms in
1973, but was reduced to 8 subprograms in 1975 due to financial constraints.
However, only about half of those subprograms offered technical assistance
related to the project. A summary of the project related subprograms as
revised in 1975 and implemented by 1976 follows.

(40.1

3.24      The technical assistance program outlined above also benefited
non-project schools, i.e., INEM schools of the first and second education
projects, other rural development centers (about 26), secondary agricultural
institutes, other technical schools, polythechnic institutes and the MOE.
Due to the lack of data, It is not possible to quantify the specific amount
of that technical assistance that went directly to the various elements of
the project.
3.25      Although the implementation of this technical assistance program
was generally successful, little evidence remalns to indleate that It had any
significant effect on the project ltself. This was due to the fact that its
implementation coincided with the period when project implementation was
either progressing slowly (1974) or was suspended by the Covernment
(197511976). Thus the project, which actually did not start making headvay
until 1978/1979, could not garner the desired benefits fro, that portion of
the technical assistance program.



- 16 -
3.26      The same fate befell the second part of the technical assistance
program which involved ACPO, a non-governmental agency of Colombia,
contracted by the MOE in October 1973 to render specific services to the
Rural Development Centers.  Between 1973 and 1976, ACPO fulfilled its
contract by:
(a) providing 149 courses for 'campesinos" on health, agriculture and
rural community development;
(b) giving rural community leadership training to 448 -campesinos- at
ACPO's headquarters in Sutatenza;
(c)  acquiring and equipping three mobile units (ACPO-mobiles) that
visited about 383 rural communities touching about 75,000 persons
with instructional programs covering health, sanitation, community
development, farming and domestic science; and
Cd) providing 15,000 hours of radio instruction for rural dwellers
through Radio Sutatenza, AC20's powerful radio network.
3.27      Had project implementation progressed according to the appraised
schedule, ACPO's technical assistance program would have greatly benefited
the Rural Development Centers. However, in 1976 when ACPO completed its
contract none of the project schools had been completed; thus the effects of
the program simply vanished. ACPO tried to extend its contract when it
became clear in 1976 that the construction of the rural comprehensive schools
was seriously behind schedule, but the MOE refused the extension because by
that time the Government's policy toward non-governmental agencies involved
in Government projects had changed.
Special Covenants
3.28      The Loan Agreement covenants that received less than full
compliance are listed below. A detailed listing of compliance with covenants
is shown in Annex 4.
(a)  Section 3.01(b)(i)-Design, construct, furnish and equip 20 Common
Facilities Centers. Almost all of the Centers were completed, but
one was only balf done by the Closing Date. The reason for this
was the unusually long time required to acquire a site for the
Center in Cartagena.
(b)  Section 3.01(b)(iv)-Conduct a Technical Teacher Training Program
for about 2,000 technical teachers. The Technical Teacher Training
Program was not implemented as originally planned. It was carried
out before the schools were constructed and staff was appointed,
thus its value to the schools is questionable. A more modest
program was subsequently carried out for teachers as the schools
opened.
Cc)  Section 3.05(a)-The Borrower shall appoint qualified directors for
the Common Facilities Centers and the Rural Development Centers at
least six months before the Centers open. Although qualified
persons are being appointed to the project schools in al-I cases,



- 17 -
their appointment is usually not made six months prior to the
opening of the given center. The main reason for this is that the
MOE usually lacks the necessary funds to make the appointments with
much lead-time.
(d)  Section 4.03(b)-The Borrower shall maintain adequate insurance on
buildings and facilities of the project. Insurance policies
covering the buildings and facilities have not been acquired.
Financial constraints and the lack of regulations related to
insurance for school premises are the reasons for non-compliance.
(e) Section 4.05-Close relationship shall be established between Rural
Development Centers and INCORA, ICA, SENA, and other development
agencies. Close relationships were never established between each
Rural Development Center and INCORA, ICA, SENA, ACPO and other
agencies of the Borrower. Those relationships have been weak and
sporadic at best.
(f) Section 4.07-Establish and maintain a Vocational Education
Supervisory Service. The vocational education extension service
was established as a function of the supervisory section of the
HOE, but with the reorganization of the MOE in 1976 the service
lost its identity and its functions were sub-divided into the two
supervisory sections that manage the programs for the INEM schools
and the Common Facilities Centers.
3.29      The Bank should remind the Borrower about the need to comply with
those covenants for which compliance is still possible, i.e., completion of
the Cartagena Center, finding a way to provide basic insurance coverage on
buildings, and strengthening vocational supervision for the Common Facilities
Centers.
Bank Performance
3.30      The Bank was prompt in developing the project from identification
to Board approval (18) months. During its implementation the project was
visited by a total of 20 supervision missions representing 33.2 staff-weeks
of effort. Almost alU of the missions (19) were staffed by either educators,
architects or both and their frequency was at least two missions per year
except in 1975 and 1981. 6/ There was good continuity of staff involvement,
6/ In 1975 only one supervision mission was carried out because the Borrower
was not prepared to receive other missions that were proposed by the
Bank. This was during the period when the Government had suspended
implementation. In 1981 there was only one supervision mission in
September; but that was considered sufficient since the project was
nearing its closing date.



- 18 -
as the same architect served the project from 1974 to its completion, one
educator from 1975 to 1979 and a second educator from 1979 to completion.
3.31      The Bank was consistently flexible in dealing with practically all
problem areas associated with the implementation of the project. Its
flexibility was most evident on two occasions (1977 and 1981) when the
Government proposed modifications to the project which the Bank generally
accepted. The Bank should have insisted in the early years of implementation
(1974/75) that the technical assistance program involving ACPO and the UNDP
be phased so that it would be in harmony with the opening of the first
schools. As it was, those agencies provided their assistance When none of
the schools were ready for operation. In retrospect, the Bank might have
looked more critically at the Government's 1977 proposal for modifying the
project with a reappraisal that would have assessed the country's financial
capacity to finance its share of project costs.
IV. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCES
Project Costs
4.01      The final cost of the project was US$29.3 million, which is 12%
below the appraisal estimate of US$33.5 million. A comparison between
estimated and actual costs by category including Bank/Borrower participation
is given in the table that follows.

58.9%         41.1%
4.02      The factors that contributed to the -12% difference between total
estimated costs are:
(a) the reduction in the number of Common Facilities Centers from
24 to 20;
(b) the reduction of the size of the 13 Rural Development Centers;
(c) the elimination of the 96 new primary schools and 462 extension
units which constituted the satellite network for the Rural
Development Centers; and
(d) the use of only half (49%) of the estimated amount for technical
assistance with the deletion of the sector survey and sector
studies, which accounted for almost US$0.5 million of unused funds
while another US$0.2 million was left unused in the technical
assistance plan for the Rural Development Centers.

4.03      Had all of these elements been implemented, as originally planned,
there would have been high cost overruns as shown by the table that follows:

4.04      The costs for furniture and equipment exceeded the appraisal
estimate by 202 and civil works (Category II) was only 3X under the appraisal
estimate despite the significant reduction of the construction component. In
these two cases the cost increases were due to the inflationary pattern that
started climbing sharply in 1973 (the project was appraised shortly before
the 1973 oil crises). The severity of cost escalation in Colombian
construction can be seen between December 1972 and May 1982 when the cost per
square meter of construction increased 800%.
4.05      In the other two major categories (III-IV) costs fell considerably
below the appraisal estimates because of the reductions in project scope
brought about by the project revisions in 1977 and 1981.
Use of Loan Proceeds
4.06      Annex 2 shows the appraised and actual disbursement schedule for
the proceeds of the Loan. It can be seen that by the Bank's FY77 when the
project should have been completed according to appraisal estimates, only 36%



- 21 -
of the Loan had been disbursed. There was only one change in the percentage
of disbursement during the life of the project. That change was agreed upon
when the project was revised in 1977, and the rate of disbursement for
Category II (civil works) was increased from 30 to 35%.
4.07      The end result was that US$2.1 million of the US$21.2 million Loan
was unused by the Borrower and cancelled by the Bank.
V. OPERATION OF PROJECT INSTITUTIONS
Overview
5.01      Policy changes and educational reform measures that took place
within the first two years of project implementation resulted in significant
changes to the project schools in 1977. The structure of the Common
Facilities Centers was changed by reducing the number of grade levels from
six to two and some of the subject areas were eliminated. The Rural
Development Centers were affected more drastically as they were converted
from secondary rural schools to primary schools that were supposed to have an
extensive network of satellite schools. This change also caused the
reduction of the size of these schools. There was a further complication for
the Rural Development Centers by the uncoordinated manner in which ACPO
implemented its training and rural organization program (para. 3.27). In a
subsequent reduction of the scope of the project in 1981, three of the 23
Common Facilities Centers were eliminated and the Rural Development Centers
were converted once again to rural lower cycle secondary schools, and their
satellite network was eliminated. The Las Gaviotas component was carried out
except for the three satellite centers that were eliminated in 1981. Only
four of the Common Facilities Centers have been in operation for more than a
year while seven others are in their first year of operation. Eight recently
completed Common Facilities Centers will open before the end of 1982 and one
was still under construction when the project closed and will now be
completed, at the Borrower's expense, by December 1982.
Attainment of Educational Objectives
5.02      The project's broad educational objective of extending diversified
secondary education to medium-sized cities and rural areas is in the process
of being met by the Common Facilities Centers. AtLanaent of this objective
is currently limited by the fact that only 7 of the 20 Common Facilities
Centers are fully operational. In addition, although 12 of the 13 Rural
Development Centers are operational, they are in a transitional phase in
their development from primary schools to first cycle secondary schools.
Enrollment and graduation comparisons for the seven operational Common
Facilities Centers are given next.

a/ This figure is the 1982 enrollment for the 11th grade which is expected
to graduate by the end of the year.
b/ This figure was reduced to 2,600 in 1977 when the project was reduced.
5.03      The actual enrollment for the Common Facilities Centers is 762 of
the appraisal estimate because two sites were changed after appraisal and the
Borrower overestimated the potential student population. Also, in three
sites at the time of appraisal it was expected that the Borrower would
provide transportation to extend the sphere of influence of the Common
Facilities Centers, but that has not taken place because the HOE has not had
the funds to acquire buses. As adjustments are made and the other centers
become operational, it is expected that the estimated enrollment target wlll
be realized and perhaps surpassed. It is also well to point out the
difficulty of comparing estimated and actual enrollments for the Common
Facilities Centers due to the change in the number of grades that these
schools now have. At appraisal the schools were to have six grade levels but
as of 1977 the grades have been reduced to two (10 and 11).
5.04      With regards to enrollment comparisons of the Rural Development
Centers it is misleading to base the comparison on the appraised estimate
because of the changes that were made in this program in 1977. It is more
appropriate to compare the actual enrollment with the modified figure of 1977
which placed the target at 2,600 students. In that case the actual
enrollment is still 59% of the expected target. This can be explained by the
Borrower's decision in 1980 to start converting the 13 primary school centers
to secondary centers serving grades 6-9. In short, the centers are now in a
transition period which is expected to enable them to reach their enrollment
target of 2,600 by ,1985.
5.05      The educational objective of training 2,000 technical education
teachers was not achieved as planned. The training program that was planned
and implemented under the UND? technical assistance program took place about
two years before the first schools were completed, therefore, project school
staff could not have been involved. The training program was actually
designed to serve technical education in general and the project schools were



- 23 -
only a part of a much larger whole (para. 3.24). However, the Borrower did
implement a less ambitious training program between 1979 and 1981 that
touched a total of 3,061 staff members directly and indirectly associated
with the Common Facilities Centers program. The short courses offered
totaled 7,275 hours and they concentrated on various aspects of operations in
the Common Facilities Centers.
5.06      The extension service was implemented by ACPO between 1975 and 1976
when none of the rural centers were in operation and thus most of its effects
dissipated by the time the first Rural Development Centers started to
function in 1979 (para. 3.27). Under current operations the Rural Centers
are conducting extension services of a limited nature for their respective
rural communities but these efforts are generally ineffective for lack of
resources, organization, and trained personnel.
5.07      The educational and developmental objectives for the Las Gaviotas
Rural Development Services Center were attained in general terms, although
those objectives were vague since the time of appraisal. The three satellite
centers that Las Gaviotas was supposed to serve (para. 2.13) were deleted
from the project at the request of the Borrower in 1981. At Las Gaviotas,
however, the facilities were greatly improved and the center is definitely in
a better position now than before to carry out its mission to assist in the
development of the surrounding rural area (the "llanos") as well as assisting
in rural development beyond its sphere of influence. The primary school at
Las Gaviotas is effectively serving about 200 students (grades 1-5) from the
surrounding area, providing agricultural and community development services
to the adult population, and making large strides in becoming an outstanding
center for the development of appropriate technology for rural development.
5.08      The educational sector survey and the sector studies originally
planned in the project were not realized in the early stages of
implementation because of financial constraints and a change of priorities on
the part of a new government (para. 2.19). These were eliminated from the
project in 1977 with Bank concurrance when the project was modified. The
Bank apparently conceded that the Borrower did not want the studies.
The Common Facilities Centers Program
5.09      Of the 24 Common Facilities Centers envisaged at the time of
appraisal, 20 were retained when the project content underwent its last
modification in 1981. At the time of completion the breakdown for the 20
Common Facilities Centers was:
7 - Fully operational
4 - Operating with the first of the two-year program and ready
for full operation in 1983
8 - Construction completed (6) or virtually completed (2)
1 - Construction about 50% completed (Cartagena), will be
completed by the Borrower.
The Government stated its commitment to use its own resources to build the
three Common Facilities Centers that were deleted in 1981.



- 24 -
The Purpose of the Common Facilities Centers
5.10      When appraised the Common Facilities Centers were to be part of the
INEK system by providing a more economical alternative to the INENs for
extending diversified secondary education. The Government concluded that
replicating the INEM model throughout the country was too costly. The main
objective of diversification was to train students so that they would find
easier access to the labor market, although the training provided was not
meant to produce skilled manpower.  But since appraisal, Colombia has
re-interpreted diversification to mean a curriculum that prepares a student
for the world of work by providing general vocational orientation 7/ in a
selected numbers of areas through practical work in workshops and
laboratories. This interpretation led to the establishment in 1976 of the
nine-year basic education structure, which is followed by two years of
"concentrated diversification" that are currently offered in the Common
Facilities Centers program. By virtue of the reforms enacted in 1975/76 the
Common Facilities Centers have three other missions in addition to providing
a vocational orientation for the students of their satellite secondary
schools, those are:
(a) provide special courses to 9th grade students and adults of the
surrounding area as part of a community service program;
(b) provide technical assistance to the secondary schools of their
respective Departments that want to improve their diversified
programs; and
(c) provide in-service teacher training on diversified secondary
education to teachers in their respective Departments.
One can deduce from the foregoing that the Common Facilities Centers are
expected to act as educational development centers for their respective
Departments. The eleven centers that are in operation are, in fact,
performing these functions, although some are more successful than others in
their efforts. The center of Medellin, for example, is having excellent
success in providing all of the services mentioned.
Administration of the Common Facilities Centers
5.11      National atministration of the Common Facilities Centers is handled
centrally by the MOE through a special pedagogical unit that plans the
opening of each new center, trains personnel, develops operational budgets,
recommends the appointment of staff, supervises operations, and coordinates
with ICCE on matters pertaining to physical plant, furniture and equipment.
7/ A general vocational orientation means an initial phase of vocational
training that introduces the student to a given vocational area, provides
tne student with basic skills for that area, and generally prepares the
student to enter an intermediate level of additional training.



- 25 -
At the local level each Facilities Center is headed by a director and,
although the educational functions of the centers are more diverse than
foreseen at the time of appraisal, the administrative system developed at
appraisal has proved adequate. The scheduling system is relatively simple
and effective. The students from the satellite schools are scheduled for two
full days a week as planned during appraisal. In fact, no other system could
work as well, given the distances between the Common Facilities Center and
the satellite schools. In this manner commuting problems for the students
are minimized, two shifts are able to operate daily and the facilities
achieve a high utilization rate between 80-90%. By scheduling students on a
two day a week pattern the Common Facilities Centers have a fifth day of the
week when they do not receive regular students. That fifth day each week is
used to offer courses for the community, rendering technical assistance to
other schools, or conducting in-service teacher training.
5.12      Common Facilities Centers' satellite school relationships are
generally satisfactory. Coordination is mainly through a steering committee
composed of the principals of the satellite schools and the Common Facilities
director. The eleven centers that are already in full or partial operation
have a total of 112 satellite schools of which 96 are public and 16 are
private. The number of satellite schools per Common Facilities Center ranges
from 3 to 21. Although enrollment data were unavailable, the directors of
the centers and the MOE pedagogical group confirmed that enrollments at the
satellite schools had increased significantly as a result of their
association with the program.
Curriculum of the Common Facilities Centers
5.13      The diversified curriculum for secondary education is divided into
two parts covering 35 weekly periods: a general academic core having 21
weekly periods which must be taken by all students, and a vocational core
having 14 weekly periods offering various options. The academic core is
offered in the satellite schools with the exception of laboratory work in
physics and chemistry which is given in the Common Facilities Centers. The
vocational core is given in the Facilities Centers and includes the five
areas listed below. Since all of the centers do not offer all of the areas,
the numbers in parenthesis indicates how many Common Facilities Centers offer
each area.
(20) Natural Sciences (Earth science, biology, chemistry, physics)
(8) Industry (drafting, metals, electricity, electronics)
(18) Commerce (Business education)
(20) Health and Nutrition (aimed at community service)
(8) Applied Arts (music, art, designing, drafting, ceramics)
5.14      The quality of the application of this curriculum in the 11 Common
Facilities Centers that are in full or partial operation varies. However, it
is generally good considering that they have been working under certain
constraints, such as having incomplete equipment, having too few consumable
teaching materials, teaching students who are generally poorly prepared for
the Common Facilities Centers program, working with a new system that has no
precedence and having the program taught by teachers who have been exposed to
a limited and improvised program. This situation will improve before the end
of 1982 when all of the equipment, teaching materials and library books will



- 26 -
have been installed in each center. Also, there are efforts to reduce the
student preparation gap through closer working relationships between the
Common Facilities Centers and the satellite schools. In this regard the
center at Medellin has developed a program that could serve as a model for
others. The program exposes 9th grade students to part of the Common
Facilities Centers' program a year before they enter it and assists the
teachers of the satellite schools to strengthen the articulation of their
program with that of the center.
5.15      The two-year vocational orientation curriculum is not meant to
produce skilled workers, and for that reason some of the more successful
centers, like the one in Medellin, are thinking about adding a two-year
post-secondary program in the future. That program would produce a -tecnico
profesional" (a technician). In fact, Medellin, has already submitted such a
proposal to the MOE. Although it might be premature at this time for any
Common Facilities Center to undertake such an expansion of its program, it
will almost be necessary for some of the centers to do so within a few years
in order to open new training opportunities for their graduates.
The Common Facilities Centers' Students
5.16      By design the centers are located in areas populated by low income
families. A sample of 117 students from 10 Centers indicates that 69% of the
fathers of those students earn between US$95-240 per month and 8% have no
income at all. The educational level of the parents was also reported low
with 72% of the fathers and 652 of the mothers having less than eight years
of schooling. Student data collected and analyzed by the Diversified
Secondary Education Study (DiSCuS) involving 697 students from four centers
that are fully operational also point to the low socio-economic status of the
Common Facilities Centers students when compared to a central group of
non-project school students (Annex 5). That comparison also shows that
project school students tend to perform less well on the relevant achievement
tests than the non-project school students. These data outline the
educational challenge faced by the Common Facilities Centers, and also
support the decision to create such institutions as a means of not only
extending diversified education, but of reaching economically deprived
students.  Unlike the graduates of the INEM schools, whose socio-economic
level is higher and who have a tendency to enter higher education, the
majority (about 95%) of the project school graduates have to enter the labor
market or a higher level of vocational training since they are economically
and academically ill-prepared for university entrance.
The Teachers of the Common Facilities Centers
5.17      The 11 operational centers currently have a total of 326 teachers,
all of whom are qualified according to the standards of the MOE. It has not
been as difficult to recruit qualified teachers as was anticipated at the
time of appraisal. About 40 of the teachers carry the title of instructor
because they are expert in the subject area that they teach but lack formal
pedagogical training except for what they have acquired through the project's
teacher training program offered by the MOE. The major difficulty
encountered in staffing the centers when they are ready to become operational
is the inability of the MOE to make staff appointments promptly because of
financial limitations.

The Program of the Rural Development Centers
5.18      The program of the Rural Development Centers is beset by problems
that eminate from the changes of direction that it has received during
implementation. A program that originally started as a rural secondary
education effort changed in 1977 to a rural primary education program, and
returned in 1981 to its original secondary level but on a significantly
reduced scale. All but two of the 13 rural centers are in operation. Of the
two inoperative centers, one (Unguia) will start to function in 1983 and the
other (Sibundoy) is being converted to a rural adult training center at the
insistence of the local community. The other 11 rural centers are operating
mostly with the first two secondary grades (6-7) and will have the four
grades (6-9) of that program by 1984. Their current enrollment of 1,551
students is therefore only 22% of the appraisal estimate of 7,000. In fact,
it will be impossible for them to reach the appraisal enrollment estimate
because their construction design was reduced as a result of the 1977
modification of the project. However, they will probably reach the revised
enrollment target of 2,600 students within the next 3-4 years. The changes
in the scope of this project component occurred because a new government
assumed power shortly after the project started (1974) and adopted a
drastically different position than the previous government had in regard to
the Rural Development Centers. At appraisal the Bank did not anticipate how
the new government would support the project in general or this component in
particular.
The Purpose of the Rural Development Centers
5.19      The current role of the Rural Development Centers is divided into
three parts:
(a) provide the lower cycle (grades 6-9) of diversified secondary
education to the students of their respective rural areas (only
about 50% of that task is currently being done);
(b) provide educational extension services for rural communities
consistiag of adult literacy programs, improvement health and
housing conditions, promotion and organization of rural community
development (only about 30 of this currently being done); and
(c) provide instructional services and supervision for the primary
schools of the surrounding rural area (about 25% of this currently
being done).
5.20      Its current role is similar to the one established at appraisal,
except that the Rural Development Centers were supposed to be larger. In
addition to being subjected to changes that have delayed their development,
the Rural Development Centers are also hindered in carrying out their tasks
by:
(a) limited operational budgets;
(b) lack of adequate student transportation in rural areas where the
distances are significant; and
(c) lack of properly trained staff for rural development.



- 28 -
5.21      The irony of this situation is that one of those problem areas (b
above) was supposed to have been resolved at the time of appraisal when the
original construction plans called for student dormitories and some bus
transportation. Another problem (c above) was handled when ACPO implemented
a training program for rural development staff. In both cases, however, the
plans failed as dormitories and buses were eliminated in the 1977 revision of
the project when the size of the centers was reduced (para. 2.18), and ACPO
conducted its training program when the rural centers did not exist (para.
3.27).
5.22      This component of the project is deficient but it can be salvaged
prcvided the MOE mounts an efficient and energetic effort within a year to
address those weaknesses cited previously (para. 5.20).
Operating Costs
5.23      The table that follows shows actual and appraisal estimates of the
operational costs per student in the Common Facilities Centers and the Rural
Development Centers and includes a rough comparison with actual per student
cost in the INEN's and non-project rural centers.
Operational Costs per Student (US$)
(In 1982 Prices)
Appraisal           Actual
Estimate   US$       Cost
11 Common Facilties          343              326 (-5Z)
Centers
INEM                       -               436
11 Rural Development         210              540 (+157Z)
Centers
Non-Project Rural          -               700
Centers
5.24      The fact that only 11 of the 20 Common Facilities Centers are in
their initial phase of operation and that their enrollments have not yet
reached their expected levels distorts the comparison given in the table.
Nonetheless, the actual cost is 5% below the appraisal estimate measured in
1982 prices. A breakdown of total operational costs shows that 88Z of that
total is consumed by personnel salaries and 12% for general operational
expenses. Of the 88% of costs that represent personnel salaries, 48% goes
for salaries of administrative personnel. This is high currently because
most of the administrative staff is appointed when the Common Facilities
Centers start to operate, while the teaching staff is appointed as the
enrollment develops. In other words, during their initial operational phase
the centers are top-heavy with Administrative personnel. In a well-
established center like the one in Nedellfn, the per student cost is US$267
or 18% below the average cost for the 11 Common Facilities Centers. Although
a direct comparison between Common Facilities Centers and INEM's is not
possible because of the differences between the structure of the two types of
schools, the INEM per student cost is given in the table to draw a rough
comparison.



- 29 -
5.25      The table also shows that in the Rural Development Centers the
actual per student costs are 157Z above appraisal estimates. In this case
personnel salaries constitute 96Z of the total operational costs; that leaves
only 4% for general operational expenditures.  Administrative personnel
absorb 70X of the total expenditures for personnel, but at least 20% of that
administrative staff is composed of technical personnel that works in the
communities and not In the schools. As in the case of the Comon Facilities
Centers, the full complement of admnlistrative staff is appointed to each
rural center as soon as the school opens regardless of the size of the
student enrollment. This creates a distortion of ratios of administrator-
teacher and adminlstrator-student and increases the cost of administration.
As the rural centers increase their student enrollments this distortion will
balance out, as can be seen in four of the well-established rural centers
(Cienega, Los Palmitos, Santander and Turbo) where the per student costs are
lower than the average ranging from US$315 to 395.
VI. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Project Generation
6.01      During the project generation period (appraisal) the Bank failed to
foresee how differently a new government would look upon the project. When a
new government assumed power in 1974 eight months after the date of
effectiveners, project implementation slowed down and was eventually
suspended in 1975 as the Government began to consider posslble changes. By
1976 the Covernment proposed drastic changes which the Bank accepted and the
project was amended In 1977. At appraisal the Bank should have detected the
possibility of changes in attitude on the part of a new Government. The
design of the project should have been made more flexible in order to m*ke
future changes, if necessary, without drastic modiflcations (paras. 3.02 and
3.03).
6.02      The original deslgn of the project was clearly focused on urban and
rural secondary education, and all of the components, save two, were directly
connected to that level of education. The sector survey and sector studies
were only indirectly linked to secondary education but the justlflcatlo for
their inclusion in the project was sound. However, the inclusion of the Las
Gaviotas component appears to have been made without any linkage
considerations, and the rationale for its inclusion In the project is vague
in the SAR, v-rking papers, and the documents In the project file. In the
documentation there are only vague hints that by strengthening Las Gaviotas
as a rural development center the stage could have been set for a follow-up
Bank project in rural development. This component should have been more
clearly defined and justified at appraisal. Because of this omission, Bank
supervision of this component was always difficult during implementation
(para. 5.07).
Project Objectives
6.03      The project objectives were generally clear and thorough with the
exception of the above cited case of Las Caviotas. However, the objective
relative to training 2,000 technical teachers was based on the erroneous



- 30 -
assumption that such teachers were virtually non-existent. In retrospect one
sees that, despite the failure of the teacher training program as originally
designed, the Common Facilities Centers are finding qualified teachers
without much difficulty. The project should have been made more cohesive by
excluding those objectives that dealt with Las Gaviotas, the ambitious
technical teacher training program and the sector studies. These objectives
made tue project more complicated and overloaded the implementation capacity
of the Borrower (para. 5.05).
Project Implementation
6.04      The factors that had adverse effects on project implementation
were: (a) policy changes and reform measures that altered the organization
and programs of the Common Facilities Centers and Rural Development Centers
and caused the new Government to re-think its position with regard to the
project; (b) financial constraints; and (c) weak project management.
Modifications in project content were affected in 1977 and 1981 by amending
the Loan Agreement but in both cases the amount of the Loan was not
affected. After extending the Closing Date on three different occasions the
project was completed in almost nine years. Although it is difficult to
predict how a new government is going to handle an on-going project, the
appraisal process did not foresee a year in advance that the new Government
would call for drastic changes. The inference here is obvious, that the
appraisal process should take Government changes into consideration when
those changes are within a year of the appraisal period (para. 2.17).
6.05      The Bank overestimated ICCE's capacity to implement the project by
relying on that agency's experience in the implementation of the previous two
projects. ICCE's experience was definitely a positive factor, but the Bank
did not foresee the dilution of that institutional experience by changes in
top level management and the reorganization of the MOE. This experience
serves as a reminder that institutional building is vulnerable to changes
such as those cited above. ICCE's propensity for centralized management
eventually resulted in having the project treated as a distant relative
within the more immediate 'family' of ICCE construction projects. A small
implementation unit within ICCE with exclusive responsibility for the project
and closely linked with the pedagogical group of the MOE, instead of having
the Director of ICCE act as the project director, may have avoided these
problems (para. 3.08). 8/
6.06      The good efforts of the UNDP and ACPO in implementing the technical
assistance program and the rural educational extension service were all but
lost because they were carried out on time, while the construction of the
schools that were to benefit from those efforts fell behind schedule.
Coordination between these two non-governmental agencies on one side and the
MOE and ICCE on the other was ineffective.  This experience points to the
need of building some flexibility into the implementation schedules of
projects that involve separate agencies. It also stresses the need for
built-in processes that will ensure effective coordination (paras. 3.25,
3.26, 3.27 and 3.31).
6.07      Financing of the project resulted in recurrent problems with
counterpart funds, indicating that the Government did not give the project
the high priority that it merited.  The Bank should have taken a firmer
position than it did in this regard (paras. 3.06(d), 3.31).
8/ The Borrower expressed agreement with this conclusion (see Attachment I,
para. 3).



- 31 -
6.08      Equipment, procurement suffered serious reversals because of
unforeseen circumstances. While the decision to procure a major portion of
the equipment and store it until the schools were constructed was justified
at the time, subsequent events caused negative results, i.e., losses due to
pilfering while the equipment was delayed in customs, and program changes
that made about 10% of the equipment unnecessary. The best assurance for the
successful scheduling of procurement is probably a well coordinated plan that
meshes procurement with the project's phased construction program. Early
procurement before construction is well underway results in the need to store
equipment over an extended period and the possibility of program changes that
will render some acquired equipment unnecessary (paras. 3.17, 3.18, and
3.20).
6.09      The performance of the Bank was generally acceptable in terms of
acting promptly during the project generation stage, the frequency and
staffing of its supervision missions and the exercise of flexibility when
dealing with implementation problems. Its performance could have improved
during the critical period of 1975-77 when the Government, whose term covered
the period 1974-78, showed reluctance and hesitancy in project implementa-
tion. In retrospect, it would have been well if the Bank had been more firm
in regard to the Borrower's proposal to amend the Loan Agreement in 1977
instead of agreeing to make all of the reductions in project scope and maiin-
taining the Loan at the same amount. At that time a re-appraisal of the
project would have identified with more precision those factors that were
detrimental to effective implementation. This would have set the stage for
modifying the project in such a way as to give it a better change for
success (paras. 3.30, 3.31).
Project Outcomes
6.10      An assessment of the educational and operational outcomes is
limited by the fact that only 11 of the Common Facilities Centers and 11 of
the 13 Rural Development Centers are in operation, and of these only seven
Common Facilities Centers are in full operation. Of the two types of
schools, the Common Facilities Centers are showing better results. These
centers are mostly located in low income sections of their respective cities
and the majority of their students come from economically deprived families.
The sites upon which they were constructed were donated by local government
agencies which meant that the sites were not of the best choice and required
costly preparation. This indicates the advisability of including site costs
in future projects to ensure acquisition of quality sites that will not
require excessive preparation costs (paras. 3.10, 5.11).
6.11      Costs for construction and equipment were high for both types of
schools due to inflationary increases during the implementation period which
spanned almost nine years. Although the experience of having cost overruns
because of extended delays in project completion is not new, it would be well
to emphasize more this possible danger to current and future Borrowers
(para. 4.04).
6.12      The Common Facilities Centers program is getting off to a
reasonably good start despite its many limitations and it is improving. It
is offering educational services not only to its regular students but also to
a variety of other students, to the communities through adult programs and to



- 32 -
schools and teachers throughout each Department.. In this regard they are
exceeding appraisal expectations. Since the Common Facilities Centers
model represents an alternate and innovative means of delivering specialized
secondary educational services, its development should be followed up by the
Bank for a few years and eventually evaluated to assess its impact. Although
the 'start-up' cost per student for the Common Facilities Centers is high,
there are indications (Medellirn, Cficuta) that once the centers become fully
operational, these costs are lower than any other existing model for
extending diversified education (paras. 5.23, 5.24).
6.13      The Rural Development Centers are striving to regain its direction
after being subjected to drastic changes in 1977. The premise upon which the
program is based is sound, but the software required to transform that
premise to reality is weak. ACPO set some of that software in place in
1975-76, but the timing was wrong, and that input was lost by the time the
Common Facilities Centers began to operate. This stresses the importance of
assuring at appraisal and subsequently at supervision that effective
coordination will be exercised in the implementation of related project
components (para. 3.25). Further, the potential for the success of these
centers is present and the Government should try to salvage the progran and
ensure that it reaches its potential by: strengthening the management of the
program in the MOE, providing stronger supervision at each of the sites,
providing training for the local staff, and strengthening the links with the
rural communities (paras. 5.20 and 5.22). The project has shown that the
infrastructure for rural educational administration and mangement is weak.
As the Bank proceeds to assist Colombia through the Fifth Education Project
in rural primary education it should give particular attention to this aspect
of the project.
6.14      The Las Gaviotas Rural Development Services Center benefited from
the project in terms of its physical plant, its primary school and related
facilities. It also acquired shop equipment that has assisted in
strengthening the school's vocationally oriented program and the center's
production of innovative appropriate technology for rural development, i.e.,
small hydro-electric generators, windmills, solar energy heat generators,
water pumps, and various other machines.  In recent years the center has
acquired considerable national status as a leader in the development of
appropriate technology. Unfortunately, the development of the three
satellite centers was not implemented because of financial constraints. Las
Gaviotas was an -add on" project component that had practically no relation
to the other components. Its focus was exclusively on rural development.
Its inclusion in the project is difficult to explain, except that the
appraisal mission saw the possibility of Las Gaviotas and its three
satellites becoming a model for rural development that could be replicated
through a follow-up Bank project. The appraisal of this component was not
what it should have been.
6.15      The other project components did not fare well.  ACPO's input was
efficiently implemented, but its effect was lost. Technical assistance was
also efficiently implemented by the UNDP and UNESCO, but it was virtually
lost as far as the Common Facilities Centers and Rural Development Centers
programs are concerned.  The Bank's supervision as regards technical
assistance failed to see the consequences of having this component proceed on
schedule while the rest of the project fell behind schedule. The Bank should



- 33 -
have assessed those consequences and taken measures to suspend the
implementation of technical assistance until it could benefit the project, or
cancel that component. The sector survey and studies were eventually deleted
and the training program for technical teachers wbich was to develop into a
national program did not materialize. In retrospect, it seems that these
components were either too ambitious, or they were planned without a careful
assessment of the Borrower' s capacity to manage, coordinate and finance
components of that complexity (paras. 3.23, 3.25, 3.26 and 3.27).

Dear Sirs:
After perusing the report submitted by you regarding the project covered
by Loan Agreement 920 (CASD and CDR) and having reviewed the background data
and gone through step by step the continuous changes and modifications made, I
would like to make certain comments.
-    Because of the political changes and the inevitable changes in
personnel entailed by them, it was impossible to revie. every detail of the
project; however, I found the evaluations presented in the report to be
accurate, such as that the change in the technical specifications of the
projects, the problems concerning funding and the lack of provision at the
start for certain key aspects, meant that the projects suffered from
shortcomings right from the start.
-    Mention must be made of the lack of coordination consistently felt
at all levels; this problem could have largely been avoided if an autonomous
project management office had been set up, as you recommended.
We are aware that the shortcomings in the implementation and execution of
the project were innumerable, but of a nature inherent in any program being
established for the first time, even with the wholehearted cooperation and
unanimous desire to serve on the part of all who participate in one way or
another.

ICGE will always be ready to provide the technical assistance needed for
any type of action consistent with its purposes and in the conviction that the
positive experiences presented will serve as a basis for improving subsequent
projects.

/s/ Jaime Calderon Bruges
Director General, ICCE
