MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF GHANA
FOR AN URBAN ENVIRONMENTAL SANITATION PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed credit to the Republic of Ghana for SDR 47.8 million, the equivalent of
US$71.0 million, on standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity, to help finance the
Urban Environmental Sanitation Project. Parallel co-financing of about US$4.0 million
equivalent is expected from the Nordic Development Fund and the Government of the
Netherlands. The Government of Ghana (GOG) would contribute about US$8.9 million
equivalent, and the participating Metropolitan and Municipal Assemblies would
contribute about US$3.5 million equivalent.
2.    Sector Background About half of Ghana's total GDP is non-agricultural, in
industry and services. These largely urban-based sectors of the national economy have
been the most dynamic. Between 1980 and 1994 the industry and services sectors grew
on average by about four percent and seven percent per year respectively, while the
agriculture sector grew at about one percent. The achievement of rapid economic growth
over the medium term will depend in large part on improved agricultural production and
export performance. At the same time, growth of agriculture is likely to foster the
development of urban-based activities linked to it. These include the processing of
agricultural and forestry products, the transfer and storage of farm outputs, and the
provision of commercial and financial services. Ghana's current drive to promote new
investment, both foreign and domestic, would also contribute to the development of new
manufacturing enterprises (catering to both the export and domestic markets) in urban
areas.
3.    Comparative country data show that economic development and urban growth are
closely linked, that per capita incomes are consistently higher in urban areas, and that
urbanization increases with economic growth more rapidly at lower income levels than at
higher ones. Ghana, with a GNP per capita of about US$430 (1994) and about one-third
of its population urbanized, has a substantially smaller portion of its national economy in
non-agricultural sectors than other countries with similar income and urbanization levels.
This suggests that, as Ghana's national economic performance continues to improve, the
share of urban-based economic activities is likely to expand considerably faster than in
the past.
4.    Economic growth in Ghana is bringing about a transition from a predominantly
rural to a quasi-urban society. Over the past three decades, the urban population,
estimated at 5.5 million in 1993, has consistently grown at a higher rate than the national
population. The level of urbanization--the proportion of total population living in urban



2
areas--rose from 26 percent in 1965 to 35 percent in 1993. At the current urban growth
rate of 4.2 percent per year, the urban population would double in 17 years.
5.   In Ghana's five major cities, about 40 percent of the population pays to use public
latrines that are unclean, inconvenient and lack privacy; 15 percent use bucket latrines
which have been banned because of the health hazard to conservancy workers; 40 percent
use household water closets that usually overflow to street drains; and 5 percent use
traditional or improved pit latrines. Few schools have operational sanitation facilities,
and few children are taught or allowed to use public facilities. At present, most fecal
waste generated in Ghana's urban centers is discharged untreated into city streets and
drains, and many neighborhood "sanitary sites" (plots where households take their solid
waste and where public latrines are located) become focal points for disease transmission.
Currently only about half of the solid waste generated within Ghana's five largest cities is
collected and disposed in dumps outside neighborhoods. There are no proper landfills for
solid waste disposal. Disease transmission and flooding due to inadequate drainage in
densely populated areas cause huge economic losses.
6.    Data from the Ghana Extended Poverty Study (1995) indicate that there were
about 1.46 million poor people in urban areas in 1992. This breaks down into about
350,000 in Accra and about 1.11 million in other urban areas. The gap between urban
and rural poverty appears to be much smaller than suggested by earlier profiles. In 1992
the incidence of poverty was 33 percent in the rural forest area and 38 percent in the rural
savannah area. The percentage of poor people in urban areas was 23 percent in Accra and
28 percent in other cities and towns. While it is important for Ghana to focus on the
alleviation of rural poverty, it is critical to simultaneously address urban poverty issues
and take measures to address them before they assume unmanageable proportions.
7.    The urban poor tend to cluster in identifiable areas of Ghana's major cities.
Various studies have shown that lower-income urban areas have the highest densities, the
lowest social indicators (education and health), and the lowest levels of infrastructure and
services. They also account for the vast majority of all epidemic and preventable
diseases. A 1991 survey of services in 17 lower-income communities Accra yielded the
following profile: (a) Secondary roads are few or non-existent. Many sections of the
communities are inaccessible by vehicle. About half of the existing secondary roads are
rated "bad". (b) In 10 of the 17 communities less than half of the houses had piped water
connections. The quality and reliability of the water supply is inadequate. (c) Drainage
is poor, with numerous localized flooding problems. The few existing drains tend to be
improperly built and clogged by rubbish and silt. (d) Sanitation is very bad, with few
household toilets or latrines. Public toilets are in disrepair. Night soil is dumped in and
around the communities and flows into drains. (e) Solid waste collection is erratic or
non-existent. There are few communal rubbish containers; sometimes these are not
emptied regularly. Open rubbish dumps are common. (f) Most houses have electricity,
but quality is substandard (low voltages and interruptions). Street lighting is non-existent
or inadequate.

8.    The most important government policy related to urban development is the
decentralization program mandated by the 1992 Constitution and the Local Government
Act (No. 462) of 1993. Ghana's local government Assemblies, which are corporate
bodies, are responsible for providing basic services and local infrastructure. Assemblies
are composed of two thirds elected and one third appointed members. Their Chief
Executives are appointed but must be approved by two-thirds of Assembly members. An
Urban Strategy Review carried out jointly by the Government and the World Bank in
1993-94 concluded that: (a) continued improvements in basic urban infrastructure and
services (roads, water supply, telecommunications, drainage, sewerage) are needed to
increase the productivity of urban households and firms, but investments must be
carefully selected; (b) basic infrastructure and services for the urban poor can be
improved through targeted community upgrading programs; (c) urban service delivery
should be made more efficient and sustainable through competition, more reliance on
commercial principles, private sector participation, and attention to demand; (d) further
efforts are needed to obtain long-lasting improvements in revenue mobilization by local
Assemblies; (e) sanitation and waste management are the highest priority urban
environmental problems; and (f) impediments to land transfer, land titling and private
land development need to be removed.
9.    Project Rationale. The project would deal with basic services whose deficiencies
constrain urban economic development and depress living conditions for large numbers
of people, especially the poor. Environmental sanitation has received relatively little
attention, while other aspects of urban development--such as transport and water supply--
have been allocated substantial funding from the GOG and the donor community.
Ghana's established decentralization policy clearly assigns to local governments the
responsibility to provide environmental sanitation services. It is therefore an appropriate
time to begin building up the capacity of the Assemblies to deal with these serious
problems. The GOG's ten year (1991-2000) National Environmental Action Plan
(NEAP) includes urbanization as one of four main areas for intervention. Sanitation and
waste disposal are highlighted as major issues. The NEAP calls for the implementation
of urban waste management and sanitation projects as a top priority; the improvement of
urban drainage in coastal cities; the establishment and implementation of environmental
and health standards; and the adoption of effective land use control mechanisms. The
project is supported by prior, recent sector work (see paragraph 8).
10.   Project Objectives. The objectives of the project are: (a) to promote productivity
and raise living standards in Ghana's major cities, especially for lower-income people, by
improving drainage, sanitation, and solid waste services; (b) to help establish better
institutional and financing mechanisms and more effective policy frameworks so that
improvements are sustained over time; and (c) build up the capacity of the Metropolitan
and Municipal Assemblies (MAs) to manage urban environmental sanitation services.
11.   Project Description. The project would cover Ghana's five major cities (Accra,
Kumasi, Sekondi-Takoradi, Tema, and Tamale), which have a combined population of
about 3.1 million. The project would have five main components: (a) storm drainage; (b)



4
sanitation; (c) solid waste; (d) upgrading of low-income urban areas; and (e) capacity-
building. Physical components represent around 83 percent of total project costs;
capacity-building, design, and supervision services the other 17 percent. The drainaze
component would improve primary and secondary drains to alleviate chronic flooding
problems in central business areas of Accra, Kumasi and Sekondi-Takoradi. The
sanitation component would cover all five cities and include high-priority investments in
household, school, and public sanitation facilities as well as septage treatment and
disposal facilities. Emphasis would be placed on strengthening the city governments'
capacity to plan and manage sanitation services while contracting with private providers
for most construction, operation, and maintenance. Assistance in solid waste would
cover the development of new landfill sites in Kumasi, Sekondi-Takoradi, and Tamale to
replace exhausted open dumps. The project would also provide financial and technical
assistance to privatize refuse collection and equipment maintenance in all the cities. The
community upgrading component would cover seven lower-income areas in Accra,
Kumasi, and Sekondi-Takoradi. Upgrading would include drainage, water supply,
sanitation, solid waste, roads, paths, and street lighting. The upgrading component
(expected to benefit around 265,000 people) is being undertaken with active community
participation in preparation and implementation. The project's capacity-builing
component would provide technical assistance, training, and equipment to improve the
ability of the five participating MAs to manage basic services. Technical assistance
would emphasize cost accounting of waste management, contract management, and
municipal finance, especially revenue collection. The project would also seek to improve
the capacity of central agencies such as the Ministry of Local Government and Rural
Development (MLGRD), the Ministry of Works and Housing (MWH), and the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to set policies and standards for waste
management and provide support to local governments. Finally, the project would
include a small amount of financing to continue the modernization of the land titling
system begun under the IDA-assisted Urban II project.
12.   Project Financing. Total project cost is estimated at US$89.3 million. IDA
would provide a credit of US$71.0 million (80 percent). The GOG would finance about
10 percent and the participating MAs and beneficiaries 6 percent. The MAs' contribution
is estimated at about US$3.5 million, mainly representing a 10 percent share of the
upgrading programs in Accra, Kumasi, and Sekondi-Takoradi and half of the privatized
waste collection. The Nordic Development Fund and the Government of the Netherlands
would provide a total of about US$4.0 million equivalent in parallel co-financing.
13.   Project Implementation. The Ministry of Local Government and Rural
Development (MLGRD) would be the lead sector Ministry for the project. MLGRD
would head the Project Coordination Committee which would include the Ministry of
Works and Housing (MWH), the five MAs, and the Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA). MLGRD's existing Local Government Support Unit would oversee
implementation of the project. The Technical Services Centre (TSC) of MWH would
assist MLGRD with contract administration, coordination, monitoring, accounting, and
procurement. TSC has served as the implementing agency for several Bank-funded



5
projects, including two under implementation (Urban II and Local Government
Development). TSC combines some of the positive features of a well-functioning public
sector agency (a small staff that focuses on managing contracts with private providers)
with those of a more efficient private organization (nearly half its professional staff are
privately contracted). MLGRD and TSC would manage the project's larger and more
complex components (storm drainage, landfills, project-wide capacity building). To
strengthen capacity at the local government level, the Metropolitan and Municipal
Assemblies (MAs) would manage the small and medium size components (e.g.,
community upgrading and sanitation). The MAs would sign contracts for the
components under their responsibility and would take the lead in handling procurement,
contract supervision, and financial management of these components. TSC would help
train the MAs to perform these functions and would support them during the initial
learning period of actual implementation. All the MAs have Technical Departments and
Waste Management Departments or Units which would be strengthened. Each MA
would be required to put in place a technical/financial staff of about five to eight persons.
Gaps in the MAs' existing staff would be filled with contract staff. Manuals are being
prepared for the project dealing with procurement, disbursement, and financial
accounting. Ghana has a sufficient number of qualified civil works contractors and
consultants for the project. The performance of local civil works contractors under IDA-
assisted projects has been generally good.
14.   Lessons Learnedfrom Previous IDA-Supported Operations. (a) Decentralized
service provision: local governments tend to be more efficient and responsive in
providing basic urban infrastructure and services than central government agencies.
Wherever possible, the capacity of local authorities to shoulder these responsibilities
should be built up. This is one of the project's key objectives. (b) Commercialization
and competition: world-wide experience shows that infrastructure and services can be
provided more efficiently through market-oriented mechanisms. The project aims to
improve the provision of basic services through cost recovery and competitive
arrangements, including private sector participation. (c) Institutional issues: previous
operations have shown that institutional aspects need to receive adequate, early attention.
Institutional arrangements have been a major subject of discussion and analysis
throughout the project preparation period (including preparation of an Institutional
Options paper and a workshop on institutional arrangements at pre-appraisal). (d) Client
ownership: the MAs, as the key clients of the project, have played a leading role in
project identification and preparation. (e) Operation and maintenance: in preparing the
project, the ability and motivation of the responsible agencies to mobilize funds for
operation and maintenance, through user fees and general revenues, has been an
important determinant of the scale of new investments. (f) Demand orientation: the
preferences and willingness/ability to pay of prospective beneficiaries are being taken
into account in project design. Demand is also guiding the design of the sanitation and
solid waste components, for which different levels of service at varying costs would be
provided.

15.   Rationale for IDA Involvement. The project supports four of the five objectives of
the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy for Ghana (discussed by the Executive Directors
on May 9, 1995): (a) poverty reduction, by improving services which have a high impact
on the productivity and welfare of the urban poor both city-wide and in lower-income
areas; (b) capacity-building, by strengthening the ability of the Metro and Municipal
Assemblies to plan and manage the delivery of basic services; (c) private sector
development, by promoting the contracting out of various waste collection and sanitation
services; and (d) environmental improvement, by directly addressing the highest priority
urban environmental problems through policies, institutional structures, and physical
investments. The project is a logical next step for continued IDA support to the urban
sector in Ghana. IDA remains the largest provider of external assistance for urban
development in the country. Through its involvement since 1985 in several major urban
projects, the World Bank has established an ongoing partnership with the institutions
involved in urban development. This relationship is alleviating infrastructure deficits,
improving the policy environment, and building capacity.
16.   Agreed Actions. At negotiations, agreement was reached on credit covenants
requiring (a) the issuance of regulations and by-laws providing an enabling environment
for financially accountable and semi-autonomous Waste Management Departments to
function in all five cities; (b) actions by each MA to increase own source revenue
collection in real terms during each year of the project; (c) independent performance
monitoring of waste management operations in the five cities; and (d) allocation by each
MA of appropriate funds for waste management in their budgets. In addition,
Government agreed to establish a mechanism for formalizing the MAs' obligations under
the project through agreements between the central government and the MAs. Credit
effectiveness would be conditioned on (a) MLGRD issuing a directive to the five MAs
requiring them to establish separate budget lines for waste management and drain
maintenance; (b) initial deposit of counterpart funds in the main project account and the
MAs' sub-project accounts; (c) the MAs filling all of the required contract staff positions;
(d) adoption of the Project Implementation Manual, satisfactory to IDA; and (e)
execution of grant agreements between the central government and each MA.
17.   Poverty Category. The project's improvements in urban drainage, sanitation, and
solid waste services would benefit all income groups in the participating cities, which
account for about 59 percent of the total urban population. Because the urban poor in
Ghana suffer disproportionately from ill health, mortality, and low productivity caused by
inadequate environmental sanitation, systematic improvements in the provision of these
services would provide substantial benefits to the poor. The project is included in the
World Bank's Program of Targeted Interventions. About 30 percent of the project's total
cost would cover components that specifically target the poor (community infrastructure
upgrading, low-cost sanitation) or from which the poor are more likely to benefit than the
overall population (solid waste collection). The community upgrading component would
directly benefit about 265,000 residents of predominantly low-income urban communities
which have severe deficiencies of basic infrastructure. The sanitation component would
provide better services to around 400,000 additional lower-income urban dwellers.



7
18.   Environmental Aspects. The project's environmental category is "B". The
project would improve environmental conditions in urban areas by providing safer
removal, treatment, and disposal of liquid and solid wastes. The main environmental
issue is the protection of ground and surface water from contamination by sewage,
septage, and refuse leachate. Environmental impact assessments are being carried out as
part of the design of the drainage works, sanitary landfills, and liquid waste treatment
facilities. Treatment and disposal facilities as well as any drainage outfalls would
incorporate design features for mitigating risks to ground and surface waters. Local
residents have been or are being consulted regarding site selection. Sites identified are
located away from built-up urban areas and have favorable topographic characteristics.
Geophysical studies are being done to confirm the environmental suitability of the sites.
The preliminary design studies for primary drainage and upgrading include assessments
of any relocation that may be needed. Relocation can largely be avoided by seeking
drainage and road alignments that do not displace people. If any relocation is needed, it
is expected to be on a small scale. World Bank guidelines on participation and
compensation would be followed.
19.   Program Objective Categories. Besides its poverty alleviation aspects, the
project would promote private sector development by supporting private contracting of
construction, waste collection, operation and maintenance of facilities, and surveying of
properties for issuance of land titles. In addition, the strengthening of policy-making and
implementation capacity in MAs and sectoral ministries would contribute to the broader
objective of improving public sector management.
20.   Participation. One of the project's main objectives is to build the capacity of the
Metropolitan and Municipal Assemblies to provide environmental sanitation services.
Accordingly, a major concern of the project preparation process has been to foster
ownership of the project by the participating MAs and other involved institutions (e.g.
TSC and MLGRD). The client consultation and participation process has consisted of
several formal activities linked by continuous informal exchanges. Through appraisal,
four major events took place in which major stakeholders participated: (a) an initial
preparation workshop in October 1994; (b) a municipal finance workshop in February
1995; (c) a workshop on project implementation in April 1995; and (d) a workshop on the
privatization of solid waste collection in July 1995. For preparation of the community
infrastructure upgrading component, a Ghanaian research institute conducted focus group
discussions with local residents, household surveys, and workshops with community
leaders to identify priorities, determine willingness to pay for improvements, and reach
consensus on the scope of improvements. Community participation would extend,
through one or more local organizations, to operation and maintenance.



8
21.   Project Benefits. Health: The project's improvements in drainage, sanitation, and
waste management would contribute to better health and thereby raise the productivity of
all urban residents, but especially the poor, in the five cities. Research shows that a
majority of significant diseases in Ghana's urban areas are linked to poor housing and
ventilation, an unsanitary environment, contaminated drinking water, poor drainage, and
lack of facilities for waste disposal. The higher occurrence of disease in low-income
areas means greater loss in work days and a higher outlay of expenditure for medical
attention for the poor than for those living in better physical environments. It has been
clearly established that the prevention of diarrhea, intestinal parasites, and vector-borne
diseases, which affect hundreds of thousands of persons each year, requires improved
water supply, sanitation, drainage, and solid waste collection. However, the health
benefits of such infrastructure interventions typically are not quantifiable due to the
methodological problems of attributing outcomes to separate factors.
22.   The sanitation component would provide about 5,500 household, 300 school and
65 public sanitation facilities in the five participating cities, from which some 400,000
people would benefit. While this represents only 15 to 20 percent of the total number of
potential beneficiaries, the project would also lay the foundation for reversing the trend in
environmental health degradation by establishing the public and private support
structures needed to construct and maintain these facilities on a large scale. In the case of
school facilities, physical works would be complemented with teacher training in the use
of the facilities and practical ways to improve personal hygiene and encourage
environmental awareness among children. More generally, each of the cities would
benefit from a new septage treatment facility that would allow wastes from household
and public facilities to be properly disposed of rather than dumped into local street drains
and watercourses.
23.   The project would support measures to improve the efficiency and coverage of
solid waste collection through private contracting, thereby removing a greater share of the
waste from neighborhoods, storm drains, and local watercourses. The project would also
finance new sanitary landfills in three cities, which would benefit their entire populations.
The new facilities would replace the existing, nearly exhausted dump sites, provide
environmentally safe disposal, and permit the elimination of many neighborhood refuse
dumps. These measures would eliminate breeding grounds for pests (rats, flies and
cockroaches) and focal points for excreta related diseases (as many people, especially
children, use local dump sites for defecation). The assistance to be provided under the
project for privatized solid waste collection is expected to increase the efficiency of this
service. No precise data are available on the actual costs per ton of solid waste collection
in Ghana's main cities. However, the inefficiency of present services is evident in low
utilization rates of municipal collection equipment, overstaffing, and cumbersome
procedures. Data from other countries suggest that competition encourages the public
sector to significantly improve its efficiency and to lower costs. Monitoring systems
would be introduced under the project to quantify the performance of traditional public
sector collection as compared with private contractors.



9
24.   Flood abatement: The project's primary and secondary storm drainage
improvements aim to reduce the incidence and severity of flooding in dense, flood-prone
central city areas. The health dimensions of poor drainage range from nuisances such as
bad odors to serious problems like excreta-related diseases, malaria, schistosomiasis, and
filariasis. Apart from their contributions to improved health, the drainage works would
generate other economic benefits in the form of: (a) reduced damage to properties; (b)
decreased loss of industrial and commercial turnover; (c) reduced losses of stocks of
goods; and (d) avoidance of damage to infrastructure. In Accra, the project would have
an immediate impact on some 1,300 properties housing at least 17,000 people which are
flooded nearly every year. It would also benefit several thousand other structures which
are flooded within 5 to 15 year cycles. Moreover, it would provide large benefits to 71
industrial properties that are flooded within a 15-year period and 98 industries that would
be affected by a major 50-year event. In Kumasi, the project would directly benefit 1,290
shops and around 25,000 traders in the Central Market and nearby areas which experience
five year cycle floods.
25.   Economic analysis shows that the drainage investments (35 percent of total
project costs) would be amply justified. Economic rates of return have been calculated
for the Kumasi and Accra drainage works. Results are summarized in Schedule B. The
Kumasi estimates were carried out in late 1995 as part of preliminary design work, with
benefits quantified for the first three categories mentioned above. The ERRs are 48
percent for the full improvement scheme and 36 percent for the prioritized improvement
scheme (which has somewhat lower capital costs, higher maintenance costs, and slightly
lower benefits). The net present values of these schemes are US$31.8 million and
US$26.9 million respectively. The ERRs for Accra come from the 1991 drainage master
plan studies, upon which the UESP investments are based (new preliminary engineering
studies are currently underway, and these will include an updated economic analysis).
The ERRs for Accra, using all but the last of the above benefits categories, are 43 percent
for the Odaw channel enlargement and 32 percent for the Priority I secondary drains. Net
present values are Cedis 6.3 billion and Cedis 5.9 billion respectively (1991 values). The
high ERRs obtained in 1991 for Accra are expected to be confirmed by the updating
studies presently being carried out. Details are presented in Annex B. 1.
26.   Cost effectiveness has been a major consideration in the choice of technologies
for the project. Of the US$8.5 million allocated for sanitation in the project, 79 percent
(US$6.8 m.) is devoted to household sanitation with VIP latrines and on-site sanitation
facilities in schools and commercial areas. VIP latrines, which cost US$20 to US$60 per
capita, are clearly the least-cost solution for medium-density areas. Simplified piped
sewerage in similar areas would cost at least twice as much. For solid waste disposal, the
selected technology is landfill, which is the lowest-cost, environmentally acceptable
method. Landfill costs roughly US$3-5 per metric ton, compared with tidal land
reclamation ($5-15/m.t.), composting ($5-20/m.t.), and incineration ($40-60/m.t.).
Composting is often thought to be financially viable, but experience in Ghana and similar
countries shows that it is not, due to insufficient demand.

27.   Strengthening of institutional and financial capacity to operate and maintain
facilities would prolong their useful life and save on repair and rehabilitation costs. The
project's support for improved local revenue mobilization, cost recovery through user
fees, and privatization of services would provide more resources for the provision of
basic infrastructure and services and help reduce the MAs' reliance on the central
government budget. Greater local government self-reliance and better financial
management would establish a basis for multi-year planning and budgeting, which would
help to make the use of scarce resources more efficient.
28.   Project Sustainability. The project would provide financial and technical support
to build up the MAs' capacity to finance, operate and maintain sanitation facilities and
services. To achieve greater efficiency, MAs would be helped to reduce their use of in-
house staff and to contract an increasing share of operation and maintenance (O&M)
functions--such as drain cleaning, vehicle maintenance, public toilet operation, and refuse
collection--to the private sector. The project would support initiatives of the MAs to
increase the funding of O&M through both user fees and general revenues. It has been
agreed with the MAs that user fees should finance 100 percent of the O&M costs of
household latrines, public toilets, piped sewerage, and septage removal. The costs of
solid waste collection would be financed by a combination of user fees and general
revenues. Precise shares are to be determined according to the characteristics of the areas
served. The operating costs of solid waste landfills and septage treatment facilities may
in principle be covered largely through tipping fees paid by private waste haulers.
However, this requires a licensing and enforcement capability that will take a long time to
establish in Ghana. In the short to medium term, a large share of the recurrent costs of
these facilities will have to be paid from general revenues. Roads and drains are public
goods that must be financed primarily through general revenues. Assembly officials
recognize that they must begin to set aside increasing amounts of general revenues for the
recurrent costs of waste management and for the upkeep of facilities and equipment (see
Risks, below). Prior to credit effectiveness, MLGRD would issue a directive to the five
MAs requiring each of them to create separate budget lines for waste collection and
disposal and maintenance of storm drains. The MAs have agreed to allocate, as of the
third year of implementation, appropriate amounts, to be determined with IDA, in these
budget categories.
29.   Risks. Project implementation could be delayed by the weak capacity of the
Metropolitan and Municipal Assemblies. Sanitation, refuse and drainage are most
efficiently managed at the local government level. Thus, the incorporation of the MAs as
implementing agencies is an essential objective, in order to build their capacity to assume
responsibility for these services. The project would attempt to minimize the risks
associated with the MAs' weak capacity by: (a) limiting the numbers and sizes of
components that each MA would manage; (b) requiring each MA to have a basic core
staff assigned to the project; (c) providing support for the hiring of contractors to help
with technical and financial tasks; (d) ensuring that the central implementing agency
supervises and monitors the MAs adequately; and (e) providing substantial training to the



11
MAs' officials and staff. An implementation delay of one or two years would not
jeopardize the benefits of the investments.
30.   There is a risk that counterpart funds for investment may not be available as
required, either from the central government or the MAs. While this has not been a
serious problem in past IDA-supported urban projects in Ghana, it continues to be a
general issue for the IDA portfolio. It would be addressed by keeping the required
counterpart fund contribution modest (10 percent for the GOG and 3.9 percent for the
MAs as a group). The GOG and MAs' combined contribution would reach a maximum of
US$3 to 4 million per year during the three peak years of project implementation. This
represents only about 1.3 to 1.8 percent of the national 1996 development budget.
31.   The project's impact could be reduced if cost recovery and general local revenue
mobilization are not be implemented effectively, resulting in inadequate funding of
operation and maintenance. Household, school, and public sanitation facilities pose a low
risk, as these would be provided on a demand basis and would depend largely on direct
user maintenance (except public facilities which would be operated on franchise).
Drainage also has a low risk of maintenance failure. Sensitivity analysis (see Schedule
B) indicates that primary and secondary drainage would provide high economic benefits
even if maintenance is well below the optimum. This probably applies also to the
sanitary landfill facilities, whose ideal O&M costs are considerable. The septage
treatment facilities would be simple, modest-sized stabilization ponds with O&M costs
that are easily absorbed by the cities' budgets. The risk of inadequate O&M funding is
being addressed through: (a) a credit covenant requiring the MAs to allocate O&M funds
to separate program budget lines for waste management and drainage; (b) an intensive
effort to build ownership of the project on the part of the Metropolitan and Municipal
Assemblies during preparation and up to effectiveness; and (c) the provision of a
considerable amount of capacity-building relating to O&M during implementation.
Recommendation
32.   I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.

Economic Rate of Return     47.8%           36.4%           43%              32%
Main Assumptions
Discount rate = Kumasi 12 percent (1995). At the time the Accra study was done in 1991, 10 percent
was the norm. However, the updated study now underway ( to be completed by March
1996) will use the current standard 12 percent. The variations between the discount
rates is slight and does not alter the thrust of the findings of economic viability.
Real exchange rate constant.
Sensitivity Analysis
Kumasi:       Assume both a decrease of benefits by 20 percent and an increase of costs by 20
percent. ERR then becomes 33.6 percent for Recommended Scheme and 24.4 percent
for Prioritized Scheme.
Accra:        Sensitivity analysis not performed in 1991 but will be done in 1996 updated study.
Switching Values
Kumasi:       For NPV to become negative benefits would have to decrease by 74 percent
(Recommended Scheme) or 75 percent (Prioritized Scheme).
Accra:        Switching values not calculated in 1991 but will be done in 1996 updated study.
Nature of Benefits
Surveys were conducted in Accra and Kumasi to inventory structures, contents, and economic activities
affected by cycles of flooding. Using these data, flood incidence figures, and topographic maps,
estimates were made of the monetary values of benefits due to flood alleviation in the following
categories: (1) residential and commercial contents damage; (2) building fabric damage; and (3)
curtailment of industrial production and commercial trade. These benefits alone produce the high
ERRs reported above. Major non-quantified benefits are: (1) reduced deaths and illnesses; (2) reduced
damage to infrastructure; (3) lower costs associated with traffic disruptions; and (4) indirect or
multiplier costs averted (e.g. extra economic costs due to utility disruptions)
Main Beneficiaries
Businesses, small-scale traders, and residents of flood-prone areas.

Ghana - Implementation Issues
Although the performance of Ghana's portfolio has improved recently from previous low
levels, disbursements continue to be slow in a number of projects. Greater attention by the
Government and the Bank to implementation has helped to raise the disbursement rate for
investment projects from 13 percent in FY94 to 17 percent in FY95. The May 1995 CPPR
acknowledged improvement in the procurement process in almost all sectors. Similarly the
availability of matching (counterpart) funds, a serious issue in previous years, has improved.
IDA's Country Assistance Strategy of linking future lending levels to disbursement
performance has contributed to the improved disbursement levels, and the disbursement outlook
for FY96 is also good based on the performance of the first half of the year. The Resident
Mission is playing an increasingly important role in project implementation and has a greater
responsibility for project supervision, particularly in monitoring procurement and disbursement
activities.
The status of the only problem project is as follows:
Water Sector Rehabilitation (FY90; $25 million credit). This is the only problem
project, rated unsatisfactory for FY93, FY94 and FY95. Although works implementation is
progressing, management of the water supply sector requires reform. To address this problem,
fundamental changes are being planned for the water supply sector including a restructuring of
the existing water utility and private sector participation. A Japanese Grant and bilateral
commitments have been secured to finance a project encompassing these objectives.
Several projects have continued to experience slow disbursement:
Public Enterprise TA Project (FY88; $10.5 million credit). The project supported
privatization and the implementation of performance contracts with state owned enterprises
(SOEs). Disbursement was slow until 1992, largely because of slow progress on privatization,
but it has recently accelerated with the privatization of Ashanti Goldfields in 1994 and 20
additional SOEs. Disbursement will be almost fully complete by June 1996 when the project
will be closed and any remaining balance canceled.
Cocoa Rehabilitation Project (FY88; $40 million credit). The project remains only
about 50% disbursed. In the early years there were serious difficulties in contracting and with a
contractor's inability to perform under the roads component. There were also long delays in
procuring jute bags. This latter problem has been resolved, and a contract for jute bags of $4.5
million is about to be executed. Several civil works contracts are also nearing completion. The
credit will close in June 1996, and the undisbursed amount of about $12 million will be canceled.
VRA/Sixth Power Project (FY90; $20 million credit). The project became effective in
September 1990. Its original design called for retrofitting the runners of the Akosombo plant.
However, for operational reasons, the Borrower suspended the work and asked the Bank to



22                                 Schedule E.3
Page 4 of 5
redesign the project and suggested to replace the runners. The Bank has given no-objection to
this and work is underway to prepare and proceed with the restructured project.
NationalAgricultural Research Project (FY91; $22 million credit). The project was
effective October 1991 and so far only US$6.9 million has been disbursed. It took three years to
prepare an agriculture research master plan and translate it into a work program and funding
plan. This was accomplished in 1995 and the major research programs are now beginning.
Counterpart funding was a major problem in the first two years, especially for civil works. IDA
increased the reimbursement percentage for civil works and the project received 100% of the
required counterpart funds from Government in 1995. For 1996, counterpart funding is expected
to be adequate. The pace of project implementation has picked up substantially since mid-1995,
and disbursements are expected to total about US$7 million during FY96.
Agriculture Diversification Project (FY91; $16.5 million credit). The project became
effective in March 1991. To date, disbursements have been only US$5.3 million. Key problems
have been poor management and coordination by the lead implementing agency and a number of
specific problems associated with different project components. A mid-term review is in
progress to resolve the main problems, and transferring responsibility for the project to another
agency is one of the central actions recommended. A number of specific problems encountered
in each of the project components have already been addressed and resolved.
NationalAgriculture Extension Project (FY92; $30.4 million credit). The project
became effective July 1992, but so far only US$11.8 million has been disbursed. Emphasis on
reforms to create a unified agricultural extension service, counterpart funding constraints, and
unfamiliarity with Bank procurement procedures caused disbursements to lag substantially
behind SAR forecasts. In 1995, the Borrower provided 100% of the required counterpart funds
and is expected to do the same in 1996. Disbursements from the credit are accelerating, with a
substantial number of contracts finalized in 1995, and are anticipated to be US$11-12 million
during FY96.
National Feeder Roads Rehabilitation & Maintenance Project (FY92; $55 million
credit). This project was approved in December 1991 and became effective in July 1992. Actual
disbursement to December 1995 was US$21.52 million against scheduled disbursement of
US$46.4 million. The project involves a large number of relatively small civil works contracts,
the design and procurement processing of which has taken longer than expected. The lag in
disbursements is, however, expected to decline significantly in the next year as 124 new
contracts worth around US$30 million were awarded during the second half of 1995.
National Livestock Services Project (FY93; $22.4 million credit). This project became
effective in April 1993 and so far US$10.0 million has been disbursed. This project has picked
up considerable pace after a slow start. The disbursement lag against SAR estimates is mainly
attributable to the slower than anticipated start-up of civil works construction, but contracting
and construction have both accelerated significantly in 1995.

Urban TransportProject (FY93; $76.2 million credit). This project was approved in
May 1993 and became effective March 1994. Actual disbursement to December 1995 was
US$4.46 million against scheduled disbursement of US$3 1.8 million. The project involves three
large urban road rehabilitation contracts costing around US$50 million. Although bid documents
were prepared before the project became effective, bidding was not advertised as planned
because the Borrower decided, as a result of problems which arose on similar works, to carry out
service relocation in advance of the main civil works. The contracts were awarded in October
1995 and disbursement is expected to increase significantly in 1996.
National Electrification Project (FY93; $80 million). The project has had limited
disbursements to date. There was a one year delay in effectiveness due to delayed hiring of a
management contractor and slow preparation of bids for the distribution network. These
problems have now been resolved. Contracts totaling $28 million have now been negotiated,
most of which will be disbursed during the next six to eighteen months.
Community Water Project (FY94; $22 million credit). The project involves building an
outreach capacity to encourage beneficiary participation and private sector capacity in 700
villages and 30 small towns. This has required a longer than expected inception period, but
recent progress in this work should enable disbursements to reach about $5 million by the end of
this fiscal year.
Local Government Development Project (FY94; $38.5 million credit). The project has
been delayed by the tender evaluation system involving district, regional and central tender
boards. In addition, some tenders exceeded original estimates. Recent progress should enable
contracts totaling about $10 million to have been signed by June 1996 which will lead to about 6
million in disbursements during FY97.
Vocational Skills and Informal Sector Support Project (FY95; $9.6 million credit).
This project was signed on June 30, 1995 and became effective on September 19, 1995. Since
effectiveness, the credit has disbursed about $280,000 in the Special Account and several
procurement activities are underway -- bids for the ICB procurement of equipment are under
evaluation and award is expected around June 1996. The current disbursement lag is expected to
be gradually reduced as project implementation accelerates on the basis of the agreed action plan.
