INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF BANGLADESH FOR A
SMALL-SCALE INDUSTRY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit in an amount in various currencies equivalent to US$3
million to the People's Republic of Bangladesh, on standard IDA terms, to
help finance a Small-Scale Industry Project. This credit would replace a
US$3 million development credit to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan of
June 1970 for the same project (Credit No. 192-PAK) on the basis set out
in paragraph 2 of my Report and Recommendation to the Executive Directors,
dated September 15, 1972, on the Second Chandpur Irrigation Project
(IDA/R72-77).
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Reconstructing the Economy of Bangladesh"
(IDA/R72-230) was distributed to the Executive Directors on October 13, 1972.
The findings and conclusions of this report are sunumarized in Part I of my
Report and Recommendation referred to above. A Country Data Sheet is attached
as Annex I.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN BANGLADESH
3.        The operations of the Bank Group in Bangladesh are described in
Part II of my Report and Recommendation referred to above. Since that report
was issued, credit agreements between Bangladesh and the Association have been
signed for a US$50 million reconstruction imports program credit, and for four
credits totalling US$59.3 million replacing amounts included in previous
credits to Pakistan for the same projects. Annex II gives the status of
Bank Group operations in Bangladesh.
PART III - SMALL INDUSTRY IN BANGLADESH
4.        In the predominantly agricultural economy of Bangladesh, industrial
production accounts for under 10 percent of GDP. The country has no major
industrial raw materials other than natural gas deposits and the diminishing
forests that cover some 15 percent of the land area. Furthermore, there
is little tradition of entrepreneurship, since in the past much of the
limited amount of investment was made by non-Bengalis. Nevertheless, Ban-
gladesh's industrial enterprises, even if few, produce items critically needed
both for exports (mainly jute goods) and for home consumption (e.g., textiles).



- 2 -
5.        By the end of 1971 most of .the manufacturing enterprises had come
to a virtual standstill. Luckily, physical damage was relatively limited:
no more than 3 percent of the installed plant and machinery of the large-
scale manufacturing enterprises appear to have been lost. On the other hand,
losses of stocks (e.g. raw materials and other necessary inputs, spare parts)
were sizeable, and replacements as well as normal deliveries were seriously
hampered by the damage to the transportation system. All imported items
were particularly scarce since the ports were damaged and blocked for several
months, resulting in the stoppage of all import and export trade. The
deterioration of the power system and the departure of many skilled managers
to Rest Pakistan added to the difficult situation in the industrial sector.
6.        Considering the circumstances, the pace of recovery in 1972 has been
quite remarkable, with varying degrees of speed and levels of recovery in
different sectors. For instance, in June 1972 jute manufacturing output stood
at 85 percent of the 1969/70 level. On the other hand, the recovery of the
cotton textile industry has been far slower, due to its dependence on imported
cotton.
7.        In March 1972 most of the large factories, having been owned and
operated by non-Bengali Pakistanis and coming into the category of "abandoned
property', as well as all jute and cotton textile and sugar mills having T 1.5
million (about US$210,000) worth or more assets, were nationalized. An
estimated 80 percent of large manufacturing enterprises was thus put into
public ownership. The Government, short of managerial staff, now faces the
difficult task of running the nationalized firms. These enterprises have
been organized into 10 new sector corporations which operate under the control
of the Nationalized Industries Division of the Ministry of Industries.
8.        Small industrial enterprises (which are defined as any manufacturing
unit with total fixed assets, excluding land, not exceeding T 1.5 million,
about US$210,000 equivalent) contribute about 40 percent of total industrial
output. During and after the war, this sector experienced fewer dislocations
than the large industry sector, and it generally appears to have survived
intact. Except for a few cases where properties were abandoned by the
previous owners, nationalization did not extend to this sector, and manage-
ment continuity has been assured in most cases since the owners or managers
were overwhelmingly Bengali. Because of the nature and structure of this
sector, where close cooperation between entrepreneurs and workers in small
workshops is typical, the danger of disruptive labor unrest, more common to
larger enterprises, is minor. Also dependence on an overburdened governmental
administration and on a smoothly operating infrastructure (power, transport,
communications) is less critical than for larger enterprises. Provided
adequate measures are taken, the small firms should be in a position to
absorb, and respond more rapidly to, a renewed flow of investment resources
and, even in the present circumstances, resources applied to them could be
quite rapidly translated into jobs and production. The Government, in its
"Annual Plan 1972/73", acknowledges in principle the importance of small-scale



-3-
industry development. Although the Plan allocates most of the finance to
larger public enterprises, the Government has stated its intention to give
appropriate emphasis to the development of small-scale industry as it
prepares a medium-range overall industrial strategy as part of its first
Five-Year Plan. In response to a request from the Government the World Bank
plans to send a mission to Bangladesh in early 1973 to help the Government
prepare a strategy for the development of small industrial firms.
'9.       In the past, several financial intermediaries were available in the
present territory of Bangladesh to finance industrial investment. The key
role was played by' two long-term lending institutions: the Government-owned
Industrial Development Bank of Pakistan (IDBP), which supported mainly medium-
scale enterprises, and' the'privately-owned Pakistan -Industrial Credit and
Investment Corporation (PICIC), which worked primarily with large enterprises.
Both IDBP and PICIC have received funds from the World Bank Group. In addition,
other institutions, such as tne -Investment Corporation of Pakistan (ICP),
the National Investment Trust (NIT) and the Equity Participation Fund (EPF),
were sources of finance to medium- and large-scale enterprises.
10.       The main instrument!for' financial support to small industrial
firms was the East Pakistan Small Industries Corporation (EPSIC).. EPSIC
extended assistance to such enterprises under three programs: (i) EPSIC's
own lending,, which was by far the least important of the three, since EPSIC
had few funds of its-own;' (ii) EPSIC/IDBP lending, a-program established
in 1962; and (iii) EPSIC/commercial bank lending, a scheme set up in 1966 to
supplement the EPSIC/IDBP program through EPSIC's association with a con-
sortium of local commercial banks. Under the two latter programs, EPSIC,
through its'specialized',department known as the'Small Industries Advisory
Service (SIAS), performed an appraisa1 and supervisory function, while IDBP
or one of the commercial banks handled the financial 'appraisal and provided
the loan funds.  Under the EPSIC/IDBP and the EPSIC/commercial bank programs,
EPSIC guaranteed-to the institution providing the funds repayment of between
half and two-thirds of its loans; EPSIC's share of the risk, if called upon,
was to be met through the Provincial Government budget, the source of EPSIC's
own fund's.
11.       The Government of Bangladesh is presently reorganizing the former
East-wing branches of PICIC (now BICIC), IDBP (now IDBB), NIT, ICP (now ICB)
and EPF into two institutions which would assist primarily medium- and -
large-scale industrial enterprises.  On the other hand, EPSIC (now Bangladesh
Small Industries Corporation, or BSIC), in conjunction with a 'consortium of
local commercial banks, would remain the major source of finance to small-
scale industrial enterprises.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
12.       In June 1970 the Association made a US$3 million Credit (Credit
No. 192-PAK, IDA/R70-24) to Pakistan to provide foreign exchange for imported
equipment and technical assistance for sub-projects in small-scale industry
in the country's East wing. A consortium of local commercial banks partici-
pated in the project. Applications from entrepreneurs were appraised by
SIAS with regard to technical, financial and economic feasibility. SIAS's
appraisal reports were then submitted to the EPSIC Loan Committee (which has
now been replaced by a Technical Advisory Committee) for approval. Where
loan finance was required, the applicant's commercial bank assessed the
creditworthiness of the applicant and, if satisfied, made available the
loan finance in local currency. EPSIC then authorized the commercial bank
to open letters of credit for imports of machinery. On settlement of the
letter of credit out of the proceeds of the IDA credit, the commercial bank
paid the equivalent amount in rupees from the entrepreneur 's loan account to
the Government of Pakistan. Where no loan finance was required for a sub-project
approved by EPSIC, foreign exchange was also made available from the credit,
under the same arrangements as described above, to cover the cost of machinery
imports. Thus, the proceeds of the Credit were not relent by the Government
but sold against immediate payment in local currency.
13.       The commercial banks participating in the program entered into
general agreements with the Province of East Pakistan and EPSIC, pledging
adequate loan funds to ensure that the program could be implemented; these
agreements provided pledges for an aggregate amount in excess of Rs 30
million (about US$6.3 million),. The participating commercial banks made
long-term loans of up to 10 years, they charged borrowers interest at a rate
3-1/2 percent above the State Bank interest rate (which in June 1970 was
5 percent) and they were responsible for securing repayment. The State Bank
was prepared to provide, when required, participating commercial banks with
discount facilities for up to a maximum of 75 percent of such loans. In
the event of default, losses were to be shared equally between EPSIC and
the commercial bank. Of the interest yield to the commercial bank, 1-1/4
percent interest was passed on to EPSIC as compensation for its services
and for its assumption of half the credit risk. In addition, EPSIC collected
from the entrepreneurs a one-time service charge in local currency equivalent
to 2-1/2 percent of the foreign exchange provided to the enterprises.
14.       The project was expected to generate about US$9 million equivalent
in total investment, of which at least US$2.7 million would have been equity
provided by the entrepreneurs and the balance, US$6.3 million, loans advanced
by the members of the consortium of commercial banks.
15.       The outbreak of hostilities in 1971 slowed and eventually
paralyzed project implementation. On December 29, 1971, when IDA disburse-
ments were suspended, less than US$200,000 had been disbursed, covering
equipment shipped for three approved sub-projects (US$156,000) and one man-
year of technical assistance (US$31,000). However, 28 sub-projects had been



- 5 -
approved by EPSIC at that time and more than two-thirds of the credit had
been allocated to them.  Early in 1972 BSIC, which emerged from the war
period with its staff practically intact, started actively first to assess
the damage inflicted on its customers and then to reconsider and reappraise
all loan applications previously received; it found that implementation of
most of these sub-projects could be resumed quickly. In July and August 1972,
shortly after the Government had requested a new IDA Credit of US$3 million to
reactivate the project, a mission visited Bangladesh to review the situation.
A. Development Credit and Project Summary as well as a Technical Note des-
cribing the findings of the mission are attached as Annexes III and IV
respectively.
16.       In March 1972, Bangladesh's 12 comercial banks - including the
10 members of the previous EPSIC consortium - were nationalized and
consolidated into six state-owned banks. All six banks are members of the new
consortium and will continue to discharge the same functions as before
(paragraphs 12 and 13 above). They have again agreed in principle to
support BSIC with sufficient funds for the program.
17.       In the past all of EPSIC's extension services to small entrepreneurs
were centralized in SIAS. Now, in order to increase its functional efficiency,
BSIC has instituted several organizational changes including a major change
in the role of SIAS. After the reform, SIAS deals only with technical and
economic appraisal of sub-projects and in-plant counselling, while other
functions, such as preliminary promotion and post-sanction sub-project super-
vision, have been shifted to other departments of BSIC. The reorganization
appears to be sound and should contribute to a further improvement in BSIC's
operations.
18.       The Swedish Interim Credit of US$11 million equivalent to
Bangladesh which was signed on June 2, 1972 included financing for urgent
expenditures incurred under the project after January 1, 1972. A memorandum
describing arrangements under the Swedish Interim Credit was considered by
the Executive Directors on April 18, 1972 (R72-74).
19.       The project remains fundamentally the same as the one which was
financed under Credit No. 192-PAK. Project priorities and criteria for loan
approval would follow the guidelines agreed earlier; priority would be given
to manufacturing enterprises potentially capable of contributing to foreign
exchange earnings and savings through exports or import substitution. Loans
would be restricted to enterprises with total fixed assets, excluding land,
of up to US$210,000 equivalent, and the entrepreneurs would have to put up
equity contributions of at least 30 percent of total sub-project investment.
The remaining amount, up to 70 percent, would then be provided by one-of the
banks belonging to the consortium of government banks as a long-term loan
of up to ten years. The technical assistance component of the project, to
which USAID contributed financially in the past, has been reduced, since
BSIC appears to have developed a professional staff sufficiently experienced
in economic and technical appraisal of sub-projects; the previous USAID



contribution to finance another 3 man-years (about $150,000) of technical
assistance has been cancelled. The remaining technical assistance (1-1/2
man-years, US$69,000) to be financed by the Association has been maintained
as originally planned to help SIAS appraise sub-projects and to assist BSIC
in screening applications and approving sub-projects.
20.       The proposed credit of US$3 million would finance:   (i) notional
repayment of amounts previously disbursed under Credit No. 192-PAK (US$187,000),
thus debiting Bangladesh with this amount; (ii) technical assistance of
approximately 1-1/2 man-years (US$69,000), including US$12,000 for
payment of outstanding amounts for consulting services performed under
Credit No. 192-PAK, before December 29, 1971; and (iii) imported equipment
for approved sub-projects (US$2.744 million). The last item includes the
reimbursement to Sweden for any portion of SIDA's Interim Credit that may
have been disbursed under the project by the time the proposed Credit becomes
effective; as of November 30, 1972, no such disbursements had been made.
21.       It is expected that by the end of calendar year 1973, a sufficient
number of projects will have been approved to commit the entire IDA credit.
Completion of disbursements is expected by the end of calendar year 1975.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUJMENTS AND AUTHORITY
22.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the People's
Republic of Bangladesh and the Association, the Report of the Committee
provided for in Article V, Section 1(d) of the Articles of Agreement and
the text of a resolution approving the proposed credit are being distributed
to the Executive Directors separately. The provisions of the draft Develop-
ment Credit Agreement conform substantially to the provisions of the prior
Development Credit Agreement with the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and in-
corporate the relevant provisions of the Project Agreement with the then
Province of East Pakistan.
23.       There will not be a separate Project Agreement with BSIC, since
BSIC does not borrow and relend the proceeds of the proposed Credit.
24.       A condition of effectiveness would be that the commercial banks
enter into general agreements with the Government of Bangladesh and BSIC
to provide assurance that funds in local currency in an aggregate amount of
not less than T 46 million (about US$6.3 million) will be available for
lending to small industrial enterprises.
25.       I am satisfied that the proposed development credit would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Association.

I. HISTORY OF THE PROJECT
1.01      The East Pakistan Small Industries Corporation (EPSIC) was estab-
lished in 1957 by the Proviacial Government of East Pakistan as a centralized
agency to promote the development of small industrial enterprises.    In
assisting private entrepreneurs, EPSIC's primary activities have been (i)
developing infrastructure, chiefly industrial estates 1/, (ii) providing
advisory services and training in feasibility analysis, market study, project
design, procurement, plant construction and installation, and management
techniques, and (iii) arranging local currency and foreign exchange finance.
1.02      In 1965, a specialized department was created within EPSIC - the
Small Industries Advisory Service (SIAS) - in which all extension services
to small entrepreneurs were centralized. During the period 1965 to 1970
SIAS expanded and intensified its activities with technical assistance
provided by the Stanford Research Institute (20.8 man-years financed by the
Ford Foundation), the Colombo Plan (9.0 man-years) and USAID (3.0 man-years).
Among the measurable accomplishments highlighting SIAS' impact were (i) pre-
paration of 80 industry briefs on potentialiy feasible small-scale industries;
(ii) completion of 50 special studies for private clients analyzing their
operations, identifying problems and recommending solutions; (iii) completion
of 2,000 project appraisals in connection with loan applications; (iv)
arranging loans for 50 new enterprises and providing full technical counselling
in design, procurement, installation and start-up.
1.03      Traditionally, EPSIC had made loans out of a limited Development
Budget (annual funds provided by the Provincial Government of East Pakistan),
plus some resources which the Government-owned Industrial Development Bank
of Pakistan made available for small-scale industry. In an attempt to multiply
funds available for its programs, EPSIC and a consortium of local commercial
banks worked out a scheme in 1966 under which SIAS would appraise the techni-
cal, financial and economic feasibility of projects submitted to EPSIC. The
banks would assess the creditworthiness of the potential investor and his
ability to provide the equity investment needed for the project. Entrepreneurs
were, and still are, obliged to put up, in the form of equity, at least 30%
of the total project cost. The remaining 70% would then be provided by the
banks in local currency, usually as a long-term loan of up to ten years at an
interest rate 3-1/2% above the State Bank rate (presently 5%). Part of the
local currency thus raised would be used to buy from the State Bank the
foreign exchange needed for the project. To make participation in the program
attractive to the commercial banks, the State Bank undertook to grant the
banks refinance facilities of up to 75% on their loans to small-scale industry.
EPSIC undertook to arrange for the foreign exchange needed for the projects
and obtained for the purpose a total of US$2 million in two loans from USAID.
These were fully disbursed by August 1970 and covered the foreign exchange
requirements of 71 projects representing a total investment of US$9 million
equivalent.

1.04      The encouraging results of the consortium program led to an IDA
credit of US$3 million on June 10, 1970 1/. US$2.9 million was allocated
to finance the foreign exchange cost of imported equipment and the balance
of US$0.1 million plus US$0.3 million provided by USAID were allocated
to finance eight man-years of technical assistance to SIAS.   The closing
date of the credit was June 30, 1973.
1.05      Between October 21, 1970 (date of effectiveness of the credit)
and June 1971, a total of 56 applications were processed, of which 28
projects were approved with foreign exchange cost of US$2.19 million
and representing a total investment of approximately US$6 million equivalent.
The program had started with encouraging momentum but slowed down after
the outbreak of hostilities in March, 1971 and was effectively paralyzed
after June, 1971. On December 29, 1971 when further disbursements were
suspended, program implementation stood as follows:

Fourteen of the 28 approved projects were in food processing and related
industries, six were small terry cloth weaving mills and the balance in
miscellaneous industries. The foreign exchange cost per project averaged
US$78,000 and generally ranged from US$20,000 to US$140,000. Nine projects
were located in the Dacca area, seven in the Chittagong area and the remaining
12 were fairly evenly distributed over the country. Fourteen projects were
located on the industrial estates of EPSIC (for details see Table 1 and
Map).

II.  CHANGES IN CONDITIONS AFFECTING THE PROJECT
2.01      Bangladesh's industry is facing severe problems following a
devastating war and the dislocations caused by the division of Pakistan into
two nations. Problems are particularly severe with larger-sized enterprises,
where plants have been abandoned by their (West) Pakistan owners and managers,
and where labor disputes and infrastructure disorganization are causing
disruptions of production. Because of its nature and structure, the small-
scale industry sector, on the other hand, appears to be comparatively stable
within the general context of economic readjustment now taking place.   Owner-
ship and management of small industrial enterprises were generally Bengali,
and cases of abandoned small-scale enterprises are few. Enterprises with
fixed assets (excluding land) below Taka 1.5 million (US$0.2 million) were
not nationalized, except in cases of abandonment by previous owners. The
Government plans to sell the abandoned small industrial enterprises to
private entrepreneurs. Interest in small-scale industry is strong as Bengalis
seek to reestablish themselves in the small-scale industry sector which continues
to be open to private entrepreneurs. In view of these factors, and given
appropriate resource allocation, the future outlook for small industrial
firms is promising.
2.02      All 12 domestic commercial banks in Bangladesh, including the
10 members of the original consortium, have been nationalized and consolidated
into six state-owned banks_I. The Government has agreed that all the national-
ized banks form a new consortium. The comercial banks have pledged support
in principle in an aggregate amount of at least T 46 million (about US$6.3
million) to small-scale industry under the program. In effect, this will
vultiply the coverage of the program, since the nationalized banks dispose
of more branches throughout the country than the previous consortium.
2.03      After independence of Bangladesh, EPSIC was renamed Bangladesh
Small Industries Corporation (BSIC). BSIC and SIAS survived the hostilities
with practically the same staff as before. BSIC's total present staff is
470, and SIAS has 31 professionals. The Chairman of BSIC was assigned to a
different position in the Government and a new Chairman, Mr. A. H. Sadique
(formerly Planning Director of the East Pakistan Industrial Development
Corporation), was appointed in May 1972. BSIC is provided at present with
an adequate budget allocation to retain its staff and operate effectively.
Assurances have been obtained from the Government that budget support to
BSIC will continue to be adequate to carry out the program.
2.04      The new Chairman has instituted a number of organizational changes
which affect the relations between BSIC and SIAS. Under the previous
administration, SIAS operated as a separate semi-autonomous group under
1/   Table 2 provides a list of all domestic commercial banks, including
the 10 members of the original consortium, and their consolidation
into six state-owned banks.

an Executive Director who reported directly to the Chairman. The SIAS
staff was responsible for the entire project cycle, including preliminary
contacts with clients and consortium banks, receipt and screening of loan
applications, technical and economic appraisal of projects and supervision.
2.05      The new organizational structure, summarized in Table 3 and shown
graphically in the attached two chartsl/, is intended to increase BSIC's
efficiency. It places SIAS under the Director of the Planning Division who
reports to the Chairman. SIAS' staff will now devote its entire capability
only to technical and economic appraisal of projects and inplant counselling.
All other functions, such as preliminary promotion and post-sanction project
supervision, have been given to other departments of the Planning Division.
2.06      The Chairman believes that the new organization will permit more
efficient utilization of the expertise for project appraisal accumulated
over the years in SIAS. Much will depend on effective coordination between
SIAS and the other departments. If this is attained, the new organizational
structure should be able to perform at least as efficiently as the previous
organization. In view of the scarcity of qualified personnel, the plan
would yield additional benefits as SIAS' present staff of 31 professionals
(versus an authorized strength of 47) will be supported and augmented by
professionals in other departments.
2.07      Consolidated financial data on current operations were not
available at the time of the mission. BSIC recognizes the deficiency and
intends to bring its accounting in order and up-to-date. Assurance has
been obtained that BSIC will maintain its records in accordance with sound
accounting practices.
2.08      In the past, when SIAS was solely in charge of the consortium
program supported by the IDA credit, it kept separate accounts which
reflected the status of the program. Now that parts of the program are
carried out by other departments of BSIC, assurance has been obtained
that BSIC will set up an accounting system which will facilitate control
and record the progress of the program as separated from other BSIC
activities and that it will employ competent and experienced auditors to
audit these accounts each fiscal year.
2.09      The technical assistance component of the previous IDA credit
plus other funds provided by USAID were to finance four foreign experts in
financial and economic analysis, industrial engineering and marketing for
two years each. In July 1971, USAID concluded that the program was
effectively paralyzed with little hope for early resumption and terminated
its support. Since December 1971, no foreign consultants have been
attached to BSIC.
2.10      The BSIC staff which will be working on the program has developed
sufficient experience in economic and technical appraisal of projects to
1/   Charts World Bank-7130 and World Bank-7052 (R).

carry on with reduced foreign consulting assistance. It was agreed with
the management of BSIC that one senior project analyst with broad experience
in small- and medium-scale industry development would suffice as a staff
advisor in the future, particularly in view of the fact that a large part
of the appraisal work for the projects to be financed under the program has
already been completed. He will help SIAS appraise projects aad assist
BSIC in screening applications and approving projects.
III. REACTIVATION OF THE PROJECT
3.01      The status of each of the 28 projects already approved by BSIC
was reviewed (Table 1). Five projects will not be implemented for various
reasons. If the program is reactivated, it can be expected that close to
US$2 million will be committed quickly on the remaining 23 projects for
which implementation can be resumed immediately. The remaining funds would
then be sufficient for another 12-15 projects some of which are already
in the t"pipe-line" in various stages of study.
3.02      In this favorable situation, the program should be reactivated
while remaining substantially unchanged in concept and execution. The IDA
credit would cover the foreign exchange cost of projects in new or expanding
small industrial enterprises after their evaluation and approval by BSIC.
Only enterprises with fixed assets (excluding land) not exceeding Taka
1.5 million (approximately US$210,000) 1/ would be eligible.   Priority would
be given to manufacturing, with the focus on new units, while service in-
dustries, such as laundries and garages, would be excluded. Certain industries
which provide services to manufacturing, e.g. offset printing, would, on
the other hand, be eligible after the approval by the Association.
3.03      Local currency finance to purchase the foreign exchange provided by
IDA and to finance the local cost of the projects, would be provided from
equity contributions by the investors and loans from the consortium of local
banks. Assuming that the average foreign exchange component is about one-
third of the total project investment, the US$2.9 million provided under the
IDA credit for import of equipment would correspond to total investment of
about US$9 million equivalent (Taka 65.6 million). Assuming, further, that
about 30% of this total investment would be financed from equity contributions
of investors, the potential total loan demand on the consortium banks would
be about US$6.3 million equivalent (Taka 45.9 million). As a condition of
effectiveness of the credit, the consortium banks would have to pledge at
least Taka 46 million 2/ towards financing the projects approved under the
program.
3.04      The credit would be allocated as follows:
1/   Rupees 1.0 million (US$210,000) under former Credit No. 192-PAK.
2/   Rupees 30.0 million (US$6.3 million) under former Credit No. 192-PAK.



ANNEX IV
Page siX
(i)  US$0.187 million, corresponding to the disbursed portion
of the former credit (192-PAK);
(ii) US$0.069 million 1/ for additional technical assistance
of approximately 1-1/2 man-years; and
(iii) US$2.744 million to cover imported equipment for 23 out
of the 28 projects already approved plus additional
projects to be approved in the future 2/. This would
include up to US$100,000 to reimburse Sweden for the
portion of her interim credit that may have been disbursed
under the program by the time the Association's credit
becomes effective.
3.05      It is expected that by the end of calendar year 1973, a sufficient
number of projects will have been approved to commit the entire IDA credit.
Completion of disbursements is expected by the end of calendar year 1975.
At present, BSIC has no foreign exchange from any other source to import
equipment for its small-scale industry program.
IV. AGREEMENTS REACHED DURING NEGOTIATIONS
4.01      Agreement was reached on the following principal points:
(a)  Budget support to BSIC will be adequate to carry out the
program (para 2.03);
(b)  The Government will cause BSIC to maintain its records in
accordance with sound accounting practices (para 2.07);
(c) The Government will cause BSIC to set up separate accounts
to record the progress of the program and to employ com-
petent and experienced auditors to audit these accounts each
fiscal year (para 2.08); and
(d)  The Government will cause the nationalized banks to form a
new consortium that will have to pledge at least Taka 46
million towards financing of the projects approved under
the program (paras 2.02 and 3.03).
4.02      With the indicated agreements, the program constitutes a suitable
basis for an IDA credit of US$3 million equivalent.
1/   Includes US$12,000 for payment of outstanding amounts for past
consulting services other than those disbursed.

BSIC Organization*
1.        BSIC has four Divisions, each headed by a Director who reports
to the Chairman. Each Division comprises several Departments most of
which are headed by a Joint Director. The four Divisions are:
a.   Finance Division
b.   Implementation and Operation Division
c.   Administration Division
d.   Planning Division
2.        The responsibilities of the Finance Division are administration of
loans made by BSIC, accounting and internal auditing.
3.        The Implementation and Operation Division carries out and operates
BSIC's own projects, such as the production of solar salt in coastal areas
and BSIC's sericulture activities at Rajshahi. It runs the Design Centre
which aims at developing and improving the designs, and encouraging utilization
of indigenous raw materials in certain small-scale industries, e.g., cane and
bamboo, textile, ceramics. The Implementation and Operation Division also
administers BSIC's industrial estates (for location of industrial estates,
see Map).
4.        The Administration Division is headed by the Secretary who has
the rank of a director. His Division looks after such matters as recruitment,
personnel policy, administration of BSIC's regional offices and public
relations.
5.        The Planning Division comprises the Planning Department, SIAS
(which has now become a Department within the Planning Division), the
Mechanical and Civil Engineering Departments and also the Rural Industrial
Service Department which provides technical assistance to artisans and
small entrepreneurs in rural areas. At present, the Loan Recovery Department
is also included in the Planning Division but will eventually be transferred
to the Finance Division. SIAS has three sections (each headed by a
"Manager") which, together with two other Departments in the Planning
Division, carry out the program financed under the IDA credit.
