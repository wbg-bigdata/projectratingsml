I. THE URBAN SECTOR
A. Urban Development in Indonesia
The Urban Sector and Growth
1.01      Indonesia's urban population of 31.4 million (1979 estimate)
accounts for about 22% of the country's total population of 140 million.
Growing at 3.7% per annum, the urban population's annual increase in
Indonesia exceeds that of most developing countries in absolute numbers.
Almost 1.2 million persons are added to Indonesia's urban population
annually. The growth and distribution of the urban population is uneven:
Jakarta, with over 8'million people, accounts for about a quarter of the
total urban population and with Surabaya (2.7 million), the next largest,
over a third; the ten largest cities encompass about 55% of the urban
population; over 40% of the annual growth takes place in Jakarta and
Surabaya. Current projections indicate the total population of Indonesia in
the year 2000 to lie between 190 and 200 million. Of these 70-78 million
are expected to live in urban areas. However, if, as some observers
predict, the "carrying capacity" of land in rural Java approaches its limit,
there could be a surge in rural-urban migration on that island, resulting in
a higher urban growth rate than currently predicted. Indeed, it is argued
that given the existing population pressure and technology and resource
constraints in rural areas, it is unlikely that rural per-capita income can
be substantially raised unless urban areas are stimulated to provide an
outlet for a rising portion of the expected population increase. The rapid
densification of rural Java and the link between city and countryside,
forged by an increasing pattern of circular migration,/l dictate a very
important role for Indonesia's cities in the years to come.
1.02      Employment in Indonesia's cities is concentrated in six sectors:
public and domestic services (33.1%), trade (26.1%), agriculture (12.7%),
manufacturing (9.5%), transport and communications (7.9%), and construction
(6.4%). While total employment has increased at a faster rate than urban
population in the 1970's, simultaneous increases in the working-age popu-
lation and the labor force participation rate have resulted in an increase in
the urban unemployment rate from 4.8% in 1971 to 6.4% in 1976. The unemploy-
ment situation is considerably more serious in urban than rural areas; the
1976 urban unemployment rate is more than four times the rural unemployment
rate, and the unemployed in urban areas look, on average, for nine months
before finding work, while their rural counterparts spend an average of
/1 The movement of rural workers to the cities during off-peak seasons in
agriculture, then back to rural areas during planting and harvest seasons.



-2-
six months looking for work. Moreover, while growth rates may be declining,
the pressure on the urban job market is likely to increase due to an
increase in the share of the population above age ten. The reverse is
likely to be the case in rural areas.
1.03      It is estimated by the Bank, that about 59% of urban residents
have a consumption expenditure level below the urban poverty threshold of
US$221 per capita per annum (1980 prices).
Urban Services Standards
1.04      Indonesia's urban areas are characterized by severe deficiencies
in essential infrastructure, as indicated by the following statistics:
(a) Less than one-third of the urban population has access tc. a safe,
reliable public water system and as a result, roughly half of the urban
population obtain water from private (often polluted) wells, springs or
rainwater collection, while others use the heavily polluted rivers and water
courses or purchase water from vendors at relatively high prices; (b) At
present, only four cities have sewerage systems; in each case, the system
covers only part of the city and is of limited effectiveness due to age and
inadequate capacity; (c) One quarter of the 1971 urban population had no
facility for human waste disposal and resorted to the use of surface drains,
ditches, canals or rivers. Only 17% are served by safe, sanitary latrines;
and (d) Approximately 40% of the urban housing supply consisl:s of non-
permanent structures. Current estimates indicate that over 200,000 new
urban housing units must be constructed annually in order to meet the
housing need by the year 2000.
1.05      Observers generally agree that the situation has deteriorated
rather than improved during the 1970's, as urban infrastructure expansion
has not kept pace with urban population growth. As a result, the public
health situation is particularly bad. The situation is especially severe
in the "kampung" areas - that is, in the clustered, densely populated urban
neighborhoods that house a large proportion of Indonesia's urban population.
Many of these areas rely on open-drainage channels to carry Dff rainwater,
septic tank effluent and household waste. These channels deteriorate to
open sewers and rubbish dumps, become blocked in the dry season and flood
the kampungs in the rainy season. Water and filth-borne diseases (e.g.,
cholera, typhoid, dysentery) constitute the principal causes of morbidity
and mortality in the country, which leads in the world in incidence of, and
deaths from, cholera. Infant mortality, already a high 126 per thousand on
average in Indonesia, can be substantially higher in the worst kampungs.
Urban Programs and Policies: Repelita I-III (First to Third Five-Year
Development Plan)
1.06      Although the Kampung Improvement Program (KIP) in Jakarta began
during Repelita I (1969-74), national programs for urban development really
began under Repelita II (1974-79). KIP standards and approaches used in



-3-
Jakarta were then adopted and expanded successively with Bank assistance to
other major cities - Surabaya, Ujung Pandang, Semarang and Surakarta. In
addition to these cities, KIP has subsequently been expanded to 30 more
cities, primarily on GOI's own initiatives but with assistance also from
the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Dutch Government. The standards
adopted for KIP were designed to provide basic minimum infrastructure in
the poorly serviced or unserviced areas of the cities. For low-cost housing
several institutions were created, the National Housing Board, a ministerial
level committee for setting policy was established, and PERUMNAS, the
National Urban Development Corporation, was authorized to build low cost
housing and the Bank Tabungan Negara (BTN) was assigned responsibility for
mortgage financing. A target of 70,000 units (of which 50% were to be sites
and services) for the income group between the 20th and 70th percentile of
the income distribution was established and achieved for Repelita TI.
1.07      Building on the policy and institutional base established during
Repelita II, a number of objectives, policies and programs have been
established for the current plan (Repelita III 1979-84). Five objectives
are particularly pertinent:
(a)  Improve the level of urban services in 150 small towns, (5,000-
50,000 pop.), 40 medium-sized cities (50,000-500,000 pop.) and
10 large cities (over 500,000 pop.);
(b)  Emphasize employment generation;
(c)  Increase equity in the provision of social services and in
income distribution;
(d)  Achieve more balanced regional development; and
(e)  Upgrade the environment.
In addition, the Government of Indonesia (GOI) has stated its intentions to
strengthen the development planning and management capacity of provincial
and local governments. Although not stated as an explicit objective of
Repelita III, Keuangan (the Ministry of Finance), Dalam Negeri (the Ministry
of the Interior) and BAPPENAS (the National Planning Agency) are examining
the restructuring of central and local financial relationships /1 by the end
of Repelita III, in keeping with the intentions of Law #5, 1974, that
greater autonomy should be devolved to the local levels.
/1 The Government has engaged Ken Davey and others of the University of
Birmingham's Institute of Local Government Studies to carry out a series
of studies on central/local government finances to assist it in this
restructuring. Two reports, Central-Local Financial Relations-A Report
for the Government of Indonesia, and The Financing of Urban Services
Development Administration Group, Institute of Local Government Studies,
University of Birmingham, have already been produced.



-4-
1.08      Urban sector programs have been developed based on these objec-
tives. The Repelita III program for low-cost housing is fairly well
structured.  PERU4NAS is responsible for building 120,000 units in 80 cities
during the five-year period for the target population between the 20th
and 70th percentile of the income distribution. Fifty percent; of this
program will again be sites and services. The cities chosen are provincial
and district capitals and growth poles, and the number of units allocated to
each is based on present population, and growth rate. Mortgage financing
for this program is expected to be provided by the Bank Tabungan Negara
(BTN) which should also finance 30,000 units of privately developed low-cost
units during Repelita III. The magnitude of the housing problem is indi-
cated by PERU4NAS' analysis which estimates that over 950,000 units will be
needed in the 80 target cities during Repelita III.
1.09      Cipta Karya - the Directorate General of Hlousing, Building, Planning
and Urban Development (Ministry of Public Works) has begun the preparation and
implementation of programs to institute kampung improvement and increase water
supply in a designated 200 cities [para. 1.07(a)] over the next four to five
years. Although this is an ambitious target which may not be realized during
the plan period, the approach which is being adopted offers the possibility
of substantial progress toward the objective. A minimum stancLards approach
has been chosen, and to the extent possible, predesigned stanclardized
packages of work which can be implemented quickly will be used. The
standards for these programs are intended to spread the benefits as widely
as possible to meet the equity objectives. Standards for KIP have been
defined in the form of cost per hectare of upgrading which determines the
level of service to be provided.  Three levels of cost standards have been
established: "threshold" at Rp 2.8 million ($4,480) per hectare, "minimum"
at Rp 6.0 million ($9,600) per hectare, and "desirable" at Rp 10.0 million
($16,000) per hectare. For Repelita III the objective is to cover 50% of
the kampung areas in need of improvement in a city. Under a "stimulus'
program, Central Government is to provide Rp 2.8 million per hectare as
grants to local governments to upgrade to the threshold standards at least
200 hectares per city in the large cities, 100 hectares in medium-sized
cities, and 60 in small cities. However, if a city agrees to add its own
resources to undertake a program to meet the Repelita III objective (50% of
kampung areas needing improvement) at the minimum standard, (Rp 6.0 million
per ha) Cipta Karya will extend its grants to half the prograni costs.
Similarly, for water supply Central Government provides grant funds to the
local governments to provide service to the "minimum" standard of 60 liters
per capita per day for 60% of the projected 1985 urban populal:ion. The
proposed project fits within the context of these policies and programs.
1.10      One constraint on the rapid expansion of urban service programs
and associated measures to improve property registration and i:axation, has
been the lack of adequate maps and topographical surveys. This is now being
rectified by the initiation of an expanded photogrammetric mapping program for
urban areas. This program is to be supported through this project.

B. The Project Cities
Selection
1.11      The cities already selected for inclusion in the project represent
another step in development of the national KIP and housing programs. They
are all provincial capitals and growth centers, medium sized by Indonesian
classification (except Palembang, pop. 764,000), and distributed among the
provinces of Kalimantan (Banjarmasin, Pontianak, Samarinda), Bali (Denpasar),
Sumatera (Palembang, Padang, Jambi) and Java (Jogjakarta Semarang). (See
Maps 15201-4.) This is also a logical extension of Bank involvement in the
urban sector which originated in Jakarta and has since been extended to
Surabaya, Semarang and Surakarta in Java, and Ujung Pandang in Sulawesi. A
discussion of the characteristics of the project cities is presented in
Annex 10.
C. Bank Role and Sector Strategy
1.12      Three urban projects in Indonesia have been financed by the Bank.
The first, the Jakarta Urban Development Project (Loan 1040-IND), approved
in 1974, included the provision of minimum basic services to about 900,000
persons living in 2,000 ha of kampungs, and the development of sites and
services for about 7,200 low-income families. The Second Urban Development
Project (Loan 1336-IND) was approved in 1976 to cover a three-year extension
of KIP in Jakarta encompassing an additional 3,000 ha of unserviced
kampungs henefitting 1.2 million more persons, and to extend the program to
Surabaya to upgrade about 375 ha benefitting some 200,000 persons. This
project also included pilot programs in the two cities to train volunteer
community health workers, who would be based in the kampungs to provide
simple curative and preventive health care. The Third Urban Development
Project (Loan 1653-IND) approved in January 1979, continued support to
existing KIP programs in Jakarta and Surabaya and extended the program to
Ujung Pandang, Semarang and Surakarta. It also expanded the program in
Jakarta and Surabaya, where the KIP program is well established, to include
complementary programs for solid waste management, drainage and land
registration.
1.13      Execution of KIP under the first two projects has proceeded well.
All infrastructure works under the first project have been completed within
the original estimate. Implementation of the second project in Jakarta and
Surabaya is nearing completion. The third project, after experiencing
initial delays in start up of about six months, is now proceeding
satisfactorily.
1.14      KIP-s success to date has prompted the Government to implement the
approach as a national policy and program. Fifty-five cities will be in-
cluded in the first three years of the third five-year plan.



- 6 -
1.15      The sites and services component of the first project has been
completed, two years behind schedule, primarily because of land acquisition
problems. A principal objective of this component was the rapid expansion
of sites and services provision as a complementary program to KIP. This
objective is now being partially realized as PERUIINAS is implementing a
program for 120,000 units, half of which will be sites and services, for
Repelita III.
1.16      In addition to financing physical development, the Bank has
supported a number of complementary efforts to develop the urban sector in
Indonesia. Technical assistance has been provided for improvements to the
property tax system (IPEDA), improvements to municipal administration, and
building the capacities of Cipta Karya, BTN and PERUMNAS. As Indonesia
prepares to implement national programs for KIP and sites and services, the
Bank will need to also support the development of Indonesian institutional
capacity that is able to manage these programs. The Fourth Urban Develop-
ment Project is an important step in that direction.
1.17      The Bank-s strategy for further involvement in the urban sector in
Indonesia is to: (a) support GOI initiatives in KIP, water supply and
housing (especially sites and services) by: aiding the develcpment and/or
strengthening of local government capacity for implementation; (b) strengthen
provincial/local capacities to plan and implement programs and integrate
urban programs in their overall development activities; (c) expand coverage
of the urban service programs in the larger cities to be overall municipal
infrastructure programs, and promote capital programming and budgeting; and
(d) develop and strengthen the central institutions' capacities to
plan, implement and/or supervise national programs, eventually making sector
lending possible.
1.18      In support of this, the Bank's lending program includes the East
Java water supply and urban infrastructure projects, a national program of
sites and services, and sewage, and transport projects in Jakarta. Each
of these projects contribute toward one or more of the objectives of the
Bank's strategy. The East Java projects would involve central, provincial
and local governments in a coordinated program, focussed at the provincial
level, which would improve urban services and infrastructure in a number of
cities, the national sites and services project would support the institu-
tion building and policy development process in the sector, while the
Jakarta projects would promote capital programming and budgeting for the
capital city and support institutional development in new and important
areas of activity in that city. During the preparation of these projects
the Bank expects to discuss with GOI the process of decentralization of
responsibilities from the Central Government, the structure, policies,
content, and implementation strategy for national programs, the development
of the resource base of municipalities, the expansion of economic development
activities and the management of urban development.

II. PROJECT COMPONENTS, COSTS AND FINANCE
A. The Project
Objectives and Description
2.01      The project has three principal objectives.  First, it is designed
to support the Government's efforts to implement nationwide programs of
kampung improvement and sites and services, by extending these programs to
nine provincial capitals. About 500,000 low-income residents would benefit
directly through the extension of KIP, and about 11,500 households (80,500
persons) through the development of sites and services. Priority for KIP is
given to the poorest areas and those in the worst conditions. Other
city-wide investments in solid wastes collection and drainage would also be
included.
2.02      Second, the project would secure major institutional change in
the housing finance sector by strengthening the management abilities of
BTN, providing it with technical assistance and involving it in appraisal
of this project. These actions are designed to make it an effective
instrument for generating and distributing funds for construction
and mortgage finance for low-cost housing. The related developer institu-
tion, PERUMNAS, the National Urban Development Corporation, would also be
strengthened.
2.03      Third, the project would assist in the initiation of a national
program for urban mapping. The maps to be produced by this program would
assist the government in preparing plans and programs for urban development,
management and financing. Two key institutions with major responsibilities
for mapping will also be strengthened: BAKOSURTANAL, the National
Surveying and Mapping Coordination Board, and the Directorate-General of
Agraria (DGA) responsible for the execution of mapping programs and the
preparation of cadastal surveys and land titles. About 100 cities would be
covered in this project.
Components
2.04      The project would include the following components:
(a) Kampung Improvement Program. Provision of basic infrastructure
services including roads, footpaths, drainage, water supply,
sanitation, solid waste collection, schools and health facili-
ties at minimum standards in low-income unserviced kampung areas.
A total area of over 1,900 ha involving about 500,000 people
would be included as follows:  Palembang, 320 ha for 157,000 people



-8-
Padang, 310 ha for 47,000 people; Banjarmasin, 270 ha for
86,000 people; Samarinda, 210 ha for 85,000 people; Pontianak,
430 ha for 88,000 people and Denpasar, 430 ha for 36,000 people.
(b) Sites and Services. The program of sites and servizes development
would consist of land acquisition, and construction of infra-
structure and housing facilities - with various core house options.
Sites have been acquired in three cities: Samarinda, 13 ha;
Denpasar, 54 ha; Jogjakarta, 37 ha. These 104 ha are to be
developed at average densities of about 60 units per ha for a
total of over 6,000 plots. An additional Rp 8.7 billion
(US$14.0 million) is proposed for financing projects totalling
an estimated 85 ha and 5,500 plots on sites in Padang (20 ha),
Jambi (20 ha), and Semarang (45 ha). These projects
would also be executed to planning and engineering criteria and
timing agreed with the Bank.
(c) Denpasar City-wide Improvements. The project includes a solid
waste management component in Denpasar, and the extension of the
existing water system from Denpasar to Kuta and Jimbaran.
(d) Urban Mapping Program. The component is designed to produce
1:1,000 scale photogrammetric maps of urban areas in order to
prepare medium-term and long-term programs for drainage, water
supply kampung improvement, sites and services, and urban planning
in about 100 large and medium-size cities to support the
government's national programs for expansion of basic urban
services. Those maps would also be used for land registration
and IPEDA tax assessment.
(e) Studies, Consulting Services and Technical Assistance. The project
provides assistance in (i) planning and implementation of KIP;
(ii) improvement of municipal tax collection; (iii) training in
urban development programming for municipalities; (iv) developing
PERUMNAS planning and management capabilities; (v) developing
capacities in BTN for functioning as a housing hank; (vi) prepar-
ing future projects; (vii) feasibility studies and engineering
designs of the first phase of the drainage system in Samarinda and
Banjarmasin; (viii) supervision of photogrammetric mapping by DGA;
and, planning, coordinating, and programming of large-scale
mapping services by BAKOSURTANAL.
B. Cost Estimates
2.05      The project cost (exclusive of direct taxes) is estimated at
Rp 53,740 million (US$86.0 million) with a direct and indirect foreign
exchange component of Rp 21,893 million (US$35.0 million) or about 41% of



- 9 -
the total cost. A summary of project cost is given in Table 2.1, with
d;etailed estimates in Annex 1.  Cost estimates for KIP are based on
coosultants preliminary engineering for all sites in the first year of the
program, and on typical unit-price cost levels established for similar works
in the Third Urban Project. As in earlier KIP projects, detailed engine-
ering is prepared on a yearly cycle, and the extent of physical works
adjusted to meet budgeted costs. Approximate costs for the urban mapping
have been estimated from a review of charges made in Indonesia and abroad
for a similar standard of work in dispersed urban areas and to specifi-
cations which have been reviewed and agreed by the Bank. Base costs include
for film,aerial photography, ground control, orthophoto and rectified photo
map output and topographic overlays, survey and mapping equipment, and
design and supervision. Cost estimates for sites and services are based on
consultants detailed engineering for the Denpasar site and preliminary
engineering for the Samarinda and Jogjakarta sites. Cost estimates for the
solid waste component and the Denpasar-Kuta-Jimbaran water supply, are based
on preliminary engineering and feasibility studies. Costs of consultant
technical assistance are based on an average of $10,000!man-month for foreign
and $3,000/man-month for local assistance. The base cost estimates are in
late-1980 prices. Physical contingencies are estimated at 10% for Denpasar
City-Wide Infrastructure and Sites and Services. Price contingencies
assumed to be on the basis of recent trends and in accordance with current
Bank guidelines, are: 1981, 18% for local and 9% for foreign costs; for
1982, 14% and 8.5%; and for 1983-1984, 10% and 7.5% per year for local and
foreign costs, respectively.
C. Detailed Project Description
Kampung Improvement Program (KIP)
2.06      The Kampung Improvement Program (KIP) for each of the six cities
has been designed along the lines of the on-going Bank-supported projects in
Jakarta, Surabaya, Semarang, Surakarta and Ujung Pandang. The basic concept
is to use limited available funds to provide basic minimum services to as
large an area of kampungs and in as short a time as possible. These
services include footpaths, secondary roads, surface drainage, water supply
from public standpipes, individual and communai toilets and washing
facilities, local solid waste facilities, elementary schools, and community
health centers.
2.07      Programs for water supply and drainage, within Cipta Karya, are
the responsibility of the Water Supply division, while improvements to
footpaths, roads, sanitary facilities in kampungs are the responsibility
of the Housinm  division.  As a result the KIP activities have been grouped
according to the assignlment of responsibilities for the services.

Activities, which are the responsibility of the Housing division have been
designated "Core KIP" while water supply and drainage, under the Water
Supply division, are called "Supporting Programs." Each group will be
financed and managed under its own program.  Core KIP (footpath, secondary
roads, sanitary facilities, solid waste management), will be designed
according to Cipta Karya's minimum standards, and cost up to Rp 6 million/
hectare. The financing and administrative implications of these arrangements
are discussed in paras. 2.21, 3.03 and 4.05.
2.08      Although hard and fast standards for KIP are not possible, or
desirable, given the considerable variation in existing conditions, levels
of service and population densities, some guidance and control is necessary
to maintain a reasonable balance of services within budget constraints. The
functional standards adopted for the Third Urban Project have been main-
tained, but varied according to the needs of particular cities, such as
those where flooding is severe (Palembang, Pontianak, Samarinda,
Banjarmasin) and one where densities are lower (Denpasar). Costs have,
therefore, been adjusted to take account of these conditions (para. 2.09).
Planning standards and facility levels of service are summarized in Annex 3.
At negotiations assurances were obtained that these standards will not be
varied without prior agreement with the Bank. Details of the design
procedures have been agreed with each municipal government and are set out
in detail in the project file.
2.09      The areas to be upgraded, number of beneficiaries, per capita and
per hectare costs (November 1980 price) of a four-year program in the
project cities are estimated as follows:

Community facilities and equipment would be provided in the project cities,
taking into account the availability of existing facilities. A program of
training for community health workers (CHWs) would also be included along
the lines of that undertaken in the Third Urban Development Project. The
estimate of community facilities requested and health workers to be trained
under the project are as follows:

Depasar City-wide Improvements
2.10      This component will include: (a) improvements to and expansion of
the solid waste management system in Denpasar; and (b) extension of the
water supply system from Denpasar to Kuta/Jimbaran.
2.11      The Denpasar solid waste system will be an expansion of the present,
very limited service to cover the whole of the Denpasar Metropolitan Area,
benefitting 175,000 people over the three-year implementation period of the
program. The system will comprise household storage in bins, alternate
day collection by handcart, transfer to central collection bins and,
finally, transfer by open, fixed trailer trucks and disposal to a properly
managed sanitary landfill. Landfill site development will be provided under
the project as well as technical assistance to help in the organization and
management of the system.
2.12      Water supply improvements to the southern areas of the city of
Denpasar are needed to overcome severe shortages in the Kuta/Jimbaran dis-
tricts as well as to provide adequate supplies to proposed KIP and sites and
services projects in the same vicinity. The proposed project will include
16.4 kilometers of 10-inch to 6-inch diameter pipes, and four booster stations
and balancing storage reservoirs. Water supplies will be obtained from the
present city distribution system and delivered to the areas concerned. It
is predicted that some 50,000 persons will benefit from the improvement by
1985. Average demand is based on a per capita consumption of 60 liters/day.
Sites and Services
2.13      The sites and services program will be carried out in six cities
throughout Indonesia including three sites for which engineering designs
have been appraised (Denpasar 2,622 units, Samarinda 778 units, and
Jogjakarta 2,604 units) and in Padang (20 ha.), Jambi (20 ha.), and Semarang
(45 ha.) the proposals for which will be appraised by BTN. These sites were
selected from PERUMNAS  larger program to meet agreed criteria (see Annex 4),
and will be designed to meet the standard and criteria set out in Annex 4.
BTN's appraisal will be based on these criteria and standards. Confirmation
of agreements on these standards and criteria were obtained during
negotiations. The target income group to be served comprises the low to
middle income households (15th to 80th percentiles of the income
distribution).
2.14      A total of approximately 104 ha will be developed in the three
sites currently prepared and about 85 ha will be developed in the cities to
be identified. Average densities of 60 to 65 plots per gross ha have been agreed
as design criteria and the projects are expected to provide accommodation
for about 80,500 persons. Land acquisition in Denpasar (54 ha), Samarinda
(13 ha) and Jogjakarta (37 ha) is virtually complete although some small
boundary adjustments may occur due to difficulties in obtaining certain
peripheral land.



- 14 -
2.15      Site development will include site preparation, provision of
infrastructure, both off-site and on-site, core housing and sanitary
facilities, together with education, health and other commun:Lty amenities.
Allottees will build their own house with technical assistance and super-
vision provided by PERUMNAS, and where desired by the allottees, loans to
purchase building materials will be provided by PERUMNAS (para. 4.13).
Loans will vary from Rp 50,000 to Rp 350,000, or adequate for: materials for
constructing rooms from 10 sq. m to a 70 sq. m house. All sites and services
allottees will be eligible for loans, the size of which will vary with their
incomes. On satisfactory completion of the work for which one or more loans
(totalling less than Rp 350,000) is intended, beneficiaries mnay obtain
further loans if their incomes at that time indicate that they can afford
additional payments. Loans may be provided either in vouchers, or in
materials, or both. Arrangements will be made by PERUMNAS for widely used
materials to be bulk purchased and be available through its stores or local
suppliers.
2.16      The standards and criteria are sufficiently flexible to allow for
variations in site physical condition, population characteristics, cultural
traditions and availability of local materials. The propose,l mixture of
plot types and core house options are shown in Table 2.4: (For illustration
of core houses and development options, see Annex 6). The plots and core
units for low and middle-income families, respectively, in Denpasar consist
of 60 and 90 sq m plots with sanitary installations (i.e., pipes and
connections for water and sanitary facilities, but no structare) and other
90 sq m plots with sanitary cores (pipes, connections, fittings, sanitary
facilities, and enclosing side walls). In Samarinda and Jogjakarta 60 sq m
and 90 sq m plots with sanitary connections are available to low income
families. In all sites, a temporary "starter" room (10-15 sq m) using
disposable or reusable materials, (e.g. thatch for roofs or wells, or
plywood), would be built. The reusable materials could be utilized later in
the interior of the house built by the occupants. Layout designs typically
permit 60-65% residential usage, 15-20% circulation usage and 15-20%
community/commercial usage of the gross area. Infrastructure standards and
criteria are listed in Annex 4, Appendix F. Assurances were obtained at
negotiations that the planning and design standards of the sites and
services components for Denpasar, Samarinda and Jogjakarta and for the
additional sites to be developed are acceptable to the Bank and will not
be changed without the prior approval of the Bank.
2.17      Community facilities, with the exception of secondary schools
financed by Central Government, are to be provided by the local authorities
from their INPRES programs. The facilities would include schools, health
clinics, markets and open space activity areas (see Table 2.5). Primary
school allocation is based on serving 80 students per classroom on a double
shift basis. Classrooms will typically be 60 m2 area net and costing is
based on current estimates for standard classrooms (Rp 80,000/m2 gross
area, inclusive of circulation space and ancillary accommodation).  Health
facilities would comprise a number of STK/polyklinik centers at neighborhood

Urban Mapping
2.18       Aerial photography to adequate standards has already been
undertaken since 1974 for 55 cities, through Dt. Cadaster of Dalam Negeri.
The photos for about half of these cities (including Jakarta) have been
developed into maps. Under the project rectified photo bases and
topographic overlays would be produced for the remaining 25 cities together
with an expansion of the program to fly and map a further 100 cities which
are a high priority in the' Government's urban development program. These
cities also include those in East Java and Sulawesi which the Bank has been
asked to review for future urban and water supply projects. The cities
would be flown at 750 meters above average ground level using 153 mm cameras
to yield a photographic scale of 1:5,000 which would yield maximum map
scales of 1:1,000 with topographic overlays of 1 meter contoar intervals and
vertical accuracy to +0.2 meters on spot elevations. The photographic map
output is acceptable to all the user agencies. In addition, a base map of
Java based on color edge-enhanced Landsat imagery and corrected to a UTM
grid would be produced at the 1:250,000 scale to provide base data for the
planning and acquisition of urban aerial photography.
Studies, Consulting Services and Technical Assistance
2.19       In addition to assistance for project design and supervision,
the technical assistance and training component includes about 710 man-months



- 17 -
of foreign and 540 man-months of local consultant services. Draft terms of
reference have been discussed with the concerned agencies and final versions
were agreed at negotiations. The items are as follows:
(a) Seventy-two foreign and 120 local man-months of technical
assistance to Cipta Karya's central KIP unit to assist in the
planning management and monitoring of the national kampung
improvement program and to design and implement a management
information system for this purpose;
(b) Five specialists comprising 120 man-months of foreign consultant
assistance to assist PERUMNAS in the areas of planning, construc-
tion management, estate management and finance for their
REPELITA III program, and on-the-job training of PERUMNAS staff;
(c) One hundred forty-four man-months of foreign technical assistance
to BTN for financial planning and management, project appraisal,
mortgage lending operations, construction lending operations,
administration, personnel planning and management, and computer
systems and operations to enable BTN to establish systems and
develop capacities for its role as a housing bank, and minimize
its reliance on government appropriations;
(d) Consultant assistance through Dalam Negeri comprising 24 foreign
and 144 local man-months will be provided to the project cities
to improve their tax collection and administration;
(e) Twenty-four foreign and 72 local man-months of consultant
assistance to help Dalam Negeri design and implement a training
program for local officials in the use of Planning, Programming,
Budgeting Systems (PPBS) in urban development programming; and
(f) Drainage studies and designs for flood-prone Banjarmasin and
Samarinda will determine needs for city-wide flood protection,
provide a drainage master plan and strategy for implementation
including detailed engineering of the first phase of construction.
Terms of reference have been agreed with the Government and were
confirmed during negotiations.  The studies should begin in mid-
1981. Further assistance will be provided, through an advisor,
to serve the two municipalities and assist in the evaluation of
the Master Plans and the organization of municipal drainage design
and operations units. A principal concern is the relief of
flooding in kampung and other low-income areas which are located
on vulnerable, low-lying lands. A total of 120 man-months of
foreign and 198 man-months of local technical assistance has been
included.
(g) Provision of 108 man-months is made for the hiring of consultants
to prepare new urban projects to a standard appropriate for Bank
appraisal and financing.



- 18 -
(h) About 72 man-months for seven foreign consultants to assist
Dt. Cadaster evaluate aerial photography mapping firms and
supervise the work.
(g) About 18 man-months for foreign consultants to assist BAKOSURTANAL
to plan and coordinate national mapping programs and to test-
plot one urban area using computer techniques.
Timing for key actions on this component is noted in para. 4.16.
D. Financing Plan
2.20      About 50% of the total estimated costs would be financed from the
proceeds of the proposed Bank loan of US$43 million, covering the foreign
exchange component of $35.0 million and some 16% of local currency costs.
The balance (Rp 26.9 billion) would be financed by the Central Government
and each of the local governments concerned in accordance wil:h Table 2.6
(details are shown in Annex 2).
2.21      The portion of the proceeds of the Bank loan ($8.8 million or 21%
of the loan) intended for the "core KIP" will be passed on by the GOI to the
cities through subsidiary loan agreements. The subsidiary loan, payable
over 20 years with a five-year grace period for principal, would bear an
interest of not less than 0.25% higher than the Bank loan to cover the BI's
administrative charges. The exchange risk in all subsidiary loan agreements
will be borne by GOI.  These terms are comparable with the three previous
Bank loans for urban development. Subsidiary loan agreements will be
required as conditions of disbursement to the cities involved. Central
Government funds for financing the remaining 50% of core KIP costs will
be passed to the cities as budgetary grants in four annual installments
1981/82-1984/85. The rest of Bank loans for KIP ($6.7 milliDn or 16% of
the loan) will finance half of Cipta Karya's supporting program expenditures.
Cipta Karya's budget will provide the other half of the funds needed.
2.22      Funds for PERUMNAS ($10.5 million or 25% of the loan) excluding
technical assistance, will also be passed on through a subsidiary loan
agreement, the completion of which is a condition of disbursement for the
sites and services component.
2.23      Funds for urban mapping will be passed on by GOI to DGA of the
Ministry of Interior and BAKOSURTANAL in the form of grants.
2.24      Funds for technical assistance will be passed on by GOI to cities,
DGA and BAKOSURTANAL as grants, and to PERUMNAS and BTN as equity.
Terms of Loans to Beneficiaries
2.25      Mortgage loan terms to sites and services beneficiaries will vary
with the type of plot and core houses, which are in turn related to income
groups. For plots intended for the income group from the 15th to the 39th
percentile of the income distribution the terms will be 5% downpayment,

20-year mortgage at 5% interest rate per annum; for the group from the 40th
to the 59th percentile, 5% downpayment, 20 years at 7%; and fcr the group
from the 60th percentile upwards, 5% down, 20 years at 9%./l This
interest structure would yield ar. average rate of 6.4%.  W4hile these interest
rates are negative in Indonesia (inflation rate over the project period is
estimated at about 12%) this regime is an improvement on the current terms,
which are 5% for all PERUMNAS-built units (95% mortgages). (1,TN also
finances privately developed units at 9% (90% mortgage)). These new
interest rates are considered to be the most politically viable at this
time, however, it was agreed at negotiations that these rates would be
reviewed and adjusted again by July 31, 1982. It was also agreed that interest
rates would be reviewed by December 31, 1983, taking into account the results of
the studies of BTN's financial requirements which are to be urLdertaken as
part of its institution development program. Assurances were obtained at
negotiations that the new interest rate structure would be impilemented by
July 31, 1981. Building materials loans will be on the same t:erms as
mortgage loans.
III. EXECUTING AGENCIES
3.01      The main agencies involved in the project are Cipta Karya, Dalam
Negeri and the local governments for KIP, the Badung Kabupaten. for the
city-wide improvements, the National Housing Authority, PERIRUIMS and BTN for
sites and services, and DGA and BAKOSURTANAL for urban mapping. The
structure, functions and capabilities of the agencies are disc.ussed in this
chapter; their roles in project implementation are discussed in Chapter IV.
A. National Housing Authority
3.02      The National Housing Authority, a committee of Cabinet Ministers
chaired by the Vice-Chairman of Bappenas for the Reform of State Apparatus,
sets national housing policy. The Executive Secretary of the Authority is
the Director-General of Cipta Karya and the staff of Cipta Karya constitute
the Secretariat to the Authority. Regular guidance and direction for
housing policy is facilitated through the Junior Minister for Housing who
reports to the President.
/1 Income distribution varies with each city; in Denpasar the projected
monthly 1980 incomes at the 15th, 39th, 59th and 70th percentile were
Rp 30,000, Rp 48,500, Rp 58,000 and Rp 83,500 respectively; in
Jogjakarta Rp 20,000, Rp 36,000, Rp 55,000, Rp 72,000; and in Samarinda
Rp 25,000, Rp 45,000, Rp 52,000 and Rp 66,000.



- 21 -
B. Cipta Karya
3.03      Under the Ministry of Public Works, Cipta Karya (Directorate General
of Housing, Building and Planning) is the principal agency at the national
level responsible for developing housing and urban development programs
responsive to policy guidelines set by NHA. Within Cipta Karya there are five
Directorates, each responsible for different aspects of housing and its
related services. These Directorates are: THousing; Building; Planning; Water
and Sanitation; and Building Materials Research. Cipta Karya assists
provincial and municipal government agencies involved in public works infra-
structure, housing programs, and regional planning, by providing technical
advice and financial support. The Directorate of Water and Sanitation
provides technical guidance for the water supply, solid wastes and drainage
programs, while the Directorate of Housing (Directorat Perumahan) is primarily
responsible for providing technical assistance regarding KIP to cities through
its Sub-directorate of Land and Housing Development. The Sub-directorate is
organized into five units responsible for the preparation, administration,
supervision and financial control of the KIP program financed from different
sources.
3.04      In addition to producing a set of useful guidelines for local
governments and consultants to use in preparing their KIP projects, the
Sub-directorate has initiated KIP in 35 cities and will introduce KIP to a
further 20 cities next year. A program to train local KIP staff in cities
which will shortly receive KIP has also been started and several training
sessions have been held in the provinces and in Jakarta. Staff is,being
expanded to try to keep pace with the program's growth (see Annex li), and
the Government has requested funds from the Bank for technical assistance
to develop and implement a management information and control system. This
technical assistance is to be included in the project.
C. Departamen Dalam Negeri (Ministry of Interior)
3.05      The Ministry of the Interior has a Directorate General of Public
Administration and Regional Autonomy (PUOD), which is responsible for the
administration and funding of the central government INPRES subsidy programs
to the provinces and the cities. It is further responsible for the approval
of appointments, staffing and salaries for provincial and local government
officials. It also must approve all borrowing by cities that exceed 20% of
their local revenues. Bangunan Kota (the Directorate of Urban Development)
which is a division of this Directorate General, has specific responsibility
for the municipal governments- development programs, including KIP. It must
approve both the size and nature of such programs after they have been
approved by the City Council and Governor. Dalam Negeri has discussed the KIP
components of



- 22 -
this project with the mayor of each city and agreed to the scope, costs and
timing with them and the staffing requirements to operate the program.
These agreements have been ratified by each City Council and Provincial
Governor.
3.06      The Directorate of Urban Development has recently become more active
in setting urban policy. As part of the implementation of Law No. 5 of 1974
which is oriented towards strengthening local autonomy and the powers of
local governments, Planning Boards (BAPPEMKA and BAPPEMKO) are now being
established in each Kabupaten (division of province) and Kotamadya (city) and
staff are being assigned or recruited to serve the Boards. The focus of the
Boards will be on the physical and spatial aspects of planning and on the
coordination and monitoring of investment required to implement the plans.
As part of this new activity, KIP is now receiving more attention from Dalam
Negeri, and the Ministry is providing guidance to the mayors and local
officials in the definition and implementation of KIP in their cities. This
follows the approach established under Urban III which has proven successful
in securing a full understanding of the KIP and an early start to
implementation.
3.07      The Ministry of the Interior will have the primary responsibility
for implementation of the urban mapping component. A Steering Committee
comprising the Director-Generals of Agraria, Cipta Karya, PUOD, Pajak (State
Revenue) and the Chairman of BASOSURTANAL has been formed. The Director-
General of Agraria is the Chairman and the Director-General of Cipta Karya
is Vice-Chairman of the Committee. The Secretary of this Commi.ttee is the
Directorate of Cadaster (Dt. Cadaster) within DGA. The commitl:ee is empowered
to decide on the policy, scope and responsibilities of the urban mapping program.
The committee has met and established working groups to select the cities to
be mapped, determine the budget and technical requirements for the mapping
agencies and monitor the outputs of the work. The Steering Coimmittee has also
agreed that Dt. Cadaster will be the contracting and executing agency for
the airphoto mapping work and will head the working groups.  DI:. Cadaster
(Directorate of Land Registration) is one of the four directorates of
the Directorate-General of Agraria (the other three being Land Use, Land
Titling, and Land Reform). Dt. Cadaster is responsible for boundary
surveys and title registration for all public and private land. As
of 1980, its staff comprised 70 Geodetic engineers, 395 Surveyors and 4,693
technicians/junior surveyors.  Most of this staff are located in the field and
form part of the Provincial and local government level offices of Agraria.
Headquarters staff total about 100, roughly half in technical positions. Due
to the increase in its workload, the Directorate is planning a substantial
increase in its staff. The urban mapping program will substantially reduce
the amount of ground surveying work, and release some of the D:irectorate's
staff located in each city for expanding the work on titling. Dt. Cadaster
has experience in urban mapping and has already mapped 55 citias since 1974
generally using aerial photogrammetric techniques.  It has a separte
section and staff dealing with urban mapping, and laboratory equipment with
the most recent orthophoto, rectification and plotting instrumants. Its key



- 23 -
staff are familiar with the use of the equipment and with the techniques and
management of aerial photography, ground survey and map production. Never-
the-less, this section requires strengthening to undertake the management of
this expanded program. At negotiations assurances were obtained that DGA
will strengthen the central office staff of Dt. Cadaster with geodetic
engineers, surveyors, plotters and accountants to levels agreed with the Bank
to manage the expanded urban mapping program and the production of cadastral
maps; (Annex 13) and employ expert consultants in aerial photogrammetry and
contract control to assist in the prequalification of firms and review
their capacities, to draft contracts, advise on bid awards, and
check the quality of air photo and map output from the private firms
contracted to undertake the work. The consultants would be hired by July 31,
1981 and before any work was contracted.
D. BAKOSURTANAL /1
3.08      BAKOSURTANAL, the National Coordinating Board for Surveys and
Mapping, is one of five nondepartmental agencies engaged in the collection,
processing and analysis of basic data and statistics under the control of the
Minister of State for Research. In addition to operational activities in the
field of resource survey and evaluation, production of smaller scale thematic
maps, and, beginning in 1981, production of national base maps, it is also
responsible for coordination, budgeting, and technical specification and
review of all aerial photography, geodetic survey, and mapping activities
undertaken by or for Indonesian government agencies. Finally, BAKOSURTANAL
conducts training programs in geodetic survey, photogrammetry, and resource
evaluation for staff of various government agencies at centers established
at major universities. BAKOSURTANAL is currencly implementing the National
Resource Survey and Mapping Project-(Loan 1197-IND), which supports several of
the operational activities and organizational functions mentioned above.
E. PERUMNAS
3.09      The National Urban Development Corporation (PERUMNAS) is an auto-
nomous state enterprise established in July 1974 under the first Bank-financed
urban project. The formation of PERUMNAS is a major initiative taken by GOI
for urban development under Repelita II (1974-79). Its objective is to
develop residential urban land throughout the country consistent with national
policies. PERUMNAS is responsible for buying, developing and re-selling urban
land throughout the country largely for low cost residential uses. It offers
the advantage of combining government seed capital, with authorization to
borrow from public and private sources, in order to develop facilities
neglected by the private sector.

3.10      PERUMNAS is headed by a President Director responsible to the Chair-
man of the National Housing Authority. The President Directcr and four other
Directors (Planning, Construction, Finance, and Estate Management) constitute
the Board which is responsible for managing PERUMNAS. The organization (see
Chart 1) is structured into four Directorates: Planning, Cons.truction,
Administration and Finance, and Estate Management. In addition, there are six
regional offices responsible to the Estate Management Directorate, and Project
Offices which report directly to the Board, in each city where PERUMNAS is
building. PERUMNAS is considered to be reasonably well staffed with
approximately 400 staff members at the headquarters in Jakarta; of these 74
are technical and professional personnel, 18 of whom are in planning, 15 in
construction, 16 in estate management, 24 in finance and administration and
1 in the office of the president. Regional and project office staff members
vary with the size of operations, but are generally adequate. PERUMNAS
staff resources are supplemented by consulting services when needed,
particularly for large projects.
3.11      During Repelita II, PERUMNAS developed 73,000 housing units in 17
cities, of which 50% are sites and services with core housing units and the
remaining 50%, low-cost housing units. In that period, PERUbINAS was pre-
occupied with meeting its target in terms of units constructed. The organi-
zation's output grew rapidly during its first years of operal:ion from
approximately 2,800 units in the first year to over 40,000 uniits in the fourth
year. In the process, however, important related activities were neglected,
including estate management and timely marketing of units, anid coordination
with other agencies on critical provisions such as water supply and land
titles. In addition no clear policies on pricing were developed and no
agreements reached with Bank Tabungan Negara (BTN), the instLtution
responsible for providing mortgage finance, on the criteria for selection and
processing of beneficiaries. In some instances developments were built ahead
of water supplies being available, some were completed before the processing
of applicants began, and successful applicants were allotted units and moved
into them before titles were available. Initially, as well, Government
required that PERUMNAS rent its units for two years to allow occupants to
accumulate downpayments. As a result of the preceding circumstances, 70% of
the available units are rented temporarily at rates which would be considered
uneconomic in the long term. These units are now becoming available for sale
and 2,730, about the amount constructed in the first year of operations, have
now been sold. PERUMNAS and BTN have now agreed on proceduras and criteria
for sale and mortgage financing through BTN and units will be sold as rapidly
as titles become available and BTN-s capacity allow them to be processed.
Nevertheless, 16% of the available units are vacant (down frDm 43% a year
and a half ago) primarily because of late processing of applicants and
unavailability of water supplies.
3.12      To correct these problems, PERUMNAS has developed a new set of
operating procedures which were discussed and agreed with the appraisal
mission (Chart 2). These procedures begin with the preparation of a project



- 25 -
Plan two years before occupancy, and establish, inter alia, forecasts for
housing demand, site plans, preliminary engineering and house designs, cost
projections, house prices and mortgage installments, and projections of the
target group served. This project plan guides the remaining stages of
detailed design and implementation and provides the estate management
department with information needed to select applicants about a year in
advance of occupancy.  This also provides the local water supply companies
with information on water requirements two years ahead of occupancy so that
supplies may be provided in time. Allottees will also be enrolled in a
savings scheme with BTN on selection, allowing them to accumulate the needed
downpayment. These new procedures should significantly improve the planning,
implementation and marketing of future projects. The appraisal mission also
discussed and agreed on annual target levels for the reduction in the number
of vacant units. In order to monitor this reduction PERUMNAS was
requested to prepare and discuss with the Bank a detailed program for this
purpose at negotiations. This program specifies the cause of vacancies
in each scheme, the number of units affected, and the actions to be taken.
At negotiations, assurances were obtained that (i) the agreed program to
reduce the backlog of vacant units from 16% of available units in 1980 to 5%
by 1984 will be implemented no later than July 31, 1981; and (ii) that the
operational plan for PERUMNAS which has been discussed and agreed with the
Bank will be implemented no later than July 31, 1981. Technical assistance
is to be provided in the project to assist PERUMNAS in the implementation of
the operational plan [para. 2.19 (b)].
Financial Structure
3.13      The sources of financing for PERUMNAS are Government budget funds,
loans from domestic and foreign institutions, and internal cash generation
(from rentals and sales). For construction, it finances some of the costs
through short-term loans from state commercial banks. Its operations to
date, however, have been financed largely from the central government
budgetary grants given to PERUMNAS as equity contributions. Repelita II
expenditures totalled approximately Rp 100 billion and as of December 31,
1979, its total assets amounted to Rp 118.6 billion of which 94% (or
Rp 111.8 billion) was financed through government budgetary allocations.
PERUMNAS also obtained loans from domestic and foreign sources for a total
of Rp 21.2 billion during the same period; however, most of these loans were
from local commercial banks and limited to short-term borrowings (three to
six months) which have already been refinanced largely from government
funds. While PERUMNAS has not obtained long-term financing locally for its
operation, it has received one long-term loan each from IBRD and the Dutch
Government; however, the amount of these loans is small (Rp 2.6 billion)
compared to the overall financing.
3.14      The financial statements of PERUMNAS for the period ending
December 31, 1979 and forecasts to 1984 are presented in Annex 7.



- 26 -
3.15      PERUI4NAS has been incurring substantial operational, losses since
its establishment in 1975, totalling Rp 4.2 billion in 1979. Because of
start up costs, slow processing in selling housing units, anc, government
price controls, PERUMNAS has not yet been able to generate sufficient income
from its operation to cover both operating and capital costs. The status of
PERUMNAS financial operations, however, is expected to improve since a large
number of housing units which are being rented are now ready for sale, at
prices which would generate substantial income. It has established as its
financial objective that over the next five years it will begin to generate
surpluses to ultimately (within eight years) eliminate its accumulated
deficits. As part of the step towards fulfilling this objective the Govern-
ment has agreed with the Bank to a pricing formula (Annex 4, Appendix A) for
public housing which would recover the full cost of houses built by PERUMNAS
including all operating and capital expenses. The Government has also
agreed that the initial two-year rental period for public housing will be
cut to one year for currently unallocated units, and the monthly rent will
be increased to a level which in that year would be equivalent to the amount
of downpayment (i.e., 5% of the selling prices) for the benef'iciaries to
purchase houses. Assurances were obtained that, beginning with the
implementation of new operating procedures (para. 3.12) unitE. will be sold
immediately on completion, without a rental period.
Financial Implications of Future Program
3.16      The development program for Repelita III, 1980-84, calls for
120,000 housing units to be built by PERUMNAS in 80 cities. The total
capital requirements for this program would be about Rp 240 billion ($384
million) in constant mid-1980 prices and Rp 300 billion ($48C million) in
current prices. This would require continuing government firancial support
until PERUMNAS sales program results in significant reduction in its
inventory of houses. PERUMNAS is, however, expected to imprc.ve its
financial operations by expediting its raarketing procedures and recovering
its investment through BTN's mortgage financing. To ensure the future
financial viability of PERUMNAS, the following operating perf'ormance
criteria were agreed: (i) operating expenses will be kept at no more than
5% of capital program (land and construction) and 16.5% of revenue; and
(ii) average unit prices in real terms will not exceed Rp 2.3 million (1980
prices). These measures are used in lieu of a sales or profitability
measure as to a significant extent PERUMNAS' sales revenues are dependent
on BTN's processing capacity, and are thus outside of PERUMNAS' control.
However, it can control its capital program and related expenses for imple-
mentation. Assurances on maintaining the agreed criteria were obtained at
negotiations.
3.17      The proposed development of sites and services with low income
housing is currently estimated to cost a total of about Rp 21.7 billion,
of which approximately 30% (or Rp 6.6 billion) would be financed by the
Bank. Clearly, the total capital requirement for the Bank project would be



- 27 -
small relative to the overall PERUMNAS development program, representing
7.4% of its total budget for Repelita II.
3.18       The financial forecasts for PERUMNAS for the period 1980-84 (Pro-
forma Income Statement, Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Statement) are presented
in Annex 7. The forecasts (which are deliberately conservative) indicate that
PERUMNAS is likely to continue to have operational losses in thie next two
years (until 1982), and is expected to generate surpluses from 1983 onward
(Annex 7, Table 1).  The projection assumes that, given a slow reduction in
inventories, the Government would continue to provide a substantial amount
of funds, Rp 205.0 billion during the period 1980-84, representing 94% of
the capital requirement for the five-year development program. The funds
from external sources have been estimated to total Rp 20.0 billion (or $32.0
million) which includes a Bank loan under the proposed project. The present
levels of inventories of PERUMNAS require continuous government contributions
to provide working capital. Annex 7, Table 2 indicates that levels of
inventory approximate levels of government contribution. The policy of
rapid sale of inventory would generate sufficient cash to eliminate the
necessity for ongoing government contributions.
F. Bank Tabungan Negara (BTN)
3.19      As part of its emphasis on housing for Repelita II, in 1975 the
GOI assigned responsibility for mortgage financing of PERUMNAS-built houses to
BTN, the State Savings Bank. In 1978, BTN was further authorized to provide
mortgages to private developers. Its operations are supervised by Bank
Indonesia (BI) under the general umbrella of the Ministry of Finance.
3.20       BTN is managed by a Board of Directors, consisting of a President
Director and two managing directors appointed by the Government, on the
recommendation of the Minister of Finance, for five-year terms. At present,
BTN is operating with its head office in Jakarta and seven branch offices
located in Jakarta, Bandung, Jogjakarta, Surabaya, Medan, Ujung Pandang and
Denpasar. It is structured into seven departments: Planning, Funds, Account-
ing and Finance, Housing Loans, Internal Audit, General Services and Person-
nel, and Office of the Board (Chart 3). The IHousing Loan and Internal Audit
departments report to the President Director, while the Planning, Funds and
Finance and Accounting report to one Director and the others (General
Services and Personnel, and Office of the Board) report to the remaining
Director. There is a Loan Committee, consisting of the Directors and the
heads of Funds, Housing Loans, and Loan Supervision (within Internal Audit),
which meets weekly. The staff of BTN totals almost 700 persons, 154 in the
head office and 535 in the branch offices.  Of these persons, 50 of the head
office and 93 of the branch office staff have technical or professional
qualifications. Nevertheless, there are insufficient numbers of qualified
staff in important areas such as civil engineering, where there are only
three. A thorough analysis of BTN's staff needs will be carried out as part
of the institutional development program.



- 28 -
3.21      Since having responsibility for mortgage financing, :he lending
operation of BTN has been relatively slow compared to its init:ial program
target of 10,000 loans per year (see para. 3,25 for details of BTN's port-
folio). BTN's performance during 1979 was rauch improved over previous years.
Up to December 1978, less than 10% of total commitments of 21,427 units for
Rp 47.8 billion had been executed. In 1979, three-and-a-half times more loans
were executed than in the three previous years combined. In 1980, BTN planned
to process 9,000 PERUMNAS and 8,000 non-PERUMNAS housing loans. The major
reasons for this relatively slow lending operation are: (i) past delays in
establishing a clear government policy for housing finance; (ii) extension of
commitment periods to developers because of project delays; and (iii) BTN's
difficulties in expanding its organization and improving its management at the
pace required.
3.22      Although there have been improvements in BTN's performance (in 1980
processing of private housing schemes should be in excess of Repelita III
annual target), the organization nevertheless needs to be strengthened
considerably. It is financially weak and incurred losses in 1.78 and 1979
(Annex 8). In addition, to fulfill its Repelita III responsibilities, it must
appraise projects from PERUMNAS and private developers providing approximately
30,000 units per year (24,000 PERUMNAS, 6,000 private) and process loans for
purchasers of the units. Currently, project proposals from private developers
are examined with some care to determine whether designs and pricing are
appropriate. Local price norms are applied, initially by the branch offices,
then reviewed by headquarters (Housing Loans Department). PERUMNAS projects
are not as carefully scrutinized, partly because of insufficient capacity in
BTN and partly because of an implicit assumption that PERUMNAS work will fit
BTN's norms. During preparation of this project, Bank missions held extensive
discussions with officials of BTN, BI, the Ministry of Finance, and the Junior
Minister of Housing, on a program of institutional development for BTN. As a
result, a Steering Committee chaired by the Ministry of Finance, withi tne
Vice Chairman from BI, and including representatives from Cipta Karya, BTN,
and the Office of the Junior Minister of Housing, has been created to oversee
a program of technical assistance to be provided through the Bank. To facil-
itate early implementation, financing of the technical assistance will begin
from proceeds from Loan 1336-IND and will continue under this project. The
technical assistance will provide consultants to develop systems, procedures
and training programs for Finance, Construction Lending, Mortgage Lending,
Project Appraisal, Personnel and Administration and Computer Operations. This
assistance would include developing a financing plan for BTN indicating, inter
alia, its financing needs, likely sources of private and public sector funds,
and the measures needed to attract these funds. In addition, an updated
mortgage processing, collections and accounting system will be developed and
implemented; policies and procedures for construction lending, including the
strengthening and expansion of appraisal capacity, will be instituted; and,
staff requirements, job descriptions, personnel policies, recruitment and
training programs would be established. While specific financial objectives
cannot be established at this stage, the Government agrees that BTN should
be financially self-sufficient, and the financial plan to be prepared should



- 29 -
be predicated on this objective. In support of this the Government has
announced that BTN will be seeking financing from the private capital market.
Terms of reference for the technical assistance have been agreed with the
relevant officials, and consulting firms have tendered proposals to provide
the required services.
3.23       The GOI has also taken other steps to improve BTN's capabilities.
The terms of the previous Board of Managing Directors recently expired and a
new President Director and Managing Director for Administration have been
appointed. New policies and procedures for the use of BI line of credit have
been developed and have been approved by BI. A proposal to enter into
construction lending by participating with the State Commercial Banks (which
would take the lead) is viewed favorably by BI; permission is being sought
from BI for BTN to enter the call money market in order to place its
unutilized deposits, and mortgage interest rates are to be raised (para.
2.25). These measures should improve BTN's financial position as well as its
operations. In addition its loan approval procedures are being reviewed and a
simplified set is being developed.
Financial Structure
3.24       While BTN has been funded largely through government budgetary
allocations, it has also been obtaining long-term loans for its lending
operations from Bank Indonesia (BI) and mobilizing local funds through
savings deposits. As of 'December 31, 1979, the government funding amounted
to Rp 27.8 billion, representing 45% of the total assets, with BI loans of
Rp 11.5 billion (19%) and savings deposits of Rp 19.3 billion (31%).
3.25       For the period ending December 31, 1979, BTN approved 47,104 housing
loans for a total of Rp 121.9 billion, averaging Rp 2.6 million per loan. Of
this total approval, 9,842 loans were committed for a total of Rp 22.2 billion
averaging Rp 2.3 million per loan, representing 18% of the total approval.
In addition, BTN channelled government funds for a total of Rp 8.0 billion
into Bali Emergency Loans for houses destroyed by a severe earthquake in July
1976. The following summarizes BTN's portfolio of housing loans:

Bali Emergency Loans            -       8,000
3.26      Because of slow processing of mortgage financing, particularly for
PERUMNAS houses, and due to relatively high operating costs, BTN incurred
operational losses of Rp 260 million in 1978 and Rp 380 million in 1979.
While BTN has been using a substantial amount of government funds for housing
loans at no cost to itself, it has not benefitted significantly from this
because of very low collections of the Bali emergency loans to beneficiaries.
Financial Policies
3.27      At present, BTN's lending terms are 20 years at an interest rate of
5% for PERUMNAS houses with 95% financing, and 15 years at 9% for non-PERUMNAS
houses (which are generally for upper income families) with 90% financing.
While funds for PERUMNAS houses are obtained through government budgetary
allocations, 90% of the loan funds for non-PERUMlNAS houses are obtained from



- 31 -
Bank Indonesia in the form of liquidity credit at an interest rate of 3% and
the remaining 10% from other scurces. The sources and allocation of funds
for financing PERUMNAS and non-PERUMNAS hiouses would continue as at present
until the current management and operations system of BTN is strengthenedr
However, since BTN's lending operation is expected to expand considerably
over the next five years, it will need to mobilize a substantial amount of
funds to meet the growing demand for mortgage financing in the housing
sector. If non-government sources are to be used, and this appears likely, it
will also need to raise the current lending rates to a level which would
attract potential investors, both institutions and individuals, to parti-
cipate. The new interest rate regime (para. 2.25) agreed with GOI would
average 7.6% over its projected Repelita III portfolio. This would be a 1.4%
improvement on the same portfolio under the existing regime.
Financial Projections
3.28       The financial forecasts of BTN for 1980-85 (Proforma Income State-
ment, Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Statement) have been prepared in mid-1980
constant prices and are presented in Annex 8. The forecasts indicate that BTN
would continue to incur operational losses in 1980 and is expected to generate
surpluses from 1981 onward as it adds more loans to its portfolio. The
lending program for 1980-84 calls for 95% mortgage financing of 120,000 units
to be built by PERUMNAS for a total of Rp 262 billion, and 90% mortgage
financing of 30,000 units by private developers or individuals for a total of
Rp 135 billion. It is expected that the funds for financing of PERUMNAS
houses would be through non-repayable, interest-free government budgetary
allocations over Repelita III. For non-PERUMNAS houses, it is assumed that
90% of the loan funds would be obtained from Bank Indonesia at an interest
rate of 3% for 15 years and the remaining 10% from savings deposits at 12% for
10 years. The projections on income from interest on housing loans is based
on an average interest rate of 7.6%, derived from the lending terms for
various income groups which have been agreed with GOI, together with
agreements on BTN's projected lending program which includes the number of
units and amount of loans for various income groups over the next five years.
3.29       Given the above lending program and based on the projected terms
and conditions of the loans, it is expected that BTN will cover its operating
costs and meet its financial obligations in 1981 and further, earn net income
equivalent to 8.1% on average net worth in 1984. This low return is due to
relatively high overhead costs for both savings and lending operations of
BTN. An average interest spread of 5% projected for housing loans should
cover the cost of money, including interest and administration costs because
of the high level of government support. Nevertheless, it is necessary to



- 32 -
improve and streamline the current operating procedures of BTN considerably
to enable its operations to be carried out effectively and to substantially
reduce operating costs in relation to its portfolio by increasing its rate
and efficiency of loan processing.  Technical assistance provided to BTN
under the project will help in identifying and implementing appropriate
measures to achieve increased operational efficiency.
G. Local Governments
3.30      City governments in Indonesia are essentially administrative divi-
sions of the Central Government, although city budgets and projects must also
be approved at the provincial level as well as by Dalam Negeri. The mayor,
who is the executive head of the local government is appointed by Dalam
Negeri and reports to an elected City Council which must approve his
proposals. Taxing authority and levels of taxation are set by the Central
Government. Within these financial constraints, the mayor has considerable
influence. He has a staff which deals with all major public services (except
electricity). There are generally separate municipal departmients which deal
with public works, sanitation, garbage disposal, health, social welfare,
education, finance, planning, general administration, and law and order.  An
autonomous municipal enterprise (PAB) is responsible for municipal water
supplies. There are also branch offices of the national line agencies in the
city which provide technical assistance to the mayor-s staff. Although at
present, most of the cities lack qualified technical staff this is largely
because they have had no major capital works to administer. Experience with
secondary cities of similar size which participated in KIP under the Urban II
and III projects has shown that the cities are very keen to implement KIP and
are able to mobilize and train staff quickly with the initial help of
consultants and Cipta Karya. After a slow start over the first year the KIP
units are subsequently able to execute the program at the prcjected speed.
Specific organizational arrangements being made to strengthen the capacity of
each of the local governments to implement their KIP projects are discussed
in Section IV.
IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Kampung Improvement
Management
4.01      The Kampung Improvement Program (KIP) will be the :Largest public
capital investment project in each city. The planning and implementation of



- 33 -
the program will be under a separate city KIP unit, whose manager will report
to the mayor. The KIP unit will be guided by a Steering Committee chaired by
the mayor.  Its membership will include the heads of the: (i) Subdirectorate
of Planning; (ii) Subdirectorate of Development; (iii) Subdirectorate of
Budget and Finance; (iv) City Planning Department; (v) City physical and
social infrastructure agencies; and (vi) District Heads (Camat) where
relevant. The function of the Steering Committee will be to review the KIP
budget and financing for the coming fiscal year; to agree on selection of
;.dmpungs for improvement; to resolve problems of coordination with other
muunicipal departments; to expedite land acquisition; to supply suitable staff
for the KIP unit; and to refer larger policy issues to the City Council, the
Province and the Central Government, as appropriate. This committee will have
authority to coordinate economic and social, as well as physical infra-
structure programs together with other development projects of the city.
Chart 4 illustrates the organizational arrangements proposed.
4.02      The functions of the KIP units (Chart 5) are to prepare and imple-
ment the social, economic and physical components of KIP from pre-planning
through supervision on a yearly cycle. The units in all cities will define
kampung areas for improvement, develop a budget and financial plan, and will
prepare drawings and specifications and manage the infrastructure contracts.
They will also arrange for necessary land acquisition and relocation of
families, as necessary, in close coordination with the Office of Agraria,
the land acquisition committee and the social affairs department (PMD). The
planning and implementation of the program will be done in collaboration with
the communities affected and, for this purpose, a field office staffed by a
social worker will be established in each kampung slated for upgrading.  The
office will inform the kampung committee (Camat, RWs, RTs), and other non-
governmental community associations about the program, provide a forum for
discussion and modification of the plans and provide liaison between the KIP
office and the kampung committee. The field office will also be the base
for supervision of the physical work.
4.03      In earlier projects, the KIP unit has been organized into three
divisions: planning, construction management, and finance and administration,
reporting to a project manager. Apart from occasional weak coordination
between planning and supervision, this arrangement has worked well and will
be continued in the new program and established in the new project cities.



- 34 -
A core of full-time staff in the KIP unit will manage most of these
functions supplemented by the line agency staff (Dinas) of each city. The
core staff requirements for the program in each city have been agreed with
the municipal governments concerned and with Dalam Negeri (see Annex 11).
Three cities already have operational KIP units. Assurances were
obtained at negotiations that a KIP unit will be established and adequate
staff appointed for the units in each city not later than July 31, lQl.
4.04      As in the Third Urban Project a special unit for land registration
and acquisition in KIP sites will be formed. Timely land acquisition has
been a problem for the program in the past and now, with the aLddition of
the registration of plots and regularization of tenure in the project, the
Government has agreed to establish a special unit within the Land Office
(Directorate Agraria) of each city with a full-time staff at the same time
as the establishment of the KIP unit. The unit will: (a) register all
public land occupation and tenures; (b) arrange for occupants of public land
to purchase their plots; (c) value the land and buildings; and (d) develop a
timely process for the acquisition of land for public access and facilities.
4.05      The supporting programs to KIP, drainage and water sutpply, will be
supervised out by Cipta Karya's regional office and the local water supply
companies (PAB) respectively. Cipta Karya will also be resporLsible for pro-
viding or improving main drainage channels needed to permit effective use of
the kampung drainage works. Because of these divided responsibilities
coordination between these agencies and the local KIP units will be
necessary to ensure that implementation of all activities is properly
phased, and to avoid conflicts. To ensure this coordination, the following
arrangements will be made: prior to each budget year, the prcposed program
and financing plan, including water supply and drainage elements which are
to be financed under Cipta Karya's supporting programs, will be prepared by
the KIP unit and submitted to Cipta Karya, Dalam Negeri, and the Ministry of
Finance. The central government agencies will be responsilble for ensuring
that appropriate budget allocations are made for the year's program.  Puring
the preparation of contract packages, the manager of the KIP unit, the head
of Cipta Karya's provincial office, and the local PAB manager will disctuss
and agree on the composition and timing of the water supply and drainage
contracts for the year. As most drainage works will be included in
contracts managed by the local VIP unit for associated access improvements,
Cipta Karya's supervision will be limited, in these cases, to verification
of work completion to specifications. These arrangements were discussed
with Cipta Karya and were confirmed at negotiations, and the arrangements
agreed were not changed without tl7e prior approval of the Bank.
Kampung Selection
4.06      Each local government is responsible for the preparation and
implementation of KIP with guidance from Cipta Karya and Dalam Negeri.



-35 -
Each city has defined a five-year KIP for Repelita III (1979-84) of which the
Bank will assist in financing the first four years. In all cities, kampungs
have been chosen for improvement based on a combination of different criteria
which give priority for improvement based on: (a) worst environmental condi-
tions; (b) high density; (c) oldest areas first; (d) closeness to existing
infrastructure networks; and (e) willingness and interest of the community
for KIP. The programs have been adjusted to fall within the financial and
implementation capacity of the local and central governments. The list of
kampungs slated for improvement in the program were agreed with the city
governments during appraisal and are in the project file. Some flexibility
will be necessary for adjustments to this list as implementation proceeds.
Policy on Physical Development and Tenure in KIP Areas
4.07      Kampung improvement financed under the Bank loan will be new to
all of the project cities. It is therefore important that the principles
and major policy features of KIP are clear both to government officials and
to project beneficiaries. Under the Third Urban Project a KIP policy
statement was agreed with the mayor of each provincial project city, and
incorporated in a mayor's decree for each city, and covered by an
Instruction (No. 5 of 1979) from the Minister of Dalam Negeri. The KIP
policy statement, to be agreed by the mayors for this project would state
the following:
(a) announce a five-year program of kampung improvement which will
upgrade the environmentally depressed areas starting with those
where conditions are worst;
(b) outline the components of the program involving drainage, sanita-
tion, footpath and vehicle access, water supply, and community
facilities;
(c) a policy of only minimum disturbance of existing houses - the KIP
infrastructure will be designed to fit into the existing layout of
the kampung;
(d) policy on compensation and relocation arrangements for families
whose houses have been eliminated by the project;
(e)  Hak Guna Bangunan title (long-term renewable ownership right) or
Hak Pakai (long-term right of use) will be offered for sale to those
families who are occupying public land on the date of occupant
registration.
Most of the features of the KIP policy outlined above will be incorporated in
a mayor s decree for each city, ratified by their respective city councils.
The policy aspects which are common to all cities and/or those not covered by
the mayor-s decrees will be incorporated in an implementation directive to be
issued by the Director General of PUOD in Dalam Negeri. Assurances were



- 36 -
obtained at negotiations that the mayor's decrees and the implementation
directive from Dalam Negeri as indicated above will be issued no later than
July 31, 1981.  Presentation will be in a form and substance satisfactory to
the Bank and GOI.
B. Denpasar City-wide Improvements
4.08      The city-wide improvements component will be managed by Cipta Karya.
Implementation will be the responsibility of the following agencies: (a)
Denpasar Solid Waste-Local Authority (Kabupaten Badung, with technical
assistance): (b) Denpasar Kuta/Jimbaran Water Supply - Proyek Air Bersih
(PAB), Bali Unit (design only) and Perusahaan Daerah Air MirLum (PDAM)
(construction and operation).
C. Sites and Services
Management
4.09      For the three projects which have already been designed (Denpasar,
Samarinda, Jogjakarta) PERUMNAS will be responsible for construction,
coordination with other agencies, and marketing. PERUMNAS will also be
involved in preparation of later projects including determining demand,
carrying out feasibility studies, and planning and designing site works and
housing options based on criteria agreed with the Bank (para 4.10). These
future projects must be prepared by PERUMNAS and submitted for appraisal by
January 1982 in order to be included for financing under this loan. BTN
will provide mortgage financing for project allottees, and will also be
involved the appraisals of the proposed future projects. The first of these
will be jointly appraised by BTN and the Bank as a test of BTN's capacity and
understanding of the criteria agreed with the Bank. (Technical assistance
in being provided to BTN to develop these capabilities, along with other
institutional improvements.) If, as anticipated, BTN's performance is
satisfactory, it will will undertake the remaining appraisals and submit them
to the Bank for review. Projects which do not meet the cril:eria and standards
agreed would not be disbursed against, however, other projects could be
submitted to replace any rejected as long as the new submissions are within
the first year of project implementation. Should BTN not have adequate
capacity the remaining projects would be appraised by the Bank with as much
BTN involvement as feasible so as to assist in developing the needed
capability.
Design Criteria
4.10      Criteria for project design and appraisal have been discussed and
agreed with PERUMNAS and BTN. (Details are included in Annex 4). The main



- 37 -
features are that:  projects must be diesigned to meet the income distribution
of the cities in whichi they are located, with, 50% of the units for the income
group froin the 15th to the 39th percentile and reachiing down to at least the
20th percentile, 30% to those between the 4Oth and 59th percentile, and 20%
to those at the 60th percentile and above; cities to be selected must have
over 100,000 population withi a growth rate above thie national average of 3.5%
per annum except where there are significant deficits in 'housing provision.
Sites to be selected must be at an affordable cost, within reasonable distance
of thie city center, close to emnployment opportunities, witlh suitable access to
and availability of water, in suitable physical condition, and with minimal
acquisition problems.
Beneficiary Selection
4.11       Plot allottees are to be selected to match the income distribution
in the proportions to which the projects have been designed.  Allottees will
be employed or self-em2ployed persons who do not already own a house, and whose
incomes fall, within the agreed (15th-80th percentile) income distribution.
They will be chosen at least a year in advance of occupancy and enrol-led in a
savings program with BTN to ensure that they will have the necessary
downpayment when units are ready.  The process of selection involves open
registration of applicants, selection of qualified applicants, verification of
documentation, including incomae, ane where qualified applicants exceed the
available units, randoim selection of allottees from the quialified applicants.
Agreement was reached at negotiations on the above criteria and selection
process.
Title, Building Materials Loans, Mortgage Collections
4.12       Delays in processing land titles have been a problem for PERI!MNAS
and BTN in the past.  To alleviate the problem, it has been agreed that BTN
will provide mortgages for projects as long as PFRUMNAS has received the form
of title (Hak Pengelolaan) giving it the right to develop the land.  In order
to ensure that land titles will be available before occupancy, PERUMNAS will
apply for the HJak Pengelolaan as soon as acquisition is completed, and seek
plot titles (Hak Guna Banguinan) for the allottees as soon as plots are ready
for occupancy. PERUMNAS will also expand its advance land acquisition program
in order to have control of sufficient land for development.
4.13       13TN will provide mortgages for serviced plots and plots with
starter rooias and core houses.  "FRITMAS will make available building materials
loans for allottees who requi re this faciuity to complete the houses.  Tp to
Rp 350,000 will he available for all plots, except those sold above cost.
P71RUMAS wil-l also provide technical assistance in building to the allottees
and will certify the conpletion oF units for wh)ich building materials loans
are oitatineJ.  C)n certiFication off coonpletion, BTh will refinance tlle existing
mortgage on open plots or core hiouse, an. thie building materials loan, in a
Qea; mortgage for the coripletetd unit.

D. Urban Mapping Program
4.14      In addition to the work done by Agraria (para. 3.07) a range of
cities have already been mapped by various agencies at different times. How-
ever, until recently no clear arrangements were made for information to be
distributed and to avoid duplication. The establishment and operations of the
commitee described in para. 3.07 indicate that this problem is being addressed.,
and that clear responsibility for managing, and supervising urban mapping is now
vested in Dt. Cadaster. Further, to make most efficient use of the limited number
of photo aircraft available, to avoid duplication of effort, BAKOSURTANAL will
coordinate and integrate the urban mapping work with other government mapping
projects. The project also provides for technical assistance to strengthen
BAKOSURTANAL to plan and coordinate both the wide range of mapp:ing activities in
the nation and to match the needs of the user agencies to the mapping capacities
available.
4.15      The map users would include the Ministry of Public Works and its
local offices in the Provinces and Cities, local government, and the cadastral
and IPEDA offices. The map originals will be stored at Dt. Cadaster's map
library with copies in BAKOSURTANAL, and Dt. Cadaster will arrange for dis-
tribution to other user agencies on demand, and to private deveLopers for a
suitable fee. The technical specifications and contracting arrangements for
the urban mapping program have been discussed and agreed with the Bank. The
volume of aerial photography and mapping work being undertaken by firms in
Indonesia is substantial and in some cases firms are overloaded. Neverthe-
less, capacity does exist but may need to be augmented by assist:ance from
foreign firms or individuals who can supply expert staff and additional
equipment. In the past the quality of output has also been uneven and more
careful prequalification of firms and better quality control is needed. These
problems have been discussed with Government and DGA has agreed to use
consultants to make a careful assessment of the firm's existing contract
commitments, quality levels and management to provide an informed basis for
prequalification, and to require firms to strengthen their capacities where
critical weaknesses exist. At negotiations assurances were obtained that
(i) DGA will employ consultants satisfactory to the Bank, who will prepare
a report for the Government and the Bank on each firm wishing to prequalify
and, (i) where critical weaknesses in capacity and quality exist firms,would be
required to strengthen their technical and/or management abilities and
productive capacity, including, if necessary, by associations with local or
foreign firms or individual experts in order to prequalify. It is considered
that these measures, together with the strengthening of Dt. Cadaster with
staff and consultant assistance to manage these contracts, will ensure adequate
quality control over the urban mapping program. The program would take two
years to complete, with the first output of rectified photomaps within 18
months.

E. Implementation Schedule
4.16      The project will be implemented over a five-year period.  Some works
initiating KIP began in September 1980, however, the project will begin
substantially in April 1981 and end in December 1985. The implementation
schedule is shown in Chart 6. Following negotiations, the initial key
implementation actions, with responsibility and completion dates are as
follows:

F. Procurement
4.17      Contracts for goods and equipment exceeding $50,000 each and hav-
ing a total value of approximately $2 million for dump trucks and pumping
equipment for the Denpasar city-wide infrastructure program, and surveying
and mapping equipment for the urban mapping program will be awarded on the
basis of international competitive bidding. A margin of preference of 15%
or the applicable customs duty, whichever is lower, will be applied to
offers of domestically manufactured goods. It is not anticipated that any
civil works contract will exceed $1 million, however, should such contracts
occur, they will be let on the basis of international competitive bidding.
Contracts for goods and equipment costing less than $50,000 wi:Ll be awarded
on the basis of local procedures acceptable to the Bank, except: for the
purchase of film, which will be procured through prudent shopp:Lng interna-
tionally. Between 250 and 300 contracts valuing up to US$1.0 mrillion from
civil works and estimated to total UE'$64 million will be let on the basis ot
local procedures acceptable to the Bank. The contracts would be for the
procurement of: (a) all infrastructure works, schools, and health posts
for KIP; (b) transfer centers, garage and landfill preparation works for
solid waste management; (c) civil works and equipment for water supply
extension; (d) site preparation, infrastructure and core housing construction
for sites and services; (e) community facilities (schools, markets, meeting
places, etc.) for sites and services; and (f) furniture, equipment and supplies
for the schools and health facilities. Foreign contractors are unlikely to
be interested in bidding on these works because of large number of small
contracts of short duration; the difficulty of working in dense!ly inhabited
kampungs and sites in secondary cities; the need for close relationships
with residents and local officials; and the labor-intensive nature of the works.
4.18      All contractors for civil works and furniture will be registered
with the agency or local government concerned and classified according to
their experience, financial standing and performance on similar works. The
list of registered contractors will be updated each year to alLow new
contractors to become eligible. The prequalification procedures were
discussed and agreed with the appraisal mission and those for the cities
will be reviewed by the KIP consultants each year to ensure their conformity
with Bank guidelines.
4.19      Following the practice in earlier urban projects in :[ndonesia,
documentation for civil works contracts over $320,000, including contract
documents, would be sent to the Bank prior to submission of application
for disbursement. Documentation for contracts costing less than $320,000
would be retained by the KIP unit concerned and be available for inspection
during the course of supervision missions. The KIP consultants would
review bids and bidding procedures for all procurement and prepare a report
containing the bid analyses and recommendations for award. wh1 h would be sent
to the Bank prior to submission of aDDlication for disbursement: for the
contract concerned. PERUMNAS will follow a similar procedure



- 41 -
as the KIP consultants for the sites and services component. Contracts for
equipment for over $50,000 and conformed copies of all contracts for the
urban mapping component would be sent to the Bank for approval prior to
submission for application for disbursement.
G. Disbursement
4.20      Disbursements of the Bank loan would be made against the follow
ing:
(a)  50% of all expenditures for civil works in the KIP including the
supporting programs and schools and health facilities, the
Denpasar/Kuta Water Supply and solid waste programs.
(b)  50% of all expenditure for civil works for sites and services;
(c)  100% of expenditures (CIF) for dump trucks and equipment imported
for solid waste disposal in Denpasar and eouivment for urban maDDing,
65% if these items are procured locally;
(d)  50% of the building materials loans for sites and services;
(e)  50% of expenditures for services, materials and supplies for urban
mapping; and
(f)  100% of expenditures for foreign and local technical assistance.

H. Accounts and Audits
4.21      Separate project accounts would be maintained by each municipal
government, and PERUMNAS giving separate breakdowns for land acquisi-
tion, civil works, equipment (including vehicles), supplies, health worker
training, loan disbursements, and consulting services. The project
expenditures would be accounted for separately by category for each fiscal
year. Accounting procedures already in use in the first three projects will
be the basis for establishing procedures in this project. Each agency and
municipality will arrange for an annual audit by independent auditors
acceptable to the Bank. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that
such audits will be carried out, and that the annually audited records of
project accounts will be submitted to the Bank within nine months following
the close of the fiscal year.
I. Operations and Maintenance
4.22      Responsibility for operating and maintenance infrastructure and
community facilities will be shared amongst several agencies (Chart 7) as
well as the residents in the communities.
4.23      The KIP operations and maintenance will be mainly a municipal
responsibility. Only water supply and electricity (where existing) would be
the responsibility of others (PDAM and PLN). The degree of city-wide main-
tenance provided by municipalities is currently constrained by limited
budgets./l As in the case of urban III project cities, the increases in
revenues projected from improved property tax collection (IPEDA) is, however
expected to assist improved maintenance and operation of KIP facilities and
other municipal infrastructure in the urban IV project cities. Official
efforts will be supplemented through fostering self-help amongst the
community. Examples of operations and maintenance functions suitable for
community participation includes household collection of garbage, cleansing
of ditches, and operation of public taps and sanitation facilities.
/1 Ongoing KIP-related operation and maintenance studies in urban III
project cities, initiated by the Bank, indicate that adequate operation
of the KIP facilities would warrant annual expenditures on the order of
1 to 2% of the initial capital costs involved. The above studies would
also help establish institutional and budgetary linkages between the
Public Works Department and the respective KIP unit in each city with
specific regard to their functional responsibilities for KIP
infrastructure operation. The findings of the studies will be extended
to urban IV project cities as appropriate.



- 44
4.24      The sites and services projects will be operated and maintained
for the first two years by PERUMNAS and subsequently taken over by the
appropriate municipality. On Presidential instruction, PERUMNAS'
obligations extend for a period of up to five years following completion and
are currently financed by a levy of Rp 800 per month over all occupied
households. This budget permits a solid waste collection service and
minimal cleansing operation (done by private contractors). Structural
repairs are met from PERUMNAS contingency funds and carried out by
maintenance crews, stationed on site where demand is sufficient (2,000
households per workshop) or where sites are small and more remote, a mobile
crew is used. In future, PERUMNAS will hand over responsibility to the
municipalities and utility agencies within two years on completion, since
such maintenance is properly a municipal responsibility.
4.25      Under the city-wide improvements, the responsibility for operations
and maintenance of the Denpasar solid waste system will lie with the local
authority (Kabupaten Badung). The water supply improvements will be
operated and maintained by PDAM.
J. Supervision
4.26      Supervision of the project on behalf of the Government will be
the responsibility of Cipta Karya. Consultants financed under the project
will advise and assist Cipta Karya in this task. The urban mapping
component will be supervised by the Directorate of Cadaster of' the
Dirtorate-General Agraria who will also employ consultants to assist them
in this task. BAKOSURTANAL will assist Dt. Cadaster in the timing and
synchronization of aerial photography of urban areas with other priority
programs. Supervision by Bank staff will require approximately 35 man-weeks
for the first year and 20 man-weeks per year for the following 3 years.
K. Monitoring and Evaluation
4.27      A system of long-term monitoring of the socioeconomic impacts of
KIP was commenced in 1975, and continued in selected kampungs under the third
urban loan. Under the fourth project, in addition to progress monitoring
carried out as an integral part of project management, selective monitoring
of the socioeconomic impacts of KIP and sites and services as they relate to
the smaller cities now entering the programs would be carried out under the
responsibility of Cipta Karya's central KIP unit, and PERUMNAS, respectively.
Format and other requirements for consistency with the ongoing programs will
be coordinated with the consulting firms already engaged in this exercise
under the existing projects.

V. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. KIP
Municipal Finances
5.01      Structure.  Municipal governments in Indonesia are responsible
for the provision and maintenance of all urban services including health,
primary education, social welfare, water supply, sanitation, roads and general
civic administration. The expenditures for most of these services are
financed from both locally generated revenues and central government grants.
Water supply, the development of which is financed by Central Government, is
operated by financially self-sufficient (in terms of operations and mainte-
nance but not capital cost recovery) water enterprises in most medium-sized
and large cities. The local revenue base is generally weak, consequently
municipalities normally rely on 30% to 55% of their revenue source from
grants.
5.02      In addition to central government grants and loans, the principal
sources of municipal revenues are taxes and local non-tax revenues. The taxes
include a variety of city taxes (e.g. entertainment tax, tax on automobiles),
development tax levied on thie sales of selected commercial enterprises (e.g.
hotels and restaurants) and property tax (IPEDA). The property tax, which is
levied under national government legislation, is collected and largely
retained (70%-80%) by the maunicipal governments. As the other sources of
,nunicipal revenues are limited, property taxes are potentially the most
important source of revenue for municipalities. The municipalities receipts
from IPEDA, however, are disappointingly low accounting for only 5-15% of
total revenues as compared to the 25% to 50% received from property taxes by
tnany cities in other countries. This low yield from property taxes is due to
the weakness in property valuation, the low percentage of properties covered,
and insufficient enforcenent of tax collection and follow-up procedures.  Over
the past fouir years the IPEDA collections have increased by an average of 25%
per year in current terms in the project cities. However, it is clear that
considerable improvements in the current system of property taxation are still
required to strengthen the munic-ipalities- financial capacity.  The project
will provide funds for technical assistance to help the project cities improve
their tax collection arid administration systems.

5.03      The following table summarizes the expenditures and resources for
each of the project cities in 1977/78:

5.04      The expenditures and resources of each city vary uidely depending
on the size of population, the nature and scope of industrial and commercial
activities, and eligibility for central and provincial government grants and
loans. Palembang, for example, with a relatively large population (764,000)
which requires a substantial amount of funds for expansion cf public service
relies heavily on central government subsidies for about 55% of the total
municipal budget. On the other hand, Denpasar with a relatively small
population (227,000) and a tourist based economy generates a significant
amount of income from development taxes from hotels and restaurants (about
40-45% of the total budget) and is less dependent on Central Government
subsidies. In some cases, municipalities undertake commercial ventures in
order to bolster their income. Pontianak, for example, whose financial
resources are extremely weak, has been borrowing large amounts of short-term
loans from both public institutions and commercial banks for the development
of commercial markets and related facilities; the amount of loans obtained
in 1977/78 represents 20% of the total municipal budget, about the same
amount as the central government grants the municipality received in that
fiscal year. Since most sources of municipal borrowings in Indonesia are
limited to short-term commercial borrowings from the banks at a relatively
high rate of interest, the municipal government in Pontianak has been
carrying a heavy debt service burden which makes its immediate financial
position rather worse than that of the other cities. However, present
indications are that returns on its investments will retire its debts by
1984.

Impact of Project on Municipal Finances
5.05      Financial Implications.  Given the inadequate financial base of the
various municipal governments, the financing of the KIP projects has been
structured in such a fashion that they would not represent an undue burden on
municipal resources in the short run. The Central Government would provide
as grants 50% of the cost of KIP works. The remaining 50% would be borrowed
by the local governments under the project. The debt service for these bor-
rowings ranges between 2% and 6% of the municipal governments- 1978/79
development budgets. However, after the current project, each local govern-
ment is expected to continue the program, on an expanded scale if possible,
from its own resources. In addition, there would be a need to devote addi-
tional resources to the operation and maintenance of the KIP infrastructure
facilities, schools and health clinics.
5.06      Cost Recovery.  Costs are recovered for KIP in Indonesia primarily
through the general IPEDA tax. In addition, there is partial recovery of
the cost for water supply from user charges. Although there is not a
betterment tax or specific charges for the improvements made, the areas
which have been improved will be rezoned, increasing the base rate for tax
purposes, within two years of completion of the improvements. More impor-
tantly, each city will take measures on a city-wide basis to improve
registration coverage of properties, upgrading property assessments to more
realistic levels and improvements in follow-up and enforcement to achieve
a significantly increased yield from IPEDA. Assurances were obtained at
negotiations that the cities will take appropriate measures to achieve a
general increase of 15% in real terms (30% in current terms in city-wide
IPEDA collections /1 for the next five years.  These increases will also allow
financing of future KIP programs in new areas and improving the operation and
maintenance of KIP and other infrastructure facilities (see para. 5.09 below).
Technical assistance would be provided to aid the municipalities to improve
their tax collection and administration.
5.07      Of the city-wide infrastructure items, the water supply extension
will recover some costs through the rate structure as is normally the case
with water supply enterprises. During the implementation of the solid waste
management component, a study will be carried out by Cipta Karya in coopera-
tion with Kabupaten Badung to determine the rate for and most effective method
of cost recovery for this item. Assurances were obtained at negotiations
that the findings of this study will be discussed with the Bank by April 1,
1983.
/1  This supports a 1978 Ministry of Finance Decree, effective April 1979,
requiring an increase of 30% in IPEDA receipts for 1979 by increasing
the base rates, and for increases over succeeding years resulting from
better administration and coverage. Results for 1979 indicate increases
from 30%-50% in project cities.

5.08       Projections of Municipal Budgets.  The projections on municipal
finances for each of the six cities for the period 1979/80-1984/85 are shown
in Annex 5, Table 1-6. Assumptions on the municipal expenditures (routine and
development) and revenues (central/provincial government subsidies, city and
development taxes, and local non-tax revenues) have been made on the past
trends in the growth of municipal finances by each account, with the exception
of INPRES and IPEDA accounts. As INPRES funds to be allocated to the cities
are subject to administrative decision and do not follow clearly discernable
trends, they are omitted from these projections. The receipts from IPEDA for
each of the cities, on the other hand, have been assumed to increase by 30% in
current Rupiahs annually during the period 1979/80-1984/85 based on the
Ministry of Finance decree, on 1979 experience, and targets agreed with the
cities.
5.09       These projections indicate the potential importance that improved
IPEDA collections may have for the municipal finance resources and cities'
abilities to undertake and maintain development programs. The relative
contribution of IPEDA receipts to overall municipal resources is expected to
increase from between 4% and 12% in 1979/80 to between 7% and 30% in 1984/85.
The debt service payments for both the proceeds of the Bank loans and local
loans would not create any significant financial burden in each of the project
cities, representing 2-5% of their projected total development budgets. With
the stipulated increases in IPEDA tax collections, it would be possible for
each city to finance future KIP projects without any further central
government subsidy. In order to upgrade all the unserviced kampung areas
in the cities, it is estimated that the programs should continue in each city
at the scale to be reached in 1985, for a further 8 years.
B. Sites and Services
5.10       Cost Recovery.  An objective of the project's sites and services
component is to recover the full attributable costs of plot and housing
development directly from the beneficiaries through sale of the plots
and housing. To that end, the project is designed to provide a large number
of plots with various types of core units which would be affcrdable by the
target income groups. Residential plots for high-income groups and sites for
commercial establishments would be developed and sold at market prices in
order to cross-subsidize plots for low-income groups.
5.11       Costs to be recovered include land acquisition, the proportion of
off-site infrastructure attributable to use by site beneficiaries, on-site
infrastructure, on-plot core units, utility connection charges, interest
during construction and overhead charges (design, supervision and management).
The optional building materials loans will also be recovered from benefi-
ciaries.  Nonrecoverable costs include part of the off-site infrastructure,



- 49 -
and community, health and education buildings which are funded under govern-
ment subsidies. For the affordability analysis, the recoverable land and
development costs (excluding core housing, utility connections and building
materials loans) have been allocated on a per square meter basis to the
saleable land. On this basis the costs of the residential plots for the
target population are shown in Table 5.2. The sale prices for these plots
have been reduced to affordability levels through cross-subsidization from
high-income residential and commercial land sales.
5.12      Of the total residential sites, low income groups (15th-39th percen-
tile of the income distribution) will be sold 53% of the lots in Denpasar, 58%
in Jogjakarta, and 50% in Samarinda (see Table 5.2 and Annex 12 for plot
sizes). The sites for the school and community facilities would be sold to
the local governments at actual acquisition and development cost. The high-
income plots and commercial land would be sold to the residential/commercial
beneficiaries at prevailing market prices, which should generate a sufficient
surplus to be used to lower the serviced land charges to the low-income
families. Actual sales prices of low income plots together with sub-core
housing units would be determined on the basis of affordability to the target
income groups. Table 5.3 shows a summary of the price mix and revenue
projections for the various plots at the three sites in late 1980 prices.
Affordability
5.13      The affordable prices of plots and housing have been determined on
the basis of monthly income of the target groups, estimated monthly expendi-
tures on housing, and terms of mortgage payments. The cost of site develop-
ment varies considerably among the cities due to differences in land
acquisition costs and site conditions. Nevertheless designs have been
adjusted to render each project affordable to the target population of each
city. Table 5.2 shows the cost per unit and affordable price range for
various income groups in each city.
5.14      The terms of mortgage loans to the target groups would be 20 years
with 95% financing at an interest rate of 5% for households up to the 39th
percentile of the city income distribution and at an interest rate of 7%
for households between the 40th and the 59th percentile. The monthly
payments for the low-income plots and basic core houses for households up
to the 39th percentile of the income distribution for each city would be
Rp 3,750-8,200 for Denpasar, Rp 3,600-6,000 for Jogjakarta and
Rp 3,300-7,450 for Samarinda. In addition, it has been assumed that the
amount of optional construction materials loans to the target groups would
range from Rp 250,000-350,000 per unit with the same terms and interest
rate applied for mortgage financing. The monthly payments for these loans
have been estimated to be Rp 1,675-2,345. Assuming that monthly payments
for utility charges would be up to about 5% of household income, the total
expenditures on housing would be 20%-25% of the total household income of
the target groups in each city. These exependitures on housing are within
an affordable range for the low income groups.

VI. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
A. Project Benefits
6.01      There are two types of benefits of the proposed project: (a) direct
service benefits to project beneficiaries; and (b) institution building
effects of project implementation. In brief, the direct service benefits
are those outlined below:
(a) The infrastructure works proposed under the project would provide
an economic stimulus to the kampungs by improving services and
access to small kampung businesses and raising human productivity
through better hygiene, health care and education at an average
cost of about US$43/capita (late 1980 prices) and benefitting
about 500,000 residents;
(b) the proposed health program would train and equip 470 community
health workers to deliver advisory and curative services to 520,000
kampung residents at an average cost of USS0.55/capita. This cost
would cover design and purchase of training materials, as well as
training, and equipment for health workers;
(c) The solid wastes management program would extend organized refuse
collection to 175,000 additional people in Denpasar (covering the
entire city) at an average annual operating cost Df US$1.50/capita.
Initiation of an effective solid wastes collection and disposal
system in Denpasar would check the rising pollution and clogging
of surface water channels, reduce the risk of flooding which arises
as accumulated garbage diminishes the capacity of storm water
drains, and make a major contribution to the control of filth-
borne diseases;
(d) The extension of water supplies to Kuta will immediately provide
new services to approximately 50,000 persons at the sites and
services site, a large KIP area and the nearby village of Jimbaran,
as well as reinforcing supplies to Kuta, a major tourism center,
and will accommodate growth in demand for at least the 1980s. The
extension of water supplies will alleviate unhygienic living condi-
tions in the new housing development and reduce the risks of
epidemic from polluted waters thereby improving public health and
protecting the valuable tourist facility;
(e) The provision of sites and services and core house options would
provide serviced residential units to low income households who
would otherwise have been unable to afford comparable accommoda-
tions. The estimated 11,500 plots in up to eight cities should
benefit over 80,000 persons between the 15th and 80th percentile
of the income distribution; and



- 53 -
(f)  Finally, the project would provide employment in the construction
and operation of the works. An estimated 40,000 man-years of
employment would be created, largely for unskilled labor, in the
civil works construction programs alone for kampung improvement,
water supply extension, solid waste rmanagement and sites and
services.
6.02      The institution-building effects of this project should be at
least as important as the direct service benefits. The planning and super-
visory capabilities of the central YIP unit in Cipta Karya and the solid
waste managemuent capability of the city of Denpasar would be strengthened;
KIP units will be established in the project cities, assisted by consultants
who will help them develop planning and managemaent capability to implement
urban upgrading programs. In addition, the tax collection and administra-
tive systems in the project cities are to be improved and the capacity of
Indonesian cities to program urban development will be enhanced by the
establishment of a tcaining program for implementing Planning, Programming,
Budgeting System (PPBS) through Dalam Negeri. The expansion of systematic
and accurate mapping of urban areas will allow priority investment programs
to be planned and executed more quickly, city planning to be more effective,
and tax and property registration to be brought up-to-date. Finally the two
major institutions in the housing sector are to be strengthened. PERUMNAS
will receive assistance in improving its planning and management systems and
operations and BTN will be assisted in a major institutional development
program to develop its capacity to fulfill its role as a housing bank.
B. Economic Analysis
Kampung Improvement Program
6.03      Quantitative evaluation of the benefits of KIP was based on the
estimated increase in property (and hence rental) values brought about by the
provision of infrastructure and services.  Although certain project benefits
may be only indirectly and imperfectly reflected in the market value of
property in the project area (e.g. increased lhuman productivity via improved
health), property values provide a useful indicator of the minimum value of
project outpujts.  Project cost estimates used in the economic analysis include
all net of tax costs of infrastructure, including design and supervision
costs, costs of operation and mnaintenance, and physical contingencies. Only
the costs of scnools and clinics are excluded, as the benefits of these
facilities are difficuLt to quantify accurately.  Within this framework, the
economic rate oF return for t'he proposed i-anpung improvement programs is 21%.
It is possible that since KIP provides for a najor expansion of serviced areas
in each1 of the cities, the increase in property values may be less than the
present value differential between service(d and unserviced areas.  it is
difficuilt to forecast the extent to 'qhich the dlifferential may be reduced, if
at all.  however, sensitivity analysis indicates that a 20% reduction in
benef'ts would still yiel(d a rate of return of 16%.

Sites and Services
6.04      The benefits from sites and services development are estimated
on the basis of the projected rental values from the development. These
values are estimated on the basis of current market value of similar, existing
developments in the project cities, Denpasar, Samarinda and Jogjakarta.
Costs included in the analysis are land, infrastructure, on 'Lot development,
relevant overheads, and operations and maintenance. All taxes are excluded.
Foreign exchange and wages are not shadow priced as existing wage and
exchange rates are considered to adequately reflect market conditions. The
economic rate of return for this component is estimated on these bases to be
15%. A reduction of benefits by 20% yields returns of 11%, and an increase
in costs of 20% results in a return of 12%.
6.05      The estimated weighted average rate of return for i:he KIP and sites
and services components, which account for 74% of project costs, is 18%.
C. Impact on the Urban Poor
6.06      In the project cities between 60% and 75% of the population fall
within the Bank's estimate of the urban poverty group.  If it is estimated
that the income distribution of the kampung areas approximates that of the
cities - a very conservative assumption as the kampungs selected for
upgrading are the densest and, in the worst conditions - then at least 60%
to 75% of the KIP beneficiaries would be the urban poor. It is reasonable,
therefore, to estimate that at least 75% of these beneficiaries fall within
the urban poverty target group. The extension of water supp]y and solid
waste management in Denpasar will be benefitting previously neglected areas,
which, with the exception of Kuta village, are well within ttLe lowest income
groups. Sites and services, by design, provides 80% of its plots to the
income group below the 60th percentile of the income distribution, the upper
limit of the urban poverty group. An estimated total of 680,000 persons
within the urban poverty group would benefit from the approximately US$53.5
million (62% of total project cost) of expenditures attributable to
relieving urban poverty.
D. Project Risks
6.07      The major risks in the project are from the inexperience of local
governments with KIP, and the possibility that BTN may be slcow in instituting
necessary organizational improvements. A great deal will depend on the
ability of the local governments to mobilize competent teams to execute KIP.
However, experience under the second and third urban projects indicates that



- 55 -
the cities have been able to rapidly build up their implementation capacity,
and the project also provides for technical assistance to strengthen the
nascent KIP units. Close supervision by Cipta Karya, Dalam Negeri and the
Bank will help to ensure timely and competent execution of that component.
6.08      Inability by BTN to adequately appraise the unidentified sites
and services component would not jeopardize the execution of this component,
as alternative courses of action for this eventuality have been defined.
The technical assistance being provided should strengthen BTN's capacity in
time for it to fulfill its function, nevertheless, should there be delay in
developing this capacity, the Bank would perform the appraisal function with
the assistance of BTN. This would lessen the institution-building impact of
the project but not delay physical implementation. However, as BTN's role
in the sector is crucial to the PERUMNAS activities, it is essential that
the Bank involve BTN in the project so that the Bank may monitor and assist
BTN in its organizational development program.
6.09      A further risk relates to the quality of aerial photography and
mapping which has not always been adequate in earlier transmigration
projects. However, recent efforts by BAKOSURTANAL to enforce quality
control and group local firms into more capable consortia has led to
considerable improvements. Further measures to be instituted through the
project include a thorough evaluation of firms, requirements for them to
take specific measures to improve their capabilities when necessary, includ-
ing through outside assistance, and strict quality control. It is
considered that these measures will be adequate to ensure quality and
timely production of maps.
VII. AGREEMENTS TO BE REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      During negotiations assurances were obtained and/or agreements
confirmed on the following principal points:
(a) the planning and design standards for the KIP and sites and
services components will be acceptable to the Bank (paras. 2.08
and 2.16);
(b) design standards and criteria for preparing and financing future
sites and services projects to be included in this loan (paras.
2.13, 4.10);

rate regime by July 31, 1981, revise them by July 31, 1982 and
these rates will be reviewed again by December 1983 (para 2.25);



(d) PERUMNAS will (i) reduce the backlog of vacant units beginning
July 31, 1981; and (ii) implement the operational plan agreed
with the Bank by July 31, 1981 (para. 3.12);
(e)  after July 31, 1981 PERUNAS will sell completed tvnits immediately
on completion (para. 3.15);
(f)  PERUMNAS will follow the performance criteria on operating
expenses and average unit price (para. 3.16);
(g) the cities and Dalam Negeri will staff the local KIP units and
Agraria units to agreed levels by July 31, 1981 (paras. 4.03,
and 4.04);
(h) the arrangements and responsibilities for managing and coordinating
the KIP and supporting programs were agreed with the Bank
(para. 4.05);
(i) the mayors' decrees and Dalam Negeri's implementation directive
on KIP will be issued by July 31, 1981 (para. 4.07);
(j) PERUMNAS and BTN will maintain arrangements for beneficiary
selection which are satisfactory to the Bank (para. 4.11);
(k) an increase of general IPEDA collection throughout the project
cities of 15% per annum in real terms for the next five years
will be effected (para. 5.06);
(1) the findings of the study on solid waste management in Denpasar
will be discussed with the Bank by April 1983 (para. 5.07);
(m)  Dt. Cadaster will strengthen its staff to levels agreed with the
Bank to manage the urban mapping program (para. 3,'7), and will
employ consultants to assist in supervision before any contracts
are let (para. 4.15);
(n) where critical weaknesses in aerial photography or mapping firms
exists, the firms shall be required to strengthen their technical
or management abilities and productive capacity, including by
association with local firms or individuals, in order to
prequalify (para. 4.15); and
(o) all contract relating to the urban mapping componenat will be sent
to the Bank for approval before signature (para. 4.19).

7.02      Completion of subsidiary loan agreements between GOI and the
project cities is a condition of disbursement against the cities KIP
expenditures, and completion of a subsidiary loan agreement between GOI
and PERUMNAS is a condition of a disbursement against sites and services
expenditures (paras. 2.21 and 2.22).
7.03      With assurances received on the points above, the project is
suitable for a Bank loan of US$43 million.

Marketing Plan
The objective of this marketing plan is to sell the units built
on completion of construction. This implies that the following steps will
be taken:
(a) Land title (Hak Pengolahan) will be applied for as soon as the
land has been purchased.
(b) The marketing process (advertising, taking of applications,
screening of applications, selection of eligible applicants, etc.)
will begin as soon as the project plan, which indicates the target
income population, is completed;
(c) Allottees will be enrolled in a savings program with BTN imme-
diately following selection;
(d) BTN will provide mortgage financing on completion of the schemes
as long as Hak Pengolahan has been obtained;
(e) PERUMNAS will apply for individual plot titles (Hak Guna
Bangunan) for the allottees as soon as plots are ready for
occupancy;
(f) BTN will finance open plots with the developed land as security
during the period when allottees are building their units. BTN
will also provide building materials loans for allottees to
assist them in constructing their homes, based on the allottees
ability to repay. The house and land will be refinanced on
completion, based on prevailing terms;
(g) BTN will provide mortgage financing for non-fixed income allot-
tees, with appropriate payment arrangements.

(a) Keep its operating expenses at no more than 5% of it:s capital
program (land and construction), and no more than 16.5% of
revenue;
(b) Keep its average unit price at approximately Rp 2.3 million (1980
base year), in real terms;
(c) Reduce its backlog of vacant units to 5% of availab:Le units by
1984.

Sites and Services
Criteria for City, Site and Target Income Selection
1.        These criteria are intended to serve as guidelines for PERUMNAS
programming and design staff, and for the project appraisal staff of BTN.
They are to form the basis for selection of cities, sites and project mix
for the funds programmed in the Urban IV project but not yet allocated to
specific sites.
2.        As PERUMNAS moves into medium size and smaller cities, the demand
for housing will require more careful analysis than for the largest cities.
At present about 80 cities are proposed for PERUMNAS housing over Pelita
III, accommodating a total of 120,000 units.
City Selection
3.        The criteria for selecting cities for PERUMNAS projects would be:
(a) Size. Cities over 100,000 population.
(b) Growth rate. Compound growth rate above the average national
population growth with priority for cities growing above 3.5%
p.a. This may be waived in conditions under (c) below.
(c) Density/backlog. Priority for cities of higher density and high
levels of rental.
(d) Regional distribution. To the extent possible within the above
criteria, cities should be selected to offer a good distribution
across the regions in the country.
Target Population
4.        PERUMNAS housing is designed to serve the low and moderate income
population as defined for each city under consideration. (See Appendix E
for income distribution analysis). The following criteria should be the
principal determinant for PERUMNAS' project design and BTN's beneficiary
allocation:
(a) The target population are those households having incomes from
the 15th to the 70th percentile of the city's income distribu-
tion. (See Appendix E for determination of city's income
distribution).
(b) For each site the numbers of beneficiaries of each income decile
should generally correspond to the numbers in the deciles of the
city income distribution, and the classes of plots (size and on-plot



- 80 -                         ANNEX 4
Appendix D

development) should also reflect this distribution. Within the
target group, the recommended distribution is 50% of plots up to
the 39th percentile 30% from 40-59th percentile, and 20% for the
group above.
Site Selection
5.        The following criteria would apply:  Sites should be;
(a)  within affordable travel cost and time of the city center and
close to employment opportunities;
(b) with suitable access to and availability of water';
(c) with suitable physical condition including minima], flooding and
suitable soils and slopes;
(d) with affordable land acquisition costs;
(e) with easy land acquisition.
Cost and Affordability
6.        Affordability of the target population for site and services
schemes (ranging from open plots to core houses) would rangE, from 15% of
total household income from the lowest income group to 25% for the highest
income group, applied to project capital development costs. (House develop-
ment costs by owner, user charges, and real estate taxes excluded).
7.        Costs to be recovered and the basis of prices to be charged are
listed in detail in Appendix A. Principal costs to be recovered would
include:
(a) Land acquisition.
(b) On-site preparation, infrastructure, and on-plot development
provided in the project.
(c)  A portion of off-site infrastructure (will vary on a case-by-case
basis).
(d) PERUMNAS overheads and certain other charges.
(e) Interest during construction.
8.        Costs not to be recovered include:
(a) Part of off-site infrastructure.

Appendix D
Page 3
(b)  Education and health facilities.
9.        Financing assumptions for affordability will be beneficiary mort-
gage repayments at 12% p.a. interest over 20 or 25 years and minimum 5%
down payment. Although present interest rates are different, it is estimated
that they will reach this average level within two years.
Planning Standards and Levels of Service
10.       The projects should be designed to meet the incomes of the target
population. Further guidelines are indicative to achieving this objective.
11.       For efficient layouts a land-use distribution for each site within
+ 15% of the following, should be applied: Residential 60% of gross site
area, small scale industrial/commercial 5%, recreational open space 8%,
roads and footpaths 18%, and community facility sites about 9%.
12.       The level of service proposed for infrastructure and facilities
is shown in Appendix F.

Methodology for Housing Demand Analysis
1.        Gathering the data for the analysis of housing demand will require
the sending of a set of questionnaires to the City Mayors through Dalam
Negeri, Information requirements should include the following:
(a) The area in hectares of the kampungs/desas in each city;
(b) The mid-1975 and mid-1979 population by kampung/desa and the
corresponding number of heads of households (depala keluarga);
(c) The present number of houses by kampung/desa classified by condi-
tion such as good, medium and bad; and
(d) Information on recent non-PERUMNAS subdivision and housing pro-
jects including area, number of units, plot sizes and target
groups plus ranges of monthly household incomes.
The housing demand analyses should cover the following major aspects:
(a) Map location of cities and their corresponding densities;
(b) Urban income/expenditure distribution by region based on the 1976
BPS Susenas results with projection per the methodology below;
(c) Number of households by decile/quintile of the target groups, as
developed from the number of households and the income distribu-
tion curve;
(d) Estimated demand of the target groups, taking into consideration
the following:
(i) Estimated housing backlog;
(ii) Various types of accommodation such as kampung expansion,
rental and new housing development projects; and
(iii) Estimated demand requiring PERUMNAS housing by quintile.
3.        The methodology of projecting income/expenditure distribution is
illustrated by its application to Denpasar, Jogjakarta and Samarinda. The
household expenditure distribution /1 for each of the three cities was
/1 The absence of reliable household income data in Indonesia leaves the
household expenditure data as the best estimate of income. At the
income levels concerned here (15th-70th percentile) the discrepancy
between income and expenditure will not be overwhelming.

based on the latest readily available survey - the third quarter 1979
National Socio-Economic Survey (SUSENAS) conducted by the Central Bureau
of Statistics. The results were tabulated on a regional basis, the lowest
government administrative level at which reasonable analysis can be done.
For Denpasar, the region is Other Islands (Bali, Nusa Tenggara Barat, Nusa
Tengarra Timur, Maluku and Irian Jaya); for Samarinda, it is Kalimantan;
and for Jogjakarta, it is the Special Territory of Jogjakarta. The 1979
urban distribution was projected to 1980 based on the historical trend
behavior of the general cost of living index for each city. This assumes
that there is no structural change within the household expenditure
curve during 1979 to 1980, and that the whole curve will shift by the
same proportion as the trend movement of the general cost of living
index. Future urban income distribution projections would follow this
methodology, in the absence of comparable expenditure surveys from which
structural changes may be discerned.
4.        Each projected curve will be analyzed through comparisons with
recent provincial or kotamadya surveys and with selected interview information
of monthly incomes of households in the kampungs, taking into account their
means of livelihood. The results of these additional data are used to adjust
the curves as seems appropriate. All adjustments and their rationale should
be explicitly stated.

FOURTH URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT CITIES
1.        Banjarmasin, the capital of South Kalimantan Province, has a
population of 403,000 (1980 estimate) making it the largest city in
Kalimantan and the eleventh largest in Indonesia. It has been growing at an
annual rate of 2.8%. The economy of the province is based on agriculture,
forestry and fishing, however, while the Gross Domestic Regional Product
grew at an average annual rate of 13.3% between 1969 and 1976, the greatest
growth came from the utilities sector (electricity, gas and water) (35.6%
p.a.) and the manufacturing sector (34.2% p.a.). During this period, the
relative share of the primary sector fell from 47.5% to 31.7% of total
economic output while that of manufacturing increased from 4.3% to 14%. In
1976, average productivity of workers in the province as measured by Gross
Domestic Regional Product (GDRP) per worker (Rp 285,000) was lower than the
Indonesian average (Rp 327,000) except in agricultural plots and rubber
areas. Banjarmasin has been designated the center of one of the two
development areas of the province. This area's main products are rubber,
coconut, pepper, fish and rice. The city's major function is as a port and
trading center, and a center of government; however, its deveslopment as a
sea port is inhibited because large ships cannot navigate th,s mouth of the
Barito river on which it is located and its development as an urban center
is constrained as it is subject to tidal flooding. Nevertheless, its site
is the most strategic location for exports in a region where development
could open up vast resources.
2.        Pontianak, the capital of West Kalimantan, is also the trade and
service center of the province because of its strategic location near the
mouth of the Kapuas river, where it is joined by the major tributary (Lat)
of the Landak river. Its population of 353,000 (1980 estimate) growing
annually at 3.8%, makes it the second largest Kalimantan city and twelfth in
Indonesia. The economy of the province is based on agriculture (54% of GDRP
in 1976), with trade and hotels (16% centered in Pontianak) and manufac-
turing (12%) being the next largest sectors. Growth of GDRP between 1969
and 1976 averaged 6.7% (about the same as the whole country), and was
relatively even across the sectors. Pontianak is the center of one of three
designated development areas of the province. Activities in this area are
mainly in rubber, coconut, fisheries, logging and lumber production. In the
city, unemployment is estimated at 3.6%, with most employed persons working
in services (25%), trade (20%), transportation (16%), and manufacturing
(10%) sectors. A water supply expansion program financed by a French
Government loan is underway to provide supplies to 60% of the anticipated
1990 population using individual connections and standpipes. This program
is scheduled to be completed in 1981.

3.        Samarinda, the capital of East Kalimantan province, is located
on the Mahakam river, 10 km upstream from the east coast of Kalimantan. It
is the third largest city in Kalimantan and about the 24th largest city in
Indonesia, with an estimated 1980 population of 259,000, growing at an
annual rate of 7.0%. Its growth rate is the highest of the eight cities in
the project and is one of the highest in Indonesia, well above the national
average of 3.7% per annum. The administrative area is an extensive
2,727 sq km (about 5 times the size of Jakarta) with 80% of the population
(165,000) living in the urbanized area of the city. Samarinda began as a
communication center where timber and other timberland products are
assembled for export. With the continued expansion of timber exploitation
and the development of natural gas and oil, the role of Samarinda has con-
tinued to grow with its additional functions as an administrative center in
a sparsely populated province. The local Department of Labor Statistics
indicate a high (20%) rate of unemployment in the city. Of the 124,500
persons aged 10 years and over, 59,000 or 48% are in the labor force, and
47,700 are employed, mostly in the trade and services sector. Average
worker productivity in the province is nearly eight times Indonesia-s
average because of oil and natural gas production, and the high productivity
of agricultural workers due to extensive frontier lands open to cultivators.
The Bank is financing a water supply project there, to be completed in 1980,
which is designed to supply 75% of the projected year 2000 population.
4.        Denpasar is located six km inland from the south coast of Bali.
It is the capital of the province and was established in August, 1978 as an
administrative kota, in Kabupaten Badung, a level below the administrative
authority of Kotamadya that the other cities in the project enjoy. The
population of the Administrative Kota is estimated at 227,000 in 1980, of
which the urban core population is estimated to be 185,000 and growing at
5.6% per annum. In addition to being the administrative center for
Government in Bali, Denpasar is the main service center with the majority of
commercial facilities, service agencies, hospitals, and upper level schools.
It provides the major concentrated source of employment opportunities in
Bali with an economic base of Government, trade, industrial services, light
industry and handicrafts. For statistical purposes, Denpasar generally
coincides with the boundaries of urban Bandung Kabupaten, which has a labor
force participation rate of about 44%, with 9% unemployed, and most of the
employed working in services (35%) and in trade, restaurants and hotels.
(30%).
5.        Palembang, the provincial capital of South Sumatera, is located
on the Musi River, 60 km inland from the north coast of Sumatera. Its
population of 764,000 (1980 estimate) makes it the second largest city in
Sumatera and the sixth largest in Indonesia, and it has been growing at 2.1%
per annum. The city is a major industrial, trade and administrative center.
Until recently industry there was dominated by river-oriented transportation
and distribution activities. However, industrial concerns (still very
dependent on the transportation network) are increasing: a Pertamina



ANNEX 10
102 -                           TPage 3
petroleum and chemical processing complex, a fertilizer plant, a rubber
processing plant, and minerals transhipment are located on the river banks,
and textiles and car assembly plants have located inland. Latest labor
force statistics (1976 estimates) showed 16.0% unemployeda. Employment was
greatest in trade, restaurant and hotels (27%) community, social and
personal services (21%), manufacturing (12%), agriculture, livestock,
forestry and fisheries (12%) and transport, storage and communications (9%).
Kampungs in Palembang were in the worst condition of any city in the
project. The overall density of Palembang is high, over 3,000 persons per
hectare in some kampungs. Owners of older houses have rented space beneath
them, and families are living in cramped conditions with little light and
ventilation, and are often flooded during the rainy season. Municipal
service levels are generally very low. A crash program to improve water
supply is underway with financing from the Dutch Government, and works are
expected to be completed by 1982. The resulting capacity should allow 90%
of the estimated 1987 population to be served with house connections (65%)
or by standpipes (25%).
6.        Padang, the capital of West Sumatera, is located midway along the
south coast of Sumatera on the Batang Aram (river). With a population of
311,000 (1980 estimate) it is the third largest city in Sumatera and the
fourteenth in Indonesia, and growing at 3.6% per year. The city's
economy is based on administration, services, distribution, marketing,
and industry including the production of cement and rubber, and processing
of agricultural products. The labor force participation rate is approxi-
mately 50% of which 10.4% were unemployed. Most of the employed (42%) were
in the services sector; trade (23%); and manufacturing (8%).
7.        Jogjakarta, a city of traditional importance, situated in a
fertile region twenty miles from the sea on the slopes from Mt. Merapi, is
the capital of the Special Territory of Jogjakarta. The region has been
culturally significant since at least the eighth century when the Buddhist
temple of Borobudur was built. The city itself was founded by descendants
of the Mataran empire, and when that empire was subdued by the Dutch in the
1750's, Jogjakarta was established as the capital of the Sultanate in 1756.
In 1825 the city was the center of Government in Java and in 1946 was made
the capital city of the Republic of Indonesia. In addition to being an
administrative center, Jogjakarta's economy relies on two major activities
which give a special atmosphere to the city. First, it is a university
town, host to 50,000 students including those of the Gajah Mada University -
a leading Indonesian institution. Second, it is a tourist city renowned for
its cultural attractions, its religious monuments, and its handicrafts in
batik, leather and silver. Its population of 497,000 (1980 estimate) is
growing at the slow rate of 0.9% per annum. The 1971 census data showed a
staggering 40.7% unemployment among the then labor force of 172,000. This
situation is said to continue despite various steps to promote employment
including providing credit for business development and training of the
unemployed. The major employment sectors (1971 data) are services, 39%;
trade, 29%; and manufacturing, 17%. Monthly household incomes in the lower
half of the income distribution are relatively low compared to other project

Page 4
cities. However, regarding existing infrastructure and current plans and
programs, Jogjakarta is relatively well served compared to other project
cities. The city is one of only two in Indonesia which has separate
surface water drainage and foul sewage systems. Because of its numerous
administrative subdistricts (desas) the city has been able to obtain
substantial grant funds ("Bangdes") from the Central Government which are
allocated to the various desas. This, combined with the strong "gotong
royong" tradition (self help-the spirit of the people), has allowed the
city to carry out significant kampung improvement works. In addition,
external entities, such as UNICEF - in health and child care, and the Swiss
Government - in water supply, are already giving considerable assistance.
The project, therefore, does not include KIP in Jogjakarta.
Semarang
8.        Semarang, the fourth largest city of Indonesia is located on the
north coast of Java midway between Jakarta and Surabaya. The capital of
Central Java, it was designated in Repelita II as the growth center for the
"subdevelopment region" that includes Central Java and Jogjakarta.  Its
population of nearly 1 million is growing at an annual rate of
approximately 2.6%. Vlhile it is experiencing growing competition from otner
coastal cities, Semarang remains an important seaport. All of its major
industries, trade centers and government offices are located on the coastal
plain surrounding the port area. While shipping and related activities
provide employment for a significant portion of Semarang's residents,
almost two thirds of the work force is concentrated in three sectors:
manufacturing (17%), commerce (27%) and government (20%) Median monthly
household income is estimated at Rp 24,000 (20% below the national urban
average).
Jambi
9.        Jambi, capital of the province with the same name, has an urban
population of about 225,000 growing at the rate of about 3.6% per annum.
As the only major city in the province it is the center of administration,
services, distribution, marketing,and industry.

FOURTH URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Staff Requirements in Directorate - General Agraria for Urban Mapping
1.        The execution of the photomapping of 100 cities will require a
fairly large staff supervision load over about 18-24 months. This will be
accomplished by the reassignment of existing staff to the urban mapping
project and the hiring of additional staff, probably on the basis of a
honoraria for two years. Staff demands for existing programs have been
reviewed and it has been determined that this staff reallocation will not
harm the execution of other DG Agraria priority programs.
2.        Summary of staff requirements is as follows:
Existing Additional
Skill and qualification                     staff       staff
Geodetic/photogrammetric engineers             5           5
Geodetic/photogrammetric
(Bachelor of Science level)                 10          10
Senior surveyors                              40          25
Total                                    55         40
3.        The existing staff will be reassigned by May 31, 1981 and the
additional staff are expected to be hired by August 30, 1981.

Poor access and drainage and frequent flooding
often result in conditions hazardous to public
health.
Waterways are critical to the economic life of
the coastal cities and the kampungs which over-
