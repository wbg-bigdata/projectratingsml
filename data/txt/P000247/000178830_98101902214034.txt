INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF UPPER VOLTA
FOR AN AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Upper Volta for the equivalent of
US$8.0 million on standard IDA terms to help finance an agricultural devel-
opment project.
PART I: THE ECONOMY
2.        The basic problems of economic development in Upper Voita were
set out in a report entitled "The Economic Development of Upper Volta"
dated November 27, 1970 (R70-237 and R71-2). An updating memorandum of
January 13, 1972, was distributed to the Executive Directors on March 2,
1972 (R72-47). An economic mission visited Upper Volta in April this year
and is preparing a report. Its preliminary findings do not substantially
alter the conclusions of previous reports. In particular, the mission has
tentatively concluded that higher petroleum prices, while not likely to have
a significantly disruptive impact on the economy unless physical shortages
develop, will add a further difficulty to an already difficult situation at
a time when the country is being severely affected by other factors, notably
the droughts and the increase in import prices in general. Annex I contains
country data, including data on foreign aid.
Background
3.        Upper Volta has been classified by the United Nations as one of
the 25 "least developed countries" in the world. The country suffers from
a number of serious growth constraints: distance from overseas suppliers
and markets, limited domestic markets and marketing facilities, generally
poor soils and unfavorable climatic conditions, lack of water and so far of
exploitable mineral resources, prevalence of endemic diseases, uneven popu-
lation distribution in relation to available resources, and low levels of
education and technical ability, particularly in the rural areas. The
country's poverty is reflected most acutely in an insufficient nutrition
levei, with animal protein intake only half that of neighboring Mali and
Niger.
4.        Upper Volta's economy is and will remain for a long time almost
entirely dependent on agriculture and livestock which provide a living for
95% of the population. Productivity in these sectors is very low, however,
and together they account directly for only a little over one third of CDP.
A further 10 percent of GDP comes from the manufacturing sector which is
closely linked to agriculture. A succession of droughts in the past few



-2-
years has caused a severe setback in agricultural production (cotton, food
crops, and Livestock), with consequent adverse effects on exports, and has
contributed iargely to the stagnation of the economy.   Wqith popula,ion grow-
ing at the rate of about 1.8 percent a year, real GDP per capita has remained
virtually unchanged since the early 1960's.    It has most probably declined
for large sections of the population in the central and northern regions.
5.        The 1972 and 1973 droughts have aggravated an already critical situa-
tion, particularly in the northern part of the country. Food production dropped
8 percent compared with 1971, and it is feared that the loss of cattle may have
been of the order of 15 percent of the national herd. Emergency food imports
reached some 60,000 tons in 1973 and requirements for 1974 could amount to as
much as twice that volume.
6.        Because of the limited economic opportunities at home, particularly
in rural areas, young people frequently choose to migrate nore or less per-
manently to coastal countries, where wages are much higher than in Upper Volta.
It is estimated that over half-a-million Voltaics have permanent or seasonal
jobs in neighboring countries, mainly in the Ivorv Coast. Their contribution
to Upper Volta's balance of payments in the form of private transfers is very
substantial, but the rural economy of the country is thus drained of some of
its most dynamic elements.
Public Finance
7.        Economic development has been further hampered by poor management
of public finances during the first years of independence to the extent that
by the end of 1965 the Government was heavily in debt on short-term account
and could no longer pay the salaries of its employees.    The military Govern-
me-ft which assumed pow-er in 1966 gave fir,st priority to the adoption and im-
?i.Lianration O.f a rical stabilization program aimed at reducing outstanding
1ebt9 and at bringing public expenditures and income into better balance.
AS a result the Government has been abLe to repay all its short-term debt
and has accuinulated relatively large liq:uid reserves.  This restrictive
pci _y and the growing flows of both externai aid and workers' remittances
a':e also resulted in accumulation of Large foreign assets, currently equiv-
al. n: to 6-7 months' imports. However, this has been achieved partly at the
COst of cutting back development expendicures, and a number of projects largely
.-,.anced by external assistance have been heid up because of the Government's
.e-r- restrictive budgets.  The recent economic mission found the Government
now readier to adopt a more aggressive and development-oriented expenditure
poiicy.
Foreign Aid
8.        Foreign sources have financed more than two-thirds of total invest-
ment expenditures effected under the first Development Plan (1967-70). The
principal sources of aid have been the "Fonds d'Aide et de Cooperation"
(FAC) of France and the "Fonds Europeen de Developpement" (FED) of the



European Economic Community. These two agencies together lhave so far
provided about 80 percent of all foreign aid to Upper Volta, principally
in the form of grants. About half of it was capital aid and one fourth
technical assistance and the remainder mainly food aid and recurrent cost
financing. A substantial part of French grants (a third in 1972) was for
assistance to the public administration; the rest was distributed (almost
equally in 1972) between projects in agriculture, road maintenance, educa-
tion, and telecommunications. FED's contributions were primarily for water
supply (urban as well as rural) and for roads. For the 1965-71 period, the
concessionary element for aid commitments was over 90 percent. This ratio
has not significantly changed in the more recent years. This reflects the
conviction of aid donors that Upper Volta needs the softest possible terms
in foreign assistance.
9.        In addition to this development aid, the international community
has assisted in alleviating the problems created by the drought situation in
Upper Volta and the other five sahelian countries affected (Chad, Mali,
Mauritania, Niger and Senegal). The emergency relief effort and the other
actions which have been taken to help these countries were described in detaii
in the documents concerning the Drought Relief Fund Project (R73-112).
Prospects
10.       The second five-year Development Plan (1972-76) was approved in
June 1972. Like the previous plan it is essentially a list of projects to
be undertaken over the next five years. The new plan does, however, give
increased attention to the problem of planning recurrent costs and the nec-
essity of a closer cooperation than in the past between the Ministries of
Finance and Planning. Proposed total investments amount to an average of
about US$40 million per year. A minimum per capita GDP growth of 3 percent
per year in current prices (or about 0.5 percent in real terms) was contem-
plated.
11.       On the basis of past experience, it is difficult to say whether
the planned investment level would be sufficient to achieve the growth tar-
get, especially because of the impact of unpredictable exogenous factors,
particularly weather conditions. The Government has been successful in
mobilizing external aid, but it is doubtful whether a marked increase in
the planned investment target would be compatible with Upper Volta's absorp-
tive capacity. The Government is hoping to interest foreign investors in
the exploitation of the country's mineral deposits, particularly the man-
ganese deposit near Tambao, but the economic viability of such an invest-
ment is uncertain in view of the heavy transport costs involved. The Tambao
project is currently under review by the Bank and other aid agencies. On
the other hand, agriculture should benefit substantially from the interna-
tional campaign for the eradication of riverblindness, planned to start in
late 1974. Large fertile areas amounting to up to 1,000,000 ha currently
uninhabited because of prevalence of this disease should eventually become
available for resettlement, and in view of the scarcity of good agricultural
land, development of these areas should yield high returns.



- 4 -
12.       Foreign capital and technical aid will continue to play a decisive
role in the development of Upper Volta, but if this aid is to be truly effec-
tive , there will be need for better coordination within the Government and
for some relaxation of present budgetary controls over development expendi-
tures, possibly linked with additional revenue measures to cover the increase
in recurrent costs. In addition, there seems to be scope for better coordina-
tion of capital and technical assistance projects as well as for closer coop-
eration among aid donors.
13.       In view of the level of poverty of the country, its limnited growth
potential, and the added uncertainties connected with the prolonged drought,
foreign aid should continue to be provided on concessionary terms. External
debt service at present absorbs about 4.4 percent of Upper Volta's export earn-
ings, and although this figure is fairly low in absolute terms, it is high in
relation to the country's very limited savings capacity. Equally, although
Upper Volta should be expected to make a more significant contribution to the
financing of public investment, this will necessarily remain modest, and ex-
ternal lending agencies must continue to finance a high proportion of local
costs if development projects are to move forward.
PART II:  BANK GROUP OPE'RATI-NS
14.       To date the Bank Group's contribution to Upper Volta's development
has consisted of seven projects on which little over US$3 million has so far
been disbursed (Annex II).   The first telecommunications project, for which
an IDA credit of US$0.8 million was made in 1969, was initially delayed by
difficulties in recruiting expatriate experts, but is now proceeding satis-
factorily and is expecred tc be conpleted shortly.   The lWest Volta cotton
project, tfor which an IDA creidic of 0 S$6.2 millior, was made ir, 1970, is also
oceecing satisfactor iLy, although drought conditions have kept production
thas far below expectations. An IDrA credi.. cf US$2.8 million was approved in
1972 for a cottori road project which was designed to complement the West Volta
cotton prolect by upgrading to gravelled surface two roads in the project area.
A  intcrease of US$1.35 million in the amount of this credit was recently
&z-)zpoved by the Executive Directors to take into account increases in project
c.i.t due to currency realignments and to cost: overrurns on the road construction
component. The rural. development fund project, for which an IDA credit of
LTS$2.2 million was ap-,roved in 1972, is now making some progress after a slow
start resultingr from delays over project prefinancing and staff appointments.
IDA credits of US$2 85 million for an education project and US$4.5 million for
a second telecommunications project were approved in June 1973, and the projects
are now getting underway. In the context of the Drought Relief Fund Project,
an IDA credit of US$2.0 million was approved for Upper Volta to finance sub-
projects aimed at alleviating the effects of the drought.
15.       The Bank Group's strategy in Upper Volta is dictated by the extreme
poverty of the country and the need to raise productivity in agriculture and
animal husbandry on which the bulk of the population depend for a livelihood.



-5-
A certain minimal infrastructure is required for the operation of the economy,
and the IDA projects for telecommunications and a possible second road project
are designed to help in providing this. For the rest, IDA lending is directed
primarily to the rural sector for projects in agriculture, education and rural
village improvements with special emphasis on operations which will favor
movements of people away from the overpopulated Central plateau with poor
soils to the Southwest where ecological conditions are much better. W4ithin
this broad strategy, the campaign for the control of riverblindness in the
Volta River Basins, for which the Bank is engaged in mobilizing the necessary
financing on an international basis, should open up new opportunities for
investment in land settlement and agricultural development, and the Bank
Group stands ready to assist in the identification, preparation and even-
tual financing of suitable projects in this field. Meanwhile, a special unit
has been created with the assistance of the French Government to prepare
schemes for the development of some of the river valleys.
16.       In addition to the proposed project, a number of projects are
under consideration for IDA financing. A FAC-financed study to determine the
feasiblity of a livestock project is presently underway, and the Bank Group's
PMWA is actively participating in its preparation. The Bank Group is also
considering steps to be taken to prepare a rice project in the western part
of the country. Road studies financed under Credit 316-UV are expected to
start soon and may result in a second road project in due course.
17.       Upper Volta remains one of the countries in which external assis-
tance is limited at present more by shortage of adequately-prepared projects
than by shortage of external funds. The Bank Group has been a relatively
small source of aid to'date by comparison with FAC and FED. However, since
FAC and FED aid is mainly in the form of grants, the Bank Group's share in
Upper Volta's total external debt outstanding at the end of 1973 amounts to
19.0 percent. Its share in the debt service is still negligible. Bank Group
commitments over the next five years are expected to increase significantly
both in absolute and relative terms and would amount to about one-fourth or
total aid flows to Upper Volta. This should put the Bank Group at par with
the other two main donors, FAC and FED.
PART III - THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
18.       Economic progress in Upper Volta depends largely on the performa-ce
of its agricultural sector which provides a livelihood for about 95 percent
of the population and accounts for practically all exports. The development
of the agricultural sector raises the issue of striking an appropriate balance
between food crops and cash crops and between crops and livestock, and of
defining means to achieve this balance. In addition, agricultural develop-
ment will require improvements in transportation, an adequate system of
extension services and rural education, the control of endemic diseases and a
better geographical distribution of the population in relation to available
resources. The Bank Group's strategy for lending to Upper Volta in this



- 6 -
sector, of which the proposed project is a part., is designed to assist the
Government in its efforts to expand food crop and cotton production, asso-
ciate crop cultivation with livestock raising where possible, and undertake
a variety of small low-cost projects (e.g., roads, wells, small dams, soil
conservation) likely to lead to small but rapidly-forthcoming imnprovements
in the productivity and livirng conditions of large numbers of farmers.
19.       Increasing food crop production must continue to receive high prior-
ity since, even with a large proportion of cultivated land under cereals, Upper
Volta's cereal import requirements average aboult 30,000 tons annually under
normal climatic conditions. The recent droug1hts have contributed to aggra-
vate this situation. Cereal yields are low, averaging only about 620 kg/ha
in good rainfall years, and reflect poor soil and climatic conditions, dete-
rioration of soils due to high population densit-ies, overcultivation and
overgrazing, limited use of improved varieties of the main cereals, sorghum,
maize and millet, and insufficient application of modern cultivation techni-
ques, such as insecticides, fertilizer and draft animals.   The on-going IDA-
financed projects in the rural sector and the proposed project are expected
to help deal with some of these problems.
20.        The number of cash crops which give satisfactory yields in Upper
Volta's arid climate and which can bear the high cost of transportation to
world markets is limited. Research might lead to the development of better-
adapted varieties. Currently, however, cottonl is the most suitable cash
crop in rainfed areas. The country's potential for cotton production appears
to be about 120,000 tons of seed cotton annually, and the Government aims at
reaching this level by 1980. This may be somewhat optimistic, but production
has already risen from an average of 2,500 tons in the late 1950's to 30,000
tons in the late 1960's. Tnis increase has been made possible by a relatively
efficient system of extension services combined with the fact that farmers are
hard-working and receptive to new techniques and price incentives.    The West
Vclta Cotton Project is already contributing to the Government's efforts to
raise cotton yields and production. Cotton production in the project area
in 1970, 1971 and 1972 as a proportion of 1969 production (an exceptional
year) was 91 percent, 118 percent and 134 percent respectively, whereas
cOt-ron production in non-project areas was on'ly 37 percent, 35 percent and
52 ;ercent- Cotton production in the project area now constitutes about 75
percent of total cotton production in Upper Volta.   The proposed project   is
to Duild on the progress achieved under the West Volta Cotton Project.
21.       Far more attention will have to be given to the livestock sector
which has been greatly neglected in the past and shows many signs of serious
deterioration. Cattle exports have been declining (from 75 percent of total
exports in 1966 to 36 percent in 1971) due to droughts, diseases, poor herd
management, and the unsatisfactory organization of veterinary and marketing
services. If this situation continues, increased domestic consumption could
eliminate cattle exports by 1985. A possible livestock project in the Bobo-
Dioulasso area was identified recently by PMWA, and a FAC-financed study is



- 7 -
presently underway to determine its feasibility. Such a project could prove
to be an important step in halting the deterioration of the sector. The
proposed project also includes a livestock component consisting of the pro-
vision of veterinary services and especially prophylactic vaccinations to
all livestock in the project area.
22.       Rural development in Upper Volta is hampered by the inadequacy
of the transportation network. Local communities are expected to maintain
secondary and tertiary roads, which are often little more than earth tracks,
but they often lack the resources to do so, and the roads are passable only
during the dry season. It is often difficult to supply densely-populated
areas with food, drugs and public services. The improvement of transport
links between villages and main towns is therefore an important component
of the proposed project.
23.       For the rural population to take full advantage of agricultural
extension services, it needs training and education. Much effort has been
put into agricultural extension, but the conventional system of education
is both very costly and insufficiently adapted to the needs of rural life.
The Government has long recognized that rural areas need a more relevant
and less costly type of education. Soon after independence, it established
a system of non-formal rural training through Rural Education Centers. The
IDA-financed Education Project aims in part at increasing the scope and
improving the quality of rural education and complements a similar FED-
financed project. The proposed project includes important technical assis-
tance and training components.
24.       Disease and malnutrition seriously affect human beings.    Malaria,
onchocerciasis, kwashiorkor (a children's disease caused by malnutrition),
bilharzia, trypanosomiasis, and trachoma are prevalent. As some of these are
water-borne diseases, the provision of more dependable and cleaner water
supplies envisaged under the proposed project should help to alleviate the
distress caused by these diseases in the project area. Similar provision will
have to be made in subsequent agricultural development projects.
25.       In many areas of Upper Volta, land is becoming less productive as a
result of continiued use of traditional agricultural techniques and soils are
deteriorating under a shortened fallow period. However, the Government has
become aware of the relatively good and so far little exploited agricuitural
potential in the southwestern part of the country. In this zone, substantial
areas are free of onchocerciasis and conditions are suitable for a wide range
of crops, and especially for sorghum, and for maize and rice. High-yielding
varieties of the latter crops are available. The southwest is also very suit-
able for livestock raising. The proposed project is located in this area. As
the onchocerciasis control campaign progresses, additional areas which are
presently uninhabitable because of the prevalence of this disease will become
available for settlement and agricultural development and should help reiieve
the population pressure on less productive land elsewhere.



- 8 -
26.       The major responsibility for rural development in Upper Volta rests
with the Ministry of Planning, Rural Development, Environment and Tourism. The
Banque Nationale de Developpement provides credit to farmers. The Ministry of
Public Works is responsible for infrastructure, in particular roads. To take
into account the diversity of conditions in various parts of the country, the
Government in 1966 created regional development agencies (Organismes Regionaux
de Developpement - ORD), of which there are now eleven. ORD's are responsible
for all rural development activities in their respective areas. The scope of
their activities has in practice been limited to providing agricultural exten-
sion, credit and marketing services; and rural infrastructure (roads, wells,
warehouses and dams) in collaboration with, and under the supervision of, the
five technical departments responsible for rural development in the Milnistry
of Planning, Rural Development, Environment and Tourism and the Ministry of
Public Works. IMost of the ORD's have been financed with external assistance
and managed by foreign development companies.
27.       The Government of Upper Volta has long been aware of the need to
reorganize its rural development services to ensure more effective coopera-
tion among the four technical departments of the Ministry of Planning, Rural
Development, Environment and Tourism and between the MIinistry and other gov-
ernment agencies and to achieve a better integration of OPD activities into
national priorities. The nee.d for such a reorganization is becoming more
urgent now, given the increase in the number of ongoing and potential agri-
cultural development projects and their growinlg complexity. IDA has therefore
proposed, and the Government has agreed, to undertake such a reorganization
no later than six months after the signing of the Development Credit Agree-
ment. The principal features of this reorganizationi are:
(a)  creating, under the direct responsibiLity of the Minister
for Planning, Rural DIevelopment, Environment and Tourism,
a onit to control and coord:inate the activities of the
ORD's and the Technical Departments responsible for rural
develripment in the Ministry, to implement the reform of th-e
ORD's, to review development programs, to supervise and
evaluate ongoing projects or programs, and to provide
ORD's with technical assistance for project execution and
evaluation; and
(b)  providing the Directors of the ORD's with the powers and
responsibilities necessary for them to satisfactorily
execute projects and programs.



PART IV: THE PROJECT
28.       The proposed project was prepared by the Compagnie Internationale
du Developpement Rural (CIDR) with funds provided under Credit 225-UV, the
ongoing West Volta cotton project, and appraised by a Bank mission in April-
May 1973. Negotiations were held in Washington from April 8 to 12, 1974.
The delegation of the Republic of Upper Volta was headed by H. E. Mr. Antoine
Dakoure, Minister of Planning, Rural Development, Environment and Tourism
and consisted of Messrs. Yaya Konate, Advisor to the Minister, Charles
Coulibaly, Director of the West Volta Cotton Project, Hama Diallo, Ministry
of Planning, and Dicko, Ministry of Finance. A report entitled "Appraisal of
Bougouriba Agricultural Development Project - Upper Volta "(No. 297-UV) is
being circulated separately to the Executive Directors. A Credit and Project
Summary is provided at Annex III.
29.       Tne proposed project is to some degree similar to the West Volta
cotton project but is more comprehensive. It will include not only addi-
tional cotton development, agricultural credit, extension services and feeder
road improvements, as does the ongoing project, but also food crop and live-
stock development, well construction, intensive staff training and applied
research.
The Project Area
30.       The Bougouriba ORD lies in the southwest of Upper Volta and com-
prises about 6% of the total area of the country. With an average annual
rainfall above 1,000 mm, climatic conditions are suitable for the cultiva-
tion of a variety of crops, including cotton, groundnuts, traditional cereals
and rice; and as soils are generally fertile and groundwater supplies rela-
tively plentiful, the potential for agricultural development is promising
in comparison with other regions of the country. The population of the
Bougouriba ORD is estimated at 360,000 or approximately 7% of the total
population. Migration into the ORD from the more densely-populated Mossi
plateau is growing, and people from the plateau represent about 14% of the
ORD's population. There are about 42,000 farms and 750 villages in the ORD,
and cultivated land totals 200,000 ha or some 10% of total cultivated land
in Upper Volta. Gross income per farm family is low, varying from CFAF
26,000 to CFAF 68,000 annually (equivalent to US$104 and US$272 respectively).
Project Description
31.       The proposed project, to be carried out over a four-year period,
will be the first major effort to develop the natural and human resources
of the Bougouriba ORD and will concentrate on the areas presently free of
onchocerciasis. The project consists of the following major components:
(a) providing technical assistance to the Ministry of
Planning, Rural Development, Environment and Tourism;



- 10 -
(b)  providing the lBourgouriba ORD with the staff, housing,
offices, equipment, vehicles and funds necessary to
implement an effective development program;
(c)  providing about 16,000 farm families with the extension
and other support services needed to increase their pro-
duction and income;
(d) providing participating farmers with seasonal credit for
the purchase of insecticides and fertilizer and medium-
term credit for farm implements;
(e)  providing efficient veterinary services for the ORD,
whose role would primarily be to execute programs of
prophylactic vaccinations to reduce the currently high
livestock mortality rate;
(f) creating a training center with teaching facilities for
project staff and farmers;
(g) creating a research station to carry out adaptive research
and operate a seed multiplication unit;
(h) improving domestic water supplies through a well digging
and rehabilitation program covering about 120 wells;
(i)  carrying out the studies and surveys needed for the
improvement of the road network of the project area;
(j)  improving about 660 kms of secondary and tertiary roads; and
(1k.) establishing a topograph-ic unit to map out and prepare
plans for the development of land for settlement by
migrants.
32.       The oroject is expected to result in annual increases in the pro-
da2c-ion of cotton (8,800 tons), sorghun (1$300 tons), maize (5,000 tons),
groulidnuts (2'50 tone), rice (300 tons) and meat (1,500 tons).  Most of the
additional cotton produced is expected to be exported, as will about 30% of
the meat.  Cereal production increases would help reduce imports.
Organization and Management
33.       The project will be executed by the Bougouriba ORD. The project
manager will be the Director of the Bougouriba ORD whom the Government has
already appointed. Due to the acute shortage of managerial skills in Upper
Volta, it is likely that several of the senior staff neded will have to be
recruited abroad. The appointment of the ORD Deputy Director and the Ac-
countant would be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed credit.



Marketing Arrangements and Prices
34.       Agricultural crops would be marketed as follows:
(a) food crops (sorghum, maize, rice) would be sold
by farmers at markets, to wholesalers, or to the
ORD;
(b) cotton would be marketed through the Association en
Participation (see para. 36).
35.       Marketing arrangements for food crops are generally poor, and the
Office National des Cereales which has been charged with improving the
system has failed to achieve any marked improvements. Project staff would
carefully monitor the food crop marketing system with a view to intervening
directly if necessary. Such intervention would be in accordance with Gov-
ernment policy which strongly encourages marketing of food crops by ORD's to
enable them to generate income and eventually become self-supporting.
36.       The marketing arrangements for cotton are regulated by a contract
of Association en Participation (AP) between the Government and the Compagnie
Francaise pour le Developpement des Fibres Textiles (CFDT). Under this agree-
ment, CFDT collects seed cotton, processes it and exports lint, and some cot-
ton seed. The Caisse de Stabilisation des Prix des Produits (CSPP) markets
most of the remaining cotton seed, but it has not carried out this task very
effectively. In order to avoid the dispersion of cotton marketing efforts
and to increase their effectiveness, the Government has agreed to make CFDT
responsible for both lint and cotton seed marketing in view of its wide
experience in this field and the contacts that it has developed all over the
world.
37.       Producer prices for cereals and meat have risen very substantially
reflecting the present drought conditions. They are expected to remain high
because of the cereals and meat shortages in Upper Volta and in West Africa
in general. Producer prices for cotton which are established yearly by
Government decree have increased only slightly between 1964 and October 1973,
and therefore decreased in real terms. These prices were increased slightly
in October 1973. The Government has informed us that it intends to increase
prices further to CFAF 40 per kg for first quality and CFAF 33 per kg for
second quality for the 1974 crop, and if world market prices remain favorable,
to CFAP 45/kg in 1975 for first quality and CFAF 50/kg in 1976, the dif-
ferential between first and second quality prices remaining unchanged.
Assurances were obtained that the level of cotton producer prices would be
the subject of annual consultations between the Government and the Association,
as would the level of subsidies for fertilizers and insecticides to be provided
to farmers (para 38).

Farmers' Credit
38.       Under the project, farmers will be eligible for credit on inputs
and equipment. To promote their use the Governiment feels it necessary that
inputs be sold to farmers below cost. In 1974 the cost of cotton fertilizer
to farmers will be CFAF 33/kg versus a farmgate cost of CFAF 79/kg, and the
cost of insecticides CFAF 420/liter versus CFAFI 740/liter. Assurances were
obtained that the level of these subsidies wou]ld be subject to annual con-
sultations between the Government and the Association.
39.       At present, down-payment conditions and terms of equipment credits
are too stringent, and are a constraint on farm development; BND requires
a deposit of between 35% and 50% and repayment over one or two years. Under
the proposed project, credit distribution and recovery would be carefully
supervised by extension staff; it would therefore be feasible to facilitate
farmers' access to equipment by easing the credit terms. Assurances were
obtained that farmers with a pair of oxen woulcd be eligible for equipment
credit and that the down-payment would be reduced to 15% of total equipment
cost. The Government also intends to extend the repayment period, which
ranges from 12 to 24 mnonths at present. Equipment would not be subsidized.
Proposed Financing
40.       The total cost of the project, excludirng import duties and US$1.2
million in local taxes, is estimated at US$9.0 million, with an estimated
foreign exchange component of US$5.4 million or 60% of the total. The
proposed credit of US$8.0 million woula finance 89 percent of total project
costs excluding taxes. The Goveniment would contribute the US$1.2 million
of taxes, the Banque Nationale de Developpement: US$650,000 equivalent, and
participating farmers about US$350,000.
41.       In t.he past Government rhas not always met its share of project
cost financinC on time. To improve the funding procedure, Government has
agreed to create a development fund wlhich would be credited with a levy
assessed on cotton seed produced and marketed. This levy would be deducted
ffro'm th;e AP's revenues on cotton seed and lint sales.  The levy would be
ca:izulated to meet at first the Government's entire contribution to the
West; Volta Cotton Project and the proposed project, and subsequent to the
completion of these projects, to pay for the extension and other services
provided by the Government.   The creation of this fund would be a condition
of effectiveness of the proposed credit.
Procurement and Disbursement
42.       International competitive bidding in accordance with IDA guide-
lines would be used for vehicles (US$330,000), equipment needed for the wells
and road programs (US$340,000) and farm implements (US$270,000). Local manu-
facturers would have a 15% preference. Contracts for the construction of



- 13 -
houses and stores (US$890,000) would be let through competitive bidding
advertised locally, as the dispersion of the works involved makes it unlikely
that firms not already operating in Upper Volta or in neighboring countries
would be interested in bidding for these contracts. Foreign companies, how-
ever, would not be excluded from bidding. Domestic contractors would have a
7.5? preference. Vaccines and drugs for the veterinary program (US$65,000)
would be obtained directly from the Laboratoire de Recherche Veterinaire de
Dakar the products of which have been proven in Upper 'Volta. The studies
for the roads (US$180,000) would be prepared by internationally-recruited
consultants in accordance with IDA guidelines. Farm inputs (US$800,000)
would be procured through established local procedures. The bulk of the
remainder (US$5.5 million) covers staff salaries and operating expenses
during project implementation, and there would be an estimated US$1.9 mil-
lion unallocated. Contracts costing less than US$20,000 would be let on
the basis of quotations obtained from local suppliers.
43.       The road improvement program (US$520,000 net of equipment costs)
would be carried out by force account. This program which would be executed
at different times and in different locations would not be suitable for letting
to private contractors.
44.       Disbursements from the proposed credit would cover:   (i) 100% of
the foreign exchange cost of vehicles, equipment, sprayers, veterinary drugs,
studies, scholarships, special staff training or 87% of total expenditures
for these items; and (ii) 87% of salaries, building costs and operating
expenses. The proposed credit is expected to be fully disbursed by December 31,
1978. A schedule of estimated disbursements is included in Annex III.
Economic Benefits
45.       Assuming a ten-year project life, the economic rate of return of the
project is estimated at 68%. This high rate of return is primarily due to
projected increases in the prices of cotton, cereals and meat which more than
offset likely increases in the cost of inputs. The economic rates of return
of the agricultural and livestock components considered separately are estimated
at 74% and 56% respectively.
46.       Most of the project-induced cotton production would be exported,
and project-induced cereal production would substitute for imports that
would otherwise be required. About 30% of meat produced would be exported.
On this basis, the annual net foreign exchange gain to Upper Volta is
estimated to amount to about US$5.3 million after 1978/1979. This compares
with the estimated foreign exchange component of the proposed project of
US$5.4 million.
47.       Farmers' annual net income after taxes and purchase of inputs is
expected to increase on average by CFAF 60,000 by the fourth year (US$3.8
million for the project area).



- 14 -
48.       The project would have no negative irmact on Government finances, as
the Government would only contribute an amount equivalent to the taxes included
in project cost. After project development Government revenues would be
significant and consist of taxes on project-induced cattle production, the
Association en Participation's profits on cotton operations attributable to
the project area, income taxes levied on staff employed by the project, and
taxes on gasoline and other rnaterials used in project operations. The Gov-
ernment would be able to sustain project activities from its revenues once
the proposed credit is fully disbursed.
49.       The project's indirect benefits would also be substantial.    It
would directly affect some 16,000 families and another 16,000 families would
receive benefits from improved water supplies and better access to health
facilities and other social services. In total some 360,000 people would be
affected in one way or another by project activities. With the considerable
increase in farmers' cash incomes rural trade and small industries would be
stimulated.
50.       The project's long-run benefits wouLd extend beyond the project
area. The project would be the vehicle for a reorganization of rural devel-
opment institutions in the country, including the Ministry of Planning, Rural
Development, Environment and Tourism and the ORI)'s. Arrangements for the
marketing of cotton seed would be improved. Firnally, the project would
hopefully serve as a model for future rural development projects.
PART V: LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AtUHORITY
51.       Tha 6tiaft Devrelopment Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Upper Volta and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee provided
for in Article V, Section 1(d) of the Articles cif Agreement of the Association
and the text of a draft resolution approving the proposed credit are being
distributed to hne Executive Directors separately.   The draft Development
Credit Agreement conforms generally to the pattern of credit agreements for
agricultural development projects.
'2.       T am satisfied that thre proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Credit 141     Telecommunications Project. US$0.8 Million Credit of
February 18, 1969; Closing Date September 30, 1974
The project was intended to finance urgently required rehabili-
tation and expansion works for local distribution networks in Ouagadougou and
Bobo-Dioulasso, the reconditioning of obsolete iron-wire lines in the provinces
and the provision of carrier equipment on trunk lines. After initial delays,
mainly due to difficulties in arranging for key expatriate staff to advise on
the works, this project is now proceeding satisfaLctorily. Completion is now
expected in September 1974. The Closing Date, originally June 30, 1972 has
been postponed three times.
Credit 225     West Volta Cotton Project.   US$6.2 Million Credit of
December 30, 1970; Closing Date June 30, 1976
FAC is providing a grant of a further US$1.7 million for the
project.  The project is the final stage of a cotton production developy,ent
program in West Upper Volta which originally started with technical assist-
ance from Compagnie Francaise pour le Developpeinent des Fibres Textiles (CFDT)
and FAC financing in 1963. It consists of both expansion of the area under
cotton cultivation on some 46,000 farms and improvement of yields through
credit and extension services, and provision.of better communications and
processing facilities. The project also includes funds for training of staff,
detailed engineering of secondary roads and preparation of the Black Volta
Agricultural Development Project.
Although Unpper Volta suffered a drought in 1971 for the second
vear i.n a row, cotton production in the project. area increased by 33% in
19;'1/72 over the pre-project year of 1970 while elsewhere production decreased
by about 10%. Processing and marketing of cotton lint and seeds is the
r sponsibiliry of a joint venture between Governmrent and CFDT which made a
ne-L profit of about US$400,000 in 1970/71 and of US$60,000 in 1971/72.   The
20,O3O0 to-as canacitv ginnery financed under the project will be built in time
for .-peration Dv the end of 1974.
The projec_ is proceeding satisfactorily and the management is
adequate.

progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-

Credit 316     Road Project.   US$4.15 Million Credit of June 26, 1972 (Os
amended on March 25, 1974); Closing Date December 31, 1975
The project comprises (a) the reconstruction of the Solenzo-
Koundougou (70 km) and the Hounde-Bereba (27 kIm) roads, and (b) feasibility
studies for about 400 km of primary roads, and engineering of those sections
found to have the highest priority.
The pre-selection of contractors for part (a) above took place
in November 1972. Four bids were recently received, the lowest being about
25% higher than the appraisal estimate. Regarding (b) above the Government
proposed four roads to be studied, and the Association agreed to only two,
from Bobo-Dioulasso to Hounde and Bobo-Dioulasso to Banfora (a totai of about
190 km), these being the only ones considered likely to show a satisfactory
rate of return.
Due to currency realignments and to cost overruns on the road
construction part of the project, the dollar cost of the project has increased.
Consequently, to enable completion of the project, the Association has recently
approved an increase of US$1.35 million in the amount of the Credit from
US$2.8 million to US$4.15 million. It is expected that the project will be
completed and the credit fully disbursed by the present Closing Date.
Credit 317     Rural Development Fund Project.   US$2.2 Million Credit of
June 26, 1972; Closing Date September 30, 1976
Between 300,000 and 450,000 people would benefit from the pro-
ject. The Rural Development Fund (RDF) Division has been established within
the Banque Nationale de Developpement (BND) to execute the project; it started
operating in September 1972. BND's performance and project management are
satisfactory. Currently it is executing its first annual program on the
basis of proposals made by the Organismes Regionaux de Developpement (ORD).
Main components of this program are wells and village warehouses. The
project which started slowly mainly due to delays over project prefinancing
and staff appointments is now proceeding satisfactorily. Arrangements are
being made for speedy progress in implementing the various sub-projects.
Credit 430      Education Project.  US$2.85 Million Credit of September 28,
1973; Closing Date June 30, 1978
The Credit was approved on June 21, 1973 and signed on
September 28, 1973. The Credit is not yet effective and no disbursements
have taken place. The Credit should become effective in the near future, as
only the legal opinion remains to be received.
The project is part of the program of Upper Volta aimed at
enlarging the scope and improving the quality of rural education and at imaprov-
ing the standard of sciences teaching in secondary education, in line with the
present production and projected manpower needs of the country. The project
will be executed by a Project Unit within the Ministry of Plannirg-, }urai
Development, Environment and Tourism, which is responsible for rural education.

UPPER VOLTA - BOTUGOURIBA AGRICULTURAL DEVELOP1MENT PROJECT
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrowers             Republic of Upper Volta
Amount:               US$8.0 million equivalent
Terms:                Standard
ProJect Description: The proposed project, to be carried out over a four-
year period, will be the first major effort to develop
the natural and human resources of the Bougouriba ORD
and will concentrate on the areas presently free of
onchocerciasis. The project consists of the following
major components:
(a) providing technical assistance to the Ministry of
Planning, Rural Development, Environment and Tourism;
(b) providing the Bougouriba ORD with the staff, housing,
offices, equipment, vehicles and funds necessary to
implement an effective development program;
(c) providing about 16,000 farm families with the exten-
sion and other support services needed to increase
their production and income;
(d) providing participating farmers with seasonal credit
for the purchase of insecticides and fertilizer and
medium-term credit for farm implements;
(e) providing efficient veterinary services for the ORD,
whose role would primarily be to execute programs of
prophylactic vaccinations to reduce the currently
high livestock mortality rate;
(f)  creating a training center with teaching facilities
for project staff and farmers;
(g) creating a research station to carry out adaptive
research and operate a seed multiplication unit;
(h)  improving domestic water supplies through a we U
digging and rehabilitation program covering about
120 wells;
(i) carrying out the studies and surveys needed for the
improvement of the road network of the project area;



ANNEX III
Page 2 of 3 pages
(j)  improving about 660 kms of secondary and tertiary roads;
(k) establishing a topographic unit to map out and prepare plans
for the development of land for settlement by migrants.
The project is expected to result in annual increases in the pro-
duction of cotton (8 800 tons), sorghum (:L,300tons), maize (5,000 tons),
groundnuts (250 tons5, rice (300 tons) and meat (1,500 tons). Most of the
additiaJ.l cotton produced is expected to be exported, as will about 30%
of the meat. Cereal production increases wcould help reduce imports.
Estimated Cost: The total cost of the projetct is estimated at US$10.2
million, including US$1.2 million of taxes, with an
estimated foreign exchange component of US$5.4 million.

Financing Plan:
The proposed credit of US$8.0 million would finance 89 percent
of total costs excluding taxes. The Government would contribute the
US$1.2 million of taxes, the Banque Nationale de D6veloppement US$650,000
equivalent, and participating farmers about US$350,000.
Estimated Disbursements:
(us$ooo)
Bank Fiscal Year        Annual        Cumulative
1975                 700           700
1976               1,800         2,500
1977               2,100         4,600
1978               2,200         6,800
1979               1,200          8,000
Procurement Arrangements t
Procurement would be in accordance with IDA guidelines for
vehicles, equipment and farm implements. Contruction of the relatively
small and scattered houses and stores totalling US$890,000 would be
advertised locally although foreign contractors could also bid. Farm
inputs (US$800,000S would be procured through established local procure-
ment procedures. About US$5.5 million would cover staff salaries and
operating expenses during project development.
Technical Assistance:
The Government may have to recruit from abroad some of the
senior staff required for the management of the project. In addition,
consultants would be engaged (i) to assist in designing the teaching
programs for the training center, (ii) to provide technical assistance
to the Ministry of Planning, Rural Development, Environment and Tourism,
and (iii) to carry out the road studies.
Economic Rate of Return:
68%. This high rate of return is primarily due to projected
increases in the prices of cotton, cereals and meat which more than off-
set likely increases in the cost of inputs. The economic rates of return
of the agricultural and livestock components considered separately are
estimated at 74% and 56% respectively.
