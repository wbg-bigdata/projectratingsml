                                      EXECUTIVE SUMMARY


 Ethiopia's Productive Safety     Net Programme (PSNP) includes        a community 'public works'
 component aimed at developing        communal infrastructure and    assets in areas of chronic food
 shortage. The programme         will make food or cash       payments for labour provided          by
 community members in the implementation         of the projects.

 The selection of the public    works projects will be driven  by the local planning process.    They
 may include, for example,       hillside terracing, land reclamation,    improvement of roads or
 bridges, improved access      to water, or repair of health  facilities. In the case ofp    astoralist
 areas, it is to be expected that they may include projects such    as development of water points,
 agroforestry, or initiatives related to livestock.

 The PSNP is expected to      serve some 260 woredas,    in which public works will     be conducted
 over a five-year period     in an estimated 3,000 - 5,000     kebeles, involving in excess     of an
 estimated 22,000 communities.

 Given the nature and large number      of these public works, it is important  that their design and
 implementation follow good       practice, in order to manage    any potentially adverse impacts.
 While it is acknowledged       that many of the public works      will themselves be intended      to
 rehabilitate the natural resource     base, it is equally important    that such projects be well
 designed and executed, to    ensure that undesirable impacts   are avoided or mitigated.

 Ethiopia's EnvironmentalImpactAssessment          (EIA) proclamation and international     standards
 subscribed to by the development        partners in the PSNP are applicable       to the PSNP. In
keeping with Ethiopia's          Environmental Impact Assessment           proclamation,    the term
 'environment' in this context   covers biophysical, social  and cultural heritage impacts.

In the case of the PSNP, where        individual projects are small,  numerous, community-based
and not known in advance        of the beginning of the programme,       it is unrealistic to execute
project EIAs. In such cases,    the approach adopted by the   Government is simple and practical:
an Environmental and Social       Management Framework (ESMF)          has been developed, setting
out in simple terms:
                  * Criteria for project selection;
                  * Basic checklists for preliminary   project assessments, to avoid      1ocation or
                    project design which might   give rise to undesirable impacts;   and
                  * Lists of mitigating measures    to be adopted for various types        of project
                    during project implementation.

The preliminary project assessment       will be conducted at woreda    level, and compliance with
the recommended mitigating       measures will be monitored     at kebele level, by the concerned
Development Agent (DA).        Only in exceptional cases   will it be necessary for a project   to be
reviewed at a higher level,      in which case under Ethiopia's       Environmental Management
proclamation, the regional       Environmental Bureau, or        equivalent office, will be       the
responsible authority.

It is proposed that for the   sake of simplicity, the standard  mitigating measures for each     type
of project be incorporated    into the technical specifications, work norms and information       kits
related to implementation    of the public works under the  PSNP.



                                                3

It is not intended that the PSNP     will include any public works     activities necessitating a
separate EIA under Ethiopia's EnvironmentalImpact      Assessment proclamation. However,      the
the Regional Environmental     Protection Authority projects   will be notified of any projects
involving water supply or irrigation,     or health clinic rehabilitation,   and based on any
feedback, may result in project modification,  a project management plan, or disapproval.

The relevant laws of the Republic   of Ethiopia are:
              *   the 'Environmental Impact Assessment'     (EIA) proclamation;
              *   the 'Environmental Management'     proclamation; and
              *   the 'Pollution Control' proclamation

Despite the fact that each public    works project will be small and    may have only limited
impacts, the nature of the public  works programme and the number      of projects are such that
Ethiopia's EnvironmentalImpactAssessment        (EIA) proclamation is applicable   to the PSNP.
It is intended that the provisions of this ESMF will meet the    requirements of the section of
this proclamation dealing with   EIA of programmes. The environmental      management process
and guidelines developed in this    ESMP for the PSNP will be subject        to approval by the
Environmental Protection Authority    of Ethiopia.

In the case of any projects   involving abstraction of riversdraining into the Nile Basin, any
relevant international agreements  under the Nile Basin Initiative willbe applicable.

 1.      INTRODUCTION

 Food insecurity has become     one of the defining features    of rural poverty, particularly    in
 drought-prone areas of Ethiopia.       Poverty is widespread in     both rural and urban areas.
 However, the magnitude     is much greater in drought-prone     rural areas than in urban     areas.
 The problem of food insecurity    has worsened in recent years,   with around 14 million people
 requiring emergency food   aid.

 The Government of Ethiopia     has decided that there is   an urgent need to address the      basic
 food needs of food insecure   households via a productive    safety net system financed    through
multi-year predictable resources,    rather than through a system      dominated by emergency
 humanitarian aid. Moreover,   the Government seeks to     shift the financing of the programme
 from food aid to c ash. On   this b asis, within the framework    oft he national Food Security
 Programme, which emphasizes     the three interrelated pillars of food security that address   food
availability, access to food  and utilization, the Government     has decided to develop a      new
 Productive Safety Net Programme.

The objectives of the Productive     Safety Net Programme (PSNP)       are to provide transfers to
the food insecure population    in chronically food insecure    woredas in a way that prevents
asset depletion at the household  level and creates assets at the community level.

The PSNP is targeted to    262 woredas identified as   being chronically food insecure.     For the
purposes ofthe Safety Net, a   woreda is considered chronically    food insecure if it (a) is inone
of 8 regions (Tigray, Amhara,    Oromiya, SNNP, Afar, Somali,       rural Harari and Dire Dawa),
and (b) has been a recipient of  food aid for a significant period,  generally for at least each  of
the last 3 years.

The beneficiaries of the Programme      are the food insecure population   living in rural areas in
these chronically food insecure   woredas. This figure is currently    estimated to be about 5-6
million people. The beneficiaries     of the programme are resource-poor        and vulnerable to
shocks, and often fail to produce enough food even at    times of normal rains in  the country.

The major causes of food    insecurity in Ethiopia include  land degradation, recurrent   drought,
population pressure and subsistence   agricultural practices characterized  by low input and low
output. Many of the public     works activities, which will    constitute a portfolio of    several
thousand community-level      projects, are intended    to address this situation,    by creating
community-level     assets, avoid household      asset depletion and contributing         to rural
transformation. Thus a large    proportion of the projects     will be aimed at enhancing       the
environment and increasing   the productive capacity  of the natural resource base.

However, the projects will    also have the potential for    adverse environmental     impacts on
human populations or    the biophysical environment,    particularly if their location and design
do not follow good environmental       practices. Thus it is expected    that the impacts of the
programme will be for the   most part site-specific; few if any of them will be irreversible,   and
in most cases mitigating  measures can be readily   designed.

 2.       PROGRAMME DESCRIPTION

 The PSNP consists of two components:
         (i) A labour-intensive Public   Works component;
         (ii) A Direct Support component       to ensure support to those  households who have no
         labour at all, no other means   of support, and who are chronically   food insecure.

 The majority of the programme      budget will be spent in payment    for the labour contributing to
 the public works. It is the public works component     that gives rise to the potential for negative
 environmental impacts.

 2.1     Public Works Projects: Eligibility      Criteria

 The Public Works projects        are labour intensive community-based        activities designed to
provide e mployment for chronically        food insecure people who have      "able-bodied" labour.
The Programme Implementation           Manual (PIM) requires that      to be eligible for financing
under the PSNP, the projects      must be environmentally sound.      It also specifies that projects
should be adaptedto local conditionsandprotect the          environment. They should be basedon
soundtechnicaladvice, and adequatetechnicalsupervisionshouldbe               availableto ensure the
quality ofwork.

The projects are also required    to meet the following criteria:
.   Labour intensity: Works must         be labour-intensive and use simple       tools as much as
    possible.
*   Communal benefits: The activities        must benefit t he community as     w hole or g roups o f
    households within a given     area.
*   Community acceptance: Activities         must be accepted and approved      by the c ommunity.
    They should have active     community support and commitment.
.   Feasibility and sustainability:       Works must be feasible technically,           socially and
    economically. They should be       simple and manageable in implementation        and also in on-
    going maintenance in order     to be sustainable.
*   Productive:Public work projects        should create durable community      assets which should
    contribute to reducing severe    food problems.
*   Gender sensitivity: Priority should      be given to activities which   are assigned to enable
    women to participate and     which contribute to reducing  women's regular work burden       and
    increase access to productive    assets.

2.2     Planned Location of Projects

Projects will be implemented      in rural areas, within the identified regions. In cropping areas,
they are expected to be within    around 5 kilometres of the  homes of the intended beneficiaries,
or less in areas of steep or difficult terrain.

In pastoral areas, projects will be organized at strategic  locations to which families   can move
or send selected able-bodied members.

2.3     Types of Project

The selection of activities  to be undertaken under the   public works component will     be driven
by the local planning process,   which will include input from   both men and women as well       as

 representatives from    vulnerable groups, in    order to identify community     needs and prioritise
 activities b ased on  those needs. This will     allow a pipeline of     public works projects    to b e
 developed. Although      the principal level     of decision-making      for determining appropriate
 activities will be the community,    projects determined    to be priority by the   woreda level may
 also be included in   the pipeline of planned   public works projects.

 Priorities, desirable outcomes   and connected activities    will vary based on location.     Examples
 of outcomes and activities     in settled cropping areas    such as are typically    found in Tigray,
 Amhara, Oromiya and       SNNPR, are outlined     in the Table below.

2.4     Projects in Pastoralist   Areas

In p astoral a reas, which  are found especially    in Afar and Somali regions,      the emphasis is
expected to be on interventions   that reduce risk and increase     the resilience of communities    to
shocks, such as:
    Development of water     points (using both traditional  and innovative methods);




                                                 7

*   Reclamation and rehabilitation     of grazing areas and creation    of grazing reserves through
    improved water harvesting and      conservation-based activities (rainfall   multiplier systems
    for improved pastures, agro-pastoralist    systems, irrigation, etc.);
*   Agro-forestry systems in grazing       reserves to improve aerial pasture    and multipurpose
    species, and access to fruits, dyes and gums;
*   Other initiatives related to livestock  trade and livestock health;
*   Development of sustained agro-pastoral        systems through rehabilitation    of crusted and
    desertified areas (use of run-off/run-on     systems integrated with dry-land     conservation
    measures); and
*   Windbreaks and fodder belts     in protected areas.

2.5     Institutional Arrangements

The PSNP is a component of          the larger Food Security Programme.         Under the overall
supervision of the Ministry of Agriculture        and Rural Development, Food         Security line
agencies at every level of Government      will be accountable for the oversight  and coordination
of the programme, with implementation           of programme activities being       undertaken by
woredas and kebeles, line ministry/agencies     and other partners. The roles and   responsibilities
envisaged for the key institutions  at each level are set out in summary   form in Annex 1.

Those roles and responsibilities       which relate to public works         project planning and
implementation and which have        a potential bearing on the question    of environmental and
social impacts are shown in Figure     1below. These are limited to operational    tasks, so Figure
1does not show, for example,    the role of some of the approving     councils/cabinets or steering
committees, nor the overseeing,      guiding and supporting role      of the Regional Bureaus of
Agriculture and Rural Development.

The preparation of the proposed    projects identified as priorities  by the community is carried
out at kebele level, usually by    the Development Agent (DA).        Where technical inputs not
available at the kebele level  are required, these are to be provided      by the woreda line, or
sector, offices concerned.

The Regional line bureaus will be    responsible for ensuring that  the standards published in the
Technical Materials are maintained     as required.

 2.6      Project Planning Process

 Kebele Development Plans        will form the basis for   all safety net interventions.  Kebele plans
 are developed following          existing participatory    planning practices and       methodologies
 extensively used in community         planning in various regions     and should ensure an effective
participation of the communities        in the planning process.   The basic planning sequence     is as
 follows:

a) The community endorsesits         Community FoodSecurity       TaskForce Committee      (CFSTF)
Each community reviews,         and is invited to endorse  in a general assembly, the   membership of
the C FSTF, which is      e lected i n the first year  o f programme o peration.   This committee is
composed of a representative           from the Kebele Food        Security Task Force     (KFSTF); a
Development Agent (if          available in the village);   two or three women's        representatives
(elected); two or three     men's representatives    (elected); a youth representative   (elected); and
an elder's representative    (elected).

b) The CFSTFpreparesa          list ofcommunity needs andpriorities
The CFSTF can benefit        from the technical support     of Development Agents      (DA) from line
departments at the kebele      level, to identify and formulate  the list of needs and priorities.Once
this list is prepared, it istransmitted to the KFSTF.

c) The KFSTFpreparesa          kebele safety net/developmentplan
The KFSTF consolidates         all lists of needs and priorities  prepared by the CFSTF      which are
part of the kebele, and     prepares a kebele safety net    plan. This plan will identify  and specify
which activities within      the development plan will        be undertaken under the       Safety Net
Programme. It should pay        particular attention, where  relevant, to incorporating   management
and rehabilitation of the    watershed as a key activity     for promoting long-term     food security.
This means that the plan        should properly sequence       activities in a way that   ensures that
watershed management        concerns are addressed as      an integral part of ensuring  sustainability
of the assets created.

d) If a kebele developmentplan       hasalreadybeen developed
A number of kebeles        may already have developed        a development plan through      the same
process as described in     a to c. In such cases, the  kebele development plan     will be adapted to
integrate new needs and      priorities identified by  the CFSTF, taking into    account the input of
men and women, youth         and elderly and other      vulnerable groups, and    will specify which
activities within the development      plan will be undertaken   under the Safety Net  Programme.

e) Presentationto the communities
Once the k ebele development        plan has been established,     it will b e presented  to a general
meeting of all communities      in the kebele for review   and endorsement by these    communities.

The Safety Net component        of the kebele development     plan will be despatched    to the kebele
Council/Cabinet for approval,      and on up to woreda level,   where the plans from   all the kebeles
will be consolidated  and, after approval, sent    to the Regional level.

  2.7     Analysis of Alternatives

  The ESMF is required      to assess options for   achieving the programme       purpose. There are   a
  number of alternative    strategies which the  Government could     adopt:

  (i) No Safety Net Programme

  Poverty is widespread    in both rural and urban   areas of Ethiopia, and    is particularly severe in
  drought-prone rural   areas. In recent years  up to 14 million people   have required food aid,    and
  in 2002 and 2003        the food security     situation and malnutrition      levels reached crisis
  proportions. Given that      the major causes of      food insecurity include      land degradation,
  population pressure and    subsistence agricultural  practices, that vulnerability  to climatic shock
  is cumulative,I and that    a significant proportion   of the vulnerable people     are in a state of
  chronic food insecurity,    to opt for no Safety Net    Programme would mean         continuing with
  emergency relief coordinated       by the Disaster Preparation     and Preparedness Commission
  (DPPC), and implemented          on an ad hoc basis.       While this strategy      may enable the
  beneficiaries to survive  in the short-term, it would  fail to:
          (a) address the cumulative    impacts of these factors in  drought-prone areas in   a
          systematic manner;    or
          (b) execute public works     in a comprehensive manner,    incorporating capital   and other
          non-labour costs, which    can be provided for only   in a systematic, annual   programme.

 By allowing widespread       chronic food insecurity  to persist, the resultant  downward spiral of
 environmental degradation       would continue, and by       failing to institute satisfactory  public
 works, the opportunity        to correct this vicious     cycle would be lost.        Thus from an
 environmental, as well     as socio-economic and humanitarian        viewpoint, the 'no Safety    Net'
 alternative would not   be preferable.

 (ii) Safety Net Provision with    Centrally-PlannedPublic     Works

 Previous Ethiopian governments           have experimented with        programmes involving       food
 payments to beneficiaries     for providing labour   to centrally-planned public    works. However,
 this approach was generally     not effective, equitable or sustainable, as the   lack of meaningful
 local inputs to the planning   process, and lack of ownership     by the communities,    meant that in
 many cases the projects      were inappropriately   designed and located.      The results were lost
 opportunities to carry   out serious enhancement     of the natural resource   base, at considerable
 human c ost. Thus from      a n e nvironmental v iewpoint,   this o ption would not   b e a preferred
 alternative.


 2.8     Implementation Challenges

The PSNP is a very        large programme, operating      in geographically and      agro-climatically
diverse regions of       the country.      The implementation      challenges will therefore      vary
considerably from    location to location.    Challenges which     may arise which could     affect the
quality and effectiveness    of the environmental   standards of the public   works projects include:

  i. Woreda capacities will    vary; some will be less      able to provide technical
     assistance for project design  and implementation than   others;
 ii. Some kebele officials and      communities have very limited        knowledge or
     experience of participatory   planning, and will need    awareness-creation and
     training;
iii. In some communities, the    capacity of local organizations  for sustainable work,
     and maintenance of assets    i s not y et well d eveloped, and will take time to
     perform to the required standards;
iv.  Appropriate approaches    and operating systems for     public works in pastoral
     areas are in many cases not  yet well developed;
 v.  In some regions the Regional         Environmental Protection      Bureau, or its
     equivalent, is n ot y et welle stablished, a nd may n ot y et be in a p osition t o
     provide the basic services   which may b e required    o f it to e nsure that g ood
     environmental practices are  adopted in the PSNP;

 3.      ENVIRONMENTAL            CONTEXT AND BASELINE              CONDITIONS

 3.1     Overview of PSNP Regions

 The 262 PSNP woredas       are located principally in  Tigray, Amhara, Afar,      SNNP, Oromiya and
 Somali regions. However,       the environmental characteristics       of these areas may      be more
 usefully demarcated by        altitude, rather than administrative      boundaries. Thus they         are
 presented in Table 2     below, with their height      above sea level, which        is correlated with
 temperature.

 4.      LEGAL, POLICY         AND ADMINISTRATIVE             FRAMEWORK

 4.1     Relevant Legislation     and Policy

 The Constitution of    Ethiopia

 The 1994 Constitution    of Ethiopia proclaims     that all citizens shall  have a right to live in a
 clean and healthy environment.     It states that Government     and citizens have a duty to protect
 the environment, and     the design and implementation         of programs and projects     shall not
 damage or destroy      the environment. The       Constitution incorporates     a number of other
 provisions relevant  for the protection, sustainable    use and improvement    of the environmental
 resources of the country.  It reflects a view of environmental     concerns in terms of fundamental
 human rights, and   provides a basis for   the formulation of national    policies and strategies  on
 environmental management       and protection. It assures    that no development    activity shall be
 disruptive to the ecological   balance, and that people      concerned shall be  made to give their
 opinions in the preparation     and implementation      of environmental protection     policies and
 programs.

 The Constitution also:
 (a) Maintains land  under the ownership    of the Ethiopian people    and the government
 but protects securityof usufruct tenure;
 (b) Reinforces the devolution   ofpower and local participation     in planning,
 development and decision    taking by regions and    woredas;
 (c) Ensures the equality of women with men;
 (d) Ensures the appropriate  management as well      as the protection of the well-being of
the environment; and
(e) Maintains an open    economic policy.

The Constitution ofEthiopia     further states that land  is retained under the control of the people
and the Government      of Ethiopia, and thus     prohibiting its buying    and selling. It however
ensures its usufruct tenure   rights and allows for   its usufruct rights to or from others (i.e. rent
out the land). All farmers   who would like to make       a livelihood from farming   are entitled to
have plot of land free  of charge

Policy on Disaster Prevention      and Management (1993)

The PDPM was introduced        in order to address the   root causes of the vulnerability to drought
and famine. It discourages    free distribution of   food relief to able bodied   persons. Rather it
emphasizes the principles   of protecting human     life in times of disaster,protecting the quality
of life from deterioration   due to disasters and    timely m itigation, protecting   the a ssets and
economic fabric and   best use of natural resources      for speedy post disaster  recovery, and the
provision of relieftaking regard for human     dignity.

Federal Policy on the    Environment (1997)

The first comprehensive      Environmental Policy       of the Federal Democratic       Republic of
Ethiopia was approved      April 2, 1997 by     the Council of Ministers.      It derives from the
recommendations    of the Conservation      Strategy of Ethiopia    (CSE) which was     prepared in
1989 and later updated    in 1997. The Overall     Policy Goal is to:    "improve and enhance     the
health and quality of life of all Ethiopians  and to promote sustainable    economic development




                                               15

 through the sound   management use of      natural, human-made     and cultural resources    and the
 environment as    a whole so as to       meet the needs of       the present generation      without
 compromising the ability   of future generations  to meet their own needs".

 The Environmental    Policy provides a comprehensive       set of principles and   policies to guide
 the integration of environmental considerations     in development activities,    and includes nine
 policy objectives, 19 guiding principles,  ten sectoral policies and ten cross-sectoral  policies.

 The National Policy    was further strengthened      with the adoption      of several multilateral
 environmental conventions,    including:
 *   The Convention on   Biological Diversity;
 *   The Basal Convention    on the Control of Transboundary     Movements of Hazardous       Wastes;
 *   The United Nations  Framework Convention       on Climate Change;
 .   The United Nations        Convention to Combat         Desertification in     those Countries
     Experiencing Serious  Drought and/or Desertification,    Particularly in Africa;
 *   The Vienna Convention    and the Montreal Protocol    for the Protection the   Ozone Layer;
 .   The Rotterdam Convention        on the Prior Informed       Consent Procedure for        Certain
     Hazardous Chemicals    and Pesticides in International   Trade; and
 *   The Stockholm Convention      on Persistent Organic  Pollutants.

 National Action Plan   to Combat Desertification      (2001)

 Ethiopia signed the Convention     to Combat Desertification    in October 1994 followed      by the
 Government ratification  in June 1997. The     Environmental Protection       Authority (EPA) was
 designated by the   Government as a national      focal agency for the     implementation of      the
 convention. The activities so far have included,  among others, the development       of a National
 Action Plan for the Environment    and the regional action  programmes are under      development.

Environmental Proclamations        (2002)

A series of legal proclamations       form the basis for the      environmental assessment        and
management framework      in the country.

The Proclamationon     the EstablishmentofEnvironmentalProtectionOrgans(No.               295/2002)
assigns organizational  responsibilities for  environmental management         activities as well as
environmental protection   regulations and monitoring.     It gives the Environmental     Protection
Agency (EPA) the    legal powers to ensure    enforcement and     compliance with environmental
laws and standards   and differentiates  the responsibilities among   the environmental    agencies
at federal and regionallevel.

The Proclamationon     EnvironmentalImpact       Assessment (No. 299/2002).      Article 5: Project
Requiring Environmental    Impact Assessment     of the Proclamation    states that: "Every project
which falls in any category   listed in any directive issues pursuant to this    Proclamation shall
be subject to environmental   impact assessment";    it also states thatprogrammes and policies
with potential impacts shall be subject to the provisions of the  proclamation.

The Proclamiationon   EnvironmentalPollution      Control(No. 300/2002).       This law recognizes
the fact that some social and economic     development endeavours      may inflict environmental
harm that could make  the endeavours counter     productive. To this end,   it aims to eliminate  or,




                                             16

 when not possible, to     mitigate pollution    as an undesired consequence      of development
 activities.

 EIA Guidelines (2000)

 The purpose of     the EIA guidelines      is to ensure that     development projects     integrate
 environmental considerations    in the planning process   as a condition for their approval. The
 EIA process includes:
 *   Application
 .   Pre-screening
 *   Screening
 *   Scoping
 *  EIA and submission    of EIA report
 *  Review of the EIA    and decision by the Competent    Authority

 The EIA guidelines   cover industrial, mining, agriculture and infrastructure development,
all ofwhich are likely  to impact the environment    in a significant manner.

Food Security Strategy     (2002)

The Food Security Strategy    is targeted mainly toward   the chronically food insecure,  moisture
deficient and pastoral areas, with a focus on   environmental rehabilitation  to reverse the level
of degradation and also     as a source of income      generation for food   insecure households
through a focus on biological   measures. Water harvesting     and the introduction of  high value
crops, livestock and  agroforestry development     are also included in the  recent strategy. The
objectives of this policy are to (i) increase theavailability offood through  increased domestic
production, (ii) ensure   access to food for food      deficit households, and    (iii) strengthen
emergency response    capabilities. The strategy   recognizes the need to  tailor interventions to
the diversity of the food production zones - areas   with adequate moisture,   moisture deficient
and pastoral areas. Chronically      food insecure areas    require a more comprehensive       and
appropriate package of   interventions, which may     include soil and water  conservation, plant
nutrient generation and  recycling, drought and   pest resistant crops and improved post harvest
management.

4.2     Administrative Structure     for Environmental    Management

Federal and Regional    EPAs

The EPA has overall      responsibility for setting    environmental policies,   regulations and
standards and for administration    ofEIA requirements.    The Federal agency is   organized into
nine technical departments  and four service units,  with an overall staffof 167.

Regional EPA offices   have been established    almost all of the regions  and where they have
not been established,  other bureaus are designated      to manage environmental       affairs and
coordination with the  federal EPA. The regional    EPA bureaus operate     independently of the
Federal EPA, reporting  to regional government.

Ministry of Agriculture   and Rural Development

The Ministry is responsible   for a broad array of   agricultural production and research, food



                                             17

 security, n atural resource  management a nd a gricultural  m arketing p rograms    and activities.
 The regional Bureaus      of Agriculture and Natural     Resources Development        are directly
 involved in delivery   of programs with Woredas,     in keeping with the   decentralized strategy
 and the government's   Agricultural Development-led    Industrialization policy.

 Ministry of Water Resources

 This ministry is responsible   for overall inventory, planning and management      of surface and
 ground water resources   in the country. This includes aspects of watershed   management, water
 supply and water quality     management that affect     rural development programs.      Regional
 Water Bureaus are directly    involved in assisting woredas and other agencies    in various water
 resource development    projects.

 Woreda Bureaus of     Agriculture, Rural Development       and Health

 The woredas are a key     focus of the government's   commitment to decentralized     delivery of
 services. The various  departments at the woreda   level have a direct responsibility for finance,
 land use, natural resources, infrastructure, and development   at the local level. The agriculture
 departments have subject      matter specialists and  others who advise development         agents
 working at the village  level. The PSNP implementation     will depend upon appropriate     inputs
 and management controls       related to soil and   water conservation,    small scale irrigation
 development, rainwater   harvesting, road development    and water supply, sanitation   and waste
management associated     with rehabilitated schools  and clinics.

Kebeles

The kebeles (village   areas with an average  population of about 5,000)   are in effect the prime
contact level for most  Ethiopian citizens. Kebele administrations   consist of an elected Kebele
council (in principle  100 members), a kebele     executive committee    of 5-7 citizens, a social
court, and the development    and security staff postedin the kebele.

The kebele council   and Executive committee's    main responsibilities are:
*   Preparing an annual kebele    development plan;
*   Organizing local labor  and in-kind contributions  to development activities;
*   Resolving conflicts  within the community    through the social courts.

Kebele executive committees     are answerable to their  woreda council. The    kebeles provide a
link between the state  and households and    are responsible for enforcing   the directives from
the government ministries.

 5.      POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL                AND SOCIAL IMPACTS

 The proposed public    works projects have    the potential, and will   frequently be designed   to,
 create many beneficial      impacts related to     environmental regeneration     and sustainable
 agriculture. However,   they may also have   adverse impacts, if   good practice is not followed in
 their siting, designand implementation.

 Annex 2 sets out typical   adverse impacts that need    to be avoided, managed    and mitigated to
 ensure optimum results   from the types of subproject    expected.

 Annex 4 sets out a range    of mitigating measures    that have been found   to be useful to offset
 potential adverse impacts.    Detailed mitigating    measures recommended       to offset adverse
 impacts for specific types  of sub-project will be    integrated into the technical specifications,
 work norms and information     kits guiding the implementation      of the public works  under the
 PSNP.



 6.      CAPACITY BUILDING

 6.1     Institutional Capacity  for ESMF Implementation

The institutional structure for managing the environmental      aspects of the projectinvolves
four levels:

Federal Level

The Federal Food        Security Office (FFSO)        will need to ensure      that the technical
specifications, work   norms and information       kits related to implementation    of the public
works covers the range   of potential activities, summarizes   the latest knowledge on the  various
types of interventions,    and presents this information      in a user-friendly   manner that is
understandable by woreda      staff and development       agents. Further development     and field
testing of these specifications and kits may be required.

The ESMF will be discussed      with the federal Environmental      Protection Authority,  and will
be presented to the regional  Environmental Protection     Bureaus.

The community-based       focus of the PSNP      presents a special challenge    that will require
guidance. Drawing     on lessons and innovations       from similar programmes       will assist in
strengthening this role.

Regional Level

The regional focal  person for the PSNP   within the Food Security    Coordination Office   and the
Regional Environmental    Potection Bureau will    have a key role in the  ESMF implementation.
These individuals will  require orientation  and training in the environmental    review process,
and the use of the  technical specifications, works norms and      information kits that are under
preparation for the project.




                                              19

  Woreda Level

  The capacity of    woreda staff to  provide timely technical   support and guidance     to kebeles is
  critical. Woreda capacity     development could    usefully focus on    the design, operation     and
  environmental management        of proposed irrigation  systems, water harvesting     structures and
  irrigated agriculture.  Further, the biological  measures for promoting      economic species and
  agroforestry in conjunction       with catchment area     rehabilitation may    also need capacity
 development.

 Kebele Level

 Some c apacity building     in the organizational   management o f improved       or new communal
 assets such as rehabilitated    drinking water systems,   irrigation facilities,etc., may be needed
 in some situations.    Water users committees     and watershed committees       can be established,
 where required, by the      kebeles to manage   irrigation s ystems, large   p onds and regenerated
 watersheds.



 6.2      Proposed Training and       Technical Assistance   Topics

 Development of Training          Materials and Technical       Specifications, Work     Norms and
 Information Kits

 These materials will    be the primary tool  to incorporate mitigation   measures and to minimize
 adverse effects. The   capacity building needed   for Woreda Technical    Committees to undertake
 the Environmental     Review of subproject      proposals, where required,     should take place    in
 conjunction with dissemination      of the manual. These    materials serve to guide   the design of
 projects, so it is important in managing potential   environmental effects.   The lead woreda staff
 involved in the project      at all of the project   woredas and the regional       monitoring and
 evaluation coordinators    should receive training on these materials.

 These materials will   be refined in discussions   and practice with woreda     staff, particularly to
 enhance the communication       aspects. Training may  be needed in developing    a basic watershed
or catchment area plan    and design and sequencing     of integrated subprojects  for soil and water
conservation and watershed      regeneration, including:
*    Subproject consultation,   design and approval
*    Watershed concept     for soil and water conservation
*    Participatory methods    for community action
*    Gully treatment prescriptions
*    Water harvesting structures
*    Rooftop catchment    systems
*    Appropriate irrigation  technologies
*   Terracing and bunding     methods
*   Check dams and other      control structures
*   Biological measures     for soil and water conservation
*   Plantation methods    and management     for effective soil conservation

In order to facilitate   the environmental     management of medical        wastes associated    with
rehabilitation of  rural clinics, a Medical  Waste Management      Guide for Rural Health     Centres
will be produced    by the PSNP, to   establish the process  for preparation of  waste management




                                               20

 plans. Similar guidance  will be provided for the development of Integrated     Pest Management
 plans, where appropriate.

 Training in the Project  Environmental Review Process

 The woreda staff and Regional    Food Security staff may    need training in the environmental
review procedures, including:
 *   Environmental review and   mitigation case studies
*    Assessment of impacts   and design of site-specific  monitoring measures     which also takes
     into account social   issues and impacts, over        and above the standard         measures
     recommended in the Technical    Materials
*    Incorporation of mitigation measures in project designs  and construction documents
*    Review and approval project  proposals
*    Public consultations in  the environmental review     process which includes      women and
     other vulnerable groups.

Farmer Training in Irrigated     Agriculture

In projects involving small  scale irrigation systems, there  may be a need to provide      farmers
with training on managing    the increased number of    inputs, including fertilizers,   pesticides
and their alternatives,   management of these systems,        the development of water         user
committees and follow-up      extension support to assist     farmers and DAs in developing
irrigated agriculture,  and managing the environmental        aspects including integrated     pest
management.

Awareness-Creation     Training

Training w ill also focus  on creating a wareness o ft  he EA process, i ncluding    consultation,
participation, disclosure, design and approval. This    training needs to include     women and
men, elderly and youth, as well as vulnerable groups.


6.3     Training Mechanism

Training in ESMP implementation     will not be conducted in   isolation. It will be based   on the
ongoing P SNP c apacity   needs a ssessment, and   will b e included as an   i ntegral p art of the
capacity-building programme     currently being designed     and budgeted for the      PSNP, and

 7.      ENVIRONMENTAL          AND SOCIAL MANAGEMENT                PLAN

 7.1     Strategy

 The PSNP Environmental      and Social Management      Plan is based on the  following principles:

     i.  The PSNP involves    relatively small-scale  public works projects    that can be designed,
         implemented and    managed at the kebele    level using standardised   published guidance,
         and with the assistance ofworeda staff as    required.

    ii.  Environmental     management will       be    integrated   with project      planning     and
         implementation.

  iii.   Projects will be adopted  in the kebele PSNP plan     on the basis of selection  criteria and
         screening designed  to eliminate projects   with major, or irreversible    environmental or
         social impacts.



  iv.    PSNP procedures     will ensure that participation       in the community        projects is
        voluntary; each community      member will have an    option to opt out ofa   project, should
        he or she desire to make no change in their    existing livelihood  situation.

   v.   The design of community        public works projects     will be guided by      the technical
        materials which will     incorporate recommended        measures designed       to minimise
        adverse impacts and    encourage positive   environmental effects.  Capacity building will
        be provided by the  PSNP as and when     required.

  vi.   Approval at regional     level will involve     the Regional Environmental         Protection
        Bureau, or its equivalent,      which will have      the right to decline     a project on
        environmental or social   grounds, or to conduct    an assessment of likely    impacts prior
        to approval.

 vii.   It is not intended thatany individual projects   will require to be subjected   to a separate
        EIA. However, special    attention will be given     to the impacts of    water supply and
        irrigation projects,  rehabilitation of health    clinics, and projects     involving asset
        acquisition. These will be notified by the woreda    Food Security Office    to the Regional
        Environmental Protection     Bureau (REPB), or       its equivalent, who    will decide on
        whether a review    and/or s ite investigation o f potential impacts   i s required p rior to
        approval. Following   such review, the REPB     may modify the project,     call for an IPM
        or medical waste plan,  or disapprove the project.

viii.   Supervision of project  implementation will    be at kebele and   woreda levels. The     DA,
        with assistance if required from the woreda    line office concerned,  will ensure that the
        specified mitigating measures are implemented.

The kebele Annual    Safety Net Plans are   technically assessed   by the WFSTF. The        WFSTF
may arrange a technical    appraisal of the proposed    projects by experts    from the woreda or
regional Agriculture and   Rural Development     Bureau, where necessary.       This appraisal will
refer to the basic environmental   screening checks as identified    by the DA, covering     project
selection and location.

If necessary, the WFSTF     will request additional    information from the     kebele. Once the
WFSTF is satisfied that   a kebele Annual Safety    Net Plan meets all   of the requirements,    the
WFSTF will submit    the plan to the woreda  Council/Cabinet for   approval.

When the plan is submitted     to the regional level,   any projects listed as   requiring special
attention from an environmental     viewpoint will be notified   to the Regional Environmental
Protection Bureau (REPB),    or its equivalent. The   REPB will decide if    further investigations
are required, and will   arrange for special  directions or the development       of a specialised
environmental plan  if necessary. Guidance   for the production of   such plans will be provided
by the PSNP, particularly  for the following project  types:

7.1.1   IrrigationProjects: Integrated    Pest Management

The Government supports    the use of biological  or environmental controls    and other measures
to reduce reliance on agricultural chemicals.   Integrated Pest Management       (IPM) refers to a
mix of farmer-driven, ecologically based pest   control practices that seek to reduce reliance   on
synthetic chemical   pesticides. It involves     (a) managing pests      (keeping them below
economically damaging     levels) rather than  seeking to eradicate    them, (b) relying, to    the
extent possible, on nonchemical  measures to keep pest     populations low; and   (c) selecting and
applying pesticides, when they have to be    used, in a way that   minimises adverse effects     on
beneficial organisms, humans, and the environment.

The following strategy   will be used to address     the use of agricultural    chemicals and to
promote IPM:
   *   Public works project     funds will not be used       for the purchase of     pesticides or
       fertilizers.
   *   Information o n acceptable   a nd u nacceptable p esticides  will b e p rovided to  farmers
       and Woreda staff to   encourage compliance     with government policy     and international
       standards.
   *   Training in irrigated   agriculture, including     pest and fertilizer applications,   safe
       chemical handling and   IPM will be provided    to communities as required.
   *   A basic guide for IPM    will be prepared as a   menu ofpractical methods      for reducing
       the need for pesticides,covering techniques    such as:
                   > Pest-resistant  crops varieties
                   > Use of disease/weed-free    planting stock
                   > Farming practices      that increase resistance     to pests (proper soil
                     preparation,
                   > spacing, planting,  watering, etc.)
                   > Farming practices   that suppress pest populations     (crop rotation, cover
                     crops,
                   > intercropping, etc.)
                   > Traditional manual    c ontrol o f p ests (weeding, removing i nsect p ods,
                     etc.)




                                            24

                         Biological controls (predators,  pathogens, pheromones,      etc.)
                      > Targeted chemical     use (pest scouting/selective  treatments)

 The guide will be developed    in conjunction with  training of farmers  in irrigated agriculture.  It
 will describe the     tools that woreda     staff and farmers    can use to develop       local pest
 management plans and      to implement practical  measures for controlling   pests.

 7.1.2   Health Clinic Projects:  Waste Management

 It is critical that a medical  waste management plan      for all sub-projects financed    under the
 PNSP which include     the construction or rehabilitation of health facilities (irrespective of their
 size). Therefore project    proposals involving   the rebuilding of rural    health clinics should
 include provisions for  the safe management of medical     wastes.

 The following strategy   will be used to address  medical waste issues   in the PSNP:
     *   A Medical Waste Management          Guide for Rural Health    Clinics will be prepared     to
         assist subproject design  and operations;
     *   A preliminary environmental        audit of clinic rehabilitation      proposals will be
         undertaken by a qualified professional;
     *   All proposals will undergo       environmental screening      to identify environmental
         concerns and environmental     assessment and mitigation    requirements associated      with
         medical waste;
     *   All proposals will be required   to prepare a specific medical    waste management plan
         following approval of the  project by Woreda Council     and before implementation.
     *   A subproject must include   or propose a basic waste   management plan that addresses:
             > The quantity    and quality of wastes generated
             > The available   disposal and treatment   options at the site
             > Methods to    segregate medical waste    from general waste
             > Internal rules  for waste handling, collection  and storage
             > Clinic responsibilities  for waste management
             > Proposed landfill   development and operations
     *  Medical waste must      not be deposited in    open dumps. An appropriate         landfill or,
        where appropriate,     incineration should   be adopted. In the      case of landfill, the
        following precautions   should be taken:
             > A trained site  manager to oversee the   landfill
             > Compacting and     sealing of the ground to  ensure containment of leachate
             > Adequate    mechanisms for leachate    collection and simple   treatment
             > Adequate mechanisms       for surface drainage control away from the site
             ; Controlled and timely    burial and covering of  waste

7.1.3   Projects involving Dams

Projects requiring   the construction of dams     of 15 metres or more      in height, will not be
approved. Dams of      less than 15 metres    height may be approved,       subject to a qualified
engineer being responsible      for the design and       supervision of construction,       and the
construction being carried  out by a qualified contractor.




                                              25

 7.1.4   Projects involving Asset   Acquisition or Loss of    Access to Assets

 While noting that there will be no projects requiring  involving relocation,  or involuntary loss
 ofassets or access to assets, it may nonetheless  occur that a project may  involve, for example,
 voluntary loss of use of a piece of land utilised  by a pipe, or by a road-widening    project, or
 voluntary loss of crops to make room for an irrigation   scheme. In such cases,   those members
 who suffer loss of productive     resources will be entitled   to either compensation    from the
 project. Wherever possible,  such compensation should    take the form of having   their asset loss
 taken into account in the project design.

 General guidance for  the equitable resolution of such cases will be  provided by the PSNP.    All
 such projects should  be earmarked for attention   by the Regional Environmental       Authority.
 The final procedures will be agreed with woreda    officials, and implemented   at kebele level


 7.2    Implementation of Mitigating      Measures

 The mitigating measures    presented in the Technical     Materials, supported by    the general
 guidance provided in    Annex 3 of the present        report, provide the primary      means of
 implementing environmental    management of the public    works subprojects. Three aspects    will
 be important in applying   and monitoring the effectiveness       of these measures during     the
 implementation phase:
   *  The Kebele or community       proponent will designate a   person who will be responsible
      for ensuring the mitigation   measures are effectively implemented      as specified before,
      during and after construction.  This will normally be  the DA.
  *   The Woreda will designate     a staff member who will    be responsible for inspection   and
      oversight of the implementation   of the mitigation measures   as required.
  *   The Regional Food Security     Office and the Regional Environmental     Protection Bureau
      will assess the application   of the prescribed mitigation    measures in monitoring     and
      evaluating environmental    performance of the public  works.


7.3     HIV/AIDS

The PSNP poses both      challenges and opportunities     regarding prevention    and control of
HIV/AIDS. Safety Net      activities will engage   in widespread community        mobilization to
implement public works     activities. These activities  could have negative     impacts through
increasing mobility of large number of people,    thereby creating favorable   conditions for the
spread of HIV/AIDS.    To mitigate the potential   negative impacts of Safety    Net activities, it
will be essential to  include effective & participatory     HIV/AIDS prevention      and control
measures in the design  ofthe programme.

MainstreamingHIV/AIDS      Preventionand Control

The existence of organized      structures which coordinate      the planning, implementation,
monitoring and evaluation   of the PSNP at federal,   regional, wereda and    community levels,
provides an opportunity to mainstream HIV/AIDS      prevention, and to   control activities in the
PSNP. The interface    between local government       (woreda, kebele) and     local community




                                            26

 governance structures is strong, and these structures can be used as a basis on which the local
 response of HIV/AIDS    can be built.

 Training

 Training for CFSTFs    will include a component     addressing the prevention    and control of
HIV/AIDS. The CFSTF        will work in close collaboration      with Anti AIDS committees,
wherever they exists, to   raise the awareness of the   community and prevent      the spread o f
HIV/AIDS.

ProtectionandInvolvement     of Women andGirls

As women and girls     are more vulnerable to     HIV/AIDS risks than other     members of the
community, it is imperative   to emphasize the protection   and role of women and girls    in the
prevention and control activities that will be planned.

Avoidance ofDiscrimination

It is also essential to ensure chronically food insecure    households which are     affected by
HIV/AIDS will benefit from    SNP without being exposed    to any stigma and discrimination.

In addition, if a household   cannot not provide labour     to participate in the public  works
because illness associated with HIV/AIDS, it should   be eligible to receive direct support from
the SNP.

  8.       MONITORING

  Monitoring of the implementation       of the PSNP is an  important aspect of   ensuring that the
  commitment to       environmental and      social protection   is being met. The     purpose of the
  monitoring is to:
       *  Determine compliance        with the ESMF and       to identify any issues     and corrective
       measures required;
       *  Determine the effectiveness       of the mitigation   measures in avoiding      and reducing
       adverse impacts of the   project activities;
       *  Assess the environmental     and social outcomes    ofthe public works   projects.

 The Regional Food         Security Coordinating     Offices will be responsible     for incorporating
 environmental and        social monitoring     into the regular M&E        system being developed
 established for the PSNP.     The monitoring plan    has two components:
     i.   Process monitoring:      measuring the compliance         and effectiveness    of the ESMF
          implementation;
    ii.   Impact monitoring: measuring       the effects of the subproject   activities on biophysical
          and socio-economic     parameters

 It is proposed that there be an annual environmental  and social review, assessingcompliance, learning
 lesions and improving   future performance

 8.1      Process Monitoring

 The primary focus     is to ensure that:
 (a) The Environmental      Review process is   operating as intended;
 (b)   Mitigation     measures    are   being adopted      and applied      during the     subprojects
 implementation; and
 (c) Mitigation measures      are effective in reducing  adverse effects on   the ground (and if  they
 are not effective, then   taking action to adjust them as required).

Monitoring and reporting       o n the E nvironmental   R eview p rocess w ill   take p lace in all t he
 Safety Net woredas.        The monitoring of      the implementation      and effectiveness   of the
mitigating measures      will occur on a regular    'spot check' basis, identifying  any problems or
factors that constrain    the performance of the    mitigation measures.    The specific indicators   to
be employed, and        the identity of the     staff responsible, will   be determined within      the
framework ofthe PSNP         M&E system.

8.2      Impact Monitoring

The monitoring of     the environmental   impacts of the project   will include:
(a) the extent and    manner in which the     project is succeeding   in environmental    regeneration
and rehabilitation;   and
(b) the occurrence     of positive and negative    effects of the infrastructure   developments (eg.
irrigation facilities,water supply, roads,   etc.).

Two aspects warrant     more focused data    collection and analysis   of impacts:
*    indicators of environmental    regeneration of catchment     areas under various  soil and water
     conservation, water   harvesting and afforestation   activities;




                                                28

*   indicators of the biophysical and socio-economic effects   of irrigation systems and  related
    changes in crops, food    security, agricultural incomes   and environmental parameters     -
    water supply/depletion, water  quality and soil quality.

8.3     Design and Implementation

The design of a Monitoring    and Evaluation system    for the Food Security Programme       as a
whole is presently underway.   This system will encompass    the PSNP, and will also cover    the
final design of the M&E   requirements for the implementation    of the ESMF. Thus the   specific
indicators to be employed,  the system design and the   identity of the staff responsibleat each
level, and the budget, will bedetermined within the framework    ofthe PSNP M&E system.

The Federal Food Security     Office will be ultimately    responsible for coordination   of the
implementation of the M&E     system.

II       Screening

 The following table lists important        potential impacts which may       require a project to be
 earmarked for special attention,      redesigned or rejected. For each    project, go to the relevant
 section and check off the likely     potential for the impacts listed.

     *   Where high potential impacts        are identified, these should  be marked on the project
         file for the attention of the Regional     FSCO, as possibly requiring   mitigating measures
         additional to those in the standardized     lists provided in the Technical  Materials.

     *   If an impact marked * is likely      to occur, the project may be accepted,    but the project
         file must be marked as a 'Project        of Concern', potentially requiring    review by the
         Regional Environmental Authority.

     *   Projects involving the relocation      of any resident should re-designed    to eliminate the
         impact concerned. If such        redesign is impossible, the project     should be rejected.
         Instances where such impacts are       most likely to occur are marked:   **.


Note also:
If the project involves dam construction,       this may not exceed a height of   15 metres.
No project within, or adjoining, an      internationally disputed area  may be accepted.
