  The Ethiopian Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP) has the same acronym as the World Bank‘s support
to the Ethiopian program - Productive Safety Net Project. World Bank support to the PSNP covered three
different Adaptable Program Loans – 1 (2005-2006), 2 (2007-2009) and 3 (2010-2014). For these reasons,
in this PPAR, the World Bank project will be referred to as APL 1 or ‗the project‘

                 IEG Mission: Improving development results through excellence in evaluation.


About this Report
       The Independent Evaluation Group assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes:
first, to ensure the integrity of the Bank’s self-evaluation process and to verify that the Bank’s work is producing the
expected results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through the
dissemination of lessons drawn from experience. As part of this work, IEG annually assesses 20-25 percent of the
Bank’s lending operations through field work. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those
that are innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for
which Executive Directors or Bank management have requested assessments; and those that are likely to generate
important lessons.
     To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEG staff examine project files and other
documents, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government, and other in-country
stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and in local offices as
appropriate.
     Each PPAR is subject to internal IEG peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. The PPAR is also sent to the
borrower for review. IEG incorporates both Bank and borrower comments as appropriate, and the borrowers'
comments are attached to the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors. After an
assessment report has been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.


About the IEG Rating System for Public Sector Evaluations
     IEG’s use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to
lending instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEG evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive
at their project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (additional
information is available on the IEG website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
     Outcome: The extent to which the operation’s major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to
be achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes
relevance of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project’s
objectives are consistent with the country’s current development priorities and with current Bank country and
sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country
Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers, Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which
the project’s design is consistent with the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project’s objectives
were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is the
extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital
and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to
adjustment operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory,
Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or
expected outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High,
Significant, Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
     Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
operation and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate
transition arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loan/credit closing, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing
agency or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and
agreements, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government
performance and implementing agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly
Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.

Preface
This is the Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) for an Adaptable Program
Loan (APL) in the amount of SDR47.8 million (US$70.0 million equivalent) to Ethiopia
to support the Productive Safety Net Project. It was approved by the Board of the World
Bank on November 30, 2004 with a mid-term review on June 1, 2006 and a closing date
of December 31, 2006. This project was chosen for review as a contribution to the
Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) evaluation of World Bank support to social safety
nets. Ethiopia was selected as one of six countries for which PPARs and additional
country case studies would be carried out. The project is the first of a series of APLs
providing support to Ethiopia‘s Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP). It is referred to
in this PPAR as APL1or the project and the evaluation covers the project objectives, with
some reference to the wider series of APLs.

This report was prepared by Rachel Slater and Alison Evans, IEG consultants. PPARs
draw on World Bank project files, government project reports and evaluations, and
independent published and grey materials as sources of evidence. This PPAR also drew
on interviews conducted during a mission to Ethiopia in April 2010 with government
officials, development partners and representatives of civil society organizations. Field
visits were conducted in two regions (SNNPR and Oromia) in three woredas and
included woreda and community-level PSNP staff and other members of the community.
Further interviews were carried out with World Bank and development partner staff
outside Ethiopia. A list of people interviewed is attached in Annex B. The authors are
grateful to those who made time for interviews and provided documentation and
information. Mission support provided by Samrawit Beyene in the World Bank Ethiopia
office and members of the Donor Coordination Team was greatly appreciated.

Following standard IEG procedures, copies of the draft PPAR were sent to the relevant
government officials and agencies for review and comments. No comments were
received.

Summary
This is the Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) for an Adaptable Program
Loan (APL) to Ethiopia. The Productive Safety Net Project was approved on November
30, 2004 and was the first of a series of APLs providing support to Ethiopia‘s Productive
Safety Net Program (PSNP).

Despite good growth and a fall in the poverty headcount of 12.4 percent between 1999/00
and 2004/05, the poverty gap remains severe and millions (sometimes tens of millions)
experience food gaps of three months or more on a regular basis. Until 2005, the main
response to poverty and hunger came through annual emergency appeals. Ethiopia had
an emergency appeal for humanitarian assistance every year since the famine of 1984.
Following the drought in 2002-2003, when more than 13 million Ethiopians–a record
number - required assistance the government established the New Coalition for Food
Security and sought a new approach to tackling food insecurity. The PSNP was to
provide a mechanism to replace annual appeals for emergency food aid with a more
predictable safety net to address chronic and seasonal hunger. In this context, the series
of APLs had the objective of improved food security for at least 5 million chronically
food insecure people and stabilization of the long term trend of increasing numbers of
food insecure people. The specific development objective of APL I was to assist the
Government to shift from a relief-oriented to a productive and development-oriented
safety net.

World Bank assistance to the transition from an ad hoc, emergency appeals system to
tackle food insecurity was provided through support for the PSNP. The emphasis on
moving from relief to a more productive and development-oriented safety net also
aligned the project with wider World Bank objectives. The project is largely consistent
with the 1997 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) and more so with the 2004-2005 CAS.
The Bank‘s objectives for this project were strongly consistent with support by other key
donors with whom it co-financed the PSNP: Canadian International Development
Agency (CIDA), British Department for International Development (DFID), the World
Food Program (WFP), the United States Agency for International Development (USAID)
and the Government of Ireland. The Bank‘s financial contribution was 18 percent of the
total donor support to financing the PSNP in 2005-2006 but it played a lead role with
regard to analytical work, joint supervisory missions and donor coordination. (Later, the
role of donor coordination rotated between different donors.) Given the prevailing
context (high levels of poverty and hunger and an increasingly unsustainable emergency
system), shared agreement on the need for reform and emphasis on moving towards a
more productive safety net in line with World Bank growth objectives, the relevance of
project objectives is rated high.

Reforming the existing system of humanitarian appeals for food aid was a radical and
risky activity. The APL project was pragmatic and realistic in its approach to reform and
this is reflected in the design. The Bank did not try and completely overturn the existing
system by establishing entirely new institutions, responsibilities and approaches. Rather
it maintained parts of the imperfect existing arrangements and mechanisms where these
would enable the shift from ad hoc emergency appeals to a more predictable and
productive safety net system. Examples of this included: a) maintaining the focus on
                                            viii


rural poverty and hunger rather than introduce new vulnerable groups such as the urban
poor; b) working within existing government systems – the Food Security Coordination
Bureau (FSCB) rather than switching to others such as the Ministry of Labor and Social
Affairs (MOLSA); c) using existing skills and experiences – for example using a similar
community targeting mechanism to that used in the emergency Employment Guarantee
Scheme (EGS); and continuing with food transfers rather than switching immediately to
cash in low capacity woredas. However, the reform was still a significant change in
operations for the government and development partners so the World Bank provided
support to ensure relevant and appropriate design features including the distinction
between public works and direct support beneficiaries, the shift from food to cash, the
need for monitoring of prices and wage rate purchasing power and levels of benefit /
wages. Relevance of design is rated as substantial

The first of the APL series substantially achieve its objective, namely assist the
Government to shift from a relief-oriented to a productive and development-oriented
safety net. The achievement of the objective was measured against a set of indicators that
demonstrated how successful the transition away from ad hoc annual appeals for
emergency food aid towards a more predictably resourced, multi-annual safety net system
has been. There was also progress reversing the upward trend in food insecurity during
APL1 although a caseload of more than 7 million remained in the PSNP in 2010 due to
population growth and the impacts of food price shocks in 2008.

The counterfactual of cost-effectiveness for comparative purposes is the cost and efficacy
of past emergency appeals for food aid. Under the emergency system total spending on
transfers to the poor in Ethiopia had amounted to US$265 million per annum on average
between 1997 and 2002 - US$4 per capita or US$40 per beneficiary. The system was
criticized for being ineffective (in the sense that it saved lives but not livelihoods and
food aid was often delivered later than needed), unaccountable and non-transparent.
Administrative costs were largely covered by the government and were not measured in
the donor budgets but approximately 17.2 percent of total program cost was dedicated to
staff time, administrative costs and capacity building. No more than 80 percent of the
budget was allocated to transfers with the remainder of the budget allocated to
administration, staff and capital requirements for public works project. The PSNP was
efficient compared to international experience on public works programs in terms of
targeting, high wage intensity, and low administrative costs due to use of existing
government systems and economies of scale given the size of the program. Based on the
demonstrated achievement of objectives of the project; and the increased efficiency and
efficacy of the PSNP compared to its predecessor – emergency appeals, efficiency is
rated as substantial. Continued investments in administrative and financial management
systems should improve efficiency further.

The risk to development outcome remains significant. Despite widespread public,
government and donor support for the PSNP (including financial resourcing until 2015)
and the many improvements made, there remain significant risks to the program. First,
claims that political affiliations influence access to the PSNP continue, despite the Bank
putting numerous safeguards in place, including monitoring systems and independent
evaluations. Second, Ethiopia has the ninth fastest growing population in the world with
an annual increase of more than three percent. Given the importance attached to
                                             ix


graduation from the PSNP (i.e. raising household income such that it is no longer food
insecure) and reversing the trend in chronic food insecurity, population growth is likely to
undermine progress towards achieving the very ambitious goals of the PSNP and may
undermine government and donor support for the program. Third, donor willingness to
fund the PSNP is partly influenced by government performance on governance and
democracy and this remains a significant risk to development outcomes in the PSNP.
Finally, government commitment to the PSNP was (and continues to be) dependent on
unrealistic graduation objectives that involve highly ambitious objectives of reducing
food insecurity.

Bank performance is rated satisfactory. There were some weaknesses associated with
quality at entry but the quality of support to implementation ensured that many
weaknesses were overcome. The Quality at Entry of the project was satisfactory. The
transition away from emergency appeals to a more predictable and productive safety net
took place over a number of years but the drought and associated upturn in the
emergency caseload in 2002-03 pushed the issue rapidly up the agenda. Many donors,
including the World Bank, were not as prepared as they needed to be given the speed at
which the government wanted to move forward. Some concerns, including scalability
and institutional capacity, were not adequately addressed in the design phase with
negative implications for the subsequent roll-out of the project (especially the timely
delivery of payments – Table 4 and targeting issues). However, the monitoring
framework (part of the design) provided a mechanism by which these problems could be
swiftly identified and addressed. Bank supervision was highly satisfactory. The Bank
played a major role in strengthening implementation capacity and systems at federal,
regional, woreda and community level to support the delivery of the PSNP.

Borrower performance is rated moderately satisfactory. The government took a bold and
risky step in attempting to transition away from the emergency appeal system.
Ownership of the PSNP was high and there was very strong commitment to the PSNP as
part of the wider food security program. Government performance is rated satisfactory.
The performance of the implementing agency – the Food Security Coordination Bureau
(FSCB) in the Ministry of Agricultural and Rural Development (MOARD) - was
moderately satisfactory. This was the first time that a cash transfer program had been
implemented at scale through the FSCB. The immediate capacities of the bureau and
implementing partners at regional and woreda level were not adequate.

LESSONS

This PPAR generates lessons about how to support governments in moving from annual
emergency appeals to tackle food insecurity to a more productive and developmental
safety net.

      Donor coordination can be critical for improving fiscal and institutional capacity
       of governments and efficiency and effectiveness of social safety nets.
       Commitments of technical and financial support from donors are most effective
       when donors align around a common framework and principles for engaging with
       government.
                                         x


   The role of social safety nets in a particular country context evolves over time as
    SSN institutions are created and the capacity to identify different subgroups of
    poor and vulnerable households expands. Whereas initially the PSNP was
    designed to address regular shocks in rural areas leading to annual emergency
    food appeals, the dialogue has evolved towards programming options to address
    two different types of poor, rural households: those with longer term potential to
    graduate out of poverty and those who face chronic challenges.
   Community based targeting, with the right guidelines, can be used to target
    resources to the poorest households in rural communities even in countries with
    very high levels of poverty. Where poverty is generalized across a large
    proportion of the population and resources are limited, absolute criteria (for
    example size of food gap) are insufficient and ranking is important. Targeting of
    the PSNP was geographically based to identify the regions, provinces and
    woredas most sensitive to food shortages; however, below the level of the
    woreda, community mechanisms were used to rank households and identify the
    poorest ones to receive assistance. Utilizing community based targeting required
    considerable work including revisions of targeting guidelines, training,
    establishment of grievance procedures and effective monitoring and evaluation.
    IE evidence indicated that these households were indeed among the poorest and
    this system of community based targeting has worked increasingly well.
   Contingency funds serve a critical role enabling government to scale up safety
    nets – both in terms of transfer size and coverage - to address transitory shocks,
    even in low income countries.
   Both cash and food transfers can be appropriate depending on specific
    circumstances, such as the level of seasonal variability in food prices, and it is
    important to be pragmatic about what mix of transfer types is best. Whatever
    transfer type, predictability is critical. Achieving timely transfers in low income
    settings is possible but requires investments in capacity building and continuous
    monitoring.
   Monitoring and evaluation—and the feedback loop back into program design or
    capacity building efforts — are essential for implementing a safety net program in
    a very low capacity. The PSNP did not have the advantage of starting off as a
    pilot and expanding later based on lessons. Rather, the program was initiated on a
    national scale, monitored and evaluated as it went forward, and changes were
    made along the way as lessons were learned.

1. Background and Context
Macroeconomic and Political Context
1.1     Despite major shocks and stresses including recurrent drought, population pressure
and land degradation, Ethiopia achieved good overall growth with increases in real GDP per
capita since the overthrow of the Derg2 regime and the establishment of the Ethiopian
People‘s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) government in 1994 (Figure 1). Growth
has been broad-based across agriculture, services and industry (World Bank 2008). This
economic performance is attributed by the World Bank to improvements in structural
policies, strengthening of economic institutions and some good fortune. The risks to
sustained growth and macroeconomic performance include inflation, the impacts of current
and future climate shocks and high costs of fuel imports

1.2     Aggregate spending levels are consistent with total revenue and grants. Fiscal
deficits have fallen in the 2000s and have benefited from debt relief under Heavily Indebted
Poor Countries (HIPC) and Multilateral Debt Relief Initiatives (MDRI). This has enabled
improvements in pro-poor spending from 12.2 percent of GDP in 2002/2003 to 14.6 percent
of GDP in 2007/2008 (World Bank 2008a). Ethiopia has Medium Term Expenditure
Frameworks (MTEFs) for the social sectors including health, education and for agriculture
(where the Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP) resides) (OECD 2006).

 The Derg was a communist military dictatorship that came to power in Ethiopia after ousting the emperor Hail
Selassie in 1974.
                                                2


1.3     The 2005 Ethiopian Plan for Accelerated and Sustained Development to End Poverty
(Ethiopia‘s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, known as PASDEP) has an eight pillar
strategy focused on the main drivers of long term poverty reduction in the country. These
are:

      Building all-inclusive implementation capacity;
      A massive push to accelerate growth;
      Creating the balance between economic development and population growth;
      Unleashing the potentials of Ethiopia's women;
      Strengthening the infrastructure backbone of the country;
      Strengthening human resource development;
      Managing risk and volatility; and,
      Creating employment opportunities.

1.4     In the PASDEP safety nets are viewed as an explicit part of efforts to achieve food
security and lie under objectives for rural and agricultural development (Government of the
Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia (GFDRE) 2005).

1.5     The relationship between politics / power and social safety nets presents a paradox in
Ethiopia. In most regions, the rural poor constitute the foundation of support for the current
ruling party. Many people maintain allegiances to the regional parties that freed them from
the Derg. The paradox is that, despite this allegiance, there are relatively low levels of
political participation (Vaughn and Tronvoll 2003) and a ―recurring cycle of opening and
closing of political space‖ (World Bank 2008a: 2). The social contract between citizens and
the state is rhetorically strong and the ruling party is omnipresent at local level and yet there
is only limited accountability within government and between citizens and the state and little
questioning of government policy on safety nets.

Poverty Challenges and Responses
1.6    Household survey evidence suggests that real total expenditure per capita grew by 19
percent between 1999/00 and 2004/05 with a resultant fall in poverty headcount of 12.4
percent. The World Development Indicators (2009) cites a poverty headcount of 44 percent
and GNI per capita remains very low at $280 per capita (Atlas method). The Human
Development Index (HDI) ranks Ethiopia 171st out of 182 countries (UNDP 2009).
However, despite growth and progress against poverty headcounts, poverty gaps remain
severe and millions (sometimes tens of millions) are food insecure every year.

1.7     Poverty and vulnerability are closely tied to covariant risks–especially drought but
also price risks (even before the food price crisis of 2008), malaria and HIV/AIDS (World
Bank 2005). Households manage or cope with these risks in numerous ways–diversifying
economic activities, (informal) insurance migration, savings, reducing expenditures and
consumptions, withdrawing children from school, borrowing and selling assets. Some of
these risk coping strategies – taking children out of school, cutting back on food or eating
‗famine‘ food, selling productive assets - are damaging in the long-term.
                                              3


1.8     Until 2005, the main response to poverty and hunger came through annual emergency
appeals (Figure 2). There was an appeal for humanitarian assistance every year since the
famine of 1984. Following the drought in 2002-2003, when more than 13 million
Ethiopians– a record number–required assistance the government established the New
Coalition for Food Security and sought a new approach to tackling food insecurity. This
change had its roots in the recognition that the appeals system often resulted in untimely
delivery of food and was increasingly unsustainable (Raisin 2001, Smith and Subbarao
2003). The World Bank‘s 2004 Public Expenditure Review (PER) estimated that total
spending on transfers to the poor in Ethiopia amounted to US$265 million per annum on
average between 1997 and 2002, fluctuating from US$120 million in ‗good‘ years to US$450
million in severe drought years (World Bank 2004c). The average represents about 13
percent of total public spending, about US$4 per capita or US$40 per beneficiary.

1.9     In 2005 Ethiopia‘s Productive Safety Net Program was established to provide
transfers to the food insecure population in chronically food insecure woredas in a way that
prevents asset depletion at the household level and creates assets at the community level
(GFDRE 2004). The new safety nets approach focused on tackling chronic or seasonal
hunger and sought to provide a more sustainable safety nets system. Sustainability was not
just about finding an alternative to an emergency system that donors were increasingly
unwilling to fund. From the outset, consumption objectives were linked with the protection
and creation of assets and the idea that PSNP beneficiaries would ‗graduate‘ into food
security as a result of PSNP and wider support that supported their consumption as they built
assets and strengthen livelihoods.

2. Productive Safety Net Project – Description
2.1     The World Bank support to the PSNP began in the form of an Adaptable Program
Loan for the Ethiopian Productive Safety Net Project (hereafter referred to as APL1 or the
project). The World Bank assisted in design phases and a credit of US$14.3 million and a
grant of US$55.7 million was appraised and subsequently approved on November 30, 2004.
The project became effective on January 1, 2005 and closed on December 31, 2006. Two
subsequent APLs followed as government met safeguard conditions identified in the APL1.
APL2 covered January 1, 2007- June 30, 2010. APL3 was approved on October 22, 2009
and will end in June 30, 2015. The World Bank support to PSNP was simultaneously
supported by other donors, including: Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA),
British Department for International Development (DFID), the World Food Program (WFP),
the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Government of
Ireland. The Bank‘s financial contribution was 18 percent of the total donor support to
financing the PSNP in 2005-2006 but it played a lead role with regard to analytical work and
joint supervisory missions, and donor coordination. (Later, the role of donor coordination
rotated between different donors.)

Project Objectives
2.2     The APL1 project was designed to support the efforts of the Ethiopian Government to
transition away from an ad hoc emergency appeal system to a more predictable safety net to
tackle chronic and seasonal hunger. The development objective of APL I was to assist the
Government to shift from a relief-oriented to a productive and development-oriented safety
net (World Bank 2004a)3 .

2.3      The project would achieve this by (i) providing predictable, multi-annual resources,
(ii) replacing food with grants as the primary medium of support, and (iii) making resources
available for critical capital, technical assistance, and administrative costs.

2.4     Objectives for the full APL series were broader: improved food security for at least 5
million chronically food insecure people and stabilization of the long term trend of
increasing numbers of food insecure people. For the purposes of this PPAR, the PDO listed
in the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) provides the basis for the ratings but progress
towards program objectives is also reviewed and wider lessons are drawn out regarding the
APL series.

Design
2.5     The project had two components. Progress under each component was measured as
per the logframe in Table 1 Two higher level additional indicators included: at least 75

  The financing agreement listed a very similar objective: to support the Borrower‘s efforts to transition from
relief-oriented assistance to a development-oriented productive safety net. Objectives for the full APL series
were broader: improved food security for at least 5 million chronically food insecure people and stabilization of
the long term trend of increasing numbers of food insecure people. For the purposes of this PPAR, the PDO
listed in the PAD is evaluated.

percent of program participants report no distress sales of assets to meet food needs; and at
least 75 percent of households in program areas reporting satisfaction with or benefit from
infrastructure developed. These were expected to be achieved by the end of APL2 but were
monitored in the project.

Box 1. APL1 Productive Safety Net Project Components
Component 1: Safety Nets (US$68 million)
a) Labor-intensive public works will provide grants to households whose adults participate in public works sub-
   projects. Sub-projects to be undertaken as part of public works will be determined locally by the beneficiary
   communities through an annual, participatory planning process. With appropriate technical assistance being
   provided by woredas and regions, sub-projects will focus on, but are not limited to, environmental
   rehabilitation. A specific budget for administrative costs and equipment will be allocated. Furthermore, as the
   most appropriate time for undertaking public works is during the dry season, and the period of most need for
   food insecure households is during the rainy season, a system of deferred payment of grants will be established.
   Public works participants will receive 50 percent of the grant at the end of the month in which they have
   worked, and 50 percent will be deferred until later in the year. This will ensure that households have the
   resources available when they are most needed, that works can be undertaken at the most appropriate time, and
   that public works sub-projects do not compete with the intensive agricultural season.
a. Direct support will provide grants to households who are labor-poor and cannot undertake public works.
   Beneficiaries will include, but are not limited to, orphans, pregnant and lactating mothers, elderly households,
   other labor-poor, high risk households with sick individuals (such as people living with HIV/AIDS), and the
   majority of female-headed households with young children.
Component 2: Institutional Support (US$2 million)
This component will focus on strengthening all aspects of program implementation, including (i) capacity building
at community level to strengthen beneficiary identification and local level planning, financial management,
procurement and technical training at woreda and regional level to ensure that all subprojects are appropriately
designed and rapid response mechanisms are in place to ensure smooth program implementation; (ii) support to the
development of a monitoring and evaluation framework and a program Management Information System (MIS).
This includes the implementation of a beneficiary survey, and a detailed program ―process‖ survey after the first 12
months. It will also finance several additional studies as part of the shift to the second phase of the APL; and (iii)
procurement of essential goods and services.

2.6    Targeting: Prior to the start of the project in 2005 an average of between 5 and 6
million Ethiopians (just below 10% of the total population) had required assistance each year
over the previous decade (World Bank 2004b). The PSNP initially targeted households in
262 (out of about 550) woredas. Those woredas targeted were designated ‗food insecure‘ by
the government and had received three continuous years of food aid in the last decade and
estimated that within these woredas there were 5 million food insecure households.4
Households were defined as food insecure when they faced a food gap of three months
(determined at community level) or more in any given year. Food insecurity was chronic
when experienced for three years or more. Self-targeting based on the PSNP public works

  These woredas are in four regions (Amhara, Oromia, SNNPR and Tigray) with additional woredas added later
in some pastoral regions. Other regions did not receive the PSNP because either they were predominantly
pastoralist and the PSNP design was not easily transferable to pastoralist communities and they were regions
that very rarely experience acute food shocks that require humanitarian responses.
                                                              6


    wage rage (ETB6 / day) was deemed inappropriate due to the lack of alternative employment
    opportunities. Rather, households were to be identified on the basis of the following criteria:

             Chronically food insecure households that had continuous food shortages (three
              months of food gap or more) in the previous three years and who had received food
              assistance;
             Households that, in the last one or two years, suddenly became more food insecure as
              a result of a severe loss of assets and were unable to support themselves; and
             Households without family support and other means of social protection and support

    2.7      In practice, the first and third criteria were applied regularly and the second criteria
    less so.

    2.8    Given the large numbers of potential beneficiaries, additional criteria were used
    including: the status of household assets such as land size and quality, food stocks; income
    from non-agricultural activities, alternative employment and remittances; and family size and
    numbers of dependents in the household. The targeting mechanism was community-based:
    Community Food Security Task Forces (CFSTF) comprising men and women who often
    occupied important positions in the community, identified, and later ranked, households
                                               7


meeting the criteria. In the first few months of the PSNP, Implementation Status and Results
(ISR) reporting processes and Rapid Response Teams identified concerns with targeting. In
Amhara region in particular, the government goal of graduating all households from the
PSNP within five years meant that the CFSTFs were instructed to select those capable of
graduating, rather than the most food insecure. They were subsequently instructed to select
the most food insecure.

2.9     Benefits and payments: Transfers were paid to households (in a single payment) on
the basis of the number of household members. Beneficiaries received transfers either in
cash, food or a combination of cash and food. The transfer, for both public works
participants and those receiving direct support, was either half a grain ration (based on the
World Food Program (WFP) food basket) for six months of the year or its cash equivalent.
Cash benefits (ETB30 / month for 6 months) were not differentiated to reflect geographical
differences and during the project, cash benefits were not changed to reflect seasonal or inter-
annual food price changes. Households on the public works part of the program
(approximately 20 percent of beneficiaries) were required to complete 5 days of work for
each beneficiary per month. Children were not officially allowed to participate in public
works but older children often completed work requirements on behalf of other household
members. Cash payments were made by Woreda Office of Finance and Development
(WOFED) cashiers direct to beneficiaries and food transfers were made at specific sites.

Implementation Arrangements
2.10 Implementing agencies: As part of a wider Food Security Program, the PSNP was
implemented through the Food Security Coordination Bureau in the Ministry of Agriculture
and Rural Development (MOARD). Implementation followed the tiers of government in
Ethiopia with activities in federal, regional and woreda (or district) level administrations and
involved a broad range of sector institutions across government–Disaster Prevention and
Preparedness, Finance and Economic Development (through which PSNP cash resources
flow), Natural Resources and numerous woreda line offices. Outside government NGOs and
other international organizations (especially WFP) provided implementation support,
particularly for the delivery of food transfers. At the community level, taskforces target,
monitor public works inputs and outputs, confirm completion of public works and notify the
woreda to trigger payments. Donors work with government through the Joint Coordination
Committee (JCC) and the Donor Coordination Team (DCT).


2.11 Some aspects of the PSNP are highly decentralized. Decision-making on public
works activities is made at the community and woreda levels, and the distribution of woreda
and regional contingency funds is made at regional and woreda levels. However, many
aspects of the PSNP remain tightly controlled by federal level agencies. These include
beneficiary quotas and the designation of ‗food insecure woreda‘ status. The extent to which
political support and preferences towards particular regions influences the geographical
targeting of program is subject of repeated debate. Woredas have little control over the
allocation of budgets for equipment and staff so are not in a position to distribute budget
across their program as they find appropriate. Furthermore, since the PSNP is such a large
                                                8


program at woreda level, PSNP teams at the woreda level frequently have to defend their
capital and equipment from demands by other sectoral/ cabinet offices.

2.12 Institutional strengthening: Under the project, the second project component focused
on making investments in institutional strengthening at various levels from federal down to
community level. These were necessary due to i) new skills and responsibilities required at
various levels, particularly those associated with the shift from food to cash transfers ii) the
decision to locate the PSNP within existing government systems and structures rather than
creating parallel systems and iii) the agreement that, in order to avoid a humanitarian appeal
in 2005, there would be no comprehensive testing or piloting of the program. The capacity
assessment was completed only one month before the program commenced (World Bank
2007).

2.13 Risks and fiscal constraints: In addition to institutional capacity and coordination
risks, a number of other risks were identified at appraisal. Concerns about the potential
inflationary impacts of the switch to cash rather than food transfers on local markets were
assessed through grain price monitoring (including a wage rate purchasing power survey that
compared food prices with PSNP public works wage rates–see Alderman, Rajkumar and
Wiseman, 2006).

2.14 The risk of leakage and elite capture was monitored through regular donor
supervision missions (Joint Review Implementation Support (JRIS)) as well as those of the
Rapid Response Team, a joint government and donor body. Additionally, in 2006 the
Overseas Development Institute (ODI), conducted an assessment of the targeting design,
implementation and outcomes of PSNP in its first year to eighteen months of operation
(Sharp et al. 2006). The assessment found: 1) PSNP was reaching the poor; 2) PSNP
institutional structures for targeting (combined administrative and community targeting) were
in place in most areas (though not all), and were functioning with varying degrees of success;
3) Local government and community decision makers made efforts to improve the targeting
processes as during the first year of the program there were some major misinterpretations
and confusions regarding targeting; and 4) No systematic corruption or large-scale abuse of
the targeting system was found.

2.15 Concerns about donors commitments were addressed through the establishment of a
DCT which has proved an exemplary example of donor coordination and harmonization:
since the first year of the PSNP donors have contributed funds, aligned their financial
reporting systems, agreed a shared framework for coordinating with government, contributed
to a shared funding arrangement and worked together on and committed staff to
implementation review processes.

Implementation
2.16 Supervision missions and the ICR identified some major concerns regarding
implementation. Throughout the project, the rating on the development objective was
Satisfactory except in 2005/06 when the project was downgraded to Moderately
Unsatisfactory and later Moderately Satisfactory due to the government‘s temporary decision
not to increase benefit levels and some delays in legislation and in the MIS development.

2.17 The decision to implement the program at scale rather than to carry out a pilot was
controversial with many donors, including the World Bank, arguing that a pilot would enable
various implementation arrangements to be tested and shortcomings in capacity to be
identified (the IDLgroup 2008). However, the government successfully argued that donors
had stated that they would not fund another emergency appeal and a pilot, even one that
covered one million people, would leave four million people outside the emergency and the
PSNP systems.

2.18 Targeting was geographical and community-based using targeting guidelines and
criteria. The CFSTF identified eligible participants based on guidelines and training received
from the kebele and then allocated those eligible to public works or direct support. The list
was finalized by the CFSTF and passed to the Kebele Food Security Task Force (KFSTF).
In subsequent years a more transparent consultation process took place before the list was
passed to the KFSTF.

2.19 Problems with targeting: Early monitoring of the PSNP found that, in Amhara
Region in particular, large numbers of the poorest households had been excluded from the
PSNP. By June 2005, the Aide Memoire of the Joint Review and Implementation Support
(JRIS) Mission noted that, although the government had taken important steps in rectifying
exclusion errors5 including increasing the number of beneficiaries in Amhara from 1.68 to 2
million and instructing woredas to prioritise the inclusion of the poorest among additional
beneficiaries, that close follow up was required to ensure identification of remaining resource
gaps.

2.20 Analysis in 2006 and 2008 (Sharp, Brown and Teshome 2006, Devereux, Sabates-
Wheeler and Tefera, 2006, Devereux and others 2008 and Gilligan and others 2010) suggests
that inclusion errors are very small–largely because the proportion of people with food gaps
is so large. These improvements have continued over time and Gilligan and others 2010 find
that PSNP ‗is better targeted than the „average‟ global safety net program … and any of the
African safety net programs reported in Coady et al (2004)‟ (p. 17). Further evidence in this
regard is found in later sections.

2.21 Inclusion errors in the PSNP were tackled rapidly in 2005 and 2006 but the debate
about exclusion errors remains the subject of serious discussion. Subsequent targeting
problems emerged during the lifetime of the project that were associated with undercoverage
rather than leakage. There are two main issues. First, in woredas where PSNP quotas did
not cover the number of households that met the targeting criteria, taskforces resorted to
diluting benefits by adopting partial family targeting. This was mostly in Southern Nations,
Nationalities and People‘s Region (SNNPR) and Oromia regions. This meant that only some
members of a household would receive transfers (although there was no systematic inclusion
or exclusion of particular household members). Second, additional woredas added to the
PSNP but there are still other woredas where households experience food gaps of 3 months
or more. The addition of woredas does not follow clearly articulated or published criteria

5
 Exclusion errors occur when those who should be in the program (i.e. those with the largest food gaps) are
not included as beneficiaries. Inclusion errors occur when households without a food gap are included in the
program.
                                             10


and is complicated by cadastral revisions that, for example, create two new woredas where
there was one previously.

2.22 Coverage of pastoralist communities: Pastoral areas in Afar and Somali regions were
expected to be included in the PSNP in 2005 and 2006 but issues with implementation
capacity and concerns about the appropriateness of the PSNP for pastoral communities
delayed the extension to Afar and Somali. In 2005 and 2006 transfers were delivered in four
out of Ethiopia‘s 10 regions. By 2009 this has been expanded to eight regions, with
significant scaling up in Afar – a predominantly pastoralist region.

2.23 Payment of transfers: In the first year of the PSNP there were considerable delays
with payments. Some of these were associated with the flow of funds from donors to
government, lack of capital equipment, limited availability of ETB notes in appropriate
denominations, and in some woredas payments were not made because public works
activities were either not completed or not reported. By June 2005, only 11 percent of
transfers were completed and the JRIS recommended that all payments should be made
irrespective of public works delays. In 2006 the timeliness of transfers was improved
significantly such that 53 percent of transfers had been made by June even with an increased
caseload of 7.2 million beneficiaries. (The target was to deliver 95% of transfers during the
calendar year). Late or unpredictable payment of transfers is not just a technical issue: it
seriously undermines the credible shift from emergency to productive safety net programs.
In the absence of some predictability of payment, beneficiaries are much less likely to make
investments in productive assets and activities using PSNP payments.

2.24 In 2006 many institutional bottlenecks were overcome. The ICR reports that
important recruitments were made at federal, regional and woreda level – for example the
addition of more accountants and cashiers to ensure smooth financial flows and timely
payments. Training in community-based watershed management was systematized to
improve the operation and subsequent value of public works. A retargeting exercise was
completed by CFSTFs and coverage was increased in some areas.

2.25 Political complications: The contested election results of 2005 and the violence that
followed led to problems with PSNP funding. Multi-annual support from some donors, the
Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) in particular, was delayed and new
financing modalities had to be sought.

Costs, Disbursements and Fiduciary Management
2.26 Because of a favorable movement in the SDR-dollar exchange rate, total World Bank
contributions to total program costs were US$72.1 million, slightly higher than the US$70
million value at appraisal (see Annex A). In 2006, US$43.7 million was transferred into the
PSNP from the IDA Emergency Demobilization and Reintegration Project to increase the
caseload from 5 to 7.2 million beneficiaries at project closing.
                                                               11


2.27      Disbursements followed the schedule relatively closely (Figure 3).

2.28 Financial management and procurement: Implementation bottlenecks included
problems with the timeliness of procurement, including capital equipment for public works;
inadequate training and guidance to the woreda level; too few staff to effectively carry out
the demands of such a large scale program; delays in disbursing to regions and woredas; and,
delays in reporting back on expenditures. Donors added a requirement for a revision to
financial arrangements for 2006 with subsequent transition costs and confusion. National
audit agency backlogs delayed the external audit in the first year. In its place, an alternative
audit raised concerns about specific incidents such as lack of approval of payrolls, purchase
of ineligible items but did not uncover any systematic mismanagement of funds. The
findings of the audit agency report resulted in an action plan implemented under APL2.

Monitoring & Evaluation
2.29 M&E for APL1 tracked the indicators shown in Table 1, each of which demonstrated
the level of progress towards the achievement of the PDO. The results are shown in Annex
Table A 1. For APL1 the focus was on output indicators. A baseline for monitoring and
evaluate outcome and impact indicators of the broader program was subsequently established
in 2006 (the final year of the project). Beyond monitoring of the project, the project
incorporated heavy investment in M&E of the PSNP itself. The range of reports and
information collected is depicted in Table 1.

2.30 M&E Design: The PAD explicitly notes the importance of M&E and the
establishment of a framework and includes this as an indicator for the project. Significant
investments were made in design, driven by concerns about implementation capacity, the fact
                                             12


that even before it began the PSNP was a flagship program for Africa, and the need to tackle
implementation problems as they emerged because no piloting or testing had been conducted.

2.31 Some but not all components of the M&E framework were part of the design. The
design was meant to be flexible and respond to problems and challenges as they emerged.
Specific M&E activities are used to address risks already identified–for example monitoring
of food prices and wage rate purchasing power–but there was additional space to address
emerging issues.

2.32 The early steps to assess and report on targeting were particularly important under
APL1. According to a targeting study, there was some evidence of political manipulation of
PSNP as it coincided with the 2005 legislative election campaign. In a few areas, the
targeting process appeared to have been used to punish known supporters of the opposition.
However, the study concluded that there was not significant evidence of systemic political
bias in targeting at that time (Sharp, Brown and Teshome 2006). Given capacity limitations
and the use of manual systems for some components of monitoring, it was not always
possible to employ the most rigorous methods for M&E. However, impact evaluation design
(for example see Gilligan and others 2009, Hoddinott 2008) did draw on a technical rigorous
methodology that incorporated a matching methods approach to assess whether hypotheses
about the potential impacts of cash predictable transfer programming in Africa could be
realized at scale even in a low income, low capacity setting. The evaluation included a
survey sampled from 3,700 households across four regions funded by the DCT.

2.33 M&E Implementation: The FSCB took responsibility for monitoring and evaluation
of both the implementation of the PSNP and assessments of its effectiveness and impact with
additional independent M&E undertaken through the multi-donor trust fund. Reporting is
within existing government systems and is frequently done manually though in subsequent
years investments have been made to computerize the M&E system. Innovations in
monitoring included the establishment of an Information Center within the FSCB which
collects real-time data from a sample of 81 woredas, a Rapid Response Mechanism which
provided assessment of implementation challenges at community level and support to resolve
them.

2.34 The Rapid Response Teams were instrumental during APL1 in identifying systemic
problems with implementation. Evaluations have included a regionally representative
household panel survey conducted every two years, evaluation of the impact of PSNP public
works, qualitative appraisals of targeting and the program linkages with the (Other Food
Security Programs (OFSP) and other mechanisms designed to support graduation. A
comprehensive listing of M&E activities and outputs is found in Table 2.

2.35 Design changes following recommendations from evaluation reports that demonstrate
the effective implementation and subsequent utilization of the M&E system include:

      Retargeting / additional coverage when rapid response teams found that the poorest
       households were not being targeted in some regions;
      The introduction of a cap on the number of days (20) that are worked by any
       individual;
      The unification of direct support and public works beneficiary lists to enable
       individuals and households to move between the two;
      Pregnant women and nursing mothers taken off public works and provided with direct
       support
      The alignment of the annual cycle PSNP planning and financial systems with woreda
       cycles to maximize the effective planning of public works and woreda level
       budgeting.

2.36 With the advantage of hindsight, it is clear that appropriate additions were made to
the initial M&E design and that there has been a high level of utilization of evidence. On this
basis overall M&E quality is rated as substantial. It is important to note that ensuring
adequate M&E has depended on additional resources from the multi-donor trust fund
arrangement.

3. Achievement of Objectives
APL1 Objective: Assist the Government to shift from a relief-oriented to a
productive and development-oriented safety net. Rating: Substantial
3.1     The principal objective of APL1 was to assist the Government to shift from a relief-
oriented to a productive and development-oriented safety net and this was accomplished.
Ten intermediate outcome indicators were used during APL1 and APL2 to assess progress.
(Since APL1 led into APL2, attribution to the first stage is impossible, however, the first
stage set the ground work for the second stage and thus contributed to the achievements.) Of
the objectives that were expected to be achieved over APL1 and APL2, namely a decrease in
the trend of chronic food insecurity, fewer distress sales and satisfaction with public works,
significant progress was made. Five of the indicators for APL 1 were exceeded, six were
partially / adequately achieved and two were not measurable due to delays with auditing.
Annex Table A1 lists the achievement of the outcome and output indicators of the project
and the progress on institutional reform and strengthening. Across the four regions in which
the PSNP was implemented, satisfaction with public works ranged from 53-76 percent on
roads projects, 29-69 percent of water projects and 22-67 percent of soil conservation
projects. Evidence from subsequent evaluations demonstrates increasing satisfaction with
public works. In 2006, the target of 75 percent of program participants reporting no distress
of assets to meet food needs was 96 percent achieved.

3.2    Under APL1, 7.2 million people were moved out of emergency relief and into a more
predictable safety net program. The PAD estimated 5,140,000 beneficiaries. By project
closing in 2006 the PSNP had delivered transfers equivalent to half a daily grain ration to 7.2
                                                            16


million people who had previously been under emergency programming. The increase in
number of beneficiaries was responding to a more realistic estimate of the chronically food
insecure population and it was possible as more donors committed multi-annual resources to
the PSNP. In the case of the World Bank, funds were transferred from an existing
emergency project and channeled into multi-annual, multi-donor funding arrangements.

3.3     Recipient households lacked timely transfers which significantly undermined
predictability under APL1. Transfers were design to be delivered monthly between January
and June. However, the project ICR recognized that by June 2005, only 11 percent of
transfers had been received by beneficiaries although monitoring, in particular the JRIS
missions and Rapid Response Teams (RRTs) led to early identification of bottlenecks in the
payment system that were then addressed swiftly (World Bank 2010: 68, Table 4).
Timeliness was improved in 2006 as 53% of transfers were completed by June.

3.4     A study on the trends in PSNP transfers provided an analysis of cash payments made
to PSNP beneficiaries. As the study did not included food payments, it is only a partial
analysis. Figure 4 showing average hours worked and paid for in cash demonstrates that
there is a problem with late and erratic payment. Time worked never fell below 14 hours or
above 26 hours per month during 2005, but participants were paid for as much as 36 hours in
one month (in August, making up for under-remuneration in 4 of the previous 5 months),
while zero payments were made in 2 months November and December (Devereux, Sabates-
Wheeler and Tefera 2006). As one of the means to achieve the APL1 objective was to
provide predictable multiannual resources to households the lack of timely transfers
significantly undermined predictability under APL1

3.5     Despite some initial problems with targeting that were addressed rapidly under APL1
(see Implementation, above), targeting of the PSNP has been satisfactory. Another relevant
goal of the project was to ensure that transfers reach the identified beneficiaries. PSNP
beneficiary households had lower income and assets than non-beneficiaries (Table 4). On
average, beneficiary households had less land although the difference between public works
beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries was negligible (Table 4). Direct support beneficiaries
were well-targeted although some pregnant women were found among the public works
beneficiaries. The targeting study carried out in mid-2006 by ODI found that 88% of
beneficiaries and 70% of non-beneficiaries reported experiencing three or more months of
food shortage in the preceding year (Sharp, Brown and Teshome). Moreover, 89% of all
sampled households reported some food shortage, underlining the prevalence of food
insecurity (Sharp, Brown and Teshome 2006) and that this was consistent with required
process towards targeting indicators.

3.6      Problems with targeting were identified early and led to retargeting exercises and
improved support and guidelines at woreda and community level. Both the Targeting Study
and the Linkages Study identified the issue of partial family targeting in 2006. Despite
government commitments to ensuring full family targeting, the adequacy of PSNP coverage
in a number of woredas compared to the number of food insecure households means that
partial family targeting continues. The problem is likely to worsen due to population growth.
Partial family targeting undermines the outcomes of the PSNP by reducing the effective per
capita transfer within selected households and by limiting the extent to which the PSNP
guarantees consumption and thereby gives households the confidence to invest in productive
assets or take loans to increase their production and income. There is no existing evidence to
suggest that, when partial family targeting occurs, the benefits reach men / boys in the
household rather than women / girls.

3.7     Another concern regarding politization of the program (access to the PSNP depends
on allegiance to the ruling political party) has been repeatedly raised, most recently by
Human Rights Watch (2010). The available evidence on the political nature of targeting is
usually drawn from qualitative research at community level and there is no representative
assessment that allows an understanding of how widespread or pervasive any biases are. At a
regional level, the four regions that have historically received an overwhelming share of
humanitarian aid correspond closely to those receiving a higher proportion of government
support. However, assessments of targeting of transfers in Ethiopia have rarely combined
assessments of targeting with assessments of effectiveness. Clay, Molla and Habtewold
(1999) and Jayne and others (2001) questioned targeting of food aid but did not assess the
impact of targeting on overall food security. More recently, Gilligan and others (2009)
assess the efficacy of targeting in PSNP regions but not all regions. Despite potential bias
towards certain regions and against others, Figure 5 shows that, across PSNP regions, PSNP
targeting is progressive: those in the lower deciles of the poverty distribution receive a
greater proportional share of benefits. Drawing on the CGH (Coady-Grosh-Hoddinott)
method which measures the share of program benefits accruing to the bottom decile or

 Note: non-PSNP households in table are not meant to be a control group. The methodology for the targeting
evaluation was based on a non-representative sample of woredas and households therein. The targeting
evaluation took place early in the lifetime of the PSNP and was meant to identify any significant targeting
problems. The 2006 baseline was subsequently established with control groups.

quintile, Gilligan and others (2010) find that, with CGH Indices of 1.69 (bottom decile) and
1.46 (bottom quintile) the PSNP is better targeted than any of the African safety net programs
assessed in Coady, Grosh and Hoddinott (2004)7 and is well above the global average of
1.25.

Consumption Decile

3.8      There are, however, regional disparities: Targeting is, by international standards,
considerably above average in Tigray and Oromiya, slightly below average but still
progressive in Amhara, and poor in SNNPR (Gilligan and others 2010: 17-18). At regional
level, the PSNP remains geographically targeted in four regions only (with some limited
progress extending to pastoral regions). No systematic ethnic or political biases were
identified in targeting and on a woreda by woreda basis. However, there are lingering
questions about political bias in PSNP targeting and similar concerns about programs in other
sectors. For example, Human Rights Watch (2010) suggest that bias is not limited to the
PSNP but to other programs in basic services, agriculture and micro-finance. It appears
appropriate to address the issue of political bias as a cross-sectoral issue rather than one that
is specifically associated with safety nets.

 Mozambique‘s GAPVU cash transfer has an CGH index of 1.05, subsidies in South Africa range from 1.23 to
0.28 and the social fund in Zambia reaches 1.08 (Coady, Grosh and Hoddinott 2004)
8
  The figure shows the proportion of households in each predicted decile that receive PSNP transfers. For this
measure, the PSNP is considered progressive if the proportion of households selected exceeds the size of the
decile (so for example, the program is progressive if the proportion of the households receiving PSNP benefits
in the poorest quintile exceeds 20 percent).
                                                                20


3.9     During the project, grievance procedures were formalized to enable households to
challenge targeting. Drawing on the 2008 survey, Gilligan and others (2010) found that
nearly 70 percent of households in PSNP woredas report that they were well-informed about
how the PSNP worked but that less than half thought that the selection process was fair and
only a third were given the opportunity to comment on the selection process (in 2006 and
2008).

3.10 Outcomes on replacing food with grants were undermined by changing food prices.
The logic for the setting of cash and food payments was based on the provision of a share (50
percent) of the cereals component of the WFP daily food ration over a period of six months.
Wage rates were then calculated based on an assessment of cereals prices. In the context of
under-coverage, contingency funds were regularly used to increase caseload and so were not
available to increase cash payments in areas where food prices increased. Despite the PSNP
delivering a much higher proportion of transfers in cash than initially envisaged at appraisal
(Table 6), changing food prices (particularly but not only during APL2) resulted in a
significant change in preferences for food and cash which undermined progress in the shift
from food to cash transfers (Figure 6). Assessing early progress with the PSNP in 2005
Kebede (2006) found that shifting from food to cash transfers affected the availability and
price of food in local markets, especially in remote, food deficit areas.

3.11 Despite the problems mentioned above, APL1 has contributed to the achievement of
the broader objectives of the APL series. As the first in a series of APLs, the contribution of
APL1 is measurable mainly in terms of outputs: it established the required systems that set
Ethiopia on a trajectory towards achieving the objectives of the APL series. Evidence on
outcomes following APL1 project closing are based on impact evaluations and reviews in
2008 that draw on baselines and evidence from 2006. The impact evaluations estimate
impacts of the programs using nearest neighbor matching (NNM) - a form of covariate
matching in which the comparison group sample of non-beneficiaries is selected based on
similarity to the beneficiary sample in observable characteristics. The impacts in 2008 are
the result of transfers in 2007 and 2008 under APL2, and of the progress made under APL1
in 2005 and 2006. This is particularly the case for the impacts of public works where some
benefits emerge over years rather than months. Positive outcomes are as follows:APL1
helped set up a system which increases food security. Households perceived themselves to be
better off in terms of food security in 2008 than in 2006. This effect was strongest among
those households that received regular, high value transfers and among households affected
by drought. PSNP households exposed to drought had a 30 percent higher caloric acquisition
growth than non-beneficiaries (p. 27).Evidence from the impact evaluation in 2008 reported
in World Bank (2010) indicates that PSNP participation measurably improved household
food security, as measured by changes in self-reported household food gap. Additionally,
growth in caloric acquisition was 17 percent higher for PSNP households that received recent
and regular transfers. These indications are further supported by 2008 evidence that PSNP
households receiving cash used 84 percent of their transfer to purchase staple food and 74
percent of households receiving food consumed the entire transfer.

3.12 The caveat to these findings is that the effect on household food security is far greater
when households received their transfers on a regular predictable basis. The PSNP
demonstrably provides an effective safety net when households face shocks such as drought
or food price increases but its efficacy is undermined when payments are not made in a
timely manner.

3.13 A survey9 carried out in 2006 and 2008 on the impact of PSNP on food security,
assets and incentives found that the PSNP has modest average impacts, improving food
security, increasing growth in livestock holdings and improving households‘ ability to raise
funds in an emergency. Program impacts on asset accumulation are greater when higher
levels of transfers are received and when participants have access to the PSNP and
complementary agricultural services10 (Gilligan et al. 2009).

 This analysis is based on longitudinal quantitative survey data collected at the household and locality levels.
These data were collected in the four major regions covered by the PSNP: Tigray, Amhara, Oromiya and
Southern Nations, Nationalities, and People‘s Region (SNNPR). The first survey was implemented in June-
August 2006 with the bulk of the interviewing conducted in July. The follow-up survey was implemented in
June and early July 2008 so differences between rounds due to seasonality considerations should not be large.
10
   The PSNP is complemented by a series of food security activities, collectively referred to as the Other Food
Security Programs (OFSP). Beneficiaries of the OFSP receive at least one of several productivity enhancing
transfers or services, including access to credit, agricultural extension services, technology transfer (such as
advice on food crop production, cash cropping, livestock production, and soil and water conservation), and
irrigation and water harvesting schemes. While the PSNP is designed to protect existing assets and ensure a
                                                   22


3.14 The PSNP is contributing towards a downward trend in the population in need of
food aid. Figure 7 shows a clear downward trend in numbers of people in need of food aid
following the introduction of the program in 2005. The food price crisis of 2008 interrupted
the downward trend as many more people became food insecure and it remains to be seen
how long it will take to recover from the 2008 spike.

APL Series Objective
3.15 The APL Series Objective is as follows: improved food security for at least 5
million chronically food insecure people and stabilizing the long term trend of
increasing numbers of food insecure people.

3.16 The PSNP has protected human consumption and household assets during shocks.
The PSNP contains a contingency fund equivalent to 20 percent of the base program cost
which is designed to respond to transitory needs during shocks or crises. Impact evaluations
in 2008 took place in the immediate aftermath of a significant drought in PSNP woredas in
Oromiya and SNNPR and in the context of the food price crisis. The evaluations show that
PSNP beneficiaries fared better than non-PSNP beneficiaries in the same woredas and
kebeles. On average non-beneficiaries had more livestock but lost livestock units between
2007 and 2008 whilst average livestock units among beneficiary households although fewer
had remained constant (Figure 9).

3.17 There are also important impacts on human capital. In 2007/08 there was a
significant increase in negative coping strategies among non-beneficiary households but only
a small increase in beneficiary households. For example, the joint assessment report by IDS,
ODI and IDL found that the proportion of PSNP beneficiary households who ate smaller
portions sizes to cope with food shortages was high in 2005/06 at 76 percent but increased
only fractionally to 78 percent in 2007-08 (Devereux, Sabates-Wheeler and Tefera 2006).
Among non-beneficiary households the increase was far greater: from 59 percent to 72
percent over the same time period. The proportion of beneficiaries that reduced the number
of meals they ate each day increased from 70 percent in 2005-06 to 72 percent in 2007-08
whilst among non-beneficiaries the proportions changed from 56 percent to 65 percent over
the same period. There is strong anthropometrical evidence that food aid in Ethiopia has
prevented irreversible effects of reduced consumption – such as child growth (Yamano,
Alderman and Christiaensen 2005; Quisumbing 2003). In the case of the PSNP, the evidence
cited suggesting that the PSNP prevents irreversible effects of reduced consumption refers to
consumption outcomes rather than measurable indicators such as height for age. However,
there are good reasons to presume that the impact of the PSNP will be similar to food aid in
this regard.




minimum level of food consumption, the OFSP is designed to encourage households to increase incomes
generated from agricultural activities and to build up assets (Guiligan et all 2009).

3.18 The PSNP contributed to improvements to household asset portfolios. Beneficiaries
used income from cash transfers to invest in both farming inputs and livestock. Households
participating in public works increased their livestock holdings by 0.28 Tropical Livestock
Units (TLUs) (Gilligan and others 2009). This is equivalent to approximately three sheep.
Ramakrishna and Demeke (2002) calculate that the impact of this increase on food security is
about 7 percent.

3.19 Public works created valuable community assets. At the time of the ICR for APL1, it
was not possible for impacts of public works programs to be assessed. By 2008, some
impacts were emerging. The Public Works Assessment found that public works did result in

beneficiaries based on observable household and community characteristics

environmental regeneration, increased access to water supply, expanded use of small-scale
irrigation, access to farmer training centers and major time savings from roads investments.
In sample kebeles respondents reported:

        increases in water table and vegetation cover leading to increased supply of livestock
         feed, bee forage and medicinal plants;
        a doubling of domestic water supplies and increased consumption of water and
         shorter travelling distances to water supplies;
        the development of small-scale irrigation in half the sampled community watersheds
         with a subsequent expansion in livestock for 4-12 percent of households;
        two-thirds of farmers attending training programs in farmer training centers and one
         third of farmers applying techniques on their own land; and

3.20     The PSNP has promoted human capital investments in health and education.

3.21 Although human capital was not a specific objective of the PSNP or of APL1, there is
evidence in PSNP beneficiary households and communities of improved access to and
utilization of health and education services although most of it is self-reported and could be
attributable to programs other than the PSNP (including the Protecting Basic Services Project
which is funded by the World Bank and other donors).12 In terms of supply-side outputs that
affect human development outcomes, the PSNP has constructed 330 and rehabilitated 3,391
schools. Assuming about 400 pupils per school a tentative estimate is made that 810,200
additional pupils now have classrooms. This equates to approximately 7 percent of pupils in
class 1-8 (MA Consulting 2009). PSNP public works constructed 925 health posts (about 10
percent of the national total) between 2005 and 2008 and these cover approximately one
million rural people (MA Consulting 2009a, 2009b). The outcome of these investments was
a decrease between 2004 and 2008 in the average distance to school for children in
beneficiary households from 5.6 km to 3.0 km and in average distance to health facilities
from 5.4 km to 4.6 km with commensurate savings in the time and cost of travel.

productive and development-
oriented safety net
a   Please see the discussion in the text below for a justification of how the overall ratings were derived


RELEVANCE

4.2     Relevance of objectives. The objectives of APL1 were wholly consistent with the
government‘s objectives for safety nets as articulated in Plan for Accelerated and Sustained
Development to End Poverty (GFDRE 2005) and the PSNP Program Implementation Manual
(GFDRE 2004). APL1 objectives were also based on strong poverty analysis and analytical
work (World Bank 2003, World Bank 2005) and an effective process of dialogue and
discussion between government, development partners and NGOs about the need to reform
the existing, increasingly unsustainable system of annual emergency humanitarian appeals.
The emphasis on moving from relief to a more productive and development-oriented safety
net also aligned the project with wider World Bank objectives. APL1 was well aligned with
the 2003-2005 CAS which highlighted enhancing pro-poor growth and human development
outcomes and reducing vulnerability. APL1 was less aligned with the Interim Country
Assistance Strategy 2006-2007 that sought to redirect Bank investments in programs
disrupted following the elections. Carefully planning for the APL1 meant it was not
disrupted and, given the prevailing context (high levels of poverty and hunger and an
increasingly unsustainable emergency system), shared agreement on the need for reform and
emphasis on moving towards a more productive safety net in line with World Bank growth
objectives, the relevance of project objectives is rated high.

4.3     Relevance of design. Reforming the existing system of humanitarian appeals for food
aid was a radical and risky activity. The project was pragmatic and realistic in its approach
to reform and this is reflected in the design. The World Bank did not try and completely
overturn the existing system by establishing entirely new institutions, responsibilities and
approaches. Rather it maintained parts of the imperfect existing arrangements and
mechanisms where these would enable the shift from ad hoc emergency appeals to a more
predictable and productive safety net systems. Examples of this approach include: a)
maintaining the focus on rural poverty and hunger rather than introducing new vulnerable
groups such as the urban poor; b) working within existing government systems – the FSCB
rather than switching to others such as the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs (MOLSA); c)
using existing skills and experiences–for example using a similar community targeting
mechanism to that used in the emergency EGS; and continuing with food transfers rather
than switching immediately to cash in low capacity woredas. In order to address the country
reality of large scale seasonal hunger among able bodied poor people and those unable to
work, the safety net design included both public works program and direct transfer support.
Given that both food and cash distribution were important at different times in different
areas, the project design allowed for these differences and included careful monitoring of
                                                      27


prices and wage rate purchasing power and levels of benefit / wages. Further, given the scale
of the project, the Bank encouraged the design of a quality M&E system to enable tracking of
performance and modification of design along the way. Relevance of design is rated as
substantial.

EFFICACY

4.4     Efficacy is rated substantial. The achievement of the APL 1 objective is measured
against a set of indicators that demonstrated how successful the transition away from ad hoc
annual appeals for emergency food aid towards a more predictably resourced, multi-annual
safety net system has been. Prior to 2005, responses to food insecurity in Ethiopia depended
on ad hoc emergency appeals for food aid, despite the fact that a significant proportion of
hunger was predictable. Despite the initial problems with the time of the payments that were
addressed, the PSNP provided predictable, multi-annual resourcing within a program that
focused on the creation of assets at both household and community level. There was
progress towards decreasing the upward trend in food insecurity in 2005 and 2006 (see
Figure 6) although progress was thwarted by the 2008 food price shock and a caseload of 7+
million remains in the PSNP in 2010.

EFFICIENCY

4.5     The counterfactual for purposes of assessing cost-effectiveness of the PSNP is the
cost and efficacy of emergency appeals for food aid. As described in Section 1, under the
emergency system total spending on transfers to the poor in Ethiopia amounted to US$265
million per annum on average between 1997 and 2002 - US$4 per capita or US$40 per
beneficiary. The system was criticized for being ineffective (in the sense that it saved lives
but not livelihoods and food aid was often delivered later than needed), unaccountable and
non-transparent.

4.6     Administrative costs are largely covered by the government and are not measured in
the donor budgets but approximately 17.2 percent of total program cost is dedicated to staff
time, administrative costs and capacity building. No more than 80 percent of the budget is
allocated to transfers with the remainder of the budget allocated to administration, staff and
capital requirements for public works project.

4.7     The PSNP is efficient compared to international experience on public works
programs in terms of targeting, high wage intensity, and low administrative costs due to use
of existing government systems and economies of scale given the size of the program. The
ICR reports that the cost effectiveness of the wage transfer is 0.55 (compared to 0.20 for
Argentina‘s Trabalhar Program), so it costs US$1.88 to transfer $1 in net wage benefit to a
food insecure person through the PSNP.13 Cost effectiveness of the infrastructure benefit is
0.47, so it costs $2.13 to transfer 1$ of infrastructure benefit to poor communities. Estimates
13
  Grosh and others (2009: 305) explain that implementing public works program can be expensive because in
addition to the cost of wages and program delivery, projects have to be designed, managed, supervised, and
provided with physical inputs. Ravallion (1999a) goes on to illustrate that transferring US$1 of income to the
poor via public works program in typical middle- and low income countries costs US$5 and US$3.60
respectively.

from 2008 suggest that the switch from an all food program to a cash/food program saves
almost US$11 million each year (World Bank 2010) through efficiency gains in program
implementation.

4.8     Based on the demonstrated achievement of objectives of the project; and the
increased efficiency and efficacy of the PSNP compared to its predecessor, efficiency is rated
as substantial. Continued investments in administrative and financial management systems
should improve efficiency further.

Risk to Development Outcome
4.9     Despite improvements in project design and implementation since project initiation,
the risk to development outcome remains significant. This assessment is based on
concerns regarding medium term financing, and political support of both government and
donors for several reasons.

4.10 On one hand, there is widespread popular, government and donor support for the
program and it remains Africa‘s flagship safety net program. Financial resources are
committed until 2014 when it is anticipated that a revised safety net will emerge and the
safety net is included in MTEFs and long-term budget projections. Capacity building has
been substantial. The government‘s contribution to PSNP has increased roughly 10-fold in
five years which is certainly a positive sign of commitment (Table 7). Government financing
remains a small portion of the total PSNP costs and is focused specifically on administrative
costs (mainly salaries) rather than financing the cash transfers to households. The
government does finance the lion‘s share of the broader Food Security Program, of which
PSNP is a component. Government commitment to the PSNP was (and continues to be)
dependent on unrealistic graduation objectives. Operations documents of donors, including
the World Bank, recognized that prospects for widespread graduation are limited but
government targets remained unchanged.

Notes on calculations: (i) CIDA contribution includes financing allocated to APL 1 that was disbursed during the APL 2 period. This was
recorded in the PSNP APL I ICR as financing to APL I. However, because MOFED records include it as a source of funds to APL 2, it is
included here as a source of financing and attributed as expenditure; (ii) the Government allocation to APL 1 was in cash; that for APL 2
and 3 is in-kind; (iii) For APL 1 + 2 Actual, food contributions to the PSNP have been valued at the prevailing market rate per year; (iv)
The USAID contribution to the PSNP is allocated through NGOs and WFP; (v) No carry-over balance from APL 1 to APL 2 is shown here
because MOFED attributed expenditure to all APL 1 financing; (vi) actual financing to APL 2 includes monies allocated to the Multi-Donor
Trust Fund managed by the World Bank. Those for APL 1 and 2 do not; (vii) Financing to APL 3 is for PSNP ONLY and thus does not
include financing to HABP.

4.11 The relationship between donors and government in regard to the PSNP is a strong,
coordinated and open one. However, in 2005, election results in Ethiopia were contested and
the violence broke out in various parts of the country resulted in a number of donors ceasing
budget support to Ethiopia. The PSNP funding modality had been designed to avoid such a
situation but donor willingness to fund the PSNP is still influenced in part by government
behavior and loss of donor confidence remains a significant risk to development outcomes in
the PSNP.

4.12 Claims that political affiliations influence access to the PSNP were made throughout
the lifetime of the project. The Bank has encouraged government to put numerous
safeguards in place, for example monitoring systems and independent evaluations. Although
these evaluations did not identify any systematic exclusion of people from the safety net in
2005 or 2006 on the basis of politics or ethnicity, the claims have not receded. Current data
and evidence are insufficient to document bias one way or the other.
                                             30


4.13 The issue of partial family targeting is a vexing one in the context of Ethiopia‘s rapid
population growth. Ethiopia has the ninth fastest growing population in the world with an
annual increase of more than three percent. Given the importance attached to household
graduation and reversing the trend in chronic food insecurity, population growth is likely to
undermine progress towards achieving the goals of the PSNP and may undermine
government and donor support for the program. This is especially true where particular
donors, such as the Bank, place a significant emphasis on growth (IEGPS 2008).

Bank Performance
4.14 Bank performance is rated satisfactory. Despite some initial weaknesses associated
with quality at entry, the overall performance is considered satisfactory. Moreover, the
quality of support to implementation ensured that many of the weaknesses were overcome.

QUALITY AT ENTRY

4.15 The Quality at Entry of the project was satisfactory. The project was based on a
strong analytical work regarding poverty and vulnerability (World Bank 2005) and
government/partners agreement on the need to move away from the emergency appeal
‗merry-go-round‘ (World Bank 2003). Whilst the need to transition away from emergency
appeals to a more predictable and productive safety net was increasingly recognized over a
number of years the drought and associated upturn in the emergency caseload in 2002-03
pushed the issue rapidly up the agenda. Donors and governments agreed in 2004 to transition
to a new system in 2005 but the switch from discussing options for a productive safety net to
actually designing one happened very quickly and many donors, including the World Bank
moved at a speed quicker than they would have liked given the speed at which the
government wanted to move forward.

4.16 The World Bank was carrying out relevant analytical work and this contributed to
design (for example World Bank 2005). Capacity assessments in June 2004 identified a
range of shortfalls that could severely limit the effective implementation of the program.
Donors, the World Bank included, had initially argued for a pilot or testing phase for the
project. Yet, many of them had also made it clear that they would not respond to a
humanitarian appeal in 2005. Recognition that piloting would leave up to 5 million
chronically food insecure Ethiopians without any form of support encouraged program
supporters to move ahead without piloting, despite known deficiencies at the start of the
program. Although this was the first major project in a low income setting where an attempt
to switch from food to cash had been made at scale, the World Bank had enough experience
to be familiar with the operational requirements of a cash-based public works program. It
drew on expertise and design support from Washington and then ensured that various
safeguards were put in place, including Rapid Response Teams and various monitoring and
evaluation activities, so that implementation bottlenecks could be identified and swiftly
addressed once the program began. This served a critical role in the implementation of the
program as early problems were detected (e.g. with payment systems and targeting) and
modifications were made along the way.
                                             31


QUALITY AT SUPERVISION

4.17 Bank supervision was highly satisfactory. The Bank played a major role in
strengthening implementation capacity and systems at federal, regional, woreda and
community level in order to support the delivery of the PSNP.

4.18 Many of weaknesses were cleared up during the first years of implementation. This
was facilitated by the safeguards put in place (RRTs) and through the regular assessment of
progress and problems through the World Bank co-ordinated JRIS missions. It is widely
acknowledged that the commitment and energy of Bank staff in the quarterly JRIS missions
was critical in maintaining momentum and prevent donors and government from being
paralyzed by the immediate implementation problems. At the same time is also
acknowledged that the attention to detail maintained by Bank staff meant that changes to
implementation arrangements and other design features were not rushed through but
subjected to careful technical assessment.

4.19 To ensure that regular, in-country support to government was maintained and that the
progress was not solely dependent on international Bank staff and other experts being flown
in, the World Bank provided space in the Ethiopia office to house the DCT. This provided a
coordinating function for donor inputs into the PSNP and provided another mechanism by
which the momentum of improvement was maintained. This also enabled the Bank to take a
coordinated implementation support approach rather than a narrow supervision approach.

4.20   Improvements at implementation stage supported or driven by the Bank included:

      Setting up systems to track unintended effects (e.g. impacts on prices in local food
       markets);
      Getting early evaluative evidence on targeting, public works and institutional linkages
       between the PSNP and the Other Food Security Programs (OFSP);
      Fiduciary and safeguard aspects including incorporating the country office
       procurement specialist in the PSNP procurement working group to review
       procurement performance and give timely feedback;
      Participation of donors, including the Bank, in the RRTs
      Ensuring the basis for robust impact evaluation through the establishment of a
       baseline;

4.21 All of these changes subsequently fed into the design for PSNP Phase 2 (APL3 for
the World Bank) (GFDRE 2009, World Bank 2009) and other linked programs including the
Household Asset Building (HAB) Program. Many of evidence gathering and analysis that
led to these improvements were supported via the multi-donor trust fund arrangements rather
than the funding to government. The lesson is that putting safeguards in place requires
additional investments but they are critical for program success.
                                                32




Borrower Performance
4.22   Borrower performance is rated moderately satisfactory.

PERFORMANCE OF THE GOVERNMENT

4.23 Overall, government performance is rated satisfactory. The government took a bold
and risky step in deciding to transition away from the emergency appeal system.

4.24 Ownership of the PSNP was high and there was very strong commitment to the PSNP
as part of the wider food security program. The government committed only a small
proportion of funding for transfers to the PSNP (US$100,000 in 2005 and in 2006). It made
the bulk of its contribution in the form of administration and staff provisions have been very
high. For example, in 2006, the government provided budget for additional investments in
staffing, training and technical assistance. At woreda level alone, more than one thousand
contract staff were appointed, mainly as cashiers and accountants to overcome bottlenecks in
the payments system.

4.25 The government has also contributed to other linked activities – such as the OFSP.
Its contributions to the PSNP are growing - since the end of APL1 the government
contribution has increased 20-fold to US$2 million a year from 2010-2015.

4.26 In terms of coordination, the government has worked closely with development
partners to improve program performance and there are high levels of representation from
within government in decision-making and program fora. The State Minister for Disaster
Management and Food Security chairs the JCC which is the primary decision-making body
for the PSNP. Weaknesses in the PSNP identified during APL1 were promptly and
appropriately addressed. Examples include the alignment of the PSNP planning and budget
cycle with woredas to ensure improved public works planning and more timely payments
and the reallocation of roles and responsibilities at federal and woredas levels to improve
performance. Targeting remains an issue, in particular, the extent to which government is
addressing concerns about PSNP access being linked to political affiliation.

PERFORMANCE OF THE IMPLEMENTING AGENCY

4.27 The performance of the implementing agency– the Food Security Coordination
Bureau in the Ministry of Agricultural and Rural Development–was moderately satisfactory.

4.28 This was the first time that a cash transfer program had been implemented at scale
through the FSCB and the immediate capacity of the bureau and implementing partners at
regional and woreda level was not adequate as the project started. The bureau lacked a
computerized system for monitoring and evaluation and initially overestimated the capacity
of local staff and was reluctant to carry out training and contract additional staff. In spite of
this, the FSCB did manage to establish and deliver cash transfers to more than 5 million
                                              33


people in its first year and avoid a major humanitarian crisis. Furthermore, significant
learning from the APL1 period has fed into improvements from 2007 onwards.

5. Conclusions and Lessons
5.1     This PPAR has reviewed the World Bank‘s Adaptable Program Loan 1 in support of
the Ethiopia Productive Safety Net Program. The project was classified under the social
safety net theme in the Bank and focused on support government in moving from annual
emergency appeals to tackle food insecurity to a more productive and developmental safety
net.

5.2    The PSNP has formed the backbone of safety net activities in Ethiopia. Despite the
problems associated with implementation in 2005 and 2006 there is strong evidence that the
lessons from the APL1 period have been critical in enabling improvements to be made to the
PSNP and to linked programs such as the Household Asset Building Program (formerly
OFSP). World Bank lending on safety nets has focused on the PSNP and the transition away
from emergency appeals but there is now increasing acceptance of the need to continue
providing safety net support to those who have no prospect of graduating from the PSNP. A
dialogue has emerged recently on what sorts of programming might achieve this. Such a
dialogue would not have been possible in 2005 at the start of APL1.

5.3     Above all, the PSNP demonstrates what can be achieved in a low income country
with limited capacity and high levels of poverty. This PPAR generates lessons about how to
support governments in moving from annual emergency appeals to tackle food insecurity to a
more productive and developmental safety net. In addition, the following lessons can be
derived from this Ethiopia PPAR:

      Donor coordination can be critical for improving fiscal and institutional capacity of
       governments and efficiency and effectiveness of social safety nets. Commitments of
       technical and financial support from donors are most effective when donors align
       around a common framework and principles for engaging with government.
      The role of social safety nets in a particular country context evolves over time as SSN
       institutions are created and the capacity to identify different subgroups of poor and
       vulnerable households expands. Whereas initially the PSNP was designed to address
       regular shocks in rural areas leading to annual emergency food appeals, the dialogue
       has evolved towards programming options to address two different types of poor,
       rural households: those with longer term potential to graduate out of poverty and
       those who face chronic challenges.
      Community based targeting, with the right guidelines, can be used to target resources
       to the poorest households in rural communities even in countries with very high
       levels of poverty. Where poverty is generalized across a large proportion of the
       population and resources are limited, absolute criteria (for example size of food gap)
       are insufficient and ranking is important. Targeting of the PSNP was geographically
       based to identify the regions, provinces and woredas most sensitive to food shortages;
       however, below the level of the woreda, community mechanisms were used to rank
       households and identify the poorest ones to receive assistance. Utilizing community
                                              34


       based targeting required considerable work including revisions of targeting
       guidelines, training, establishment of grievance procedures and effective monitoring
       and evaluation. IE evidence indicated that these households were indeed among the
       poorest and this system of community based targeting has worked increasingly well.
      Contingency funds serve a critical role enabling government to scale up safety nets–
       both in terms of transfer size and coverage– to address transitory shocks, even in low
       income countries.
      Both cash and food transfers can be appropriate depending on specific circumstances,
       such as the level of seasonal variability in food prices, and it is important to be
       pragmatic about what mix of transfer types is best. Whatever transfer type,
       predictability is critical. Achieving timely transfers in low income settings is possible
       but requires investments in capacity building and continuous monitoring.
      Monitoring and evaluation—and the feedback loop back into program design or
       capacity building efforts—are essential for implementing a safety net program in a
       very low capacity. The PSNP did not have the advantage of starting off as a pilot and
       expanding later based on lessons. Rather, the program was initiated on a national
       scale, monitored and evaluated as it went forward, and changes were made along the
       way as lessons were learned

5.4     The experience of the PSNP also suggests that a recalibration of indicators commonly
used to assess the effective of safety nets lending and programming is required. In particular,
assessments of sustainability that depend on interrogating whether or not governments begin
to fund programs themselves and on whether households are graduating from programs may
be appropriate in some contexts but are inappropriate in low income countries. Where
poverty and food insecurity are generalized across a large proportion of the population and
where humanitarian responses and emergency appeals are the norm rather than the exception,
an appropriate view of sustainability might be more useful if it focused on: i) whether
programs receive broad-based support among government and all development partners; ii)
whether safety net programs are embedded in long term development visions (such as
PRSPs); iii) whether there is recognition that graduation is a long term goal requiring long
term resources; and iv) there will always be a portion of the population that depends on
safety nets.
