1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Until 2006, Senegal’s economic growth had been satisfactory with an annual Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) growth rate of around five percent since 1995. Domestic shocks of locust invasion
and poor rains had also been overcome. In fact, over the duration of Phase I of the PRN (2002-
2006) Senegal witnessed improvements in household income levels and there were considerable
progress on several MDG targets (1c, 4 and 5). The latest household survey indicated that the share
of the population living in poverty decreased from 67.9 percent in 1994 (61.4% of households) to
57.1 percent in 2001 (48.5% of households). Yet, Senegal remained a poor country with a GNI per
capita of US$710 in 2005, and social indicators which continued to be a cause of concern. Senegal
was ranked 157 out of 177 on the 2003 Human Development Index, barely up from where it was
in 1992 when it occupied the rank of 152 out of 174.

From the local communities to the central levels of Government, there were signs of positive
developments. Stagnating malnutrition rates had been turned around since the initiation of PRN
Phase 1. A steep decrease in the proportion of malnourished children under three years old was
documented in the intervention areas from 27 percent in early 2004 to about 10 percent by late
2005. A community nutrition platform had been developed, which was well-adjusted to the local
circumstances in selected regions with high levels of malnutrition. Stunting levels had decreased
substantially from 30 percent in 2000 to 20 percent in 2006. In the National Nutrition Development
Policy of 2001, and later updated in 2006, the national goals on nutrition had been clearly presented
and the PRN provided the implementation framework of the policy. The Bank’s support to Phase
I was rated “highly satisfactory” in the ICR of 2007.

The focus during project preparations of PRN2 was therefore to build on Phase I’s achieved results
by supporting the scaling up of program-reach to all the Regions and Districts. In doing so, the
design of PRN2 took advantage of: (i) the experience with the nutrition related community-based
behavior change communication: (ii) the capacity improvements within the implementing agency,
the Coordination Unit for the Fight against Malnutrition (CLM); and (iii) the established rapport
with local, national and international development partners.

The Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP; 2006) informed the strategic decisions made in the
design of the PRN2. In the PRSP the reduction of malnutrition was identified as essential to
achieving the MDG 1c to halve between 1990 and 2015 the proportion of people who suffer from
hunger. Improving access to social services, as highlighted in the Country Assistance Strategy
(2003), was of outmost importance. Based on the results of Phase I and the planned scale up to
new regions in Phase II, this Millennium Development Goal (MDG) was assessed to be within
reach.

The PRN was originally conceptualized as an Adaptable Program Loan (APL) in three phases,
which at the closing of Phase I was reduced to two phases: Phase I (2002-2006) for the
development of the implementation framework for the program in three Regions and Phase II
(2007-2012) for the national scale up. Phase III, as originally planned, is intended for consolidation

                                                  1
of nutrition as a development issue in Senegal was envisioned to be financed through other types
of support such as budget support or Sector-Wide Approaches (SWAp). Most importantly,
nutrition in Senegal was increasingly conceptualized among all partners involved not only as a
public health matter but as a development issue.

The population of Senegal was reported at approximately 11 million in 2006. Around 5 million
were living in rural areas and the remaining 6 million in urban areas. During the preceding decade,
the annual average population growth rate was 2.4 %. The population is unevenly distributed. The
highest population density is in the Western and Central regions, which includes the capital Dakar,
while the Eastern and Northern regions are more sparsely populated.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

As presented in the Project Appraisal Document (2006) the project development objective was to
expand access to and enhance nutritional conditions of vulnerable populations, in particular those
affecting growth of children under five in poor urban and rural areas. The attainment of this
objective by 2011 was measured through three key indicators:

   (i)   increase in overall program coverage of children under five in rural areas from 15
         percent in 2006 to 40 percent in 2011;
   (ii) increase in the prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding among 0-6 month old infants by
         30 percent; and
   (iii) at least 40 percent of pregnant women and children under five are sleeping under
         insecticide-treated bed nets.

In addition, a Bank Core indicator was defined to measure progress towards the PDO:

   (iv) People with access to a basic package of health, nutrition and population services
        (number was defined).

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
    reasons/justification

The content of the PDO remained the same after the Additional Financing was approved in March
2012 even though the PDO was clarified to “improve nutritional conditions of vulnerable
populations, in particular children under five years of age in the intervention areas.” This improved
focus on outcomes to be achieved in the intervention areas also resulted in a change of indicators.
A fifth project development indicator was added to the original four: i.e., children aged 6-23
months receiving yearly a minimum of 90 micronutrient sprinkles sachets for three months in
interventions areas (30%). This added PDO indicator was meant to reflect the intensification of
anemia control among the youngest children through an evidence-based measure. The three
original PDO indicators and the Bank Core indicator were achieved and their targets were therefore
raised (see Table 1 below). A split evaluation for the original and refined PDO was deemed
unnecessary since it would not change any of the ratings and overall outcome rating

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The primary target population of the community-based nutrition program (Component 1) was
children under five in poor rural and urban areas. It was estimated that the number of children
reached would increase from 320,000 to 710,000 (originally) in rural areas. In addition, 1,500 000
(originally) mothers were expected to be reached with behavior change communication and
counseling. The Local Government (LG) structures benefited from improved collaboration with
CLM and capacity strengthening in project management.

Distribution of micronutrients and deworming medication was carried out in primary schools
estimated to reach around 300,000 children (older than five years) (Component 2). The whole
population in the project areas was expected to benefit from fortified foods becoming available in
the targeted areas. In addition, the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Education benefited from
strengthening implementation capacity.

After the second restructuring in 2012 the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Equipment, the
Ministry of Livestock and Productive Animals, and the Ministry of Fisheries and Maritime
Affaires were also expected to benefit from new collaborations with the CLM.

1.5 Original Components

The project is composed of three components: 1. Community-based nutrition; 2. Multi-sectoral
support to nutrition; and 3. Support to implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the nutrition
development policy. CLM’s role was to coordinate and supervise the multiple actors involved in
project implementation in support of the second phase of the Nutrition Enhancement Program.



                                                       3
Component 1: Community-based Nutrition (IDA US$10.4). The scale-up of the PRN package
of community-based nutrition and health services, developed during Phase I, was the core activity
of the project. The component integrated the activities of community-based growth monitoring
and promotion with Community-based Integrated Management of Child Illness (c-IMCI) and
Community Management of Acute Malnutrition (CMAM). During Phase I the community based
interventions were contracted out by CLM to NGOs that acted as Community Executing Agencies
(CEAs). This implementation arrangement was modified in the second phase. LGs were given the
overall management and control of the implementation of the community-based interventions and
LGs contracted-out the interventions to a CEA. Each CEA covered at least one district. The scale-
up in Phase II consisted both of mobilizing new districts with high malnutrition rates and to
accomplish higher coverage in already mobilized health districts.

In communities with more than 1,000 inhabitants an intensive intervention was implemented,
which entailed monthly mobilizations of women and children and a less intensive model in
communities with less than 1,000 inhabitants with services provided quarterly. The project
financed: (i) Community-based growth promotion and c-IMCI sessions for children under two
during which mothers were counseled on the nutritional status of their child, on improved infant
and young child feeding practices, on recognition of danger signs during illness and on home-
based care. Except for the growth monitoring activities, children in the ages 3-5 were offered the
same services as children under two; (ii) Provision of insecticide treated bed-nets and promotion
of iron, Vitamin A supplements and deworming medication. The behavior change communication
and counseling that was provided to mothers also targeted pregnant women and provided specific
recommendations related to pregnancy and delivery; (iii) Nutrition education for mothers with
cooking demonstrations using local foods; (iv) Mobilization of extended caregivers to take part in
social and behavior change communication activities. Grandmothers, in-laws and other relatives
are important for the survival of infants and young children; (v) Screening of acute malnutrition
and education on community management of the identified cases of acute malnutrition (CMAM);
(vi) Community-level communication activities to create demand for iodized salt, Vitamin A, iron
supplements and dietary diversification; (vii) Training and supervision of nutrition aides in the
communities providing the services to the community on a voluntary basis.

Component 2: Multi-Sectoral Support for Nutrition (IDA US$1.4). The work initiated during
Phase I on involving sector ministries in a systematic and formal manner was continued. The
support focused on the education and health sectors (i.e., the Ministry of Education (MOE)
including the literacy Department, the National Agency for Early Childhood Development and the
Ministry of Health and Prevention (currently changed to the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs;
MOHSA). In health, the focus was on training and supervision of community workers by front-
line health staff. In addition the component financed the development of monitoring and recording
tools used in: (i) CMAM; (ii) screening as well as therapeutic feeding of children suffering from
severe acute malnutrition (SAM); and (iii) the twice-yearly distribution of high-dose vitamin A
supplements to new mothers. The supplies used in these interventions were not financed by the
project.

In the education sector, the project supported the weekly distribution of micronutrient supplements
as well as the monitoring and recording tools used. Nutrition training and education in literacy

                                                4
schools as well as early childhood centers were financed. Enhancing salt iodization by local
producers was also supported in this component.

Component 3: Support to Implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation of the Nutrition
Development Policy (IDA US$3.2). In this component, support was provided to strengthen the
performance of the CLM at the national and regional levels in promoting greater involvement and
ownership of local actors including Local Government representatives. The development of the
existing comprehensive Monitoring and Evaluation system was an important activity in this
component. Continuous improvement of databases for project results, targeting and feed-back
mechanisms for use in activities related to the community nutrition platform were conducted.

The National Committee for Food Fortification, a sub-committee of the CLM, was supported in
the fortification of oil with vitamin A and wheat flour with iron. Development of products, quality
control measures and social marketing campaigns to promote the use of fortified products were
financed by the project.

1.6 Revised Components

No new components were added.

1.7 Other significant changes

The original credit of Special Drawing Rights (SDR) 10.1 million (equivalent to US$15 million)
was approved by the Board on November 13, 2006, and became effective ahead of time on January
29, 2007. This credit closed on May 14, 2012 with SDR 10.0 million (99 percent) disbursed. The
project was restructured four times. The first time was in 2008 to reallocate project funds within
the project. About 15 percent of the International Development Association (IDA) credit planned
for purchase of pharmaceutical products and unallocated funds were reallocated to strengthen the
community-based nutrition scale up (Component 1).

The second restructuring, again for a reallocation of project funds, was conducted in 2011. The
third restructuring was conducted in 2012 when an additional financing from IDA resources of
SDR 6.5 million (equivalent to US$10 million) became available in March 2012. An extension of
the project closing date by 13 months to June 14, 2013 was approved. This additional financing
and project extension made it possible to add a fifth PDO and adjust targets upwards that had
already been achieved before time. New indicators to strengthen the response mechanisms for the
protection of nutrition among vulnerable groups were also added and they reflected a stronger
focus on: (i) anemia prevention; and (ii) multi-sectoral approaches at community level to reduce
vulnerability to external shocks. One intermediate indicator to measure progress in household food
security levels (access to backyard gardens) was also added while three intermediate indicators
(supervision density) were deemed less pertinent for the PDO than originally assessed and were
therefore taken out.

The extension of the project also implied a partial bridging-support to the Government’s effort to
build financial sustainability of nutrition activities by 2016. In May 2013 the project was extended

                                                 5
by 12 months from June 2013 to June 2014. The project had faced 5 months of delay in setting up
a disbursement mechanism for new activities added in 2012. In addition, two implementation
delays were incurred related to procurement of sprinkles sachets and establishing new partnerships
with the agricultural sector. Altogether, this led the Government to request a new extension of 12
month. The new closing date became June 2014, which made it more likely for the project to reach
the new targets added in 2012. In addition, one of the original PDOs (overall program coverage)
had again been achieved and a new target was agreed (see Table 1).

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

The sequential design of the Nutrition Enhancement Program included triggers for moving from
the first to the second phase. The first phase was meant to explore, learn and identify best practices
on a limited scale, while the second phase would take the successful interventions to scale. Phase
III as originally planned was intended for consolidation and institutionalization of nutrition as a
development issue in Senegal. However, at the end of Phase I, the Bank decided to: (i) reduce
the number of phases to two; (ii) request the Government to consolidate Phase II ($24 million) and
Phase III ($10 million) into one; and (iii) lower the IDA allocation to $10 million from the original
$24+$10 envisioned. The $10 million was supplemented by $5 million for bed net distribution.

The changed position of the Bank provided a challenge for preparing the project as the client was
expected to do more with less while building on the experience from Phase I. This inbuilt
importance ascribed to taking into account lessons from phase I in designing phase II, was reflected
in the broad implementation issues covered in the triggers (impact on child growth, establishment
of work plans with sector ministries, approved audits of the implementing agency, and low project
costs per child in rural and urban areas).

The triggers were in turn validated through several data collections including a well-designed
independent impact evaluation conducted at the end of Phase I, Knowledge Practices and Coverage
surveys, independent audits from audit firm, and a project cost analysis comparing costs to other
similar interventions in other countries. They had reached a satisfactory degree of achievement at
the end of Phase I. Phase I had significantly lowered the risk of a child having a weight less than -
2 standard deviations below international norms. 1 In addition, health and healthcare seeking
behaviors were improved in the program communities compared to the control communities. The
project had mitigated some of the consequences of the difficult living conditions in the intervention
areas.

There was strong agreement among stakeholders about the importance of (i) increasing the
coverage of the program and include new hard to reach areas with high malnutrition; (ii) change
the implementation arrangements from CEAs to LGs taking the lead in community nutrition
activities; (iii) applying the same guiding principles of implementation such as to promote
contextualized implementation approaches; and (iv) emphasizing multi-sectoral collaborations at
all levels. The change of implementation arrangements was based on two observations: first the
1
    Alderman et al 2008.
                                                  6
LGs were demonstrating improved capacities in nutrition, and secondly they were identified by
the CLM as the most effective and long-term drivers of integrating nutrition into the LGs multi-
sectoral responsibility of community development.

The project funds were contributing to the financing gap of the Nutrition Enhancement Program
but during preparation it was acknowledged that it was uncertain when the financing gap of the
budget 2007-2011 would be closed. A gradual implementation strategy to new health districts
was therefore developed, which would adapt the speed of the scale-up to financial resources
mobilized. The expansion accelerated in 2009 following the successful mobilization of additional
funding from the Food Price Crisis Response Program (P115938) for child nutrition and social
cash transfers complemented with resources from the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition
(GAIN) for food fortification, UNICEF and the World Food Programme (WFP) for the
management of acute malnutrition, the UNDP/Spain Millennium Development Goals
Achievement Fund for child nutrition and food security, and the Micronutrient Initiative (Canada)
for salt iodisation.

The project was financed by IDA and the Government at almost equal levels. The high level of
counterpart contribution (i.e., a more than ten-fold increase from the first Phase) is a strong
indicator of ownership. The project preparations were conducted in an environment of assumed
continued economic growth. The risk related to continued ownership was assessed as moderate
during preparations due to the national election shortly after effectiveness in 2007.

The project took advantage of a Project Preparation Facility (PPF) advance to prepare the scale
up. During the development of the project implementation manual, the importance of developing
two types of community interventions depending on village size and malnutrition risks were coined
(monthly and quarterly activities). The project implementation manual was finalized before the
planned effectiveness of Phase II. In addition the funds of Phase I were near to exhausted and the
PPF guaranteed the maintenance of community level activities until effectiveness of Phase II. No
Quality at Entry assessment by QAG was done.

2.2 Implementation

The project greatly benefitted from the continuation of contracting out community mobilization
efforts to ten CEAs from the first phase. With the need to take the community nutrition activities
to scale, only the CEAs able to cover a whole district were contracted during phase II. The ten
CEAs with renewed contracts had demonstrated high performance levels and that they were well
established institutionally and among communities in their district(s) of implementation. The
project was thus able to cover 29 health districts from day one and the project disbursed initially
funds faster than planned. Meanwhile, preparations for the scaling up of the program were
advancing. No other Sub-Saharan country had managed to implement community-based activities
at this scale.

Given the importance of the new implementation arrangements of LGs taking the lead in the
overall coordination of community nutrition activities, it was of outmost importance that LGs and
CEAs were willing and capable of adjusting to this change. As part of the mid-term review in

                                                7
2009, a study was conducted to shed light on these processes. It was found that LG continued to
perceive the project as very relevant to its population and that nutrition was increasingly framed
as a development and poverty reducing issue. Yet the capacity of the LGs was uneven, which
resulted in uneven pace of progress across districts.

Component 3 was given a new direction after the mid-term review in 2009, namely a
systematically strengthening of the role of LGs in mobilization and monitoring the project. This
increased support to the decentralization process would secure the continuity of nutrition within
the LG planning processes.

After the 2007 national elections a period of institutional instability occurred. The Prime Minister
re-organized several Ministries including his own Office where the CLM was housed. Without
consultation with stakeholders, including the national coordinator of the CLM, the CLM was
moved to the newly created Ministry of National Solidarity. Following constructive discussions
between the Prime Minister's Office, the CLM and development partners, including the World
Bank, the CLM was moved back under the Prime Minister's Office by decree.

Soon after the effectiveness of the project the economic and budgetary situation of the country
started to deteriorate. As a result of extra-budgetary expenditures, the Government was during
about one year unable to live up to the agreed counterpart funding to all projects in the portfolio
of the Bank. The Task Team and Country Management were in frequent contact with the
Government about the negative impact on the implementation process. As a result of the lack of
counterpart funding: (i) the multi-sectoral activities with the Ministry of Health and the Ministry
of Education were scaled down to almost zero; (ii) some of the core activities of distributing
micronutrients to improve the nutritional conditions of the target groups were negatively impacted;
(iii) the scaling up was slowed down; (iv) intensity of activities was reduced to a minimum.
Moreover, in the absence of counterpart funding, the IDA disbursement rate exceeded
considerably the initial estimated disbursement plan. In late 2008 there was concern of missing
the project development objectives. Therefore, the World Bank’s progress ratings were
downgraded.

The CLM felt the need to mobilize additional resources to support the scaling up of interventions
of the whole program. The CLM with support from the Prime Minister made several national and
global qualified attempts to advocate for additional resources to scale-up the program to cover all
regions. These efforts included (i) the program's partnership with development partners at local
level, (ii) its visibility in the global Partnership for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health (Geneva),
(iii) its central stage participation in the previous and upcoming "Countdown to 2015 - Maternal,
Newborn and Child Survival" conference, and (iv) the President's acceptance to become a member
of the Network of Global Leaders (Norway), a group of like-minded political leaders to create
momentum for improving maternal and child health. As a result, the CLM raised several envelopes
of resources, mostly earmarked for specific activities, from the MDG Achievement Fund
(supported by Spain), the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition, UNICEF, WFP and the
Micronutrient Initiative (supported by Canada). These resources were essential to maintain the
broad scope of interventions but inadequate to support the full scaling up to all Districts.


                                                 8
In the meantime, Senegal was hard hit by the 2008 food and financial crisis that developed on a
global scale. Senegal imports 80 percent of its rice consumption and the sharp rise in food prices
had a direct and negative impact on poverty levels. Households experienced their purchase power
declining rapidly. It was assessed that without a rapid response, the window of maintaining the
gains in improved nutrition conditions would be closed. To mitigate the consequences of the crisis,
the Task Team successfully raised $8 million from the Global Food Price Crisis Response Program
Multi-Donor Trust Fund and the Bank agreed to reallocate $10 million of cancelled IDA resources
to the nutrition program. These resources were processed under OP/BP 8.00 as an Emergency
Project in just four months (from identification in February to Board approval in May 2009). The
Rapid Response Child-focused Social Cash Transfer and Nutrition Security Project (Credit No.
4605-SN and TF094372) supported the scale-up of the PRN and included the first large-scale cash
transfer scheme in Senegal. As a parallel project to the PRN, the rapid response project offered an
opportunity to advance the scale-up of PRN in the hard to reach regions with high and deteriorating
malnutrition levels. Due to the preparation of this new project, the mid-term review was postponed
from July to October 2009.

As the project implementation continued, CLM’s reputation as a public institution working directly
with LGs and with communities to encourage local solutions grew very strong. This was
highlighted in the LG’s strong response and ownership of the large-scale cash transfer pilot.

The CLM, attached to the Prime Minister’s Office, established itself as the natural entry point for
all policy dialogue on nutrition during the second phase. Different donors have projects with the
CLM and associated national structures on food fortification, the management of acute
malnutrition, salt iodization and food security. The increased number of partners including several
partnerships made it at times difficult for the CLM to advocate the holistic view of community
based nutrition. In response, the Bank mobilized other development partners to conduct twice
yearly joint coordination and supervision missions in support of program implementation. Donor
coordination was enhanced between 2007 and 2009. After the severe drought that dramatically
brought down harvest expectations in 2009, there was a push for mounting humanitarian responses
among some donors. The large scale screening undertaken by the Nutrition Enhancement Program
indicated high levels of malnutrition in only a few pockets in remote areas. The CLM urged the
development partners to keep a holistic view on the situation whereby most areas could be helped
by strengthening resilience factors and concentrate the humanitarian assistance to those pockets
where needed.

In 2012, the Government requested Additional Financing for the PRN2 to maintain and increase
(i) program coverage and intensity; and (ii) to pilot a household and community resilience
approach by strengthening the household food security interventions under the community
nutrition program and multi-sectoral planning with the agriculture and water sectors. The Bank
responded with an additional credit of $10 million with which three larger activities were added,
i.e. distribution of multi-micronutrient powders (i.e., sprinkles), the promotion of family and
community gardens, and collaboration with the agricultural sector. The administrative procedures
used for the procurement of sprinkles were more time consuming and complex than anticipated,
which postponed the initiation of the distribution of the sprinkles. Due to these implementation
issues, the World Bank’s progress ratings were downgraded to Satisfactory in 2013.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

The drive to improve nutrition conditions among vulnerable groups and to achieve the project
development goals have been a leading principle in the implementation of the project. Much effort
has been placed in developing the right indicators and feed-back loops at all levels in the
monitoring and evaluation system.

Design: The existing integrated monitoring and information system of the PRN was refined
during Phase II. The formal implication of LGs and the enhanced and formalized roles of Sector
Ministries (Health and Education) required some updates in the monitoring system. Indicators
were added to capture the role and activity level of LGs. The system is managed by the CLM and
is linked to the subcontracted CEAs so as to respond to their own monitoring needs. The LGs
strengthened the monitoring of the nutrition activities together with the CEAs during Phase II. LGs
started to submit quarterly reports to CLM on achieved community activities and results. In
addition the LGs controlled the financial management by approving financial reports from the
CEAs. The monitoring system also integrates the implementation progress of health and education
sector plans (Component 2). The selected indicators were adequate for monitoring progress of
the PDO and all intermediate indicators.

A rigorous impact evaluation of the first phase of the project documented significant impact of the
intervention on nutritional status and a broad range of nutrition outcomes including infant and
young child feeding behaviors. The positive results informed the decision to scale up the
interventions during Phase II, which would be monitored through the comprehensive monitoring
system.

Due to the funding constraints in early stages of the project, the planned baseline Knowledge,
Practices and Coverage (KPC) survey was not conducted as planned. Instead, annual Lot Quality
Assurance Sampling (LQAS) surveys were used to provide additional quality monitoring
information on the indicators.2

Implementation: Data is collected on a monthly basis in the communities on project activities,
service quality, outcome indicators and costs. Data is of good quality and reports are timely and
complete.

The application of the M&E system included regular feed-back to regional stakeholders which
improved the implementation process. The design of the monitoring system also made analysis of
results possible during the joint supervision missions.

In 2012, the program conducted a national Standardised Monitoring and Assessment of Relief and
Transitions (SMART) survey representative at the level of the Département, was conducted. This


2 KPC Surveys require large household sample sizes and are therefore very expensive. LQAS require very small sample sizes
and provide accurate information on categorical hypotheses. Since LQAS is implemented at the local level, aggregating data
from multiple LQAS allows the calculation of KPC estimates on specific indicators.
                                                            10
survey formed the basis for the design of the additional financing that followed in 2012 and focused
on addressing the underlying determinants of undernutrition.

Utilization: The program has a strong results-based management focus. The information is used
at all levels (i.e., community, Local Government and central levels) to monitor progress and adjust
the actions when progress appears to be stalling. The program embedded project support missions
to operational levels which were organized around the findings of the M&E system. As a result,
stakeholders at all levels are fully informed on the progress of implementation.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

No safeguard policies were triggered by the project. Fiduciary compliance has been rated
Satisfactory in ISRs throughout the project period. The project has benefitted from a stable
financial management group that had a high managing capacity.

Procurement: A procurement plan was developed for the project based on the approved practices
in Phase I. The type of procurement methods remained the same as in Phase I. The implementation
of the procurement methods was satisfactory according to the Bank, and the internal control system
performed well.

Disbursement and financial management: The project had disbursed 99 percent of the IDA credit
ending in 2012 and 100 percent of the Additional Financing credit. The annual planning and
budgeting process was of high quality. The management of the contracting arrangements between
LG, CEA and CLM were well conducted. The CLM was the first implementing agency to use the
Inter Un-Audited Financial Reports system (IFR) when it was introduced in Senegal. The project
has complied with the requirements to submit annual audit reports. All audit reports have been
submitted on time with unqualified audit opinions and have been acceptable to IDA.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

The decision to move away from a three phased approach to a two phased approach was stooled
on the thought that a greater deal of the scaling up and consolidation should be financed through
other types of support such as budget support or SWAPs. Currently, the Bank is supporting
demand- and supply-side interventions to improve maternal health and nutrition in the eastern parts
of the country through the Health and Nutrition Project.

A financial mapping of ongoing interventions supported by USAID and the CLM is currently
conducted as a follow up to an earlier mapping of interventions. The information obtained from
the mapping exercise is meant to increase efficiency of community nutrition activities. In
addition, the Bank intends to conduct a sector study to capitalize on the policy efforts of the last
ten years which is expected to result in an investment case.

Lastly, the current momentum among development partners and partnerships to strengthen
collaboration resulted in September in a joint mission to discuss the need for a policy reorientation
to address household and community resilience to food and nutrition insecurity shocks which will

                                                 11
become more frequent as a result of climate change. Given the relevance to the Bank’s twin goals,
and the opportunities offered by this decentralized platform for community actions, the Bank is
interested to support the Government in bringing about this policy change, although the exact
mechanisms are still under discussion.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The relevance of the project’s development objective, design and implementation was high.

Objectives: The project supported cost-effective programs to improve essential human
development outcomes such as the health and nutrition status of children, pregnant and lactating
women. These activities are fully consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy (2007), the
Poverty Reduction Strategy (2006), and the Nutrition Development Policy (2006). One of three
pillars in the Country Assistance Strategy was highlighting the importance of improving human
development through better delivery of social services, notably to the most vulnerable groups.
Furthermore, the current twin goals of the Bank to (i) eradicate extreme poverty; and (ii) promote
shared prosperity are addressed in the project (in particular through the community-based activities
in component 1 and the intersectoral collaborations between CLM and the agricultural sector to
improve food security in component 2).

Design: The PRN builds on the global consensus of the importance of community nutrition
programs as articulated in the Bank’s strategy document “Repositioning Nutrition as Central to
Development (2006) and the Copenhagen Consensus (2008 and 2012).3 A cross-country review
of successful programs has shown that malnutrition can be reduced two to four times faster than
in the absence of such a program.4 The education and behavior change interventions in the project
are confirmed by the evidence provided in the Lancet Series on Maternal and Child undernutrition
(2008). Furthermore, the validity of the project results is assessed as high in the light of reduced
malnutrition rates in similar community-based programs around the continent.

During Phase I the community based interventions were contracted out by CLM to NGOs that
acted as Community Executing Agencies (CEAs). This implementation arrangement was modified
in the second phase. LGs were given the overall management and control of the implementation
of the community-based interventions and LGs contracted-out the interventions to a CEA. Each
CEA covered at least one district. The scale-up in Phase II consisted both of mobilizing new
districts with high malnutrition rates and to accomplish higher coverage in already mobilized
health districts.

With the Additional Financing in March 2012, the PDO was clarified to “improve nutritional
conditions of vulnerable populations, in particular children under five years of age in the
intervention areas.” This improved focus on outcomes to be achieved in the intervention areas also
resulted in a change of indicators, while the content of the PDO remained the same. A fifth project

development indicator was added to the original four. The three original PDO indicators and the
Bank Core indicator were achieved and their targets were therefore raised.

Implementation: The relevance of the project objectives became even higher during the course of
the project in light of the increase in food prices, a decrease in remittances, and severe droughts
affecting the whole Sahel region that negatively affected the country throughout the project period.
The successive external shocks since 2006, resulting in economic vulnerability, increased food
and nutrition insecurity, has highlighted the importance of improved uptake, implementation and
impact of the cost-effective interventions. In particular after the Additional Financing in 2012, the
project was able to strengthen the new discourse on nutrition, to reach beyond public health, with
new collaborations with the agricultural sector. The emerged recognition of the need to address
household resilience in a broader development perspective, yet maintaining key cost-effective and
evidence-based nutrition measures, is aligned with the frontline of global and Bank policy and
practice. In the Joint IDA-IFC-MIGA Country Partnership Strategy (2012-2017) it is emphasized
that resilience to the high risks of future domestic and/or external shocks is essential to improve
living conditions especially for vulnerable populations. The relevance of community mobilization
and improved LG capacity is furthermore stressed. Yet, the severity of the continued stream of
economic shocks indicates the importance of building resilience beyond health, nutrition and food
security such as employment opportunities and social protection systems, which are beyond the
scope of the current project.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

The achievement of the Project Development Objectives was substantial. The PDO is measured
through five project outcome indicators. The three original indicators and the Bank core indicator
have all exceeded their targets, while the fifth indicator added in 2012, has not yet been met (Table
2. The indicators are measured through continuous and periodic data collections: (i) Project
Monitoring System; (ii) National Nutrition Survey; and (iii) independent Lot Quality Assurance
Sampling (LQAS) surveys. The project monitoring and evaluation design is assuring measurement
of results as well as implementation processes, in particular in relation to collaboration with LGs.

the same outcome as the Bank core intermediate indicator #5 on Long-lasting insecticide-treated malaria nets

children in the intervention areas from 16 percent at baseline to 70 percent at the end of the project.
The source of data is the Project Monitoring System. The end target was surpassed and the project
reached a total of 73 percent of the under-5 year old children population. This corresponds to
1 451 490 children being reached by the project. It translates into about 300,000 children under
two having their weight and health status monitored every month and their mothers counseled on
feeding and caring practices; and far more than a million children under five are screened for acute
malnutrition every month. Those children diagnosed as malnourished are then enrolled in
therapeutic programs in the community or health facility, need depending. When a project reaches
such a large proportion of a total population it is likely that the impact of the interventions will
directly contribute to the national level indicators.

Senegal is the only country in Sub-Saharan Africa that has succeeded in reaching such a high
proportion of children under five through a community nutrition project at an annual cost per child
of approximately US$4. This achievement has had a strong demonstration effect on other countries
with high stunting levels such as Mauritania, Ghana, Benin, Ivory Coast, Djibouti, Burkina Faso,
Mali and Malawi. Many of these countries have sent delegations to learn from the Senegal
experience with multi-sectoral policy coordination and large-scale decentralized implementation.

Project Development Objective 2: Mothers targeted providing exclusive breastfeeding (%).
The revised target was to increase exclusive breastfeeding from a baseline level at 34 percent to
65 percent. The source of data is LQAS surveys at annual intervals. Throughout the project period
there has been a gradual increase of mothers who exclusively breastfeed. Between June 2013 and
June 2014, the average percentage of mothers exclusively breastfeeding their infants for the first
six months was 65 percent. The results are impressive in light of: (i) the initial, and to some extent
current, concerns among some families to only feed the 0-5 month baby breast milk; and (ii)
women’s continued importance in agricultural work which places a time and work burden also on
mothers with children 0-5 months. The community-based activities involve regular presence of
project community support groups to support new mothers in or close to their home and the support
groups provide more frequent contact to women and children than health facility workers have
time for. The Knowledge-Practice-Coverage survey (2006) and the Project Impact Evaluation
(2007) under the first phase of the PRN confirmed the role of the project in increasing the exclusive
breastfeeding rate.6 The trend of gradual improvement in exclusive breastfeeding in the last ten
years as the project coverage has increased and as the promotion of exclusive breastfeeding has
been intensified, indicates that the project likely has contributed to this improvement.

Project Development Objective 3: Pregnant women and children under five sleeping under
insecticide-treated bed nets (%). The revised target was that 75 percent of women and children
were sleeping under insecticide-treated bed nets in the intervention areas. The baseline estimate
was 12 percent in 2006. The target has been surpassed and has continued to increase. In December
2013 it was measured at 86 percent. This major accomplishment contributes to a decrease in
malaria infection but also to reduce anemia in women, which in turn has a direct impact on child
delivery outcome. The increased availability of insecticide-treated bed nets made possible through
the project distribution network has improved the acceptability of (reported) usage.

Project Development Objective 4: [CORE] People with access to a basic package of health,
nutrition and population services (number). This indicator refers to the number of children
reached by the nutrition program. In 2012, the target was set at 1.1 million children. By March
2014, the project had reached 1,639,028 million children, i.e., 49 percent over the target.

Project Development Objective 5: Children aged 6-23 months receiving yearly a minimum
of 90 micronutrient sprinkles sachets for three months in interventions areas (%). This
indicator was added in 2012 when the Additional Financing was made available to the project. The
improvement of the evidence-base and the development of the sachets of micronutrients were not
available in 2006 during preparation of the project. The extension of the project and access to
funding made it possible to complement the community-based activities with this supplement. The
project experienced delay of more than a year due to constraints surrounding the procurement
processes between CLM, the central storage of UNICEF and the updated Bank procurement
requirements. The objective has therefore not yet been reached, but is expected to be reached
before the end of the year. The micronutrients have been successfully procured. The first
distributions started in October 2014 and are currently ongoing in 13 regions (all except the capital
Dakar). 249 882 children under five are targeted. At the end of October 2014, 49 983 children aged
6-23 months had been reached, which corresponds to 20 percent of the end of project target. By
the end of November 2014 it is expected that the target (of 30%) will have been reached and
surpassed by 10 percentage points to 40 percent.

All other implementation arrangements related to the distribution of sprinkles were well prepared.
The distribution strategy was based on findings from a formative research study on acceptability
of sprinkles. The progress in the current distribution indicates that the community platform is well
suited to this new activity.

In addition to the PDO indicators, the project has contributed to the higher level impact of reducing
stunting levels among children. Chronic malnutrition, the principal marker of non-income poverty,
was reduced to 16 percent in 2012. Only twenty years ago the stunting levels were more than
double as high.

Furthermore, ten project intermediate outcome indicators and five Bank core intermediate
indicators measure the different types of activities in the three components. Fourteen intermediate
indicators have been met and one indicator is partially achieved. Three original project
intermediate indicators were as mentioned earlier deemed irrelevant and one new indicator was
added during the restructuring in 2012.

Achievements in component 1 (community-based nutrition) were captured through five
intermediate indicators (in cursive below) in addition to the two PDO indicators presented above.

Of children aged 0-24 months in the intervention areas at least 75 percent should show adequate
monthly weight gain. The end of project target was 80 percent. The target has been exceeded at 83
percent. The evidence is strongly showing that the “window of opportunity” to prevent lifelong
impairment of malnutrition should be achieved during the first two years of life. This result on


                                                 15
adequate weight gain indicates the density in the established rapport with communities. The strong
outcome reflects that the majority of newborns are identified and supported.

Increase by 30 percent of pregnant women making at least four prenatal care visits, has been
reached. The baseline was in 2006 at 40 percent and the target was 60 percent. It was surpassed
already in June 2013 when measured at 63 percent in a LQAS survey. Since then it has dropped
slightly to 61 percent; most likely due to the inclusion of new target area with low utilization rates.

The target of 80 percent mothers of children (under five) participating in monthly information and
education sessions in intervention areas was ambitious already at the start of Phase II. Phase II
started at a baseline of 60 percent; the target was revised from 80 to 90 percent in 2012. Still, the
target was superseded and in spite of seasonal variations in participation rate, the end-of-project
result was 94 percent. This coverage rate suggests that the activities were found effective by
mothers. The sessions offered behavior change communication to pregnant, first time mothers and
mothers who after several births now were able to join. The sessions also served as opportunities
for the more than 10 000 trained volunteer support group members to identify women in need of
specific counseling concerning feeding and caring practices. The result should also be assessed in
light of inclusion of hard-to-reach regions that normally require additional resources for
mobilization.

Additional outcomes in component 1 related to improved micronutrient status in targeted children
aged 6-59 months. The target was to reach at least 80 percent of children in this age group with
high preventive doses of Vitamin A supplements twice yearly. The baseline was 79 percent since
this activity had been initiated during Phase I. The end of project target of 90 percent was exceeded
at 94 percent according to LQAS surveys in 2013. The very high performance was also
accomplished and exceeded in terms of distributing at least 90 percent of insecticide-treated bed
nets. 500,000 long lasted bed nets were purchased and distributed, equivalent to 100 percent of the
target.

Achievements in component 2 (Sectoral Support for Nutrition Results) included the sectoral
ownership and accountability for nutrition results, particularly in Health and Education. In 2012
the agricultural sector was also mobilized and an intermediate indicator was added to reflect this.

The adoption of child growth promotion in children under two years old and revision of anemia
prevention and control strategy by the MOHSA was reflecting the interdependency between the
health and nutrition activities. The target was achieved since more than a year back. The
collaboration with the MOHSA has been challenged by organizational problems at the central level
of the MOHSA. During the last two years there have been more opportunities to discuss the
advantages of community-based approaches to strengthen the uptake and implementation of health
services.

The second indicator measured sectoral collaboration with Education. The targeted children in
primary education receiving weekly micronutrient supplements in schools was the selected
indicator. The target was to reach at least 80 percent. This target was met already in 2012 and was
raised during the project restructuring in that year. At the end of project all targeted children (100

                                                  16
percent) were receiving the supplements. However, during 2013 there was a supply problem due
to international regulations, which caused a temporary stock out. It was corrected in 2013 and the
level was again exceeding the target.

In 2012 (during project restructuring) the opportunity was given to strengthen the intersectoral
profile of the project to also include the agricultural sector. The process of developing
Memorandums of Understanding with the Ministries in the agricultural sector was initiated. An
agreement has been signed with the Ministry of Livestock and Productive Animals and the
agreement with the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Equipment is currently being finalized.
Activities are underway with the Ministry of Fisheries to improve opportunities for female
entrepreneurs in the sector.

The selected indicator was to measure progress in household food security levels by increasing
households’ access to backyard gardens (0 at baseline in 2012 to a target of 350 in 2014). With
only two years of implementation this was an ambitious target. Given women’s multiple
responsibilities in food production, consumption and reproduction, the need to directly address
food insecurity was significant, however. This entry point to the agricultural sector was driven by
the same commitment to establish collaboration based on local needs and capacities in addition to
sectoral ownership. The agricultural sector was no longer developing household food production
approaches and extension services in the local communities had been ceased. A process of
consultations with local communities, district and Ministry levels in the agricultural sector was
carried out to identify new strategic and operational areas of collaboration. The specific household
constraints in food security and the identification of contextual and feasible activity plans at district
and community level were identified and agreed.

The SMART survey results (2012) were directly informing the participatory process at the local
level. This evidence-based-programming process took longer than anticipated; yet was also
implemented with higher quality than originally envisioned from the community to the Ministry
level. The process included: (i) the specific conditions in the different areas; (ii) the needs
expressed by beneficiaries; and (iii) the technical advice from the agriculture sector in the LGs. As
a result, the project offered support in a wide range of activities to beneficiaries including small
ruminants, poultry, micro-gardening and backyard gardens. The diversified approach based on
defined targeting principles (such as distance from village to capital of CL; accessibility to basic
social infrastructure; the occurrence of shocks and the prevalence of acute malnutrition) led to
support more households than originally thought feasible (i.e., 350). Currently 1,321 households
have benefitted from backyard food production support to enhance their food security. The target
has thus been surpassed.

Achievements in Component 3 (Support to the implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation
of the National Nutrition Policy). The results were measured through the percentage of Local
Governments incorporating nutrition objectives and interventions in Local Development Plans.
This outcome reflects a change in design that was made after the Mid-term Review of the PRN. It
lead to greater participation of LGs in the implementation of the nutrition security activities. The
baseline was 0 and the end of project target was set at 35 percent. The result was at end-of-project
very close at 34 percent. The 34 percent corresponds to 135 LGs and was reached already by the

                                                   17
end of 2012. There has not been a new formal round of Local Development Plans within the LGs
since then, which is the reason for the lack of more recent data on this indicator. The benefit of
systematically strengthening the LGs was effectively demonstrated in the process of integrating
the agriculture sector into the project (described above). The strong ownership of LGs was shown
in the development of work plans connecting the community-based activities with food security
measures. The inclusion of nutrition in Local Development Plans has set new standards of adapting
a national program to local conditions in Senegal.

The achievements in establishing a close collaboration with the LGs are partly a reflection of the
leadership of the CLM. During Phase II the CLM has transitioned from a project implementation
unit to facilitate new partnerships and serve as the recognized entry point of nutrition policy and
practice. Nutrition has become integrated in several national plans including the most recent “Plan
for an Emerging Senegal.” Furthermore, the nutrition indicators are now integrated in monitoring
tools and documents of the Poverty Reduction Strategy and the Senegal Millennium Development
Goals. Despite clear progress many MDGs will not be reached, however. Goals on malnutrition
are one of the few exceptions.

3.3 Efficiency

The efficiency of the project was high both in terms of the cost-benefit ratio, unit costs and in terms
of technical design. When monetized benefits for the malnutrition related diseases/conditions
were compared to costs for children reached by the project, the benefit to cost ratio was found to
be $19.65/$1.00. In other words, for every $1.00 invested by the project, $19.65 in benefits from
reduced health care costs can be expected (See Annex 3).

The robustness of the result was tested at 8 and 9 percent of social discount rates. Varying these
assumptions, as tested in the uncertainty analysis, did not generate a negative Net Present Value
(NPV). The cost-of-illness study may have some limitations. The chosen weight factor of 1.4 used
as an indicator for the weight of total burden for malnourished patients in comparison with the
burden for well-nourished patients was taken from international studies. The situation on the
ground may be different. A lower weight factor leads to a decrease in NPV, but the project still
exhibits positive returns.

The NPV is estimated at around $0.9 billion. This is 26 percent less than the forecasted NPV of
$1.2 billion when the program was designed. Key contributors to this gap include the methods
used to estimate benefits.

While the ex-post analysis takes into account only healthcare cost avoided for three diseases (Acute
Respiratory Infection, Malaria and Diarrhea) for children under the age of 5 years reached by the
program; the ex-ante analysis based its estimation on healthcare cost avoided for a number
nutrition-related diseases for the entire country.

Although these data and Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) outcomes may not be comprehensive and
may not fairly represent all benefits generated by the nutrition program, they do give a good
approximation of the benefits that are likely to have occurred. Despite the discrepancy between

                                                  18
the two CBA estimates, still the ex-post CBA suggests that the monetized benefits exceed the costs
of the project. Considering that the second phase generates net gains, it can be concluded that, all
else being considered, that the Government of Senegal and the World Bank are receiving positive
returns on the funds invested in this project.

The median cost per child per year was during the design phase in 2006 calculated at US$5 in
urban areas and US$3.7 in rural areas. The actual unit cost during Phase II was lower at US$4 in
urban areas and US$3.4 in rural areas. This compares favorably to other international experiences
from which studies concluded that: (i) US$5 per child per year was more or less the minimum
needed to see an impact; and (ii) investments of US$10 or above demonstrate limited added value
in relation to impact.7

The project is characterized by a strong technical efficiency. The implemented activities are among
the most cost-effective interventions to improve nutrition outcomes8 with some of the highest cost-
benefit ratios in terms of poverty reduction and economic development.9 These interventions were
implemented using the subsidiarity principle by which “matters ought to be handled by the
smallest, lowest or least centralized competent authority”. Most interventions were implemented
by community members securing access to the interventions in a cultural and social sensitive
manner. CEAs provided critical assistance in community mobilization and organization, program
innovations, and integration of programs at community level. LGs became in charge of overseeing
health and nutrition development efforts, supporting the monitoring and evaluation together with
CEAs, controlling financial management in their respective area, social mobilization and
coordination among stakeholders and programs. This also included the innovative work in
evidence-based programming of food security measures within the newly established collaboration
with the agriculture sector.

The management structure at the central and regional levels is kept to the minimum, e.g., the
number of professional staff for all programs and projects (including those funded by other donors)
at central level is less than 15. Moreover, as the program moved into Phase II, the number of
regional offices was reduced from six to three – despite the broadening of the program scope and
coverage (from 20% to over 70% of the total number of children under five reached) over the same
period. As a result, over the project period, project management has represented between 10 and
12 percent of the budget of which three percent is overhead.

Constructive partnerships have been fostered between LGs, civil society and the private sector for
improved health and nutrition outcomes. Central and Local Government have entered into formal
partnerships with civil society organizations, public service delivery systems and the private sector
for improved food, nutrition and health outcomes. The development of the partnerships at the
operational level has contributed to many improvements (chronic malnutrition, doubling of the
production and consumption of iodized salt, major staple foods fortified with essential

  This was concluded in the Copenhagen Consensus 2008 and 2012.

micronutrients such as vitamin A and iron, with the expansion to the agriculture sector renewed
focus on food transformation and conservation, and maternal mortality reduction).

The establishment of these operational partnerships has also resulted in “spillover effects” such as
stronger collaboration between LGs and CEAs on a broad range of development issues. By
developing a public-private interface it became possible to discuss harmonization challenges of
district based interventions (including interventions funded by other donors through parallel
systems). CEAs were recruited for Phase II based on their capacity to cover a whole district, which
was an efficiency enhancing measure. The profiles of the CEAs have been beneficial in developing
contextual, broad and inclusive approaches to community mobilizations. The project has been
successful in reaching a broader range of target groups more effectively through for example,
pregnant women solidarity clubs, grandmother forums, and religious women circles in areas with
large and strong brotherhoods like in the region of Touba.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Considering the high relevance of the project due to significant impact documented in
Phase I and successfully scaled up in Phase II; the economic downturn since the project
effectiveness, the continued vulnerability to external shocks; the substantial achievements (four of
five PDOs and all (except one) intermediate indicators having reached or surpassed their targets);
the well-designed implementation arrangements leading to high technical and economic
efficiency, the overall outcome rating for the project is Satisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

IDA has been the lead agency for nutrition in Senegal over more than a decade and has
demonstrated the leadership in the sector by: (a) fostering the partnerships that has developed
around the nutrition program; (b) mobilizing the resources urgently needed to support the scaling
up; and (c) strengthening the intersectoral platform by establishing collaboration with the
agricultural sector in addition to Health and Education.

   (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The direct beneficiaries of the project are pregnant and lactating women and children under five
years of age living in poor communities with risks of malnutrition. The investment in women’s
health and nutrition has a recognized potential of breaking the vicious and inter-generational cycle
of malnutrition and ill-health. Women’s improved access to health care and nutrition services
through the project also contributes to narrowing the gender gap in health outcomes.

The project was implemented during a period when the succession of shocks had a significant
negative impact on GDP growth. The growth has been much lower than expected in the PRSP-II
and poverty reduction rates have been small during the project period (48.5 percent in 2005 to 46.7
percent in 2011). Considering the very high coverage rate of the target group it is likely that the
project has mitigated some of the effects of the economic downturn.

   (b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The gradual strengthening of LGs in coordinating the project has strengthened the decentralization
process through improved technical capacity of LG representatives in eg. monitoring and
evaluation activities. It has also resulted in improved harmonization of activities implemented by
CEAs and staff in the health and education sections at the district level. These changes in capacity
and coordination signify the ambitions of achieving high levels of sustainability. The project is
likely to have a demonstrative effect on other partnerships in their future involvement of a
horizontal structure as the LG.

   (c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

Regional disparities in access to basic social services in addition to overall low quality remain a
serious challenge. The national nutrition survey identified large geographical disparities in
malnutrition rates and the scale-up of interventions was designed on the basis of these data. Areas
that were considered hard to reach were mobilized and services were delivered.

Maternal mortality remains high at 392 for 100,000 births. The rate of births assisted by trained
personnel has increased some – from 52 percent in 2005, to 65 percent in the Demographic Health
Survey in 2010. The project contribution to the number of women attending antenatal care four
times in pregnancy is a step in the right direction of strengthening the interactions between
communities and health facilities in reproductive health outcomes.

The relatively high maternal mortality rates reflect in large part weaknesses in the health system.
The Bank is currently supporting a Health and Nutrition Project by which demand- and supply-
side interventions towards skilled birth attendance are provided in three southeastern Regions of
the country. Linking the community platform with the health system offers great potential to
generate better results on issues around maternal health and nutrition.




                                                21
CEAs have enhanced their theoretical and operational understanding of the decentralization
process, and of the evidence-based planning processes with LGs. The project has a demonstrative
effect on other countries seeking to develop strong community based nutrition programs.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

The Beneficiary Assessments (BA) during PRN I (2005) and at the final stages of a cash transfer
pilot (2012) both reported high satisfaction levels with provided services. The growth monitoring
and promotion activities were perceived as well organized and the promotion of behavior changes
was communicated clearly by nutrition aides. The BA of the cash transfer in 2012 indicated that
the cash transfers reached the targeted women with the complete number of transfers to a very
high extent (96%). Direct beneficiaries reported that the transfer was spent on expenses for the
child under five and the household as a whole (71%), 22 percent of mothers spent the cash
exclusively on the child and 6 percent spent a part of the allocation on an income generating
activity.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: The risk to Development Outcome was Moderate.

Senegal’s role in the global nutrition community grew strong during the project period. In
December 2010, the partners set up a donor group for nutrition to coordinate their programmatic
support efforts on a national level more efficiently. Senegal joined the Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN)
movement in 2011 and has since participated in global and regional initiatives. The political
commitment to nutrition improvement has been strengthened over the course of the project with
high-level participation of government representatives in a range of international policy events
including the annual Scaling Up Nutrition meetings, the G8 New Alliance for Food Security and
Nutrition, the Global Alliance for Resilience Initiatives for the Sahel (AGIR), and the upcoming
Second International Conference on Nutrition. In November 2011, Senegal gave the prestigious
21st Annual Martin J. Forman Memorial Lecture on their achievements in nutrition policy
development.

The development of the inter-sectoral networks (formal and informal) - with three sectors
including four Ministries currently engaged - strengthens the scope and solidity of nutrition as a
topic that moves beyond public health and into the broader dimensions of development. The
anchoring of nutrition in national policies on Health, Education, and Agriculture in addition to the
broader National plan of Emerging Senegal improves significantly the sustainability. However,
weak service delivery across the public sector is still a concern. The project’s dependency on
progress in service delivery quality in other sectors is increasing and could be a risk to the
development outcome. That said, there are encouraging developments in the health sector with,
for example, the finalization of the Community Health Strategy by the Ministry of Health and
Social Affairs. The strategy builds on and integrates with the community-based nutrition
interventions of the Nutrition Enhancement Program and will contribute directly to improved
nutrition results. The high coverage of Vitamin A supplements is another core activity in which
the Ministry is taking the lead and thus directly supports the project outcome. The operational

                                                22
collaboration with the agriculture sector includes stronger service delivery for enhanced household
and community food and nutrition security. Coordination at the policy level is a work in progress
and may still take a considerable amount of time to accomplish. Over the years, the agricultural
sector has moved away from the food and nutrition security dimensions of food policies and
repositioning the Ministry’s role in this area will take time.

The enhanced leadership of LG on nutrition will mitigate future risks to the development outcome.
A third of LGs have integrated nutrition within their planning cycle. The evidence-based
programming exercise based on high quality health and nutrition data has contributed to enhancing
the knowledge base of LG-representatives. The acquired knowledge on persistence of pockets of
malnutrition, the causes of malnutrition and the range of available evidence-based interventions
that can address them, is an investment into the decentralization process in the mobilized areas.
An assessment made in the World Bank Participatory Local Development Project10 indicates that
the pace of the general decentralization reforms is uncertain but decentralization is not likely to be
reversed.

The expertise and experience of CLM’s implementation coordination of the nutrition policy is
uncontested in the Senegal civil service. The very strong political commitment, the leadership from
the Government over the course of more than a decade, is evidenced by the increase in the national
budget for nutrition in Senegal. The Government has increased its annual support to the CLM from
the national budget from F CFA 145 million during the first phase, to F CFA 1,172 million since
2007. In 2012, the Government increased its contribution to F CFA 1,372 million and, with the
purpose to render the nutrition programs sustainable, committed itself to further increase public
financial support to the CLM by F CFA 500 million per year until 2016 to reach an annual total of
F CFA 3,572 million. Yet, concerns related to the financial sustainability of the program, due to
increasing overall competition of resources and the economic downturn of the Senegalese
economy, have been expressed throughout the project period.

Senegal remains vulnerable to volatile food prices. This situation erodes purchasing power of poor
families and poses a serious nutrition risk to the vulnerable segments of the population. In addition,
Senegal remains vulnerable to the effects of climatic shocks (droughts, pests, flooding). While
regional efforts for early warning in the Sahel have improved over the past decade, the domestic
surveillance and the rapid response capacity remain weak.

The burden of disease on the adult and child population is still heavy. Maternal mortality is still
high and the MDG 5 will not be reached. The double burden of communicable and non-
communicable diseases is affecting the health of breadwinners and disease is a cause of households
falling into poverty. The development of the health and insurance system has a longer-term
outlook.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

   (a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

The Phase I performed beyond expectations as documented in an impact evaluation (2006) and the
ICR (2007), and Phase II was designed based on these results. Efficiency-related measures were
taken to reduce the administrative costs at national and district level alike; the interventions were
refined to include monthly or quarterly contacts with the project to monitor the malnutrition status.
The goal of scaling up the interventions to a level where the impact would make a difference at
the national level was driving the Bank’s Task Team to perform beyond requirements. The
originally designed three-phased project was adapted to new requirements and ambitions in the
Bank, and the Task Team re-designed the project into two phases. The importance of maintaining
a women-centered approach in terms of achieving results has been amply debated.

The Task Team had developed a professional working relationship with the government through
a series of discussions on policy needs in nutrition. The team was also well acquainted with other
agencies and partners in nutrition. This knowledge and position was well used to enhance the
implementation arrangements and support the LGs in taking a leading role in the project. It also
reflected an understanding of the Senegalese socio-political context that became important for the
design of the project. The weak management capacity of LGs was recognized in the design by
creating tri-partite arrangements which facilitated the development of strong partnership
arrangements between LGs and the CEAs with the latter ensuring quality financial management.
The strong results-based management orientation of the M&E design was continued in Phase II.

The main risk identified during preparations related to continued ownership, which was assessed
as moderate due to the national election shortly after effectiveness in 2007. During preparations,
IDA and the Government agreed to finance the project at almost equal levels. For the Government,
this was a ten-fold increase from the first Phase. The high level of counterpart contribution (i.e.,
a more than ten-fold increase from the first Phase) was a strong indicator of ownership. The project
preparations were conducted in an environment of assumed continued economic growth.

   (b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

Bi-annual joint donor implementation support missions under the leadership of the Task Team
were initiated during the Phase II. These have been instrumental in developing an improved
discourse on nutrition in Senegal. The growing number of partners, including several partnerships
in nutrition, augmented the need of leadership during the project, and the Bank’s Task Team
fulfilled that role. The harmonization of development partner contributions to nutrition has
improved during several years and has continued also after the closing of the PRN in June 2014.

                                                 24
The Bank’s Task Team continuously brought attention to the financial sustainability of the national
program. Only 18 months into the implementation of the project, strategies of risk mitigation to
safeguard the core of the program were developed, in case it would not be possible to bridge the
funding gap of the national program. A reallocation of 15 percent of the credit was swiftly carried
out to secure the core activities in the communities when a delay in counterpart contributions
occurred early after project effectiveness in 2007. Project applications to international funds were
proactively sought throughout the project period, which raised additional funds for nutrition.

Other development partners started to support narrow sector specific interventions through the
CLM which allowed the CLM to entertain the idea of reallocating some more resources towards
the scaling up of the community platform. A request for a reallocation restructuring was received
on September 28, 2011 and approved by the Bank on December 1, 2011. These reallocations
aided the program to increase coverage and strengthen the outcomes on the development objective.

When the CLM was transferred from the Prime Minister’s Office to a ne w (and now abolished)
Ministry without notification, the Country Management Unit (CMU) and the Bank’s Task team
took swift action and the CLM was transferred back. The withholding of counterpart contribution
was a portfolio-wide issue and was addressed in dialogues with the Ministry of Economy and
Finance at several occasions by the CMU and the Bank’s Task team. In late 2008 the Bank’s Task
team assessed the Development Objective to be at risk of not being reached. The withholding of
counterpart funding delayed implementation of component 2 and the main component 1 was at
risk. This was clearly communicated through a downgrading of the project.

Following the shocks that emanated from the global food price crisis, global financial crisis and
climate change between 2008 and 2012, the Government feared that the development objective
could be at risk. As a result, the Government requested additional financing to develop a food
security component in the program with the aim to help vulnerable households and communities
to better cope with the detrimental effects of droughts, floods and external economic shocks.
Bank approval of the government request for additional financing and extension of the project
closing date with 13 months made it possible for CLM to achieve the broad coverage of the
program and to establish the new collaborations with the agriculture sector. During the preparation
of the Additional Financing and the expansion of the project scope, the selected additional project
development indicator on distribution of sprinkles was ambitious with the project time at hand and
the long procurement requirements. As a result, the Government asked for an extension of project
closing date by 12 months which was swiftly approved and processed.

The project has benefited from regular and structured supervision missions, which have been well
documented in two Aide-Memoires per year. Throughout the project period the Bank’s Task Team
actively provided feed-back on the components that worked well (project management, M&E) and
on those that needed strengthening. The Aide-Memories have included specific recommendations
on next steps agreed with the CLM and development partners during the joint supervision
missions. To strengthen food security as part of improving household resilience is recognized as
important to reduce current and future vulnerabilities. During the course of the project, the Task


                                                25
Team monitored project performance closely and applied a proactive approach to enhance the
outcomes on the development objective through timely restructurings.

   (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

Considering the operationalization of the lessons learned from Phase I into the design of Phase II,
swift responses to a deteriorating Senegalese economy with sudden new high burdens on poor
households targeted in the project, the leadership in convening an increasing number of partners
in nutrition and sustaining the importance of joint-supervision missions, the technical supervisions
that made it possible for CLM to develop evidence-based programming in the latter part of the
project period, the overall rating for Bank performance is Satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance

   (a) Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

The continued political commitment to approach nutrition from a community base and to develop
the multi-sectoral nature and reach of nutrition has produced results. The endorsement of
continuing to work across sectors with Health and Education and to broaden it to the Agriculture
sector enhances the outcomes.

The CLM, and thus the project, was moved from the Prime Minister's Office to the newly created
(and now abolished) Ministry of National Solidarity without consultation with stakeholders.
Following discussions between the Prime Minister's Office, the national coordinator and the World
Bank, the CLM was moved back to the Prime Minister's Office. The delay in counterpart funding
interrupted the scale-up of community nutrition activities in component 1 and 2, and in particular
of the mobilization of new regions with high malnutrition rates during 2007 and 2008. All funds
were eventually made available and gradually increased.

The 2012 budget line was increased by approximately US$ 0.5 million. In addition, a commitment
was made to increase the budget line further by more than $1.0 million annually until 2016, which
has been adhered to. By 2016, the Government will be contributing approximately US$ 7.8 million
per year, which will be the largest Government financial contribution made to the nutrition sector
in the region.

Support from the Prime Minister’s Office and the Ministry of Economy and Finance has also
strengthened the decentralization process to LGs. The close collaboration between CEAs and LGs
is an accomplishment that also indicates the importance placed by the Government on improved
food, health and nutrition services to vulnerable groups. The retention of data as a means of protest
by the health districts since 2010 is a constraint as the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs is
unable to disseminate adequate national health and nutrition statistics. The Government adapted

                                                 26
well to the Bank driven change from an originally three phased project to only two phases. The
Government has retained and supported high level and capable staff in the CLM and the
Secretariat. The turn-over of CLM staff was low overall which has played an important part in the
successful implementation.

   (b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Highly Satisfactory

The knowledge-base on nutrition policy and practices are very high in the CLM. The project
became effective ahead of time as a result of efficient project preparations. The professional
working relationship with the Bank’s Task Team and other development partners is illustrated in
the joint supervision missions where information is shared and debated. CLM’s extensive
experience with results-based management improved the scale-up plan and maintained the
community-based approach when the effects of drought and increased food prices were indicating
an increase in malnutrition levels in specific and limited geographical areas.

The technical skills in improving the uptake, implementation and impact of the project have
strengthened the position of nutrition in human development in Senegal. The CLM has evolved
from being a project implementation unit to becoming a nutrition program facilitator, which is
illustrated more recently by the efforts to address household resilience and not only nutrition
intake. The CLM has built a strong team with clear roles and mandates. Two coordinators left the
job successfully (one for an international career, the other for reasons of retirement) and each time
a successor was identified from within the implementing agency with no decrease in quality of the
policy dialogue, program implementation and office management.

CLM has proved its leadership in establishing and maintaining multi-sectoral collaborations. The
advancements in the health sector including the development of the Community Health Strategy
within the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs contribute to the alignment of policies and
practices. The continued support in the Ministry of Education to integrate nutrition interventions
into the school system contributes to increased school attendance. The multi-sectoral support to
the production and commercialization of iodized salt addresses a major public health problem of
iodine deficiency which is a major factor in maternal mortality, child growth and mental
development. The recent commencement with the broadening of the multi-sectoral work to
include the agricultural sector provides a new set of food security enhancing measures that will
contribute to strengthening the household and community resilience to external shocks.

The CLM has systematically addressed the lack of access to national health statistics through
conducting a mixture of household surveys and quality assurance sampling surveys. The agency
has succeeded in expanding the M&E system yet maintaining a high quality. The delay in the
procurement of the sprinkles could to some extent have been prevented by consulting the Bank
procurement specialist on detailed requirements. The process of engaging the agriculture sector
and the LGs is an illustrative example of the application of collected data in practice. A national
survey with representative data at Department level was used to conduct a causal analysis with
local stakeholders. The evidence-based programming process turned into a comprehensive high-

                                                 27
quality consultative process that was not foreseen in the planning of the timeline of activities.
However, when the process was finalized, the implementation of backyard gardens quickly caught
up and has now exceeded the targets.

The CLM is recognized for its expert management in the context of Senegalese nutrition,
demonstrated by the Alpha Award for management by the Ministry of Economy and Finance in
2010. CLM has been nominated for the award again in 2014 and awaits the decision in December
2014. The high level performance by the CLM team resulted in quality guidance to and supervision
of local stakeholders.

   (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Satisfactory.

Considering the scale-up of community-based nutrition, the political commitment to broadening
the multi-sectoral nature of nutrition to include three key sectors, to support the financial
sustainability of the program and the continuous emphasis on achieving results, the overall
performance of the Borrower is rated Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

Policy discourse:

A shift in the nutrition discourse to move beyond emergency aid and therapeutic care of
malnutrition into the objectives of poverty reduction and development is significant in
establishing and sustaining partnerships with Local Governments and sectors infrequently
engaging with health and nutrition. The project approach has over the course of the project
period made a transition: from a focus on improving nutrition intake to advancing the discourse
on household coping and mitigation strategies. Keeping a focus on evidence-based cost effective
nutrition and health interventions, while expanding into improving resilience to food insecurity
and poverty is a combination that could narrow the existing gap between nutrition and maternal
mortality.

The onset of different crises with serious economic consequences demonstrates the need to
enhance household and community resilience. Since 2008, Senegal has suffered a series of
economic shocks including the global food price crisis, the spike in fuel prices, the global financial
crisis, floods (2012), successive droughts (2010, 2012 and 2014) and now the threat of Ebola.
Each of these crises leads to an economic stagnation that can affect thousands of households which
suddenly are not able to make ends meet. The standard approach of mounting large-scale crisis
response interventions is clearly proving to be inadequate. A concentrated focus on building
household and community resilience to the negative impacts of external shocks is the next
challenge and key priority in the nutrition policy development and implementation.




                                                 28
Policy coordination:

Ten years of collaboration between the Government of Senegal and the Bank can improve
sustainability of nutrition policy development. The Government’s effort to take ownership of
the program and build financial sustainability of nutrition activities started in 2007 by creating a
budget line for nutrition. In 2012, the Government committed to gradually increase the budget
by 350% by 2016. This support to the nutrition program secures that key activities will be
sustained.

Strong national leadership is fundamental to break the invisibility of nutrition and the
fragmentation in the discourse surrounding it. Nutrition has long suffered from being
immediately intangible to families and to policy makers. Even in the case of Senegal, where
nutrition policies have received more attention than in most neighboring countries, nutrition
remains a nebulous concept subjected to continuously changing discourses, often mixed with
strong donor bias.

Fostering formal partnerships between Local Government, civil society, private sector and
sector Ministries at the operational level can contribute to the reduction of malnutrition. The
reduction of stunting to 16 percent in 2012 in addition to improvements on intake of micronutrients
such as Vitamin A, demonstrates the opportunities in establishing partnerships across sectors.
Gradual but significant increase of Government contribution to the CLM in order to sustain its role
as a coordination mechanism of nutrition policies boosts the commitment of public and private
stakeholders.

CEA’s characteristic of being flexible in producing innovative and inclusive forms of
community mobilization is essential in gradually turning over the leadership to the Local
Governments. During Phase I CEAs proved their flexibility in establishing appropriated forms of
community mobilization, including pregnant women solidarity clubs, grandmother forums, and
religious women circles in areas with large and strong brotherhoods. In Phase II, the CEAs were
gradually improving capacity of Local Governments and in parallel handing over the coordination
role.

Strategy:

The subsidiarity principle has contributed to: (i) a lean management structure (and low
overhead expenditures); and (ii) the development of local capacity among mothers, village
leaders and Local Government. The program is unique in that it is characterized by high
coverage, a multitude of interventions, rapid communication between central and local levels, and
a solid results-based management system through an institutional setup that has a central
management team of no more than 15 professionals who also lead all the policy dialogue at
national level. As a result of the decentralization of responsibilities, the results are achieved at
low cost of approximately US$4 per child per year. At the same time, households, communities
and Local Government (the mayors, “sous-prefet” “prefet” and regional governor) show high
levels of ownership through which they share a high degree of responsibility of the results that are
achieved.

                                                29
Scaling-up nutrition interventions to reach 70 percent of the target population is possible
through a community-based approach. Scaling up nutrition interventions through a community
based approach need enabling conditions to succeed, including flexible mechanisms to promote
learning, tailored interventions based on context, and results obtained from a well-functioning
monitoring system, as well as strong Government support and multi-stakeholder partnerships. The
flexibility in supplementing the core nutrition activities with malaria prevention, therapeutic care
for malnourished children, food fortification, safety nets and food security interventions greatly
enhances the results.

The package of “direct” nutrition interventions have been effective in reducing chronic
malnutrition (linear growth retardation), but has done little in making a difference in the
rate of acute malnutrition. Over the years, rates of stunting, a marker of human development,
have come down to a level not seen in any other country in continental sub-Saharan Africa. Yet,
acute malnutrition (acute weight loss) has remained at relatively high levels in par with other
countries in West and Central Africa and higher than in East and Southern Africa. A different
approach is needed that addresses the more underlying and fundamental causes of acute
malnutrition, which are those related to the household food and nutrition security (e.g., availability
of, access to and utilization of food, as well as access and utilization of safe water). The policy
reorientation needs to address the household and community resilience to the effects of external
shocks on household food and nutrition security.

Effective communication for behavioral change and counseling requires specific messages
on the promoted behaviors that build on positive examples that are easy to adopt, are
adjusted to existing cultural models of malnutrition, and includes explicit descriptions of how
the promoted behavior should be accomplished. The scale-up of the PRN was built on extensive
knowledge of the implementing partners on the challenges in keeping children healthy but also on
the positive practices already in use. Showing respect for existing community practices is
important to promote change. The project demonstrated this by e.g. carrying out local food
demonstrations in the hungry season and in periods when children start complementary feeding
practices.

It has been shown that nutrition outcome indicators specifically targeting pregnant women
and children under five in poor areas can perform well even under poor economic growth
conditions such as that in the Senegal context. The effectiveness of investing in health and
nutrition services in circumstances of limited fiscal resources is encouraging for low-income
countries that are affected by domestic or global economic shocks. Leadership responses during
crisis are essential. The promotion of a community program as a platform also during food crisis
was important to maintain the focus on a broad coverage of a set of cost-effective interventions.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

   (a) Borrower/implementing agencies

The PRN II project has been well implemented with the support of all partners both at the
international level (World Bank, UNICEF, WFP, GAIN, MI), national level (technical ministries)
and at the decentralized level (Local Government).

In analyzing the implementation process, some points should be emphasized:

      In terms of constraints encountered during the implementation, it should be mentioned that
       the delay in the provision of micronutrient powders, which caused a delay in the start of
       home fortification interventions, the main difficulty was in the control of the procurement
       process.

Many good points have been noted on the implementation process including:

      The top-level government commitment to support the fight against malnutrition resulting
       in the contribution from the state budget to the PRN;
      Collaboration between different technical partners that are involved in all stages of the
       implementation process - from the design phase to conducting monitoring and evaluation
       activities;
      The involvement and leadership of the World Bank at all stages of the process, particularly
       during the phase of design and development of the evaluation plan where technical support
       was instrumental in achieving the objectives of the project PRN II;
      The strong commitment of decentralized structures especially the establishment of control
       measures for monitoring activities on the ground.

In the outlook for Senegal, the great interest in nutrition that the Government of Senegal continues
to have, should be noted. Indeed, the results of the PRN II project have been disseminated even
beyond the borders of Senegal. Today several countries are inspired by the implementation
arrangements of the nutrition interventions that have been developed in Senegal through the
fruitful partnership between the Government of Senegal and IDA.

CLM also wishes through its partnership with the World Bank to continue scaling up core
interventions and pro-nutrition activities, which takes into account the fight against determinants
of malnutrition in areas affected by economic shocks. In these areas, some households face real
difficulties in accessing certain basic needs and face multiple challenges including climate change.
The continuation of the PRN will significantly contribute to the achievement of sustainable
development objectives by supporting some of the most vulnerable groups (women and children
under five years) and strengthening community resilience.

Component 1: Community-based nutrition.

Achievements: The PRN reaches quarterly approximately 1.5 million children with screening
activities and management of acute malnutrition and about 250 000 children every month to follow
the activities of Growth Promotion. Management of acute malnutrition was introduced in 2009 in
the nutrition service package at community level. The results in Table 1a/1b and 2a/2b represents
annually accumulated contacts (up to 12 contacts for growth promotion and 4 contacts for acute
malnutrition).

Senegal has implemented several reforms that led to an increasing number of regions and
Departments. Some regions were split into two in 2012 and 2013 (I.e. Sine Saloum region is
currently divided into three regions: Kaolack, Fatick Kaffrine and Sine Saloum).

Effective communication for behavioral change and counseling requires specific messages. The
disseminated messages wore characterized by building on positive examples that are easy to
adopt, are adjusted to existing cultural models of malnutrition, and include explicit descriptions
of how the promoted behavior should be accomplished.

Component 2: Multi-Sectoral Support for Nutrition

Achievements in collaboration with the MOHSA:More than a million children under five are
screened for moderate and severe acute malnutrition every month. Those children diagnosed as
malnourished are then enrolled in therapeutic programs in the community or health facility, need
depending.

The number of schools with a canteen remains low. Vulnerable areas such as Kaolack (76%),
Kédougou (78.26%), Matam (79.10%) have a satisfactory situation however. Kolda (17.23%),
Dakar (21.58%) and Kaffrine (26%) have the lowest coverage rates in terms of school feeding
facilities at schools.
The micro gardening program run by the Directorate of Health and Nutrition and Community
Approach and supported by CLM was implemented in six regions: Dakar, Thies, Louga, Diourbel,
Fatick and Kaffrine. In the first phase, 60 schools were enrolled, 240 trained officers and 250
vegetables cultivation bins installed. After this pilot phase, the program was in 2014 scaled-up in
other regions.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Cost Benefit Analysis: Ex-post economic evaluation of the Senegal Nutrition Enhancement
Program II

This section presents the findings of the Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) conducted for the Senegal
Nutrition Enhancement Program II (SNEP). The project aimed at improving the nutritional status
of the population, in particular, the growth of children under the age of five residing in poor rural
and urban areas of the country. The objective of this ex-post CBA for SNEP II is to measure the
economic impact or benefits of the project.

CBA is a systematic process where costs and benefits of a program are identified, measured, and
compared in monetary (dollar) terms. By valuing both costs and benefits in the same monetary
terms, they can be directly compared to determine net economic impact of a program.

Benefits can be defined as all positive outcomes or consequences that result from the actions of a
program. They could be direct or indirect benefits; tangible and intangible. This analysis did not
take into account intangible benefits and costs because of the difficulties in monetizing them.
Indirect benefits will also be excluded due to lack of data. Only direct and tangible benefits will
be considered. Therefore the CBA will consider only children under the age of five whose health
care costs were avoided or delayed. These comprise of all direct health care costs (diagnostics,
therapy, rehabilitation and care) for diseases/conditions related to malnutrition.

Costs can be defined as the value of the resources that must be used to develop, implement, and
operate the program being analyzed. Direct costs are the resources budgeted for or assigned to the
program (e.g. personnel; facilities; equipment; …). Indirect costs are the resources not actually
budgeted for or assigned to the program, but nonetheless represent a withdrawal of resources from
the economy that allow the program to operate (e.g. time lost from work by recipients when
participating to the program; increased expenditures on foods; ...). As mentioned above, due to
lack of data, indirect costs are excluded from this study.

The formula for monetizing the benefits and all relevant explanations are provided in the last
section of this annex.

Results

From an economic efficiency perspective, any program with benefits exceeding costs, or with a
benefit-cost ratio of greater than 1, would be considered an efficient allocation of resources
(Stephanie R. Cellini, James E. Kee 2010).

When monetized benefits for the malnutrition related diseases/conditions were compared to costs
for children reached by the SNEP project, the benefit to cost ratio was found to be $19.65/$1.00.
In other words, for every $1.00 invested in the program, $19.65 in benefits from reduced health
care costs can be expected. This implies that the program is economically justified (positive return
on investment).

Sensitivity analysis

Sensitivity analysis describes the process of establishing the extent to which the outcome of the
cost benefit analysis is sensitive to changes in the values of the input variables. It involves
recalculating the NPV based on changes made to key variables and assumptions. To verify the
robustness of the results, an uncertainty analysis was carried out to test some key assumptions
using different variable values.

Discount rate: Although researchers recommend a discount rate in the range of 1.75-4.2% for
health program investment (Helmohltz Munchen, 2012)11, for ease of comparison with the ex-ante
CBA conducted at the start of the program, this ex-post CBA used a discount rate of 5%; Using a
higher discount rate may have material impact on the Net Present Value of the program. The
robustness of the result was tested at 8 and 9% of social discount rates. Varying these assumptions,
as tested in the uncertainty analysis, did not generate a negative NPV. As shown in the table below,
the use of higher discount rates led to a decreased, but still positive, NPV, indicating that the
program was still economically viable.

Weight factor: Our cost-of-illness study may have some limitations. The chosen weight factor of
1.4 used as an indicator for the weight of total burden for malnourished patients in comparison
with the burden for well-nourished patients was taken from international studies. The situation on
the ground may be different. In the case of severe acute malnutrition with complication, the
additional Length of Stay may exceed the suggested 40% and could go as high as 60%. However
in the case of Senegal, a low income country, this assumption might not hold due to early dismissal
for financial reason or due to the unavailability of hospital beds, no matter the severity of the
patient health status. In such case, the additional Length of Stay may only be as high as 20%. As

Conclusion

As shown in the Table 1, the Net Present Value of SNEP II is estimated at around $0.9 billion.
This is 26% less than the forecasted NPV of $1.2 billion when the program was designed. Key
contributors to this gap included the methods used to estimate benefits.

While the ex-post analysis takes into account only health care cost avoided for three diseases
(Acute Respiratory Infection, Malaria and Diarrhea) for children under the age of 5 years reached
by the program; the ex ante analysis based its estimation on health care cost avoided for a number
nutrition-related diseases for the entire country.

Although these data and CBA outcomes may not be comprehensive and may not fairly represent
all benefits generated by the nutrition program, they do give a good approximation of the benefits
that are likely to have occurred. Despite the discrepancy between the two CBA estimate, still the
ex post CBA of SNEP suggests that the monetized benefits exceed the costs of the program.

Considering that SNEP phase 2 generates net gains, it can be concluded that, all else being
considered, that the Government of Senegal and the World Bank are receiving positive returns on
their dollars invested in this program. The nutrition enhancement program was a success; resources
were efficiently allocated and the program socially improved societal welfare.

Explanatory note

To derive an estimate of annual cost to household for health care provided to children with specific
malnutrition related disease this is used:

                                                    =  ΣxiPi

  Where
EAC: estimate of the annual households health spending (cost) for children under the age of five,
that is attributable to Malnutrition.
CAD: is the number of Cases Avoided or Treated.
P: is the Percentage of treated cases among all or one of the three diseases targeted in this analysis.
X: is the Cost of treating Malnutrition related disease.

                                       X =  ∗ ℎ  ∗ )

 Where
FTC: Full Treatment Cost is the average total expenditure per patient incurred for the treatment
of a specific disease.
RRM: is the Relative Role of Malnutrition in children as compared to all factors related to this
specific disease.

Data on Prevalence and treatment of ARI, Malaria and Diarrhea, collected from Senegal DHS-
MICS 2010-2011 excluded advice and treatment sought at private pharmacy, shop and traditional
practitioners. However, the last National Health Accounts in Senegal reveals that 49% of
Household health expenditure occurred at private pharmacy and traditional practitioners12.

In order to accurately reflect the real cost avoided; the initial additional cost of treating the
malnutrition related diseases (considered in this study) was adjusted upwardly by a factor 49% to
arrive to a more realistic cost saving accrued to household as result of the project’s interventions.

Social discount: By spending $ 68,000,000 on nutrition interventions, the country did not have
that amount to spend on other programs, and thus there is an additional opportunity cost that should
be recognized in the analysis. The money spent could have been invested to earn returns. The
present value of a dollar to be received in the future is always less than 100 cents (Rhoads, 1980).
In order to incorporate this concept of time value of money, CBA converts all monetary values to
their equivalent value at the beginning of the project, in year 1 (present value). A discount rate of
5% was used in this analysis.

Key assumption: Beneficiaries who practice optimal nutritional behavior and the community
reached by the program will continue to practice these behaviors and maintain dietary
improvement over, at least, the next 20 years from the beginning of the program.

(if any)

A Beneficiary Assessment was conducted at the end of Phase I (2005) indicating high levels of
satisfaction with the provided services. A second BA was conducted in 2012 when a larger cash
transfer scheme was piloted by CLM. The project provided the platform for informing women
about the cash transfer schedule of payment, the amount they were expected to receive and the
logistics surrounding the actual transfer including the need to bring an identity card. Beneficiaries
expressed high levels of satisfaction with the pilot services.

Annex 6. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

The PRN II project has been well implemented with the support of all partners both at the
international level (World Bank, UNICEF, WFP, GAIN, MI), national level (technical ministries)
and at the decentralized level (Local Government).

In analyzing the implementation process, some points should be emphasized:

      In terms of constraints encountered during the implementation, it should be mentioned that
       the delay in the provision of micronutrient powders, which caused a delay in the start of
       home fortification interventions, the main difficulty was in the control of the procurement
       process.

Many good points have been noted on the implementation process including:

      The top-level government commitment to support the fight against malnutrition resulting
       in the contribution from the state budget to the PRN;
      Collaboration between different technical partners that are involved in all stages of the
       implementation process - from the design phase to conducting monitoring and evaluation
       activities;
      The involvement and leadership of the World Bank at all stages of the process, particularly
       during the phase of design and development of the evaluation plan where technical support
       was instrumental in achieving the objectives of the project PRN II;
      The strong commitment of decentralized structures especially the establishment of control
       measures for monitoring activities on the ground.

In the outlook for Senegal, the great interest in nutrition that the Government of Senegal continues
to have, should be noted. Indeed, the results of the PRN II project have been disseminated even
beyond the borders of Senegal. Today several countries are inspired by the implementation
arrangements of the nutrition interventions that have been developed in Senegal through the
fruitful partnership between the Government of Senegal and IDA.

CLM also wishes through its partnership with the World Bank to continue scaling up core
interventions and pro-nutrition activities, which takes into account the fight against determinants
of malnutrition in areas affected by economic shocks. In these areas, some households face real
difficulties in accessing certain basic needs and face multiple challenges including climate change.
The continuation of the PRN will significantly contribute to the achievement of sustainable
development objectives by supporting some of the most vulnerable groups (women and children
under five years) and strengthening community resilience.
