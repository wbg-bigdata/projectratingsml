                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The project continues to make significant progress in piloting a partnership between the Government and a number of fishing communities for more sustainable coastal fisheries. As
                         of today, the fishing communities in the four pilot sites (Benty, Foundiougne, Ngaparou and Ouakam) are highly involved in the implementation of local fisheries management
                         measures (e.g. closed seasons to fishing, use of larger fishing nets, no-fishing zones, submersion of artificial reefs, etc.) in order to help rehabilitate the coastal fish stocks. The
                         communities are continuing to report benefits from these co-management measures, such as an improvement of the catches in quantity and quality, and longer fishing seasons in
                         some cases. In Benty and Foundiougne, the fishing communities are working with the Government to prepare a number of new and additional fisheries co-management initiatives
                         (creation of Local Marine Protected Areas) to continue to enhance the fisheries resources in the nearby waters.

                         To support the communities in these four sites to implement these fisheries management measures, local and participative fisheries surveillance operations have been organized and
                         financed by the project, to contact the relevant authorities concerning any fishing activities in prohibited zones. The number of infractions with the new fishing rules put in place by the
                         communities has decreased as a result. To ensure that the communities capture more of the benefits of improved fish catch, the project is continuing to support them to add more
                         value to the fish products, through small grants to the local associations of fishers. At the same time, the project is providing support in the communities to diversify the economies, to
                         contribute to reduced fishing pressure on the resources to support their rehabilitation. These four pilots are now being replicated by the Government in 8 new sites in the central
                         coastal region from the Cap Vert Peninsula to the Saloum River Delta, with support from the Sustainable Management of Fish Resources Project (GDRH) financed by the World Bank
                         and Global Environment Facility (GEF).

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         The Government is working with the National Center for Oceanographic Research to collect data from the four pilot sites to better quantify the results and impacts of the fisheries
                         resource management measures supported by the project (for example increases in revenues to fishing households). Improving the monitoring and evaluation activities and the
                         communication of the results to the communities, will be a priority of the Government in the coming months, together with the replication of these four sites to additional areas.
