               Restructuring Paper – Extension of Closing Date

1. The closing date for the Senegal Integrated Marine and
Coastal Resources Management Project (GIRMaC), IDA Credit
No. 3998 (P086480), will be extended from December 1, 2011
until May 1st, 2012.

2. At present, the project is rated “satisfactory? with respect to
both Development Objective Achievement and Implementation
Progress. The IDA credit still has US$1.109.408 in undisbursed
funds. Overall project objectives continue to be achievable as
progress in the project implementation remains satisfactory.

3. The Government of Senegal, by a letter dated September 7,
2011, requested an extension of the closing date for the IDA
Credit in order to allow the project to complete the two national
fisheries management plans. The work was delayed due to the
fact that the lead technical specialist of the firm fell ill during the
work and needed to be replaced. As a result of these delays, the
Government now expects the work to be completed by May 2012,
and has therefore requested an extension of the closing date for
the payment of the contract of this firm. Given that completion of
these two management plans is one of the key performance
indicators of the project, and the extension of the closing date for
this contract would not require additional management costs since
the Bank's other fisheries investments (GDRH and WARFP) can
support Government supervision, the team has sought
management approval to extend the closing date of the credit.

4.   This is the second extension of the Integrated Marine and
Coastal Resources Management Project, IDA Credit No. 3998 -
P086480. Including the extension of 18 months already approved
as part of the mid-term restructuring in May 2010, the total
extension of the original closing date is 23 months.
