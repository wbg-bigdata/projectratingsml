                         Implementation Status Overview
                         As of today, the fishing communities in the four pilot sites (Bétenty, Foundiougne, Ngaparou and Ouakam) are highly involved in the implementation of local fisheries management
                         measures (e.g. closed seasons to fishing, use of larger fishing nets, no-fishing zones, submersion of artificial reefs, etc.) in order to help rehabilitate the coastal fish stocks. The
                         communities are continuing to report benefits from these co-management measures, such as an improvement of the catches in quantity and quality, and longer fishing seasons in
                         some cases. In Bétenty and Foundiougne, the fishing communities are working with the Government to prepare a number of new and additional fisheries co-management initiatives
                         (creation of Local Marine Protected Areas) to continue to enhance the fisheries resources in the nearby waters.

                         The project is finally coming to a close in May 2012 after making solid progress in piloting a partnership between the Government and a number of fishing communities for more
                         sustainable coastal fisheries.
