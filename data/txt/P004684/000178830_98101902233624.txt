INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE KINGDOM OF THAILAND
FOR THE PHITSANULOK IRRIGATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Kingdom of Thailand for the equivalent of US$95 million to help finance
the Philsanulok Irrigation Project. The loan would have a term of 30 years,
including seven years of grace, with interest at 8-1/2 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects of
Thailand" (542-TH) was distributed on October 23, 1974 (R74-212). An
economic mission has just returned from Thailand and its report is expected
to be distributed to the Executive Directors and the members of the Consultative
Group for Thailand in October; the next meeting of the Consultative Group is
tentatively scheduled for November this year. Basic data are given in Annex
I.
Political Situation
3.        In the period following the overthrow of the military government of
Field Marshalls Thanom and Prapass in October 1973, pent-up social pressures
were released, new ideas aired, and previously unrepresented social groups -
farmers, students, laborers and the small business community - staged various
forms of protest in support of their interests. The new Government under
Prime Minister Sanya Dhamasakdi maintained the free enterprise orientation of
the past but was more responsive to the claims of lower income groups than
the previous government. Although it avoided some decisions on controversial
longer-term matters because it felt itself to be an interim Government and
did not wish to commit its elected successor, the Sanya Government ran the
day-to-day affairs of the country efficiently; passed a number of significant
new laws dealing with land reform, agricultural institutions, urban planning,
and other matters; and successfully broLght in a new constitution and held
elections in January 1975.
4.        In the elections, twenty-two parties won seats in the National
Assembly, with the Democratic Party winning the largest number (72 out of
269). *The Democratic Party leader, Seni Pramoj, was chosen to form a
government in February but failed to secure a vote of confidence in the
National Assembly. In March, a coalition led by Kukrit Pramoj (Seni's
younger brother) formed a government and won a vote of ccnfidence by a
narrow margin. The Kukrit Government has not yet had time to formulate
detailed economic and social policies. To date, the principal new policy



thrust has been an attempt to decentralize some government expenditures by
transferring the equivalent of US$125 million to tambon (village) councils
for expenditure on rural works.
Current Fconomic Situation
5.        Thailand's real GDP expanded at an average rate of 8 percent during
the 1960s with agriculture growing by 5-1/2 percent per year; prices were
virtually stable; open unemployment was minimal; and the balance of payments
was in surplus. Recent years have been more difficult, however. The growth
rate has slowed to just under 6 percent as a result of rapid shifts in ex-
port demand, stagnation of public investment since 1970, and adverse weather
and shortage of agricultural inputs. Prices were driven up sharply in
1972-74, largely by massive increases in import and export prices. Although
the international agricultural commodity boom allowed Thailand to weather
the immediate adjustment to higher prices of imported petroleum with less
difficulty than many other developing countries, Thailand's terms of trade
deteriorated sharply in 1974 and are likely to continue to worsen in the
years ahead. In addition, the current worldwide recession, together with
the uncertainty resulting from political events and major cost-price changes
in Thailand, ended the 1973 surge in private investment and caused signifi-
cant unemployment to emerge in 1974.
Structural Problems
6.        Thailand's favorable performance during the last decade was not
without weaknesses. The rate of population increase has averaged over 3 per-
cent per year, and income disparities between regions have tended to widen as
Bangkok and the Central Region have advanced more rapidly than the rest of
the country. Agricultural output increased largely because new land was put
under cultivation rather than because of improved productivity, and therefore
population pressure on land has already developed in some areas. Because of
rapid population growth, the dependency ratio is high and the burden on the
government budget to provide education, health, and other necessary services
is heavy. The annual increment to the labor force has risen by more than
50% in the last decade to a level of 450,000 workers at present and will
rise further to around 650,000 by 1985 as a result of population growth that
has already taken place. In the past, agriculture has provided jobs for
about half the new entrants to the labor force by extension of the area under
cultivation; industrial employment has grown slowly and still accounts for
only 7 percent of the work force. In the future, however, as new land
suitable for cultivation is used up, creating new jobs will be more difficult
as they will have to be generated by the intensification of agricultural
production and the rapid expansion of labor intensive industries.
Development Planning and Objectives
7.        Thailand's Third Five-Year Plan (1972-76) was the first attempt of
the Government to deal with the above structural problems. It set the
obj ective of further rapid economic growth (7 percent per year); emphasized



- 3 -
the intensification of agriculture to achieve continued agricultural growth
of over 5 percent per year; stipulated greater spending on education and
other social services, the reduction of income disparities and regional
development, and employment creation and population planning. Some improve-
ments have been made, for example, a recent Bank population sector mission
found indications that the population growth rate was beginning to decline,
but difficulties in planning and budgeting and the need for strengthening
of institutions to prepare and implement projects and expenditure programs
in new sectors have limited achievement of the Plan's objectives - particu-
larly in agriculture. Although recent economic changes have outdated the
Plan's macro-economic balance of payments and public finance framework, its
objectives are still valid and are likely to be reaffirmed in the Fourth
Plan (1977-81) on which preparation work has just started.
Public Finance
8.        Domestic savings have been comparatively high at 22-23% of GDP,
and the Government's fiscal performance has been satisfactory. However, a
more activist government expenditure policy is needed to achieve the country's
development objectives. The need for increased public expenditure is great:
despite a planned increase, expenditures on agriculture, education, and other
social services declined relative to GDP in fiscal years 1973-74, and public
capital expenditures have not increased in real terms since 1971. Last year,
government revenues rose substantially in real terms, but this revenue in-
crease was absorbed by reduction of the deficit to maintain an appropriate
deflationary fiscal position in the face of sharp increases in external prices.
In the future, the Government will have to intensify its fiscal effort if it
is to finance necessary public expenditures; an IBRD Public Finance Survey
in late 1974 offered detailed recommendations on tax changes.
Balance of Payments and External Borrowing Program
9.        Thailand's balance of payments position is relatively favorable at
present. Sharply higher commodity prices and greater private capital inflows
allowed Thailand to absorb the $400 million increase in the cost of imported
petroleum in 1974 and maintain reserves at a level of 5-1/2 months imports.
In addition, the rapid rise in export earnings in the last three years has cut
Thailand's debt service ratio from 18 percent in 1971 to 11 percent in 1974,
of which only two percentage points are public debt service. Consequently,
the country's medium term debt servicing capacity has substantially increased.
However, after improving by 27% in 1973, Thailand's terms of trade deteriorated
steadily throughout 1974, falling back to the 1972 level by year end, as
export prices stabilized at mid-year and then declined and import prices
continued to rise. Largely because of the deterioration in the terms of
trade, a balance of payments deficit is likely in 1975. The latest Bank staff
projections of comodity prices indicate that Thailand's external terms of
trade will deteriorate for the remainder of the decade. Thus, there will be
a need for larger public foreign capital inflows in the future and, in order
to attain this, it will be necessary to increase loan commitments as rapidly
as possible. Considering all these factors Thailand should have no difficulty
servicing the additional debt which is likely to be contracted in the next
few years.



-4-
10.       Apart from the Bank the Government has only limited possibilities
of borrowing abroad on suitable terms to help meet the economy's foreign
exchange requirements and carry out the public investment program. The
Government's priorities are shifting towards increased investment in the
agricultural and social sectors, which have a comparatively low foreign
exchange component, and, if the Bank is to provide an appropriate volume of
support to Thailand's development program, it will find it necessary to
finance a portion of local expenditures on some projects.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN THAILAND
11.       Thailand first borrowed from the Bank in 1950 and has received 30
loans amounting to $613.3 million, net of cancellations. Most of these have
been for transportation ($186.1 million), irrigation ($69.1 million) and
power ($166.0 million) with, in addition, one for a dual-purpose power and
irrigation project ($65.8 million). The remaining loans have been for water
supply ($55 million), education ($21.3 million), industry ($13 million) and
telecommunications ($37 million). In addition, Thailand has received IDA
credits of $19.5 million for education and $12.5 million for irrigation
improvement. In general, Bank-financed projects have been carried out in
accordance with expectations; however, Credit 369-TH (Third Education
Project) is behind schedule because of administrative problems and lengthy
bidding procedures; under Loan 898-TH (Fourth Railway Project), the borrower
is facing major financial difficulties; and under Loan 870-TH (Fifth Highway
Project) some contracts have been terminated due to inadequate escalation
provisions and new bidding is required. Loans 702-TH (Third Bangkok Port
Project) and 1021-TH (Bangkok Water Supply Project) have overcome their
initial start up problems. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank
loans and IDA credits and of IFC investments as of May 31, 1975, as well
as notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
12.       The Bank is diversifying its lending program in Thailand. In the
next few years a smaller proportion of lending is planned for transportation
and power projects, while projects to support a broad range of agriculture
development, rural works and infrastructure, family planning, education and
small and medium scale industries would account for about two-thirds of the
proposed program. Increasingly, projects are selected to spread development
benefits over a wider area, and one of the main functions of the Regional
Mission in Bangkok is to assist the Government in developing projects which
will achieve this. Our readiness to finance some local costs in appropriate
cases will enable the Bank to participate more fully in projects in agricul-
ture, the social sectors and projects having significant social benefits.
13.       In FY76 about 90%, by dollar amounts, of projects proposed for
Bank lending are expected to benefit the countryside, where most low income
people live. In addition to the irrigation project that is the subject of
this report, a rural development project and a livestock improvement project,
both in the northeast region, a rubber replanting project in the southern
region, and a rural electrification project are planned for presentation to



- 5 -
the Executive Directors. Also, an education project which is largely directed
to improving the quality of education in the rural areas is being reformulated
for the Bank's consideration. An industrial estates project to assist the
location of small and medium scale industry outside of Bangkok and a tele-
communications project to improve communications with the outlying regions
are also under preparation.
14.       On May 31, 1975, IBRD loans and IDA credits disbursed and out-
standing to Thailand amounted to $288.1 million, representing about 30 per-
cent of the country's estimated total external debt and about 60 percent
of the public debt. The level of Bank commitments is expected to increase
substantially over the next five years, but loans and credits disbursed
and outstanding are not expected to exceed 35 percent of total external
debt by 1978. Servicing of the Bank debt in 1978 is projected to account
for about 55 percent of the country's public debt service. These relatively
high ratios reflect the fact that IBRD has been the principal source of the
Government's external borrowings, which, however, represent only a small
portion of Thailand's total external debt.
15.       IFC has made two equity investments in the Industrial Finance
Corporation of Thailand totalling $380,000, a loan to and an investment in
the Siam Cement group totalling $22.08 million and a loan of $300,000 to
Concrete Products Ltd. IFC plans to present to the Executive Directors a
loan of about $15 million to Siam Cement Co. Prospects for other IFC
operations are reasonably good; potential projects include a pulp and paper
project based on bamboo and bagasse, a zinc mining and refinery project, the
development of privately sponsored industrial estates and a sugar refinery.
PART III - THE SECTOR
General
16.       As Thailand's economy developed and diversified over the last
decade, agriculture's share of GDP declined from 44% to about 30%. However,
agriculture still employs three-fourths of the labor force and agricultural
products provide about two-thirds ($1 billion) of merchandise export
earnings. Agricultural production grew at an average rate of 5-1/2% per year
during the last decade and was considerably diversified as the output of
maize, cassava, sugar cane and kenaf expanded rapidly. This good performance
was largely the result of (a) an increase of 45% in the cultivated area
between 1960 and 1972 as an additional 500,000 hectares (ha) were brought
under cultivation each year, and (b) private traders recognizing new export
possibilities and farmers changing cropping patterns and introducing new
crops in response to price incentives.
17.       Thai agriculture is largely based on owner-operated small holdings,
and highly skewed income distribution by size of farm has not been an import-
ant problem. Farmers with holdings under 5 ha tend to get more output per
ha than farmers with larger holdings and usually earn additional income from



- 6 -
off-farm work so that, whereas the smallest 48% of farms (i.e., those under
2.4 ha) occupy 16% of the land, they still receive 41% of total cash income.
The average size of holding has apparently not changed much over time because
of new land brought under cultivation. There are very few landless workers
as expansion of the new area under cultivation has provided land for new
entrants in the agricultural work force with little fragmentation of holdings.
18.       Average yields are low in Thailand:   fertilizer consumption is
among the lowest in Asia, improved seed-fertilizer technology has been
adopted only to a limited extent, and double cropping, while steadily spread-
ing, has been extended to only a small part of the irrigable area. The
potential for intensifying production is great, but steps must be taken to
realize this potential through the development of irrigation and improvement
in cultivation practices.
19.       Thailand has a large stake in increasing yields of rice--its major
crop--because much of the soils in the Central Plain are suitable for rice
and little else, and paddy has the most immediate potential for raising
the productivity and incomes of a large number of farmers. Domestic rice
requirements are growing by 3% per year; and expansion of Thailand's rice
exports to retain its present share in world rice trade would require an
increase in the exportable surplus from the present average level of 1.5
million tons, out of a total production of about 9 million tons, to at least
2 million tons by 1980. Supplying domestic and export markets will require
production increases averaging 3.4% per year, in comparison to the recent
average of 2.9% per year.
20.       In the past, the main obstacle to large-scale use of fertilizer on
paddy has been its unprofitability to the farmer: a reflection, on the one
hand, of the high cost of fertilizer (prior to 1974 because of the domestic
import monopoly, and more recently because of the sharp increase in inter-
national fertilizer prices) and, on the other, of domestic rice prices which
have been held substantially below the world level by taxes levied on rice
exports (generally called the rice premium) and other export taxes and controls.
It became clear that if farmers were to have an effective incentive for the
orderly intensification of rice production, if rural-urban income disparities
were to be reduced, and if the availability of adequate rice for export and
the domestic market were to be assured, the Government would have to modify
its pricing policies. The Government recognizes this need and is also taking
some steps to provide greater incentives to farmers. In addition to abolishing
the monopoly on fertilizer imports, the Government has allowed the domestic
rice price to double in the last two years and has established a Farmers
Marketing Organization, which is to purchase rice and other commodities
directly from farmers. Furthermore, it is procuring fertilizer for subsidized
sale to farmers and is extending loans to agricultural cooperatives to construct
rice silos and rice mills, giving members a better opportunity to sell their
produce at higher prices than they otherwise could obtain. In January 1975,
a Seeds Certification Law was enacted, and the Government has requested a
loan and grant totalling about $4.0 million from USAID to help finance a
project to expand the production, processing and distribution of certified



-7-
seeds. The project follows the recommendations of a i-AO/IBRD Cooperative
Program project preparation report and the USAID loan is expected to be
approved in principle shortly.
Irrigated Agriculture
21.       As the supply of new land is depleted, irrigation will have a
key role in increasing agricultural employment, production, and crop yields,
particularly for paddy. Intensification of rice production on irrigated
land will generate significant new employment opportunities. This will
require further investments to expand the irrigated area through construc-
tion of new systems and improvements of water control and farm access in
existing systems.
22.       To improve interagency coordination in irrigation development,
the Royal Irrigation Department (RID) was transferred in 1972 to the
Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives (MOAC) from the former Ministry of
National Development, and a Central Committee for Irrigated Agriculture was
established, consisting of the heads of all the relevant departments in the
MOAC, as well as representatives of the Ministries of Interior and Finance.
The Committee determines priorities for irrigated agriculture and coordinates
activities of the various departments in the execution of irrigation projects.
23.       Improvement of existing irrigation schemes is clearly an economic
way of increasing rice production, and projects to do so are now underway in
the Chao Phya Plain (Cr. 379-TH) and in the Northeast (Cr. 461-TH). Two
projects are currently being prepared for the Bank's consideration which
would upgrade existing irrigation schemes on the Meklong River and further
expand the project in the Chao Phya Plain. Investments in new facilities
are also justified when the expected return is high.
24.       In view of the need to exploit the full potential of irrigation,
the substantial budgetary implications of irrigation development, and
possible administrative and manpower constraints to implementing a large
number of projects in the same time period, the Bank plans to assist the
Government in updating and reviewing its investment programs for irrigation
development. A mission for this purpose is scheduled for early this fall.
Rainfed Agriculture
25.       Regardless of the level of irrigation development that takes place,
for the foreseeable future the majority of Thai farmers will continue to
raise their crops under rainfed conditions. Technical improvements to
raise yields of rainfed crops are a promising way of increasing production.
In the past, rainfed agriculture has received much less attention than
irrigation and far less than it deserves. Increasing production in rainfed
areas will require appropriate price policies, improved seeds, increased
credit, and research and extension support. A Rainfed Rice Improvement
Project being financed under Credit 461-TH will strengthen the Government's
efforts to identify, test and promote techniques to obtain higher rice yields



- 8 -
in Northeast Thailand. A project aimed at more productive use of the upland
soils in the Northeast, and a livestock project in the same region which
would also help improve soil fertility through pasture development are now
under preparation.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
26.       The project is part of Thailand's Third Five-Year Social and
Economic Development Plan and would be the eighth irrigation development
project to be financed by the Bank Group in Thailand.
27.       The Sirikit Dam Project (Loan 514-TH) included feasibility studies
for irrigation development in the Nan River Valley and these studies, which
were completed by RID in 1970 and were further revised in 1972, served as
the basis for appraisal of the project. An appraisal mission visited Thai-
land in April 1973; its report was completed just before the sharp rise in
oil and commodity prices. Accordingly, it was agreed with the Government
to update the appraisal in light of expected cost escalation, and an updating
mission reappraised the project in June 1974. The proposed loan was nego-
tiated in Washington from May 19, 1975 to May 24, 1975. The Government
delegation was led by the Deputy Minister of Finance, H.E. Thinakorn
Bhandhugravi; he was assisted by the Undersecretary of State for Agriculture,
Dr. Prida Karnsut, and the Deputy Director-General of RID, Khun Sunthorn
Ruanglek. A report entitled "Thailand - Appraisal of the Phitsanulok Irri-
gation Project" (248b-TH) is being circulated separately to the Executive
Directors. Annex III provides a loan and project summary.
28.       The Phitsanulok project area is in the southern portion of the
Northern Region within the provinces of Phitsanulok, Phichit and Nakorn
Sawan, along the Nan River. The net irrigable area of the project is about
139,000 ha (out of a gross 212,000 ha). The project has been divided into
two phases. The first phase will provide irrigation facilities to 97,000 ha
(net) located on the west bank of the Nan River. The second phase will
provide irrigation facilities to 42,000 ha (net) located on the east bank
of the river, and may also be proposed for Bank financing at a later stage.
The project which is the subject of this report is the first phase and includes:
(a) construction of a diversion dam and navigation lock on the
Nan River, 30 kms north of the city of Phitsanulok;
(b) construction of an unlined canal system, flood control works,
drains and service roads to serve the project area;
(c) establishment of pilot projects to develop techniques of on-
farm development for demonstration and for training of extension
personnel;



- 9 -
(d)  on-farm development consisting of the planning and construction
of irrigation and drainage ditches, farm roads, land leveling
and the realignment of farm boundaries where required, and the
issuance of land titles;
(e) provision of necessary agricultural supporting services to
farmers, including extension, research, seed multiplication,
credit, a fisheries development scheme and surveys on water-
borne diseases.
29.       The Project would also provide for studies to be carried out with
the assistance of consultants: a water resources study of the Chao Phya and
Meklong River Basins, an administration and organization study of the MOAC's
activities related to irrigation development, and studies for further irri-
gation projects. Consultants would also be engaged to assist project staff
with the planning, design and implementation of the works and the detailed
preparation of a feasibility study for the second stage project, as well as
for further irrigation projects.
Farm Size and Land Tenure
30.       About 16,000 farm families, averaging 6.5 members per family, or
a total farm population of about 104,000, live in the project area. The
population generally lives in hamlets, usually located on the highest ground
adjacent to the rivers. The average farm size is relatively large by Thai
standards - about 6 ha, with 70% of the farms having more than 4 ha. Most
holdings are fragmented into two or three plots. The degree of fragmentation,
however, is not serious. About 80% of all cultivated land in the project
area is owner operated, the rest usually being rented to close relatives.
While the farm size distribution is rather skewed, it is less so than in
most Asian countries. Moreover, the larger farms usually have a high pro-
portion of poor quality lowland.
31.       Only about 20% of the farmers in the project area have full title
deeds, recognized for legal transfer or as security for credit. The remain-
ing farmers have occupancy certificates of various kinds. Cadastral surveys,
to be carried out as part of the project, would permit the issuance of title
deeds to all farmers; this would remove most problems of farmers' eligibility
for institutional credit.
Project Organization
32.       RID would be responsible for planning, design and construction
of all civil works, including on-farm development. RID is a well-managed
department with long experience in water resources development and has success-
fully executed a wide range of irrigation projects. The Central Committee
for Irrigated Agriculture (para. 22) would provide the necessary coordination.
To streamline procedures for project administration, a Project Executive
Committee would be established with authority to make all major decisions



- 10 -
required for project implementation and to supervise the overall project
administration. The Minister of Agriculture and Cooperatives would be the
chairman; relevant ministries, departments and agencies would appoint the
other members.
33.       The Undersecretary of State for Agriculture would be appointed as
Project Coordinator. He would meet periodically with representatives of the
departments engaged in project implementation to resolve any routine coordina-
tion problems. The Deputy Director-General of RID would be appointed as
Project Director and would be responsible for directing the implementation
of project works and coordination with other agencies. A Project Manager,
witlh staff assigned exclusively to the project, would be responsible for all
design and construction activities. RID would promote the formation and
strengthening of farmers' associations which would operate and maintain on-farm
works for each tertiary command area. A Technical Advisory Committee con-
sisting of representatives of the research stations in the area, extension
services and project management would be set up to determine priorities
and programs of agricultural research to be carried out under the project.
A Provincial Coordinating Committee would be established in each of the
provinces included in the project, under the chairmanship of the respective
Governors; each Committee would include the senior field representatives
of RID, the Department of Extension and branch managers of the Bank of Agri-
culture and Agricultural Cooperatives (BAAC). A Project Monitoring Unit
would periodically carry out surveys of the agro-economic and social impact
of the Project.
Extension
34.       The Department of Agricultural Extension of MOAC would establish a
separate extension and farmer training section in the project area. Under
the supervision of a senior Project Extension Officer, extension services
would be reinforced, patterned on the "farmer foremen" scheme success-fully
introduced in two Bank Group-financed projects (Credits 379-TH and 461-TH).
Under the scheme about 100 farmers would be selected as "farmer foremen"
from among the more progressive farmers of the project area and would be
trained in the pilot projects to provide technical support to other farmers
in the project area on a ratio of about 1:200. These "farmer foremen" would
work under the supervision of ten extension agents and several subject matter
specialists.
Seeds and Credit
35.       In implementing the seeds project submitted to USAID for
financing (para. 20), the Government has agreed to ensure an adequate
supply of high quality seeds for the project area. Credit requirements for
the farmers in the project area are expected to increase ten times (from
a present level of about $1 million a year to about $10 million a year).
The Government has agreed to cause BAAC to increase its branch office staff
in the project area, and to ensure that this staff shall cooperate closely
with the ProJect Extension Services. It would also cause BAAC to make



- 11 -
available funds, both short-term and long-term, as needed to meet adequately
the credit requirements of the farmers served by the Project.
Project Costs and Financing
36.       The total estimated cost of the project is $210 million of which
about $88 million would be in foreign exchange. Depending on the status
of investigations, physical contingencies of between 5% and 20% have been
included in the estimates. Expected price increases were derived by applying
the following rates of annual price escalation: (a) for civil works, 12%
for calendar years 1975-79 and 10% thereafter, and (b) for equipment and
services, 12% for 1975, 10% for 1976, 8% for 1977-79, and 7% thereafter.
Expected price increases account for 55% of the total cost plus physical
contingencies.
37.       The Bank loan of $95 million now proposed would finance 45% of the
total cost of the project, including about $85 million in foreign exchange
costs and $10 million in local currency requirements. It would be disbursed
during the first 8 years of project development. The Government would
contribute $95 million equivalent towards the local currency requirements
during this period, and has further agreed to finance the entire cost of
the subsequent on-farm development of the last 35,000 hectares included in
the project. This will require a further $20 million, including about $3
million of foreign exchange costs.
Procurement
38.       Equipment and vehicles for force account construction and other
project activities costing about $15.5 million would be procured after
international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank Group guidelines.
A 15% preference margin, or the prevailing customs duty, if lower, would be
extended to local manufacturers in the evaluation of bids. Procurement of
off-the-shelf items not suitable for international tendering, costing less
than $10,000 each, and up to an aggregate amount of $500,000, would be
purchased through normal government procurement procedures satisfactory to
the Bank.
39.       Contracts for the construction of the diversion dam ($16.2 million)
and the irrigation and drainage systems ($53.8 million) would be subject to
international competitive bidding. Drainage and flood protection works
($6.5 million) and on-farm development ($27.1 million) would not be suitable
for international tendering. The drainage and flood control works consist
of dredging natural channels; thus, it would be uneconomical to prepare
detailed designs and specifications, and measure quantities. Therefore,
it has been agreed that RID would carry out these works on force account.
For on-farm development, the works would need to be planned and executed
at short notice to coincide with the acceptance of boundary realignment
schemes by the landholders in many cases, as well as to avoid the growing
season and adverse weather conditions. For these reasons, the on-farm



- 12 -
works cannot be grouped into contracts of sufficient size to be attractive
to international contractors; thus it has been agreed that up to 75% of
these works would be carried out by RID on force account. However, it is
expected that most of the works in the later years of the project would be
undertaken by local contractors. Contracts for on-farm development and for
buildings would be awarded on the basis of competitive bidding advertised
locally and in accordance with local procedures, which are satisfactory to
the Bank. Foreign contractors would be eligible to bid.
Disbursements
40.       Loan disbursements would be made at the rate of 100% against the
cif cost of directly imported equipment, or the ex-factory price net of taxes
for equipment manufactured locally, and at the rate of 65% of total expend-
itures for imported equipment procured locally. For consultants' services,
disbursements would cover 100% of foreign or 85% of total costs. Disburse-
ments for civil works carried out by contractors would be against 100% of
foreign expenditures for mobilization costs and 43% of the remaining
expenditures. Disbursements for civil works to be carried out by force
account would be 43% of total expenditures. It is expected that disburse-
ments would be completed by December, 1982.
Cost Recovery
41.       To determine the farmers' repayment capacity on irrigation projects,
the Government agreed under Credit 379-TH to: (a) initiate a cost recovery
study which, before May 1975, would propose levels of charges and collection
procedures; and (b) review the proposals with IDA and impose and commence to
collect the agreed charges in the Chao Phya project within two years of
project completion. Preliminary results of this study show that a moderate
level of cost recovery is possible, especially for the larger farmers, with-
out unduly reducing incentives to adopt new agricultural techniques. However,
the study makes no recommendations with regard to amounts to be recovered
from different size farm units, the appropriate mechanism of recovery, or
the relationship between the water charges level and the prevailing tax on
rice exports. The latter is of particular significance, inasmuch as it would
affect farm-gate prices and repayment capability. An agreement was reached
during negotiations to extend the study's completion date to June 1976, in
order to enable the Government to take these factors into account. Assur-
ances were obtained that the Government would:
(a) submit to the Bank not later than June 1977 proposals for
establishing and collecting charges as set forth in (b)
below; and
(b) promptly take all measures (including further legislation
or amendments of existing legislation), which would be
necessary to impose and collect not later than three years
after completion of the on-farm works in each area of about
1,000 ha served by a secondary canal:



- 13 -
(i) charges at levels sufficient to recover on a current
basis, upon completion of all project works, the costs
of operating and maintaining said works; and
(ii) an annual charge sufficient to recover the capital
cost of on-farm works and a reasonable proportion of
the capital cost of the other project works, on terms
and under procedures satisfactory to the Bank, taking
into account farmers' incentives and capacity to pay.
(Section 4.03 of draft Loan Agreement)
Benefits and Justification
42.       The project would make a significant contribution towards meeting
the Government's objective of increasing rice yields and cropping intensities
as well as promoting crop diversification. It would make better use of past
investments in irrigation by utilizing water stored in the Sirikit dam. It
would raise the income level of the rural population and generate new employ-
ment opportunities in the southern part of Northern Thailand, in line with
the regional objectives of Government economic policy. Through the provi-
sion of perennial irrigation, on-farm development and supporting agricultural
services, it would result in a considerable increase in cropping intensity
and yields of rice and a wide variety of other crops in an area currently
under rainfed subsistence farming. The project would also generate signifi-
cant employment opportunities. While at present the area provides the equi-
valent of 14,500 jobs a year in agriculture, the number is expected to
increase to about 57,000 at full development. In addition, there would also
be a significant increase in employment opportunities in the services sector.
43.       Under the proposed cropping pattern, future production of major
crops after completion of the project is expected to increase as follows:
Production
Present       Future
----('000 tons)----
Paddy                         105           555
Maize                          24            31
Soybean                        -             15
Mungbean                         6           23
44.       While there is considerable variation in farm size in the project
area, the variation of farm incomes per hectare is relatively small. This
is primarily due to the fact that farmers with large holdings have to hire
a high proportion of their total labor requirement. The small farmers, on
the other hand, can usually earn money working off the farm in their spare
time. Nevertheless, on the basis of farm income estimates, it can be
reasonably assumed that about one-third of the farm families in this area
presently belong to the lowest 40% income group in Thailand. Without taking
into account income from work off the farm, annual farm incomes are estimated



-14 -
to increase from $430 to $965 for a 2 ha farm and from $1,060 to $2,560
for a 6 ha farm at full development. Correspondingly, per capita incomes
would rise from about $66 to $148 and from about $163 to $394 for similar
sized farms.
45.       The annual gross value of production is expected to reach $70
million at full development, 14 years after project commencement, compared
with a current level of $20 million. Using adjusted border prices, the
incremental economic benefits would be $35 million per annum at full devel-
opment, giving an economic rate of return of about 20%. This analysis does
not account for substantial secondary benefits from facilities to be cons-
tructed under the project (e.g., an improved transportation network), benefits
from livestock production or returns from crops such as cotton and sugar,
which might be introduced and which are more profitable than those presently
included in the cropping pattern. The quality of the available data does not
warrant a refinement of the economic analysis to incorporate these additional
factors, but it is reasonable to assume that if they could have been quantified
and evaluated, the economic rate of return on the project would have been
significantly higher.
46.       The rate of return for the full development of 139,000 ha, assuming
the second stage development to begin in 1980, would be 21%. The second
stage alone would have a higher rate of return, about 32%, because it would
take advantage of investments in the diversion dam and main canal to be
constructed under the present project.
Effects on the Environment
47.       Irrigation would tend to raise the level of groundwater in the
area, thus increasing the supply of water in wells. The project would have
some positive and some negative effects on the production of fish and frogs:
farmers would use the borrow pits created in the construction of canals and
roads for breeding fish and frogs. but elsewhere, fish production would suffer
from the drainage of swamps and the greater use of chemical pesticides. A
fisheries development scheme would be prepared as part of the proposed project.
48.       Schistosomiasis (bilharzia), a potential health problem in irriga-
tion projects, does not exist in the area but monitoring would be conducted
to detect the outbreak of this and other water-associated diseases. The cost
of this monitoring has been included in the project costs.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Loan 514-TH, Sirikit Dam Project; $26 Million Loan of September 19, 1967;
Closing date: original, June 30, 1973; current, June 30, 1975.
The works under this project have been completed, with the closure
of the dam being carried out on schedule in June 1971. Substantial increases
in the principal civil works contract (+41%), which resulted from unforeseen
adverse foundation conditions, have been largely compensated by savings on
other items and the total cost of the project is estimated at $78 million,
as against $76 million at appraisal (+2.5%). The closing date has been
postponed to June 30, 1975, to allow for settlement of claims by the contrac-
tor.
Loan 626-_H   Fourth Highway Project:   $23 Million Loan of June 27, 1969;
Closing date: original, December 31, 1973; current September 30, 1975.
The project has been satisfactorily completed except for supple-
mental works on one of the primary highways, consisting of strengthening
of pavement on some sections over exceptionally bad soil conditions, and
construction of fencing and guard rail for controlling access. The strength-
ening of pavement could not be carried out until initial settlement of embank-
ments had taken place. The Bank, at the Government's request, has extended
the closing date to September 30, 1975. There has been a substantial savings
in the cost of the project, chiefly because bid prices were lower than
expected, due to keen bidding and almost completely stable prices in Thailand
during the main construction period, and savings on consultants' services
through the firms employing a substantial proportion of local staff. At the
Government's request, a total of US$6 million of the loan was cancelled.
Loan 655-TH, First EGAT Power Project; $46.5 Million Loan of February 10,
1970; Closing date: original December 31, 1974; current, June 30, 1975.
Project works have been completed. Final costs ($93.4 million)
were about 10% higher than originally estimated ($83.5 million) mainly
because of currency adjustments. Closing date has been extended to allow
the payment of retention money.
I/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken
to remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the
understanding that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation
of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Loan 702-TH, Third Bangkok Port Project; $12.5 Million Loan of August 6,
1970; Closing date: original, July 31, 1974; current, July 31, 1976.
Construction, presently about 80% completed, is expected to be
finished by December 1975. Construction work on the project which consists
of four deep-water and two lighterage berths, together with transit sheds
and ancillary facilities is proceeding satisfactorily, but somewhat behind
the original schedule. The civil engineering work was placed on a fixed-
price contract and the only significant cost overruns will be those caused
by changes in foreign exchange rates and the Government's decision to
compensate contractors on fixed-price contracts for overall increases of
construction costs after June 1974. The Closing Date has been extended
from July 31, 1974 to July 31, 1976. The financial situation of the Port
Authority is very sound.
Loan 790-TH, South Bangkok Thermal Unit No. 4 Project; $27 Million Loan
of November 11, 1971; Closing date: November 30, 1976.
Project execution is on schedule. Costs have increased by about
13% due to changes in currency exchange rates.
Loan 822-TH, Second Education Project (Kasetsart University); $15.4 Million
Loan of May 24, 1972; Closing date: June 30, 1978.
Implementation of the project has been delayed by about 18 months
due to a late appointment of the campus masterplanner and late Cabinet
approval of the executive architects' fees. Substantial progress was made
during the last six months. All sketch plans have been completed and working
drawings are now under preparation as are furniture lists. Tenders for
$2.5 million in educational equipment were opened on April 4, 1975. Accord-
ing to the latest schedule, the first civil works will be tendered in
September 1975, and construction of all buildings completed by December 1977.
Implementation of the technical assistance program is well underway.
The project is now expected to cost 27% more than the original
estimate, due to expected overruns of about $10 million for site develop-
ment and construction. Because of recent and expected future progress,
disbursement from the loan should rapidly increase during the coming year
and no postponement of the present Closing Date of June 30, 1978 would likely
be required.
Loan 864-TH, Telecommunications Project: $37 Million Loan of December 5,
1972; Closing date: December 31, 1977.
The project is now moving forward satisfactorily and it should be
practicable for the Telephone Organization of Thailand (TOT) to overcome
delays which occurred at the outset. Procurement action is well advanced
and major equipment deliveries are in progress. Increased equipment prices
have required TOT to re-plan the project financing. Additional funds are



ANNEX II
Page 5
being sought from the Japanese EX-IM' Bank and a reallocation of the proceeds
of Loan 864-TH is being considered. Approval of Government for a telephone
tariff increase is also being sought to maintain TOT's financial position
and to generate development funds.
Credit 369-TH, Third Education Project; $19.5 Million Credit of April 11,
1973; Closing date: June 30, 1978.
Implementation of the project is about one year behind schedule,
and project costs are estimated to be 28% above the appraisal estimate. The
delays are mainly caused by late recruitment of technical assistance specialists
and increased construction costs which necessitate lengthy negotiations be-
tween the Ministry of Education and the Budget Bureau. Almost all architec-
tural drawings, equipment and furniture lists and bidding documents have been
completed. The first eight civil works contracts were recently awarded. It
is expected that disbursements will accelerate slowly during the coming months.
Steps are being taken to achieve progress in technical assistance.
Loan 870-TH, Fifth Highways Project; $28.6 Million Loan of December 26, 1972;
Closing date: December 31, 1977.
Works under the project have been divided in nine contracts of which
two have been completed and four are expected to be completed shortly, only
slightly behind schedule. The remaining three contracts have been terminated
because the rapid increase in cost has led to financial problems for the
contractors since, despite the Bank's recommendation, the contracts provided
only for costs escalation on petroleum products but costs from materials,
labor and equipment, and spare parts have also escalated rapidly. These
contracts will be re-bid to complete the works. In spite of these difficulties
the project is likely to be completed no more than one year beyond the
original schedule.
Credit 379-TH, Chao Phya Irrigation Improvement Project: $5.5 Million
Credit of May 9, 1973; Closing date: June 30, 1978
Physical execution of the project is proceeding on schedule. A
program of strengthening agricultural extension services in the project by
training of progressive farmers as extension workers has been established.
Loan 898-TH, Fourth Railways Project: $15 Million Loan of June 1, 1973;
Closing date: June 30, 1977.
Due to initial delay in procurement, the project is behind schedule
by about one year. However, orders have now been placed for all items ex-
cept for rails required for track renewals. The revised investment on the
project shows an increase of about $16 million with a foreign exchange
content of about $5 million required for the purchase of rails. The Rail-
way is approaching the Government to finance the increased costs.   Tariffs
have not been adjusted to take account of substantial increases in fuel costs



ANNEX II
Page 6
and in wages. As a result, the Railway failed to earn any return in 1973/74,
and therefore did not comply with the requirement of the Loan Agreement.
Unless the Government agrees to heavy increases in tariffs and to provide for
adequate compensation for the losses incurred on uneconomic lines which are
to be operated on grounds other than commercial, the financial position of
the Railways will continue to deteriorate. The recently elected Govern-
ment is aware of this situation, although it has not taken any action as yet.
Credit 461-TH, Northeast Irrigation Improvement Project; $7 Million Credit
of February 19, 1974; Closing date: June 30, 1979.
The hiring of consultants was condition of effectiveness. Because
of delays in obtaining the Government's final approval of the consultants
contracts, due to complicated legal procedures, the original date of effective-
ness was postponed three times from May 20 to October 15, 1976. Additional
delays are being encountered in preparing contract documents due to strict
legal procedures recently enacted by the Government. Therefore, the Royal
Irrigation Department is carrying out preliminary works on force account in
the 1975-76 construction season. Completion of the project may be delayed
by about one year.
Loan 977-TH, Ban Chao Nen Hydro-Electric Project; $75 Million Loan of
April 15, 1974; Closing date: December 31, 1980.
Construction of the project is at an early stage and is proceeding
satisfactorily. The civil works contractor commenced work in March 1974, and
has mobilized equipment on site, constructed camp facilities and begun the
diversion tunnels. The Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand's (EGAT)
short-term financial position may become difficult because of a committed
expansion program based on a growth rate of electricity demand increase now
unlikely to be achieved following a tariff increase of 60% and energy con-
servation measures to combat the fuel crisis. The position will be mitigated
by EGAT's ability to raise bonds in the local market. During FY74, W45O
million ($22 million) of 5-year bonds were raised at 9-1/2% and 9%. Although
estimated operating income declined for FY74, EGAT has met its convenanted
30% contribution to construction from internal cash generation for the four
years ended FY September 1974.
Loan 992-TH, Second Industrial Finance Corporation of Thailand (IFCT) Project;
$12.0 Million Loan of June 4, 1974; Closing date: September 30, 1978.
After it was declared effective in September 1974, the $12.0 million
Bank loan to IFCT has been committed more rapidly than expected. As of May 31,
1975, about $10.0 million had been credited. Over the past year IFCT has made
commendable progress in expanding its volume of lending operations and is
working towards a diversification of its activities. Progress towards its
objective of greater regional diversification of investment is likely to be
slow. IFCT is considering various ways of playing a more active promotional
role, particularly in the regions and is about to take its first step towards
assisting the development of an active equity market in Thailand.

Loan 1021-TH, Bangkok Water Supply Project; $55 Million Loan of June 28,
1974; Closing date: June 30, 1979.
The project consists of expansion and improvement of raw water
facilities, construction of a treatment plant of 800,000 m3/day capacity,
transmission tunnels, and distribution centers to meet the expected water
demand of the metropolitan area through 1982.    A complementary project
financed by Asian Development Bank (ADB) would include trunk mains, distri-
bution pipes, tubewells and purchase of water meters. ADB's loan became
effective on September 13, 1974. Construction work on the project has not
commenced, but the bulk of the contracts have been tendered for and the
project is proceeding approximately on schedule.

Procurement
Arrangements:      Equipment and vehicles for force account construction
and other project activities costing about $15.5 million
would be procured after international competitive bidding
in accordance with Bank Group Guidelines. A 15% pre-
ference margin, or the prevailing customs duty, if lower,
would be extended to local manufacturers in the evalua-
tion of bids. Procurement of off-the-shelf items costing
less than $10,000 each, and up to an aggregate amount
of $500,000, which are not suitable for international
tendering, would be purchased through normal government
procurement procedures which are satisfactory. The
diversion dam ($16.2 million) and the irrigation and
drainage systems ($53.8 million), would be subject to
international competitive bidding. Drainage and flood
protection works ($6.5 million) and on-farm development
($27.2 million) would not be suitable for international
tendering. The totality of flood protection works and
up to 75% of the on-farm development works would be
carried out by RID on force account. Equipment would be
purchased out of the proposed loan following international
competitive bidding. However, it is expected that most of
the on-farm development works in the later years of the
project would be undertaken by local contractors. Con-
tracts for on-farm development and for buildings would
be awarded on the basis of competitive bidding advertised
locally and in accordance with local procedures which are
satisfactory to the Bank. Foreign contractors would be
eligible to bid.
Consultant:           (i) About 500 man-months to assist local staff with
thie planning, design and implementation of the
works; supporting services; and final preparation
of phase II.
(ii) About 600 man-months to carry out the various
phases of the Chao Phya Meklong Basin Studies,
and the administration and organization study
and prepare future irrigation projects.
Rate of Return:     20%.
Appraisal Report:    248b-TH, dated June 27, 1975.
