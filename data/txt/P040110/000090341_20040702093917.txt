3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry

3.1 Original Objective:
The project development objectives at appraisal were the following:

(a)      Implementing a sustainable process of self-management in financial administration, while
instituting sound financial management standards and systems in a critical mass of public entities. This
would enable Bolivia to perpetuate institutional strengthening procedures covering newly decentralized
sectors and municipalities and aim to incorporate at least 90 percent of total public funds administered in
the country. These activities would be supported by the implementation of an integrated financial
management system under the decentralized Prefectures, decentralized agencies, and municipalities, which
would link into the national budget via a centralized financial management system operated by the Ministry
of Finance (MdH). The private sector banking network would be deployed in providing the financial
infrastructure for budget payments via electronic transfer.

(b)      Building up a strong public auditing function able to, in collaboration with private sector auditing
firms, continuously review and evaluate financial performance and integrity of operations conducted by
public sector entities. This shall include implementation of uniform, professional accounting and auditing
standards across the public sector, auditing operations of the recently decentralized regional governments
and municipalities, development and execution of anti-corruption audits covering large public overlays and
contracts, and quality control of private sector audit standards.

The project was intended as a follow-on operation to the Public Financial Management Operation
(ILACO). In this manner, the project was designed to consolidate the implementation of the integrated
financial information system (SIIF), extend the SIIF to the decentralized entities and municipal
governments, and support the strengthening of the public sector auditing function.

3.2 Revised Objective:
During the initial stages of the project, it was determined that the technical and operational capabilities of
the SIIF had been significantly overestimated due to capacity and cost contraints encountered during the
pilot testing of the initial rollout to the decentralized entities. Moreover, rapid echnological advancements
in these type of systems funded by IBRD projects elsewhere opened up new and possibly more efficient
alternatives for the design of the system. As such, IDA proposed to undertake a full evaluation of the
proposed system expansion before any significant funding was committed to the expansion. An IDA
mission conducted in June 1998 found critical deficiencies in the information system and related hardware.
More seriously, a November 1998 IDA mission concluded that methodological and administrative
constraints would preclude the achievement of the project objectives if the SIIF system were retained.
These IDA missions identified the following deficiencies with regard to the SIIF system: (i) limited
functionality; (ii) limited reliability with respect to the information generated; (iii) limited user friendliness;
(iv) insufficient system capacity; (v) vulnerable security mechanisms; and (vi) the need for costly technical
and capacity upgrades every three months, which limited efficiency and increased costs while the SIIF was
offline. An additional difficulty was posed by the dynamic and rapid changes in the information technology
industry, which effectively caused the SIIF to be outdated within a relatively short period. Very
importantly, the assessments and the missions also focused attention on the fact that the project was
risking becoming merely an informatics project rather than a project which produced deeper changes in
public financial administration. Internally within the MdH there was a disconnect between its own Units
and the integration efforts of the Implementation Unit. The different departments of the MdH offered little
support for the development of their corresponding modules and allowed the continued use of parallel
financial management sub-systems alongside SIIF. In turn, the system continued to be implemented

without the needed critical input and reform and thus lacked ownership. It was recommended that process
reengineering particularly pertaining to budgeting and budget execution related tasks needed to be
implemented before any modifications to the integrated financial management system took place. It was
determined that the continued development and use of the SIIF system as such would preclude the
satisfactory achievement of the institutional and administrative reforms anticipated under the project.

To address these difficulties, IDA and the Government of Bolivia agreed during the April 1999 mission and
in the subsequent 1999 Action Plan that it would be more efficient to establish a new more comprehensive
financial management system that would integrate public sector management procedures with a unified
database at the central government level. This meant that certain reengineering processes would have to
take place alongside the development of the new system and all its modules. The 1999 Action Plan also
called for deferring the project activities that related to the modernization and integration of financial
management systems at the decentralized and local levels. This change in project design effectively
modified the activities included under objective (a) of the project and was codified under an Amendment to
the Credit Agreement that was approved by IDA in October 2000. This amendment primarily affected the
component executed by MdH. Under this revised action plan, it was agreed that the Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) would finance the implementation of the financial management system (SIGMA)
system at the municipal level. A similar action plan for the Prefectures was not completed until 2001,
which led to the deferral of related project activities for these entities.

Notwithstanding these difficulties, the redesign of the project led to significantly better results than
originally foreseen at appraisal, especially at the central government level. In particular, the change in
project design enabled the Government of Bolivia to replace the previous financial management system,
SIIF. In addition to being largely obsolete, the SIIF system experienced numerous technical difficulties,
lacked sufficient security protections, and was limited in its overall usefulness. This led to the development
of the SIGMA system, a more complete, integrated, reliable, and viable system that has modernized,
standardized, and rationalized the financial administration and management at the central government level.
The SIGMA system has supported the integration of budget, accounting, and treasury activities. Moreover,
the revised project design has improved the level of institutional dialogue and coordination between the
central government and decentralized/local entities with respect to financial management activities. The
project has also provided training to public officials as well as strengthening the legal and regulatory
framework governing financial management activities.

The October 2000 amendment to the Credit Agreement did not modify the objectives and activities being
executed by the Comptroller General's Office (CGO). At the time, it was felt that the SAFCO Law (Law
of Governmental Administration and Control) and supporting regulation (some of which was published
after the project was initiated) formed the basis for strengthening the auditing function. Notwithstanding
this, the original project design did not provide a clear definition of the goals, scope of work, and the
associated milestones for strengthening the CGO. As a result, there did not appear to be a substantial
improvement in the public sector auditing function at project end. In retrospect, the amendment to the
Credit Agreement could have provided additional guidelines and greater detail with respect to the goals and
activities included under the auditing component.

3.3 Original Components:
At appraisal, the project consisted of a total of 9 technical components. The first 5 components involved the
upgrade of financial management systems and support for institutional reforms within the associated public
sector entities. MdH, in collaboration with regional governments, was responsible for implementing these
activities. These components included the following:




                                                        - 3 -

Component 1: Implementation of Decentralized Integrated Financial Management Systems, included
the development of a modernized and an automated integrated financial management system for the 9
regional prefecture governments, all decentralized entities, and selected municipalities. This component was
also intended to support the translation of budget regulations into workable administrative procedures, the
institutionalization of operating procedures for treasury transactions, and the implementation of financial
accounting norms, as required under the SAFCO law.

Component 2: Public Sector-Wide Integration via Installation of Telecom Links was intended to link
decentralized and centralized financial and budget reporting systems as well as support national accounting
reporting and comprehensive monitoring at the aggregate national level.

Component 3: Budget Transaction and Payment Systems Modernization via Banking Network
component was designed to link transfer mechanisms for public budgetary funds via the private sector
banking system to increase the efficiency in the distribution of budget funds to the prefectures (general
budget funds) to municipalities (public participation investment funds), and to central government agencies.

Component 4: Dissemination of Financial Management/IFMS Operations, and Operationalizing
Public Financial Regulations, comprised the integration, in a sustainable manner, of the central and
decentralized financial management systems designed under the project. This component was intended to
provide practical hands-on training in the use of the financial information systems and the specific
application within each affected agency.

Component 5: Project Operating Costs. This component covered the project coordination unit's
operating costs including administrative and management staff, intra-country travel, dissemination of
materials and publications, and equipment support.

Activities listed under components 6-9 referred to and were under the execution of the CGO. These
components included the following:

Component 6: Government Audit Function ­ Strengthening Institutional Capacity for Central and
Regional Comptroller Offices, and Evaluation of Decentralized and Municipal Sector Operations.
Activities under this component centered on strengthening the institutional capacity of the CGO as well as
expanding the scope and type of public audits to be undertaken by the CGO.

Component 7: Implementing Audit Capability for Conducting Operational and Non-Financial
Audit/Evaluation Techniques. This component involved strengthening of CGO's capacity to conduct
operational audits, which included ex-post and in-process evaluations for investment programs, large public
works, environmental operations, and other special audits.

Component 8: Anti-Corruption Audit Techniques and Ethic Principles Dissemination, involved the
development and implementation of forensic audit techniques (e.g. anti-corruption detection methods) and
interface with financial and operational audits.

Component 9: Public Sector Training in Accounting, Auditing and Financial Management. This
component was intended to support the other 8 components by ensuring the widespread dissemination and
sustainability of modernized financial management procedures and the incorporation of proper accounting
and auditing norms. This component was placed under the purview of the Controller General's National
Training Center (CENCAP).

3.4 Revised Components:
The financial management components and related project activities to be carried out by the MdH were
modified as a result of the Amendment to the Credit Agreement signed in October 2000. These components
were redefined as follows:

1. Development and implementation of the SIGMA system. For financial management activities at the
central government level, the project scope was modified to include the: (a) redesign of budgetary
procedures to evaluate and strengthen oversight in the use of financial resources; (b) reorganization of
Treasury operations to carry out quarterly planning activities, to develop and implement the Single
Treasury Account, and to improve the reliability of expenditure records; (c) development of automatic links
for managing debt and accounting functions and improving oversight over public credit activities; and (d)
the development of administrative sub-systems for the redesign and integration of budgetary, accounting,
treasury, payment, personnel, procurement, and inventory activities.

2. Modernization and dissemination of public sector procurement activities.

3. Development and implementation of a centralized database that provides authorized public officials
access to real-time and reliable financial transaction information through a secure system. This includes the
installation of computer terminals connected to the system through a fiber optic network.

4. Development and implementation of policies and procedures to ensure the efficient operation of the
SIGMA system, including the provision of technical assistance and training to key public sector officials
and staff.

In addition, the 1999 Action Plan established the following goals for the financial management activities
executed by MdH:

l Simplify the budget preparation process;
l Ensure the collection of all financial information related to the budget;
l Design methodology to program and evaluate the physical execution of the budget in conjunction with
    the Institutional Reform Project;
l Implement the Single Treasury Account;
l Reduce the number of transactions without corresponding budgetary receipts;
l Carry out treasury activities in coordination with the budgetary system;
l Integrate financial management activities carried out by the Central Bank with the bank accounts

It should be noted, however, that there were some notable differences between the activities defined in the
1999 Action Plan and the amended Credit Agreement. For example, the Action Plan proposed that the
integration of the public investment system with the SIGMA system would be completed by December
2000. This was not reflected in the amended Credit Agreement. Finally, the revised project indicators,
expected results, milestones, and potential impacts were not sufficiently defined in the revised project
documents. The project activities under the purview of the CGO were not modified.

3.5 Quality at Entry:
Quality of entry of the original project is rated as being satisfactory. The key project objective of ensuring
the adequate administration, reporting, and tracking of public sector expenditures was largely consistent
with the Country Assistance Strategy for Bolivia dated February 8, 1994. In particular, this CAS
highlighted the need to assist the government in its program for modernizing public sector and
strengthening public institutions. The project was also intended to increase transparency in government
operations, improve the level of accuracy in the preparation and reconciliation of fiscal accounts,
strengthen monitoring and oversight with respect to the management of financial activities, and increase
efficiency in public sector operations. By supporting these objectives, the project was largely consistent
with country-level goals delineated in the CAS.

The project was to build on the outputs of the previous project which itself had at the time been a pioneer in
the area of central public financial integrated systems and become again a pioneer in the decentralization of
these same systems. In fact, similar type systems where starting to be launched throughout Latin America
with funding from IBRD with considerable advantage in terms of gained expertise and new technological
advances. However, the decentralization activities planned under the project at appraisal were somewhat
ambitious given the encountered technical difficulties as well as the limited utility of the SIIF system. The
length of time between appraisal of the project and the actual implementation of the project allowed for
newer options in the technology to emerge, for success stories elsewhere to be known and also for a
renewed interest from the GOB to support the project. Based on these assessments, IDA seized the
opportunity to take on what turned out to be a more ambitious and comprehensive approach to the
administration and integration of public financial management.

During an April 1999 mission, IDA and the Government of Bolivia agreed to transfer the financing for the
development and implementation of the SIGMA system within municipal entities to a parallel IDB
intervention. This operation is financing the implementation of the SIGMA system in roughly 110
municipalities, an activity that remained ongoing at project end. In regard to the Prefectures, it was decided
to that the implementation of SIGMA would be implemented and financed by a parallel IBRD Loan ­
PSAC II. To date, the latter has financed the implementation of SIGMA in the Prefecture of La Paz.

4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs

4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
Implementation of the unchanged objectives as well as those modified by the 1999 Action Plan and the
Amendment to the Credit Agreement are considered to be satisfactory.

a. Implementing sustainable financial administration system within a critical mass of public entities
In regard to objective (a), the SIGMA system has been developed and implemented within a critical mass
of central government agencies, including 14 government ministries. At project end, approximately 56
percent of government expenditures, 100 percent of the central government budget, and nearly 47 percent
of all public sector expenditures (including local government and decentralized entities) are being
processed by the SIGMA system. To date, the SIGMA system has been implemented within the central
government and decentralized entities, and several municipal/local government entities. The wider
implementation of the SIGMA as well as the maintenance and refinement of the system modules remains is
continuing. These ongoing maintenance activities are part of the dynamic operations of the SIGMA
system. A review by IDA has found that the information processed by the SIGMA is reliable, timely, and
useful. Two separate projects, the PSAC funded by IBRD is due to finance the implementation of the
system in the Prefectures and an IBRD project is programmed to finance the implementation of the system
in 100 municipalities by end of 2005.

As per the 1999 Action Plan and subsequent amendment to the Credit Agreement, the timetable for
implementing the SIGMA system within local governments was deferred and, as a result, these activities
were not covered by this intervention. This amendment also modified project design, activities, and
schedule as well as scaled back the institutional strengthening activities within decentralized and local
entities. Notwithstanding this change, a parallel IDB operation is supporting the installation of the SIGMA
system at the local government level. With the eventual implementation of the SIGMA system in the
Prefectures (being financed by another IBRD loan - PSAC 2) and in selected municipalities, the updated
financial management system is expected to reach the original project goal of processing more than 90
percent of public sector expenditures. The tables below provide a summary of the progress achieved in the
implementation of the SIGMA system at project end.

Because the SIGMA system remains an evolving and dynamic financial management system, the
assessment of its objectives, benefits, and impacts remains somewhat premature. It is clear at this stage
that the implementation of the Single Treasury Account, the development of an electronic payment system,
and the development of modernized budget and acquisition systems have significantly increased efficiency
and reliability in the central government's financial management practices. These benefits include the
following: (a) improved recording of financial information; (b) greater access to timely financial
information; (c) improved efficiency and flexibility in the use of budgetary resources; (d) increased
transactional efficiencies, (e) strengthened financial controls; and (f) improved integration within and
among central government financial management functions (budget, accounting, treasury, etc). Although
the SIGMA system is still being implemented, ongoing maintenance is being carried out with respect to the
different modules. This is being done concurrently to ensure that the SIGMA remains dynamic and under
constant improvement.

Nevertheless, there are some key issues that still need to be resolved. First, IDA concerns regarding the
AG's institutional capacity has delayed the transfer of the SIGMA system until it can be demonstrated that
the AG can adequately assume the management of this system. The review of the AG's institutional
capacity is being supported by an ongoing IDB intervention and a PHRD grant. Although not part of scope
of the project, the SIGMA system has not fully been implemented within the Legislative and Judiciary
branches, thereby only partially fulfilling Decrees #25775 and #26455. In addition, the following
shortcomings have been identified: (a) difficulties regarding the timely closure of accounting records. (e.g.,
the annual accounting reconciliation for FY02-03 has not been completed by project end, especially for the
decentralized entities and local governments.); (b) difficulties uploading public investment transactions onto
the SIGMA system (which is made once per year on June 30); (c) inconsistencies regarding the discretional
recording of budgetary expenditures (e.g. some expenditures recorded within the accounting module have
not been recorded in the budget module); and (d) incomplete certification of information, which has limited
the ability to evaluate the veracity and reliability of reported information. Finally, the frequent changes in
the government's organizational structure due to the creation of new entities and the merging/closing of
entities has produced a degree of uncertainty as to the validity of some of the reports issued by the system.
The main progress achieved with respect to each objective and anticipated results are summarized in the
table below.

b.       Building up a strong public auditing function

Because the CGO has received technical assistance from a variety of donors and other sources, it is
difficult to specifically isolate the specific impact that the project has had with respect to institutional
strengthening of the CGO. Notwithstanding this, the project has provided technical assistance and training,
which has contributed toward improving the CGO's institutional and administrative capacity, strengthened
internal and external controls, increased the number of financial audits conducted, and increased its ability
to conduct forensic and special audits. The project also supported the establishment of a complete and
well-documented external legal and regulatory framework that has clarified its institutional mandate. Along
these lines, the CGO has received technical assistance that has strengthened its organizational structure and
has better defined its operational policies, procedures, and scope of activities. The ability of the CGO to
obtain ISO 9000 certification is an important indicator of the progress achieved to date.

Although the expected results were largely achieved, i.e. capacity was largely improved, the CGO reached
ISO Certification and technical assistance helped strenghthen many aspects of the insitution, there are other
political factors and weakenesses in governance within and outside the institution which undermined the
potential of the technical assistance to lead to material improvements in the government's control function.
In particular, there are a number of outstanding institutional weaknesses that still need to be addressed.
These include: (a) the control function has not been sufficiently institutionalized and does not appear to be a
strong priority. CGO's recommendations to central and local government institutions are sometimes
ignored and/or not enforced; (b) training activities, especially in regard to the enforcement of ethics
violations are not sufficiently supported; (c) quantitative goals relating to audits have not yielded tangible
results; and (d) lawsuits filed by the CGO are not duly followed up by the Judiciary, creating a level of
impunity that undercuts CGO's official position. The following table summarizes the goals and impacts
achieved under the project.

The capacity of the CGO to carry out financial, operational, technical, special, and forensic audits has also
increased during the course of the project. It should be noted that although the CGO evidenced strong
overall progress, there was a degree of slippage in some areas, especially in conducting operational audits.
In all, the CGO has conducted 3,671 audits and inquiries from 1998 to 2003. The annual number of audits
carried out by the CGO by audit type is summarized in the table below.

4.5 Institutional development impact:
The institutional development impact engendered by the project has been substantial. By project end, the
SIGMA system has become the sole and universal system within the central government level for managing
public funds, which has replaced the inefficient and outmoded SIIF system. Specifically, the SIGMA has
had the following impacts: (a) standardized and simplified administrative procedures for budget
commitments, accruals, and payments; (b) encouraged the use of results based practices in the management
of financial information; (c) increased efficiency, timeliness, and reliability of financial information
generated by the public sector; (d) required public institutions to increase institutional capacity in order to
implement and maintain the SIGMA system within their respective entities; (e) increased the level of
transparency and efficiency in the use of public funds; and (f) significantly reduced discretional decisions
with respect to payments. Moreover, the institutional impact resulting from the project, especially with
respect to the management and control of public funds, is expected to increase once the SIGMA system is
fully implemented within all public sector entities.

With respect to the public sector audit function, the project has also supported the institutional development
of the CGO. The CGO is better equipped to conduct external control activities in all the country's regions.
Along these lines, the CGO has recently obtained ISO 9000 quality certification with respect to external
government controls. Nevertheless, concerns exist regarding the ability of the CGO to enforce its findings
and recommendations of its audit.

IDA has also voiced concerns regarding the ability of the AG to assume the management of the SIGMA
system. A review of the institutional capacity of the AG with respect to its ability to administer and oversee
the SIGMA has recently been initiated. These activities are being supported by an ongoing IDB
intervention and a PHRD grant managed by the World Bank.

5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome

5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
Weak legal and judicial framework. Although the Government has signaled its intention to combat
corruption, the ability of the government to carry out external control activities is constrained by a weak
legal framework and judicial system. This has made it difficult to enforce existing regulation and prosecute
violations, which has limited the credibility of external control activities. Moreover, some public entities
continue to interpret existing laws and regulations in a discretionary manner, reducing the reliability and
timeliness of financial information generated by their respective entities as well as putting pressure on the
viability of their internal control mechanisms. The extent that the weak legal and judiciary framework
affects the implementation of auditing activities tends to vary among public sector entities.

5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
Insufficient government commitment during the initial project period. During the first few years of the
project, the Government did not demonstrate sufficient commitment with respect to project execution,
leading to implementation delays and reduced project activity. The change in government administrations
resulted in a stronger commitment toward the project, which led to a faster implementation pace and



                                                      - 15 -

increased efficiency in the management of project operations.

Weak Internal Auditing Units. The Internal Auditing Units (IAUs) within each of the centralized entities
remain relatively weak and lack sufficient resources. This has limited the effectiveness of internal controls
activities and reduced the ability to carry out enforcement activities. The control function and respect for
internal rules and procedures should be given greater priority for internal control activities to be more
effective.

Late reporting of financial information. The procedures underlying the preparation and reporting of
financial information remains overly flexible and somewhat unsystematic with inadequate enforcement
mechanisms to ensure the timely reporting of financial implementation. Despite the legal requirement that
mandates the closing of public accounts for the previous fiscal year prior to June 30, public sector agencies
were reporting their financial information on or after this date for FY 2001 which impacted the reliability
of public accounting data. While the situation had reportedly improved in the fiscal exercise for 2002, the
existence of a single accounting system has effectively compounded this situation, since the financial
information provided needs to be reviewed, verified, and approved for each agency before the government
can commence the preparation of financial accounts for the next fiscal year. Thus, existing operating
procedures need to be tightened to ensure that financial reporting is completed in a timely manner.

5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
Project costs at appraisal was estimated at approximately US$21 million with US$14.5 million to be
provided by IDA and the remaining US$6.5 million was to be financed with US$ 4.0 million from
government counterpart funds and 0.8 from USAID and US$ 1.7 from a Belgian Bi-lateral Grant.
Although the project restructuring led to a redistribution of the amounts between components, the aggregate
amount to be spent was not modified at the time. Nevertheless, total project costs were estimated at
US$18.5 million at project end. IDA provided about US$14.0 million and the government provided an
additional US$4.5 million. The flow of funds during implementation was sufficient to meet project needs.
Project costs by component, procurement type, and financing sources are listed in Annex 2. This
information has been reviewed under an independent audit.

5.4 Costs and financing:
The cost of the Project was estimated at 21 million with actual costs amounting to US$ 18.5 million,
US$14 million funds from IDA funds and the remaining US$ 4.5 million from government counterpart
funds. The proposed grants from Belgium and USAID did not become effective. During the execution of
the project the estimated amount was not modified. The restructuring of the project generated a
redistribution of the expenses among the components, but not a modification in the global amount of the
investment. The implementation costs of the project are showed in Annex 2 of this document. The flow of
funds constantly responded to the needs of the project and was not a factor that affected the fulfillment of
some of the components.

6. Sustainability

6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
Project sustainability is considered to be likely, overall. By project end, the SIGMA system has been
implemented within a critical mass of Central Government agencies, covering roughly 56 percent of the
total government expenditures, 100 percent of the Central Government Budget. As per the 1999 Action
Plan, the implementation of the SIGMA in the decentralized entities and local government entities was
effectively deferred. However, these activities are being supported by an ongoing IDB operation.

Project sustainability for the activities carried out by MdH is also supported by the enactment of the

SAFCO Law (#1178), which established that the AG would be responsible for administering the financial
management systems for the public sector. Notwithstanding, IDA has requested that the AG's institutional
capacity be analyzed to determine whether it has the ability to assume this responsibility. Concerns have
surfaced regarding AG's ability to provide sufficient resources to manage, operate, maintain, and
periodically upgrade the SIGMA and related systems. The review of AG's institutional capacity is being
financed under a separate PHRD grant and has been initiated at project end. The government is also
reviewing strategies for strengthening AG's capacity to oversee and manage the SIGMA system.

Regarding the project activities implemented by the CGO, sustainability appears to be likely given that
project activities were financed entirely using its own resources. Along these lines, the CGO has operated
with sufficient financial resources to carry out its mandate relating to audit activities since its inception. In
addition, an adequate legal and regulatory framework is in place that permanently codifies and governs
CGO's activities. Although CGO's capacity to investigate financial transaction has increased under the
project, its enforcement mechanisms and ability to prosecute financial wrongdoings within the legal and
judicial framework remains weak.

6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
Despite the progress achieved in the development and implementation of the SIGMA system, concerns
remain as to whether the AG has sufficient institutional capacity to take over this system. No formal
transfer mechanisms and attendant schedule have been delineated to date. Nevertheless, a level of
continuity is being provided through an ongoing IDB intervention, which will permit existing operations to
continue in much the same manner for an additional 2 years. During this period, the AG is expected to
build up sufficient capacity to assume the management of the SIGMA system. The PHRD grant is also
expected to support this transition.

With respect to the public sector auditing function, the CGO has been able to build up sufficient
institutional and administrative to oversee and carry out this function since the early stages of the project.
In addition, the CGO has been able to undertake institutional strengthening activities using its own
resources. It should be noted, however, that a stronger legal and institutional framework would bolster the
ability of the CGO to enforce, prosecute, and possibly deter, financial violations.

7. Bank and Borrower Performance

Bank
7.1 Lending:
Bank performance during lending is rated as satisfactory. It should be noted, however, that the
decentralization activities planned under the project at appraisal were, however, somewhat ambitious given
the technical difficulties and limited utility of the SIIF system. Overestimation was due mostly because
there was a considerable lapse of time between appraisal and effectiveness (about 18 months). In the
meantime funds that had been allocated for project preparation (PPF) were used to identify client
information reporting needs as this was the main concern for the users. It was only as the system prepared
to accomodate these needs that it became apparent that there was a capacity issue with the then current
SIIF platform and that new developments in the technology sector would better support the information
needs. After some technical assessments by experts, it was recommended that that the best alternative was
a system overhaul and to implement a system with the flexibility to meet all the demands. Nevertheless,
project preparation defined a project structure that led to the quick identification of the emerging technical
weaknesses of the SIIF, efficiently addressed these issues, and supported the development of the SIGMA
system.

7.2 Supervision:
Bank performance during supervision is considered to be satisfactory. Once the weaknesses relating to the
SIIF system were identified by late November 1998, IDA responded relatively quickly to diagnose the root
causes, propose feasible solutions, and restructure the project to implement these remedies. This
far-reaching change in project design and the implementation of related activities was carried out in close
consultation and coordination with the Borrower. The Bank made a considerable effort to gain the support
for the reestructuring of the project from the newly appointed Minister of Finance. These changes were
formalized through the April 1999 Action Plan. As the action plan evolved and started a critical mass of
changes, it was also decided that an amendment to the Credit Agreement would be necessary. This
amendment was approved in 2000. IDA also supported the strengthening of the institutional and technical
capacity of the executing agencies, including knowledge transfer between countries undertaking similar
projects. This was an important element in the development of the SIGMA system.

There were some difficulties relating to the procurement of goods by the Borrower, especially for the
auditing component. This situation arose, in part, due to the lack of a coordinating unit within the CGO as
well as inadequate support from the PCU (located within the MdH) in assisting the CGO in interpreting
IDA's procurement procedures, resulting in delays and the partial eligibility of procured items. This was
compounded by the fact that the CGO provided training to public officials on IDA procurement procedures
without a complete understanding of these guidelines. In this manner, IDA should have been more proactive
in providing support and technical assistance to the CGO with respect to its respective procurement
guidelines, which could have potentially reduced implementation delays.

Finally, it should also be noted that the project had 6 separate task managers during implementation and
because of reorganizations within the Bank, the project was also transferred within sectors, decentralized to
the field and centralized to headquarters once again. This change in TMs effectively limited continuity in
project operations and weakened the level of supervision and the high-level on-going pressure by IDA
needed with respect to the project. Greater continuity in IDA supervision would have facilitated and
improved the level of assistance provided to the government.

7.3 Overall Bank performance:
In general terms, IDA performance, overall, is rated as being satisfactory. IDA participation was
crucial in financing experts that brought international expertise in the review of the SIIF systems
and in the development of the SIGMA system. In addition, the Bank promoted an exchange of
ideas and disseminated international best practices, which were important building blocks in
supporting the technical and institutional development of the SIGMA system. Further, by linking
the success of the SIGMA as a pre-condition for another IDA project, the project was given
additional focus and support by the government as well.

Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
Borrower performance during preparation is rated as satisfactory. The Borrower demonstrated strong
commitment during this stage.

7.5 Government implementation performance:
Borrower performance during project implementation is rated as satisfactory. Government commitment
initially flagged, but increased substantially after the change in government administrations and remained
strong throughout most of the remainder of the project.



                                                       - 18 -

7.6 Implementing Agency:
Implementing Agency is rated as satisfactory. It should be noted that once the government renewed its
support to the project, the implementing agency demonstrated a strong level of flexibility in restructuring
the project as well as committment to implementing the revised project activities.

7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
The Borrower performance is rated as being satisfactory, overall. Although the Borrower was a committed
partner during project preparation, this level of commitment waned after the changes in government
administrations. Once the project became a renewed priority, high commitment was maintained throughout
the entire implementation period. The new government administration encouraged the revision of the project
objectives as well as demonstrated strong leadership in implementing the activities associated with these
goals. In particular, MdH was able to make up for lost in time in executing financial management
activities. By project end, MdH was able to develop and implement an updated financial management
system at the central government level that has a strong level of functionality and reliability in the
management of financial information.

8. Lessons Learned

Project design and budget should factor in the possibility of later upgrades to keep up with rapid
changes in technology

The principal lesson learned from this project is that system technology and software are constantly
evolving. Therefore, a proper project design should include budgetary space for system and technological
changes and the possibility for upgrades should be built into the design. This, in turn, would have
facilitated the implementation of a functional and an operational financial management system not only
within the centralized entities, but also within the decentralized entities and municipalities. Thus, an earlier
diagnosis of system needs would have minimized financial and institutional resources. Once the decision to
scrap the SIIF and develop the SIGMA was reached, the participation of external consultants supported the
Government in delineating the requirements, developing the underlying methodology, and supporting the
development of the SIGMA system.

Results based indicators are critical for the achievement of project objectives

Project indicators, as defined at entry, were not specific enough to provide meaningful results. This
deficiency is reflective of both the learning curve at the time with regard to the development and use of
indicators for IDA projects as well as for specific interventions in the financial management sector. An
important example was the auditing component, which was successfully achieved as defined under the
project, but failed to yield tangible results. Under the project, the CGO was able to increase institutional
and technical capacity as well as increase the number of financial and special audits conducted. However,
the number of audits conducted, which by itself is a reasonable measure of the investigative capacity of the
CGO, is not a complete indicator of the viability and strength of the public sector control function, since it
excludes enforcement. This investigative measure could have potentially been combined with indicators that
provide stronger evidence with respect to the enforcement of financial controls, such as the number of cases
prosecuted, the number of successful convictions, etc. In this manner, future projects should develop
indicators that attempt to measure the progress achieved in relation to addressing the underlying
deficiencies in the sector, including weaknesses in the legal and regulatory structure and the judiciary
system, which has limited the ability to enforce financial control activities.

Need for top level commitment


                                                      - 19 -

It is important that project ownership by the government and the implementing be maintained. Fluctuations
in the ownership of the project, not in the least due to the frequent tumover in the executives of the MdH led
to stagnation of the project during those times. In contrast, the CGO component, an autonomous agency,
did not suffer from leadership fluctuations throughout implementation. It is also important that in order to
minimize the risk of 'disintegration' of the system, it is imperative to ensure that a mechanism for
coordination at the highest levels, and including all subsystems involved in financial management, be in
place to continue to promote the reform. The coordinating mechanism will lead to sustainable efforts
because those involved will take part in the decision leading to new changes. The strategic thinking needs to
be headed, in the context of Bolivia, by the Minister himself and the technical coordination should report
directly to his office.

Linking of the project to a broader public sector reform agenda

Within the first year of implementation the SIGMA system was linked to a parallel broader institutional
reform project. Establishing SIGMA as a prerequisite for the Institutional Reform Project (IRP) and to the
Programamatic Structural Adjustment Credit (PSAC) served to ensure continued coordination and pressure
by IDA and government authorities to meet the goals of the Public Financial and Decentralization Project.

Initially the design of the SIIF failed to adequately reengineer inefficient processes, limiting the potential
benefits of the project. When the SIIF was redesigned during the course of project implementation
(becoming SIGMA) we ensured that the design and implementation of the financial management system
would rectify deficiencies in the current public
financial management norms and procedures. Thus, outdated procedures were not carried forward into the
automated system.

Stability in Task Management

While we normally emphasize the importance of having strong and constant technical leadership by the
government, it is equally important to minimize turnover by IDA in the task management of the project. An
unusually high turnover of task managers (four) up until 3 months from completion of the project resulted
in breaks in the communication with the Borrower, resulting in one case in significant delays in the
procurement of one component and eventually in delays in the closing of the project.

IFMS system not the decentralization of the system as the name of the component implies. For this reason, the
actual amounts spent may not in some cases be directly comparable to the appraisal estimates.

Evaluación Proyecto de Descentralización Financiera y Responsabilidad (ILACO II)
CONVENIO DE CREDITO DE FOMENTO DEL FONDO INTERINO N 033 ­ BO
COMPONENTE MINISTERIO DE HACIENDA

Antecedentes

El proyecto de Descentralización Financiera y Responsabilidad (ILACO II), en su componente a cargo del
Ministerio de Hacienda, surge a raíz de las reformas establecidas en las leyes de Participación Popular y
Descentralización Administrativa, como una necesidad de incrementar la capacidad de los gobiernos
descentralizados y la administración de los recursos asignados a ellos por el gobierno central. En este
sentido, el proyecto, tomando como base los avances logrados en materia de administración financiera
durante la ejecución de la Segunda Operación para la Administración Financiera Pública (PFMO II),
estaba orientado al establecimiento de sistemas integrados de administración financiera (Sistema Integrado
de Información Financiera - SIIF) en un determinado número de entidades públicas (prefecturas, entidades
descentralizadas y municipios) de manera que se incorpore en el sistema de la administración central, hasta
un 90% de los recursos públicos administrados en el país.

Objetivo original

"Establecer sistemas integrados de administración financiera en las prefecturas, entidades
descentralizadas y municipios seleccionados."

Ejecución del Proyecto

El convenio de préstamo fue firmado el 19 de agosto de 1997 y su ejecución se inició en enero de 1998, con
el desembolso del PPF.

En diciembre de 1998, el Ministerio de Hacienda, contrató una consultoría para evaluar el SIIF. Los
resultados de esta consultoría mostraron problemas referidos al enfoque mismo del proyecto, indicando que
éste se había convertido en un proyecto informático, desvirtuando el objetivo de la Ley SAFCO de
modernizar el funcionamiento de los sistemas de administración financiera y control, para hacer más
eficiente y eficaz la gestión de la administración pública.

En marzo de 1999, el Ministro de Hacienda designa a la Lic. Ma. Del Carmen Zuleta Calderón como
Directora Técnica, encomendándole la tarea de reorientar el enfoque del proyecto en función de los avances
conceptuales y tecnológicos en materia de administración financiera pública.

Dentro de este contexto, entre el 7 y el 14 de abril de 1999, una misión del Banco Mundial, luego de
evaluar las necesidades de reestructuración del proyecto y determinar su voluntad para continuar con el
apoyo, acordó con el Ministerio de Hacienda y la Dirección Técnica un plan de acción que considera el
desarrollo e implantación de un nuevo Sistema Integrado de Gestión y Modernización Administrativa ­
SIGMA, sobre la base de los cambios conceptuales en los órganos rectores de los sistemas que regula la
Ley 1178 "Ley de Administración y Control Gubernamentales", la ley N° 1654 "Ley de Descentralización
Administrativa" y la ley N° 1551 "Ley de Participación Popular", que permita la generación de
información financiera oportuna y confiable para el uso del Ministerio de Hacienda y las entidades del

sector público.

El 31 de octubre de 2000 se suscribió la enmienda al Convenio de Crédito, documento en que se establece
como nuevo objetivo el establecimiento de sistemas integrados de administración financiera en las
entidades del sector público.

A raíz de la modificación del objetivo del proyecto, sus componentes también fueron modificados tal como
se muestra en la siguiente tabla.

  Problemas que afectaron la ejecución del Proyecto

  Durante la primera etapa de la ejecución del proyecto se identificaron, a través de la consultoría de
  evaluación mencionada párrafos arriba, además de los problemas referidos a programación y
  administración presupuestaria, gestión financiera, materia informática, etc., problemas relacionados con
  la falta de compromiso político con la reforma de la administración financiera, la necesidad de una
  dirección técnica con amplia experiencia en el tema, la definición conceptual de la reforma y otros que
  incluyen a las funciones y atribuciones mismas del proyecto.

  A raíz de las modificaciones acordadas y el nuevo enfoque del Sistema Integrado de Gestión y
  Modernización Administrativa SIGMA, se vio la necesidad de cambiar la plataforma informática y el
  equipo computacional. Adicionalmente, tomando en cuenta anteriores experiencias, se identificó que uno
  de los principales problemas para la implantación del nuevo sistema en todas las entidades del sector
  público era la inexistencia del hardware requerido para su operación, aspecto que se convertiría en una
  seria amenaza para la obtención de los objetivos. En este sentido, se acordó que el Ministerio de
  Hacienda, a través del proyecto, además de actualizar el software y hardware central, debería dotar del
  equipo necesario a dichas entidades.

  Debido a que el Convenio de Crédito no permitía la adquisición de bienes o servicios de origen de los
  Estados Unidos, se suscribió un Pre Acuerdo de Reforma Institucional entre la Unidad Técnica de la
  Comisión Nacional de Integridad y el Ministerio de Hacienda, mediante el cual la mencionada Unidad
  Técnica, con cargo a los recursos del PPF 980-0-BO, proveería al Ministerio de los recursos necesarios
  para adquirir el sotware y hardware necesario para el desarrollo e implantación del SIGMA aspecto que
  fue fundamental para el logro de los objetivos del proyecto.

Resultados alcanzados.

Sistemas Integrados de Administración Financiera (SIGMA).

El SIGMA es un conjunto de políticas, principios, normas, procedimientos técnicos, herramientas
informáticas, otros medios y/o recursos y, organismos, que intervienen en la planificación, gestión y
control de fondos públicos; integra los sistemas de presupuesto, contabilidad, tesorería, crédito público,
compras y contrataciones y, administración de personal, que operan en una plataforma informática
actualizada y produce información en tiempo real.

Bajo esta nueva concepción de administración financiera, el SIGMA se constituye en un sistema de
gestión, orientado a reemplazar el flujo de papeles por el flujo de información computarizada,
permitiendo:

l generar registros simultáneos, diseñados bajo la concepción de bases de datos relacionales, a
    partir de una única carga de datos y producir múltiples combinaciones de información
    presupuestaria, económica, contable, de gestión, de inversión, etc., en distintos formatos;
l relacionar la gestión con el registro permitiendo efectuarla en forma simultánea (tiempo real);
l aplicar el principio de unicidad de caja utilizando la operatoria de la Cuenta Unica del Tesoro, de
    manera que los proveedores o beneficiarios que contratan con el Estado reciban sus pagos
    directamente en una cuenta corriente en la red bancaria adscrita;
l operacionalizar los Principios de Contabilidad Gubernamental Integrada, facilitando la
    generación de información financiera y no financiera cumpliendo las cualidades de integridad,
    claridad, aplicabilidad, materialidad, confiabilidad, manifestación fidedigna, comparatividad, y
    oportunidad;
l identificar a los servidores públicos responsables de cada paso dentro de los ciclos
    transaccionales en función a la asignación de funciones y niveles de responsabilidad de los usuarios
    mediante la determinación de roles específicos que deben cumplir;
l utilizar la firma electrónica para la autorización de transacciones;
l incorporar e integrar los procesos de administración de bienes y servicios y de personal
l estandarización de hardware en las entidades del sector público para una adecuada conexión a
    servidores principales mediante cableado de fibra óptica.

Los objetivos que se persigue con el SIGMA son:
l gestión de recursos en un marco de absoluta transparencia,
l generación de información útil, oportuna y confiable, tanto en detalle como sintética para los niveles
    de toma de decisiones,
l promover economía, eficiencia y efectividad de la gestión pública
l interrelacionar los sistemas de administración financiera con los sistemas de control interno y
    externo.

El Sistema Integrado de Gestión y Modernización Administrativa SIGMA, fue aprobado mediante
Decreto Supremo Nº 25875 de fecha 18 de agosto de 2000, para su implantación obligatoria en todas
las entidades del sector público, previstas en el artículo 3 de la ley 1178.

La aprobación del sistema se complementó con el Decreto Supremo N° 26455 de 19 de diciembre de
2001, en el que se estableció expresamente las responsabilidades del uso y administración de



                                                  - 36 -

información que se genera y transmite a través de los sistemas informáticos en el marco del SIGMA, su
ámbito, las responsabilidades del uso y administración de información, generada, enviada, recibida,
archivada o procesada, su validez y fuerza probatoria, responsabilizando a la máxima autoridad
ejecutiva de cada entidad pública y los servidores públicos autorizados, de los efectos y consecuencias
que pueda generar la incorrecta operación y/o utilización de estos sistemas informáticos, de la
información procesada y enviada y del uso de los mecanismos de seguridad. Asimismo, amplio el ámbito
de aplicación del Decreto Supremo N° 25875 a las unidades administrativas de los Poderes Legislativo
y Judicial previstas en el Artículo 4° de la Ley N° 1178.

De acuerdo al artículo segundo de la mencionada disposición legal, la implantación del SIGMA se debe
efectuar en forma paulatina. La primera fase en forma oficial a partir del 2 de enero de 2001 en todas
las entidades de la Administración Central y, a partir del mes de junio, en el resto de las entidades del
sector público

El SIGMA Central se encuentra funcionando desde el 2 de enero del 2001, con implantación paulatina
hasta alcanzar al 31 de julio de 2003, 22 organismos de la Administración Central con 94 direcciones
administrativas y aproximadamente 303 unidades ejecutoras, conectadas en línea.

Adicionalmente, a partir de enero del 2002 se ha iniciado la implantación del SIGMA en la
administración descentralizada, habiéndose alcanzado a la fecha, 24 entidades con 47 direcciones
administrativas y aproximadamente 140 Unidades Ejecutoras.

El Gobierno Municipal de La Paz, está operando en línea a partir del mes de Enero y Gobierno
Municipal de Cochabamba, opera a partir del 16 de Junio de la presente gestión.

La Prefectura Departamental de La Paz, se encuentra operando el SIGMA desde el 23 de Junio de 2003.

La Universidad Mayor de San Simón en Cochabamba está operando en línea con el SIGMA desde la
gestión 2002.

Existe información presupuestaria financiera, económica y de gestión de los organismos de la
administración central y de las entidades descentralizadas conectadas en línea y de las que operan a
través de la Dirección General de Programación Financiera y del Dirección General de Contaduría.
Dicha información se puede observar en los menús de consulta del SIGMA o en la página WEB
www.sigma.gov.bo.

Actualización de la reglamentación de adquisiciones

En agosto de 1995 se aprobó la primera Norma Básica del Sistema de Administración de Bienes y
Servicios (SABS), los avances en materia administrativa y los cambios introducidos por las reformas del
Estado obligaron a una actualización de las mismas. El proceso de actualización de la normativa del
Sistema de Bienes y Servicios, a cargo del Ministerio de Hacienda a través de la Unidad de Normas,
incluyó la revisión de la normativa vigente en ese momento; la elaboración cinco pliegos modelo para
obras, consultoría, seguros bienes y servicios; y le elaboración de contratos modelo. Como resultado de
este proceso se obtuvo la última versión de las Normas Básicas, aprobadas mediante Decreto Supremo
N° 25964 de 21 de octubre de 2000.

Para la difusión de la normativa aprobada, durante la gestión 2001 se realizaron cincuenta y un eventos,
en los cuales se capacitaron más de mil quinientos servidores públicos de aproximadamente


                                                  - 37 -

cuatrocientos ochenta instituciones de la administración central descentralizada y municipios.
Adicionalmente se financió la publicación de 4.000 ejemplares de la normativa básica del SABS.

Dentro del criterio del gobierno de dar transparencia a la gestión pública, el Ministerio de Hacienda, a
través de la Unidad del Normas y con recursos del Proyecto ILACO II, ha desarrollado el Sistema de
Información de Contrataciones Estatales SICOES, cuyo objetivo es brindar, a través de su página WEB
www.sicoes.gov.bo, información oportuna y confiable al Estado y a la sociedad civil de las
contrataciones que realiza el sector público.

La información disponible de los procesos de contratación es la siguiente:

l Convocatoria y Objeto de la contratación.
l Pliego de condiciones y su costo.
l Organismo(s) financiador(es).
l Empresa adjudicada, ítems, precios unitarios y costo total.
l Empresas que participaron en el proceso.
l Recursos administrativos interpuestos (si hubieren).
l Información sobre contrataciones por excepción (si hubieren).
l Cuadros estadísticos de contrataciones del estado.
l Programas Anuales de Contratación.
l Normativa vigente.
l Modelos de pliego de condiciones.
l Modelos de reglamento específico para municipios, gobierno central y descentralizadas.
l Cursos de Capacitación.
l Listado de Entidades que no cumplen con la aplicación de las NBSABS en lo referente a la
    información oportuna al SICOES

Capacidad de procesamiento en telecomunicaciones e información

La tecnología utilizada para el SIGMA corresponde al modelo "tres capas", cuyas características de
aplicación están enmarcadas a tres procesos bien definidos y separados, cada uno que funciona en una
diversa plataforma:
l La interfaz de usuario, que funciona en la computadora del usuario (el cliente).
l Los módulos funcionales que procesan realmente los datos. Capa intermedia donde funciona el
    servidor de aplicaciones
l Un sistema de administración de la base de datos (DBMS) que almacena los datos requeridos por la
    segunda capa.
La solución tecnológica para la implantación del SIGMA en las entidades de la administración central y
descentralizada está definida de la siguiente manera:


La topología de la red es de tipo "estrella", conformada por tres tipos de nodos:
l Nodo "0", corresponde al nodo central, ubicado en el Centro de Cómputo de la Contaduría General
    del Estado, del Ministerio de Hacienda. A este nodo se conectan vía canales de Fibra Óptica los
    switches de los nodos "1"

l Nodos "1", que se encuentran distribuidos en ocho zonas geográficas de la ciudad de La Paz, donde
    se concentra el tráfico de las entidades ubicadas en cada zona.
l Nodos "2", corresponden a las entidades que se encuentran conectadas a los nodos "1", a estos



                                                  - 38 -

    nodo se conectan a su vez, las redes de cada una de las entidades.

Diseminación, capacitación y expansión de los sistemas de información financiera.
Para llevar adelante la capacitación del SIGMA, se diseñaron dos cursos, Diseño Conceptual y
Aplicaciones Informáticas. El primero permite dar a conocer a los servidores públicos las bases
conceptuales sobre las que se diseñó el sistema; en tanto que el segundo se dirige a la enseñanza de la
aplicación práctica.

Se dictaron 34 cursos de Diseño Conceptual a un total de 1.619 servidores; en el curso de Aplicaciones
Informáticas se capacitaron a 629 usuarios en 40 eventos. Ambos cursos fueron dictados en
coordinación con la Contraloría General de la República.

Por lo expuesto en los párrafos precedentes, los resultados del Proyecto de Descentralización Financiera
y Responsabilidad (ILACO II), se consideran altamente satisfactorios.

Temas Pendientes

Existen aún algunos temas que no estaban previstos en el convenio y fueron expresadas en la ayuda
memoria de la misión de supervisión de fecha 7 al 10 de mayo de 2002, estos temas se refieren a:
l Sostenibilidad. Administración del sistema, que está relacionada con la capacidad técnica
    institucional de la instancia que tomará a su cargo el SIGMA, las tareas a encarase deben incluir
    tanto la operatoria de la herramienta computacional, como sus actualizaciones tecnológicas en
    función de los avances que se vayan dando en el tiempo y a los aspectos conceptuales;
l certificación de seguridad informática. Cuyo objetivo es el de garantizar el servicio que brinda el
    SIGMA en tiempo real a las entidades públicas, la inviolabilidad de la información en el proceso
    electrónico de datos, las soluciones alternas ante desastres u otros eventos imprevisibles que puedan
    ocurrir en el Nodo Central donde residen los servidores y equipos de comunicación sobre los cuales
    funciona el sistema y,
l Implantación en el resto de entidades descentralizadas. Para posibilitar que las entidades
    descentralizadas que a la fecha no están conectadas en línea, registren sus operaciones desde el lugar
    donde se genera la información.

Estos temas han sido considerados dentro de la Donación del gobierno japonés PHRD TF052116

Desempeño del Prestatario

La identificación del proyecto por parte del prestatario estaba limitada a las condiciones existentes
durante este período (existía un sistema informático en operación, la descentralización administrativa
obligaba al gobierno a considerar fortalecimiento a las prefecturas y la participación popular a los
municipios grandes), en este sentido, el desempeño del prestatario puede considerarse como
satisfactorio.

La participación del proyecto para la reorientación del proyecto demuestra la voluntad política de seguir
apoyando la modernización administrativa del Estado y su predisposición a mejorar los sistemas
existentes en base a conceptos más actualizados de gestión y tecnología, este aspecto puede considerarse
como altamente satisfactorio.

La ejecución del proyecto es considerada como satisfactoria debido a la respuesta de la Unidad
Ejecutora a los cambios realizados, el apoyo otorgado por el gobierno a la implantación del sistema y


                                                  - 39 -

los resultados alcanzados en plazos relativamente cortos.

Las lecciones aprendidas durante el período de ejecución pueden resumirse en las siguientes:

l Liderazgo Técnico. La dirección del proyecto, juntamente con la participación de profesionales
    altamente capacitados y con amplia experiencia en el desarrollo e implantación de sistemas
    integrados de administración financiera fue uno de los aspectos primordiales para el éxito del
    proyecto. Antes de la reorientación del proyecto se identificó que un liderazgo sin experiencia
    técnica o con poco conocimiento de los temas financiero administrativos en el sector público, podía
    poner en riesgo la ejecución del proyecto.
l Voluntad Política. Uno de los aspectos que determinaron el limitado éxito de las operaciones
    anteriores está referido a la ausencia de voluntad política o compromiso por parte de los niveles
    ejecutivos del gobierno. A partir de la designación de la nueva dirección técnica del proyecto,
    considerando el nuevo enfoque del SIGMA, se obtuvo un apoyo incondicional desde los niveles más
    altos del Poder Ejecutivo. Este apoyo se manifestó con la promulgación de Decretos supremos de
    aprobación de un único sistema ha ser utilizado, con carácter obligatorio, por las entidades del
    sector público, disminuyendo considerablemente uno de los obstáculos más comunes de los procesos
    de reforma, conocido como la resistencia al cambio.

Desempeño del Banco

La participación del Banco, en la etapa de diseño del proyecto puede considerarse como satisfactoria.
Durante la etapa de ejecución, una participación más activa del banco hubiera permitido una
reorientación más oportuna. Debe resaltarse de manera muy especial el apoyo recibido por parte del Jefe
del Pilar Institucionalidad de la Misión Residente, a partir de la etapa de reorientación del proyecto,
apoyo que fue vital, inicialmente para la continuación del proyecto y posteriormente y hasta la
finalización del mismo con su decidido impulso tanto en los niveles del gobierno como en el ámbito de
los organismos financiadores y países donantes.

IMPACTOS

Entre los impactos más relevantes, la implantación del SIGMA a la fecha muestra los siguientes:

l Economías de escala, con un único sistema que procesa operaciones comunes de todas las entidades
    del sector público, incluyendo entidades financieras.

l Pago electrónico directo a las cuentas bancarias de beneficiarios finales reemplaza al "cheque" como
    medio de pago, incrementando la seguridad y eliminando costos administrativos,

l Ejecución del presupuesto y seguimiento en tiempo real de las transacciones efectuadas desde una
    Unidad Ejecutora. Los procesos son auditables totalmente en el sistema porque incluyen todas las
    operaciones (compras, almacenes, activos fijos y otros)

l Incorporación al marco normativo nacional respecto de la validez y fuerza probatoria a la
    información generada, enviada, recibida, archivada o procesada a través del SIGMA.

l Transferencias electrónicas entre cuentas, incluyendo operaciones multimoneda, suprimiendo costos
    bancarios.

     l Información gerencial a nivel jerárquico en línea y en tiempo real.


     l Transparencia en la información de la administración financiera gubernamental, disponible vía
          internet:
     l Ejecución del presupuesto, estados contables del sector público, operaciones de tesorería.
     l Proveedores, Contratistas y Agentes de Retención del Estado, consultan datos respecto a su Registro
          en sistema, estados de cuentas, facturas, pagos en trámite o ya procesados, sanciones impuestas.

CONVENIO DE CREDITO NO33-BO BANCO MUNDIAL
INFORME DE EVALUACION FINAL DE LA CONTRALORIA GENERAL DE LA REPUBLICA
DE BOLIVIA


1. INTRODUCCION.

   En base a lo que establece el Manual Operativo del Banco Mundial y sus procedimientos, referidos a
   informes de cumplimiento de ejecución de proyectos, la Contraloría General de la República de Bolivia
   presenta a continuación el informe de evaluación de los componentes que fueron responsabilidad de la
   entidad desarrollar, con el propósito de cumplir a satisfacción con el objetivo fundamental del proyecto. A
   través del desarrollo de dichos componentes se describe objetivamente la evaluación del objetivo del
   proyecto y del propio desempeño de la entidad prestataria.

2. EJECUCION DEL PROYECTO Y EVALUACION DE LOS COMPONENTES

    En base a los objetivos del proyecto definidos en detalle en el "Documento de evaluación del Proyecto",
    que se resumen en el fortalecimiento de la función de auditoria y la capacitación del sector público en
    contabilidad, auditoria y administración financiera, se presenta a continuación la evaluación de los
    respectivos componentes.

    2.1 FORTALECIMIENTO DE LA CAPACIDAD INSTITUCIONAL DE LA FUNCION DE
        EVALUACION Y AUDITORIA DEL PRESTATARIO

        Ante la necesidad de realizar un trabajo de seguimiento más efectivo y con el fin de fomentar el
        control interno en las entidades públicas, de manera de darle a este componente el rol preponderante
        que le corresponde dentro de la gestión de las entidades públicas, la Sucontraloría de Auditorías
        Internas existente hasta la gestión 2000 se convierte en Subcontraloría de Control Interno. De esta
        forma se establece un instrumento útil y efectivo a través del cual la Contraloría General de la
        República define normas, controla su aplicación, evalúa los informes realizados por las Unidades de
        Auditoría Interna (UAI)de las entidades auditadas y verifica el adecuado funcionamiento de estas
        unidades; para que el componente del control sea parte de la gestión eficaz y eficiente al estar
        inmerso en los procedimientos y procesos, coadyuvando a la reducción de riesgos y desviaciones.

        A pesar de este esfuerzo es pertinente mencionar que en Bolivia existen 225 unidades de Auditoría



                                                       - 41 -

    Interna donde prestan servicios 731 auditores. Sin embargo, de los 314 municipios apenas 31
    cuentan con unidades de auditoría interna. A pesar de ello la Contraloría General de la República ha
    emitido en los últimos seis años (1997-2002) un promedio anual de 2.800 evaluaciones sobre los
    informes de auditoría interna presentados por las respectivas UAI de las entidades públicas. Esta
    información en detalle se encuentra en la Memoria 1992-2002 de la institución. Al mismo tiempo se
    ha contribuido para que las UAI existentes en el país cuenten con instrumentos y guías que mejoren
    su labor técnica; en ese sentido, se elaboró la "Guía para la aplicación de los principios, normas
    generales y básicas de control interno gubernamental", acompañada de un anexo que contempla las
    principales actividades de control para cada sistema de administración.

    El control interno en la Administración pública es fundamental, porque contribuye al logro de
    resultados y de la gestión pública, pero sobretodo desarrolla una cultura de control que debe empezar
    en la máxima autoridad ejecutiva (MAE) hasta el nivel jerárquico más bajo de la organización.
    Lamentablemente hasta hoy son pocas las entidades públicas que detectan esta necesidad y aporte,
    por ello las principales deficiencias de las UAI se traducen en la falta de manuales de puestos,
    funciones y procedimientos, el incumplimiento a las Normas de Auditoría Gubernamental en lo que
    respecta a la ejecución de sus propias auditorías, la limitada asignación de recursos humanos en
    estas unidades y el inadecuado nivel jerárquico que se le asigna a la UAI dentro de la entidad pública.
    Ya es labor de las propias entidades públicas, las MAE y el Organo Rector de los Sistemas de
    Administración desarrollar planes y políticas más sólidas y objetivas que permitan alcanzar mejores
    resultados.

    Internamente, la Contraloría General de la República ha ido desarrollando una estructura
    organizacional acorde con los cambios que se fueron produciendo en el país. En ese sentido es
    pertinente mencionar el proceso de descentralización administrativa y la puesta en marcha de la Ley
    de Participación Popular que ha permitido la creación de varios municipios responsables por la
    administración de sus recursos. Es así que fue necesario crear la Subcontraloría de Auditoria Externa
    en Autonomías Constitucionales que tiene a su cargo la auditoria en gobiernos municipales;
    habiéndose elaborado guías para la evaluación técnica de obras públicas menores, evaluación del
    sector salud y educación, para la elaboración del informe sobre antecedentes, aspectos
    económico-financiero y sociales.

    También se creó la Subcontraloría de Servicios Técnicos que cuenta con tres gerencias de :
    Evaluaciones Ambientales, Evaluaciones de Obras Públicas y Evaluación se Sistemas Informáticos.
    En cada una de las citadas gerencias se desarrolló normativa interna y externa para el control
    gubernamental.

2.2 FORTALECIMIENTO DE LAS CAPACIDADES DE AUDITORIA                                    PARA LAS
    AUDITORIAS OPERACIONALES Y NO FINANCIERAS Y EVALUACIONES

    Con el objetivo de poder llevar a cabo trabajos de auditoria técnicamente completos y uniformes en
    su ejecución (estandarización), en junio de 2002 la Contraloría General de la República ha obtenido
    la certificación ISO 9000/94 a todos sus proceso de auditoria y procedimientos vinculados. Esta
    certificación ha alcanzado a la Oficina Central de la entidad y todas las gerencias departamentales
    ubicadas en el país.

    También se ha actualizado las Normas de Auditoría Gubernamental, tomando en cuenta las Normas
    de Auditoria Generalmente Aceptadas, Normas Internacionales de Auditoria, además de coordinar
    normativa emitida por países líderes en la materia como las normas de la GAO de Estados Unidos de


                                                  - 42 -

        Norteamérica. Esto ha permitido que las NAG sean perfectamente aplicables a las UAI y a las firmas
        de auditoria externa.

        Además se ha desarrollado la Guía de Evaluación de Gerencias Departamentales, instrumento con el
        cual es posible medir objetivamente los objetivos alcanzados por cada gerencia en materia de calidad
        en el trabajo, productividad, esfuerzo gerencial, capacitación, recursos humanos, administración de
        activos, costos, etc.

        En los últimos seis años se realizó un promedio anual de 66 informes de auditorías operacionales,
        cinco informes de auditorías ambientales anuales en los últimos tres años, un promedio anual de 44
        informes de evaluaciones de las Unidades de Auditoría Interna, 36 informes de evaluaciones anuales
        promedio a Unidades Jurídicas en los últimos cuatro años y 274 informes de seguimientos como
        promedio anual desde 1997 hasta la gestión 2002.

        Se muestra claramente una predisposición por contribuir al mejoramiento de la gestión y
        administración de las entidades del Estado, a pesar de haberse producido una reducción del 7% en los
        recursos humanos de la Contraloría General de la República, de 1997 a la gestión 2002.

 2.3 TECNICAS ANTI CORRUPCION

        La tarea de la Contraloría General de la República, además de sus atribuciones designadas por ley,
        ha estado también orientada a contribuir en la lucha contra la corrupción. En ese sentido, se han
        alcanzado los siguientes objetivos concretos que se han ido materializando a lo largo de los pasados
        años:

l A través de otros medios de financiamiento se desarrolló labores fundamentales de apoyo para contribuir a
  combatir la corrupción, mediante la aplicación y puesta en marcha de nuevas acciones; entre las que se
  debe destacar el programa de auditoría forense que ha involucrado la participación de un grupo escogido
  de auditores y personal técnico de la Contraloría General de la República. Este esfuerzo representa un
  subcomponente del Plan Nacional Integridad dentro del marco de Reforma Institucional. Gracias a este
  programa se ha logrado capacitar a 75 servidores públicos de la Contraloría General de la República y a
  22 funcionarios de otras entidades públicas. A partir del año 2002 se puso en vigencia la Declaración
  Jurada de Bienes y Rentas, a través de la instrumentación del Decreto Supremo 26257 que señala la forma
  y oportunidad de su presentación, bajo principios de universalidad, obligatoriedad, periodicidad y
  transparencia. Al 31 de diciembre de 2002 se recibieron las declaraciones de 20.788 servidores públicos de
  la categorías A y 133. 894 servidores públicos de la categoría B; lo que hace un total de 154.682
  servidores públicos en todo el país.

l En materia de auditorías especiales, que no necesariamente tienen una orientación "anticorrupción", sino
  que cumplen la función de realizar objetivamente un examen sistemático de evidencias relacionadas con
  desviaciones en el cumplimiento de disposiciones legales aplicables, estableciéndose, en su caso, indicios
  de respondabilidad por la función pública. En los últimos seis años (1997-2002) se emitieron 1.494
  informes de auditoría especial, lo que representa un promedio anual de 249 informes. Además hoy se
  cuenta con aplicaciones informáticas como WIN IDEA que contribuyen a mejorar la calidad y alcance de
  las auditorías.

l En materia de ética la Contraloría General de la República cuenta desde el año 2001 con el Código de
  Etica de la entidad, debidamente reglamentado. Este código toma en cuenta valores y principios que
  sustentan una administración y gestión responsable y transparente que contribuya a consolidar la conducta


                                                     - 43 -

   moral del servidor público de la entidad hacia sus colegas de trabajo, hacia los intereses y objetivos de la
   institución y hacia la ciudadanía en general.

    2.4 CAPACITACION EN CONTABILIDAD, AUDITORIA Y ADMINISTRACION
         FINANCIERA.

          A partir de 1999 la Contraloría general de la República impartió más de 450 eventos        anuales de
         capacitación a más de 10.000 servidores públicos cada año en todo el país. Los eventos impartidos
         han tenido relación con temáticas de ética y transparencia, contabilidad, auditoría y administración
         financiera, además de los eventos vinculados estrictamente con los sistemas que trata la ley 1178.

         Dentro del programa de capacitación en técnicas de auditoría anticorrupción se impartieron      cursos
         en auditoría forense, autodiagnóstico del papel del audigador (para auditores forenses), contabilidad
         y fraude, control interno para auditores forenses, estadísticas y probabilidades, equipos de alto
         rendimiento, ética y responsabilidad, fraude informático, fraude y corrupción, etc.

         Para el componente de difusión de principios de ética y transparencia se realizaron cursos en
         administración de bienes y servicios, organización administrativa, legal, programación de
         operaciones, administración de personal, y cursos introductorios de la ley 1178.

         En lo que respecta a la Ley SAFCO en Contabilidad, Auditoría y Administración Financiera se
         realizaron cursos en presupuesto, crédito público, contabilidad integrada, control gubernamental y
         tesorería.

         El CENCAP desde 1997 hasta el año 2002 ha capacitado en promedio a 12.400 servidores públicos
         en todo el país, el mejor comportamiento lo tuvo en la gestión 2001 con 17.002 servidores públicos
         capacitados en los sistemas de la Ley 1178, además de otros cursos que responden a ámbitos de
         aplicación específicos.

         La orientación fundamental de la labor del CENCAP ha estado dirigida a fortalecer la
         institucionalización de las entidades públicas; ahora queda el desafío de incidir para que los
         subsistemas de evaluación del desempeño de los servidores públicos den a la capacitación una
         valoración alta que influya en las decisiones de ascenso y rotación de los recursos humanos.

3. LECCIONES APRENDIDAS

   La Contraloría General de la República ha sabido aprovechar y optimizar los recursos asignados,
   orientándolos al propio fortalecimiento institucional con proyección hacia la contribución que debe dar
   todo órgano rector y autoridad superior de auditoría a la ciudadanía a través del trabajo que realiza y las
   recomendaciones que vierte para fomentar una gestión pública cada vez más eficaz, eficiente, económica y
   transparente en las entidades públicas del país. De todas maneras, habría resultado más beneficioso que
   durante el planteamiento del proyecto se precisen mejor los objetivos a alcanzar en cada uno de los
   componentes, orientados más a los efectos e impactos que deben producirse en la administración pública,
   haciendo posible un efectivo mejoramiento contínuo de las entidades y, por ende, del Poder Ejecutivo que
   es responsable por llevar adelante los planes de gobierno nacionales a través de sus instituciones.

   Sin embargo, al representar esta labor un esfuerzo permanente que debe llevar adelante la Contraloría
   General de la República en coordinación con las entidades auditadas, involucrando a los poderes del
   Estado y comprometiendo la labor del Órgano Rector de los Sistemas de Administración, es necesario que


                                                       - 44 -

   la cooperación internacional en general participe de manera más compenetrada en este proceso. Para ello,
   la Contraloría General de la República está ingresando en una etapa nueva dentro de su crecimiento y
   desarrollo institucional, orientada a potenciar de mejor manera el relacionamiento que debería sostener con
   todos los actores que, de una u otra forma, influyen en la administración y gestión pública de las entidades
   e instituciones del Estado. Este nuevo reto tendrá como fin último la recuperación de la confianza pública
   en sus propias organizaciones y en los servicios y productos que brindan.

4. EVALUACION DE LA LABOR DEL BANCO

   A lo largo de los casi seis años que ha tomado el proyecto, el Banco Mundial ha atendido de forma óptima
   los requerimientos y necesidades de la Contraloría General de la República, para poder desarrollar con
   eficiencia los desafíos propuestos en los cuatro componentes que eran su responsabilidad llevar adelante.
   Esta opinión es fundamental destacar porque resulta muy común que los organismos de cooperación
   internacional, en general, tiendan a ser muy burocratizados y lentos en la solución de necesidades y
   problemas; perjudicando el proyecto e incluso afectando los intereses no solo institucionales sino
   ciudadanos.

   Sin embargo, en el caso del Banco Mundial se ha dado una relación coherente y dinámica con excepción
   del último año en el que debido quizás a la falta de continuidad, rotación repetitiva del nuevo "task
   manager" para Bolivia, u otros motivos que no son de conocimiento de la entidad ejecutora, el Banco ha
   incurrido en desentendidos y debilidades en la interpretación técnica respecto del ámbito de la adquisición
   de bienes y servicios; lo que ha provocado que la Contraloría General de la República deba presentar
   formalmente un reclamo que, a pesar de demostrar una posición coherente, no ha existido de parte del
   Banco el reconocimiento de su propia responsabilidad que ha sido la que finalmente provocó no sólo un
   problema que afecta al presupuesto aprobado de la entidad prestataria, sino su imagen institucional hacia
   la comunidad de empresas y personas naturales que le proveen servicios y productos según sus
   necesidades.

   Concretamente la situación provocada es producto de la ausencia de asesoramiento que debe brindar el
   Banco en el proceso de adquisiciones y, sobretodo, en situaciones en las que, en su entender, podrían
   sucederse interpretaciones inadecuadas e incorrectas que luego se deriven en decisiones mal adoptadas. La
   Licitación Pública Internacional CGR/GNA/LPI-001/2002 "adquisición de equipos de computación y
   otros bienes" tuvo su inicio en febrero de la gestión 2002 y finalizó en el mes de agosto de 2003 (último
   pago a la empresa proveedora). La observación del Banco Mundial respecto de esta licitación se centró en
   el porcentaje de financiamiento que debería aplicarse sobre el costo de esta adquisición. La Contraloría
   General de la República vivió una experiencia anterior de adquisición bajo los mismos parámetros en la
   gestión 2001 (adquisición de bienes a la empresa SISTECO ­ empresa local) cuyo costo de adquisición
   (Costo CIP-Aduana más Gastos de desaduanización) fue reembolsado sin ninguna observación de parte
   del Banco Mundial y en el porcentaje que correspondía. Esta experiencia que no tuvo contratiempos ni
   opinión en contra, conllevó a que la Contraloría General de la República efectúe en la gestión 2002 una
   adquisición similar y por un importe mayor al anterior. Sin embargo, en esta siguiente ocasión el Banco
   Mundial sorprende a la Contraloría General de la República cuando recién en el momento de la solicitud
   del primer pago directo a la empresa adjudicada, observa el porcentaje de financiamiento. Esta tardía
   interpretación de la norma ha ocasionado un serio problema de tipo económico a la entidad ejecutora,
   debido a que este importe no estaba presupuestado y en consecuencia no se tenía previsto incurrir en este
   gasto con recursos propios. En la actualidad la Contraloría General de la República afronta un problema
   legal interpuesto por la empresa proveedora, por incumplimiento de pago.




                                                       - 45 -

El Banco Mundial pudo haber evitado este problema en más de una oportunidad, puesto que esta entidad
financiadora otorga la "no objeción" en las siguientes fases del proceso de licitación: i) al contenido de la
publicación en el Development Bussines y otros medios escritos locales; ii) al Documento de Licitación;
iii) a la evaluación y a la adjudicación de la empresa proveedora y; vi) al Contrato de provisión de bienes.
Esta situación se vio agravada por las contradicciones que se produjeron entre la misión del Banco
Mundial en La Paz ­ Bolivia que estaba de acuerdo con los criterios empleados por la Contraloría General
de la República y el porcentaje de financiamiento de este proceso en particular, y el Banco Mundial ­
Washington que no aceptaba los argumentos de nuestra institución, que estaban apoyados además en los
criterios vertidos por el Banco Mundial ­ La Paz.

Lamentablemente este problema no fue solucionado de la manera en que nuestra institución esperaba y, en
base a esta única experiencia, la Contraloría General de la República recomienda al Banco Mundial no
sólo revisar y mejorar sus procedimientos en esta materia, sino sobretodo definir con mayor claridad sus
responsabilidades, para evitar entrar en lagunas conceptuales que sólo contribuyen a que la solución sea
parcial, provocando situaciones de distanciamiento que llevan al debilitamiento de una relación
interinstitucional sólida que por muchos años ha sido construida con el mayor esfuerzo.

 Lo más censurable de esta experiencia es que sea precisamente a la Contraloría General de la República
 de Bolivia, Órgano Rector del Control Gubernamental y Autoridad Superior de Auditoria del Estado a
 quien se la responsabilice de un error de control y de proceso, cuando es precisamente esta entidad la que
 promueve y persigue que los controles estén bien implantados en toda la administración pública boliviana.
