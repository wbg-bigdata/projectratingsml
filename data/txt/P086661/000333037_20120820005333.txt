1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
Sector Background
By the early1990s, over 90% of the rural population in Bangladesh had access to safe water
for domestic use, thanks largely to privately owned handpumps on shallow tubewells. A
shallow water table extends across most of the country. The government and donors, notably
UNICEF, developed and promoted the technology for tapping this source, first through drilling
programs and subsequently through activities to build capacity in the private sector for
inexpensive drilling and low-cost handpump production.1 As a result, the technology became
widely available and affordable, so that rural households could install their own safe water
supplies in or near their compounds. 2 That led both to high access rates and high service levels,
as rural consumers generally enjoyed the equivalent of a yard connection.
The story changed in 1993, when the government became aware that thousands of tubewells
in more than half the country’s 64 districts were contaminated by arsenic. The world had
never seen arsenic contamination on such a wide scale before. While the extent of the problem
and its impact were not known, it was estimated that millions of people using shallow wells were
at risk of death or serious illness. The government and donors perceived a national crisis
demanding urgent action.
The Bank responded with the US$44 million credit for the Bangladesh Arsenic Mitigation
Water Supply Project (BAMWSP, P050745), 1998-2006. The project’s largest component
aimed to provide arsenic-safe water to the most severely affected villages and pourashavas
(municipalities). The other major component comprised activities to increase understanding of
the arsenic problem.
The most popular and reliable alternative technology tested by BAMWSP turned out to be
deep tubewells, provided that they were installed at a rate of one per 10-15 households.3
The original service level had been set at one per 200 households, but that proved to be too
drastic a cut in the service standard that people enjoyed with shallow tubewells. The project
developed an implementation approach based on contracting local consultants (e.g., NGOs) to
support specially formed user groups,4 which then planned and implemented the water point
construction activities.
In 2002, the Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) published research that concluded rural
people overwhelmingly preferred piped water supplies for arsenic-safe water, and were
willing to pay for this level of service. The research indicated that rural consumers were willing



1
 In Bangladesh, a shallow tubewell is 30-50 meters deep, but the static water level is 7.5 meters or less.
Therefore an inexpensive suction pump can be used.
2
  Rural access remained problematic in areas where shallow handpumps could not be used, the main
reasons being that the shallow aquifer was not palatable (due to iron, sea water intrusion, etc.), was not
accessible through low-cost drilling (due to a stony layer), or was non-existent (northwest, southwest, and
central parts of country).
3
  Deep tubewells for domestic water are defined as anything over 150 meters deep. These are mainly used
in coastal areas where they typically go down to 300 meters.
4
    These user groups are called Ward Arsenic Mitigation Water User Groups (WAMWUGs).


                                                      1
to pay a tariff that would both cover operation and maintenance, and contribute at least 10%
toward capital costs. Pilot activities by a national research institute, the Rural Development
Academy (RDA), added credence to this argument. 5
Therefore, BAMWSP began a pilot activity in 2002-03 to construct 13 rural piped schemes,
based on using the local private sector to build, partially finance, and operate the schemes.
Bangladesh at that time had about 100 rural piped schemes, most of which had been implemented
by the Department of Public Health Engineering (DPHE).6 The BAMWSP schemes, along with
those by RDA and a few schemes implemented by the Bank-assisted Social Investment Program
Project (SIPP), stood out in terms of their efforts to introduce private sector or NGO financing
and management. In the BAMWSP model, the investor-operator (called a “sponsor?) would
provide 40% of the investment costs, to be recouped over 15 years of operations through the tariff.
The community would make an upfront 10% capital cost contribution, and BAMWSP would
provide the remaining 50%. One of these pilot schemes was largely completed by the end of
BAMWSP; the others were not yet under construction.
BAMWSP experienced major delays, attributed to poor project management. The Project
Management Unit (PMU) had been set up as semi-independent of DPHE, because previous Bank-
financed operations with DPHE had experienced problems. However, BAMWSP made very
slow progress, leading to an unsatisfactory rating on implementation for 2 ½ years, and a US $5
million grant cancellation. In 2003, the Bank supported reintegrating the PMU into DPHE in an
effort to solve the problem. Implementation subsequently improved, but this change could not
necessarily be attributed to the reintegration of the PMU.7
Rationale for Bank Involvement
The Bank could assist the Government of Bangladesh to scale up quickly the provision of
safe rural water by promoting an innovative private sector approach to rural piped water
supplies. The technologies (e.g., pond sand filters, dug wells, rainwater harvesting, deep
tubewells) that BAMWSP had tested suffered from limited demand, due to their lower service
level. The WSP research suggested that piped schemes had offered a level of service for which
consumers were willing to pay tariffs sufficient to cover operation and maintenance as well as
some of the investment costs. Furthermore, the new financing and management approach held
out the promise that it would both enable scaling up and ensure sustainability, through private
sector (“sponsors?) involvement and adequate cost recovery.




5
  RDA had implemented several multipurpose rural piped schemes projects that supplied water for rice
field irrigation, domestic water use, and other small-scale activities such as livestock and nurseries. In
these schemes, local operators agreed to pay 10% of the investment costs upfront, and use the revenue from
the schemes to cover operation and maintenance, plus repay the outstanding capital costs within 10 years.

6
 DPHE is the main agency charged with water supply and sanitation in rural areas, and urban areas outside
Dhaka, Chittagong, and Khulna cities. It is under the Water Supply Wing of the Local Government
Division, in the Ministry of Local Government, Rural Development, and Cooperatives.

7
  The BWSPP PAD opted for integrating the PMU into DPHE, stating that this approach was not
necessarily a solution to the poor implementation. The BAMWSP TTL said that improved BAMWSP
performance was rather due to the new project director whose appointment coincided with PMU
reintegration (e-mail to ICR Team Leader, May 31, 2011).



                                                    2
The Bank saw a window of opportunity to push the water reform agenda with the
Government of Bangladesh. The government had expressed interest in developing new
approaches in the water sector. BWSPP would capitalize on this opportunity to introduce
innovation, which was why it was important to process the project rapidly and deliver it in
FY2004, even before the BAMWSP had fully tested the new private sponsor based approach to
rural piped schemes.
The municipal sector needed a more effective approach to operation and maintenance.
Water service levels in pourashavas were very poor. Only 100 out of 250 of these towns had
piped water. Coverage was 30-60%, and daily supply averaged between 3 and 12 hours. A
number were affected by arsenic. A pourashava component was included in BWSPP to test a
private sector approach as a means to address these problems. This was another way to capitalize
on the government’s interest in developing new approaches to the water sector.
Contribution to Higher Level Objectives
The project would contribute to health and productivity in the country. In addition to the
arsenic problem, water-related diseases continued to be widespread, and to account for a large
number of deaths each year. Mortality rates for infants and children under five years were
respectively 77 and 134 deaths per 1,000 live births.
The project would strengthen decentralization. A number of policy papers had indicated that
in the future DPHE should play more of a facilitating and monitoring role, with water provision
responsibilities undertaken by local government, NGOs, and the private sector. The government
had also introduced some measures to devolve more decision-making authority to the local levels
of government in general. The project was in line with both government initiatives, that is, the
specific one to reform DPHE, and the more general reform of local government’s role.
The Country Assistance Strategy (2006), Country Water Resources Assistance Strategy
(2005), and Poverty Reduction Strategy Program (2005) supported Bank investment in
rural piped water supplies. These documents were under preparation or planning when BWSPP
was being prepared. When these three documents were subsequently published, each supported
investments in rural water supplies.
BWSPP would provide the transition toward developing a programmatic approach and
SWAp for the water sector. The project would build capacity among various actors, and give
the Bank an opportunity to engage with other development partners.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
Original PDO:
The development objective of the proposed project is to contribute to Bangladesh’s efforts to
achieve the Millennium Development Goals in water supply and sanitation by 2015.
Specifically the project will pilot innovative measures to scale up the provision of safe water
supply free from arsenic and pathogens in rural areas and small towns

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and reasons/justification
The project was restructured in 2008, mainly due to poor performance. Only 12.8% of the
IDA grant had been disbursed by June 2008, and both progress toward achieving the development
objective and implementation performance were rated unsatisfactory. The grant was substantially
reduced, with US$25 million equivalent being transferred from BWSPP for flood and cyclone
relief under other projects. In addition, US$5 million equivalent within BWSPP was allocated to
a new non-piped water sub-component, providing point sources in flood and cyclone-affected
areas. The Board approved this restructuring in January 2008, based on the recommendation of
the Mid-Term Review mission. The project document for restructuring was approved on October
6, 2008.
Revised PDO:
The development objective of the project is to contribute to Bangladesh’s efforts to achieve the
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in water supply and sanitation by 2015 in select rural
and urban areas, including those in flood-affected districts, through pilots.
Specifically, the project will deliver increased access to the water and sanitation services in
selected rural villages and small towns, focusing on areas affected by the 2007 floods and
cyclones. The project will pilot some innovative service provision measures, including private
sector participation in rural schemes.
In terms of targets, the number of beneficiaries was cut by 54%. The goal became providing
safe water to 570,000 people in villages and towns, compared to an original target of at least 1.25
million persons.
The intermediate results indicators or their targets were greatly reduced, with the exception
of those for the rural non-piped water component. The changes in the intermediate results
indicators and targets are detailed in the table below. The principal changes were as follows:
    x    The rural piped component was drastically cut, from 300 villages to 21 villages and
         25,000 households, although still using the private sponsor model. 8
    x    The component to develop local financing for the piped schemes’ sponsors was cancelled.
    x    The pourashava water component was also cut, from piloting private operator models in
         order to make major improvements in quality and quantity of water in 3 pourashavas, to
         making modest improvements in access for 20,000 households/24 pourashavas, with no
         change in the existing management model. The 24 pourashavas comprised the 5
         originally selected to have private operators, plus 19 that had been affected by floods.
    x    However, the result indicator for rural deep tubewells was greatly expanded. The target
         went from 2,000 to 7,000 deep tubewells: 2,000 as originally planned in 3 heavily arsenic
         affected in 3 sub-districts (upazilas), plus 5,000 additional deep tubewells in cyclone-
         affected areas. The original 2,000 tubewells would be constructed using the participatory
         approach piloted by BAMWSP. The 5,000 additional tubewells would be constructed
         using the traditional DPHE approach.


8
  “No. of villages served? or even “no. of schemes constructed? did not prove to be a stable indicator. The
PAD assumed that a scheme would serve a village of an average 300 households. However, the scheme
designs that were submitted covered an average of 900 households, located in any number of villages.
Some schemes served as many as 12 villages (see Annex 2).The May 2007 supervision mission estimated
that the (original) component budget would only cover about 120 such schemes/villages.

1.7 Other Significant Changes
The closing date was extended by eight months, to December 31, 2010. This was to allow the
GOB to complete ongoing works, and achieve the targeted outcomes.
The GOB set 2 targets differently in its Revised Development Project Proforma (RDPP), as
compared to the project Document approved by the World Bank Board.. First, the RDPP
retained the original target for total number of beneficiaries served by safe water as 1.25 million.
Second, the RDPP raised the target number of water points in heavily arsenic-affected areas to
3,180, compared to 2,000 in the Results Framework. Note that the ICR reports against the targets
in the results Framework and not those in the RDPP.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
The rural non-piped water supply component succeeded quite well because its design was
based on a well-tested modification to a program that was thoroughly familiar to the
implementing agency, private sector, and communities. DPHE had long worked with the
private sector to construct handpumped water supplies and turn them over to communities to
manage. BAMWSP had developed, tested, and gone to scale with modifying the traditional
approach to so that communities had a larger role in site selection and contracting. BWSPP
seamlessly took over and continued this modified approach to deep boreholes in one of the same
districts where BAMWSP had worked.9
Otherwise, the overly ambitious project design contributed to the eventual need for
restructuring. The designs were particularly demanding for 3 components: rural piped schemes,
a local credit market, and pourashava water and sanitation.
The rural piped scheme component sought to scale up a new approach before a pilot
program had shown results. BAMWSP began testing the new approach in 13 schemes in 2002-
03. Implementation experienced serious delays. By the end of the BAMWSP, construction had
not even begun on 12 of the 13 schemes, and this despite the project being extended by a year.
BWSPP was already under implementation by then. In fact, the BWSPP concept note, including
plans to scale up the pilot approach, had been developed at almost the same time that the
BAMWSP pilot began..
The local credit market component was based on a reasonable idea that had not been
sufficiently developed. The logic behind having such a component was reasonable: local banks
would have to provide credit to the private sector, if it was supposed to provide all the initial
financing (as OBA required), and some of the long-term capital investment for piped schemes in
rural areas and pourashavas. However, preparatory work for this component appears limited.
The Mid-Term Review Mission pointed to the fact that private sponsors could not come up with
the required capital as one of the bottlenecks leading to restructuring.




9
 BWSPP introduced changes in the approach as recommended by the BAMWSP ICR: increase village
eligibility level to 400 households; use Ward Arsenic Mitigation Water Users Groups (WAMWUGs) for
implementation; rigorous water quality and material testing; establish GPS database for all point sources,
and improve transparency and fiduciary capacity of WAMWUGs



                                                     9
Preparation of the pourashava component was deferred to project implementation. The idea
to use private operators to design, build, and manage municipal water supplies was in line with
sector thinking at that time. However, BAMWSP had done nothing in pourashavas, due to some
early failures, and preparatory work for this component in BWSSP was deferred to project
implementation. The time required to do this preparation work was significantly underestimated
given the range of tasks to be completed in order for the component, as planned, to be a success:
    x introduce changes in existing local government legislation,
    x hire the technical consultancy to prepare the proposed activities,
    x build political consensus in each identified pourashava,
    x establish ring-fenced Pourashava Water Supply Entities to own the assets of the
         municipal water supplies,
    x select and mobilize the private operators, and
    x have the private operators design, build, and begin operating the infrastructure.
In addition the pourashava component required that the PMU interact with the local government
structures for municipalities, in addition to the rural local government institutions. This was an
unanticipated demand placed on the relatively weak PMU by this component’s design.
The procurement aspects of the project design were onerous. The project design comprised
more than 170 activities, some of which were themselves made up of multiple contracts. The
rural piped schemes component, for example, targeted 300 discrete contracts, each with multiple
procurement stages – a significant challenge given the PMU capacity (see below).
The risk for poor project management was candidly recognized, but the solution did not
prevent the problem from derailing implementation for a significant period. BAMWSP and
previous Bank operations with DPHE had experienced management problems with the PMU. As
the next section will explain, BWSPP also experienced a long period of unsatisfactory
performance due to poor management by the PMU.

2.2 Implementation
The project had to be restructured because implementation progress steadily declined,
coming to a “virtual standstill? by the Mid-Term Review. Project performance was
downgraded to Moderately Unsatisfactory less than 10 months after the effective data. The
actual assessment was borderline Moderately Unsatisfactory. By the Mid-Term Review,
disbursement stood at 5.2%, with about 30 months until the project closed, and 33 months after it
became effective.
Lack of commitment by the government, and poor management by PMU, were significant
factors behind the poor performance. The performance rating was initially downgraded
because, 18 months after project approval, the majority of PMU staff had not been put in place,
and the technical assistance for the pourashava component had not been procured.10
Management worsened when a new PMU Director with a very weak track record under
BAMWSP was appointed, despite resistance from the Bank team.11 The Mid-Term Review


10
     In fact, this contract would not be signed until 2 years after project approval.

11
   The Bank held repeated meetings with the Secretary of the Local Government Department about the
situation, with no change.



                                                         10
Mission noted, “The PMU continues to demonstrate an inability [to move towards]
implementation at a reasonable rate?.
The Mid-Term Review Mission also concluded that the project design had been too
ambitious, given that BWSPP was essentially a pilot project. The inability of the PMU to
manage the project was only part of the reason that it would have to be restructured. The other
reason was that project design had entailed both pilot-testing innovations and scaling up coverage.
The previous section has detailed this aspect of the design. The Mid-Term Review Mission’s
assessment of the situation was as follows:
        “…the project has many features of a pilot project. It is assessed that the scope and extent
        of innovative measures, together with coverage targets, were by far too ambitious given the
        weak implementation capacity and the lack of experience in implementing these innovative
        measures?
In summary, the need for restructuring was precipitated by the following three factors:
    x     overly ambitious assumptions in the design of the rural piped and pourashava water
          components,
    x     the overall complexity of the operation’s design, including multiple innovative
          components, an unusually heavy procurement burden, and multiple sets of institutional
          partners, and
    x     poor PMU management, including a poor choice of PMU Director.
Restructuring reduced the credit by 57%, to SDR 11.8 million from SDR 27.6 million (to
US$18.6 million from US$40 million equivalent). Beneficiaries were reduced to 570,000 from
1.25 million. The Board approved the proposal for restructuring in October 2008. Section 1.6
details the restructuring proposal by component.
Implementation improved after restricting because a new PMU Director was appointed.
The weak PMU Director retired about the time of restructuring, and was replaced by a
dynamic individual. Implementation improved considerably as a result. The experience
resembles that of BAMWSP: implementation slows and speeds up, depending on the
qualities of the PMU Director.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
Restructuring curtailed the M&E component. By the time of restructuring, the M&E
framework had not yet been developed. The plans were therefore scaled back significantly, given
“the reality of the project,? the very limited ability to implement activities to-date. The
restructured M&E component comprised progress reports from sponsors and one technical and
performance audit. The latter was carried out by consultants just prior to the end of the project.
The scaled back M&E program did not provide certain basic information. For example, the
ICR Team had to request the PMU to gather information about the number and types of
connections on the various rural and pourashava schemes in order to estimate the number of
beneficiaries. The beneficiary estimates are based on quite a number of assumptions, rather than
solid data. Furthermore, there is no information the degree to which the poor are served by the
schemes, or the views of a cross-section of community on the project results.
Key design features in the rural piped water component were never adequately evaluated.
For example, such issues such as the effectiveness of OBA, the business model based on single
schemes rather than clusters, and water quality regulation, were never evaluated. This is a major
shortcoming, given that the project was meant to test these innovations.


                                                  11
2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
Financial management, procurement, and environmental specialists were not recruited for
the PMU in a timely fashion. Section 2.2 has already explained that poor PMU staffing quickly
led to the project performance rating being downgraded.
No other safeguard or fiduciary problems were noted in the aide memoires or
Implementation Status and Completion Reports (ISRs). Aide memoires mentioned some
fiduciary problems such as not using the computerized accounting system for a period. None of
these problems were sufficiently grave as to be noted in ISRs. The fact that no water safety plans
for the rural piped schemes were produced was a potential problem. The PAD had pointed to
water source quality protection as one of several key environmental concerns. However, the final
supervision mission visited a random sample of rural piped and non-piped supplies, and found no
problems with construction impact, water quality, or health.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
On the Bank side, preparations for a follow-on project began in 2010, in the anticipation of taking
this project to the Board in February 2012. The Concept Review meeting was successfully held
in January 2011. There was good collaboration between the ICR and Project Preparation Teams,
to ensure that lessons learned are incorporated in the next project.
The follow-on project will seek to develop and test both the implementation and the operations
phases of using a public-private partnership approach to rural piped schemes. The project design
will incorporate the lessons learned from BWSPP about the need for simplicity and reasonable
scale in order to have a successful outcome.

3. Assessment of Outcomes
ICR Guidelines require that the project outcomes be assessed against both the original and the
restructured objectives. The two ratings are then combined in a weighted average, where the
weights are the percentages of actual loan disbursement before and after restructuring.12

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Rating: Satisfactory
Relevance of Objectives: Highly satisfactory before and after restructuring. The project
objective remains highly relevant: to assist Bangladesh to achieve the MDGs in rural water
supply through piloting innovative approaches top arsenic-safe water supply. Restructuring
added another aspect to this objective, namely assisting with providing safe water supplies to
areas hit by devastating cyclones and floods. This was a very appropriate adaptation to changing
circumstances.
Relevance of Design and Implementation: Moderately satisfactory before restructuring and
satisfactory after restructuring. Testing public-private partnerships to rural piped schemes
remains highly relevant to situation in Bangladesh. However, a design that emphasized testing
and evaluation, rather construction on a sizeable scale would have been better. The WAMWUG
model remains a relevant and appropriate design for non-piped water supply. However,




12
     The weights before and after restructuring for BWSPP are 0.14 and 0.86 respectively.



                                                      12
allocating supplies based on the number of households in a village (originally 200, then raised to
400, or fewer) has had the effect of arbitrarily denying safe water to some.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
Before restructuring: Highly unsatisfactory. The low disbursement rate—14%—at restructuring,
three and a half years after the project became effective, indicates how little had been achieved.
After restructuring: Moderately satisfactory. With restructuring, the project development
objective shifted in favor of providing water supplies to flood and cyclone affected areas, rather
than through widespread use of innovative models working with the private sector. The objective
in regard to the latter was refocused on pilot innovative models in a small number of rural piped
schemes.

As the above table indicates, the project had a highly satisfactory outcome in regard to three
components, exceeding the target number of beneficiaries. In regard to the rural piped scheme
component, the target number of beneficiaries was not met.
As Annex 2: Outputs by Component explains, the project made a major step forward in pilot-
testing the innovative private sponsor approach to piped rural water supply schemes. However,
there remain facets of that approach still to be developed and tested. This annex also explains
that the targeted output of 21 water safety plans for the rural piped schemes was not met.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately satisfactory
This rating reflects the moderately satisfactory rating on the achievement of the project
development objectives.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
There is no indication from supervision missions that there were any major issues or
problems with poverty impact, gender, or social development. Unfortunately, the virtual
demise of the M&E system makes it impossible to discuss poverty, gender, and social issues in
more detail. The original M&E system included annual consumer surveys. This system was
never put in place due to the problems described in Sections 2.1-2.2. However, the PMU did hire
a consultant firm to produce an end-of-project M&E report.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
DPHE, the implementing agency, has demonstrated willingness to support innovative
concepts. The WAMWUG approach to deep borehole supplies was successfully implemented as
originally designed, despite the many problems which BWSPP encountered in the course of
implementation. Since restructuring, the PMU has worked hard and well to complete the 21 rural
piped schemes using the very innovative private sponsor approach.
The institutional capacity of DPHE to manage projects does not seem to have improved,
although PMU performance increased markedly in the last two years of BWSPP. The
appointment of a new PMU Director improved DPHE performance considerably. BAMWSP,
had a similar experience whereby implementation progress varied hugely, depending on the
choice of PMU Director. This recurring boom or bust pattern of management is not indicative of
institutional development.




                                                14
The sector-wide impacts, which formed part of the rationale for Bank involvement and
contribution to higher level objectives, have not yet materialized. As Section 1.1 explained,
BWSPP was supposed to contribute to the “reinvention of DPHE,? utilize a “window of
opportunity? to push the water sector reform agenda, and help the Bank engage with other
development partners and the government in moving toward a programmatic approach. There
does not seem to be much evidence of this. Piped schemes are more widely viewed as a good
option for rural water supplies, but the type of public-private partnership that BWSPP promotes is
not well-understood, much less copied. The WAMWUG model, which appears successful, has
not been copied. Indeed, even within BWSPP, the majority of deep boreholes were constructed
using the classic DPHE approach, not the community contracting approach.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts
The majority of beneficiaries were served through traditional, rather than innovative
approaches. The original project development objective was to provide safe water supplies to
people through using innovative approaches such as private sponsor arrangements and
WAMWUGs. In practice, BWSPP delivered safe water supplies to many more people than
originally targeted, but only a small percentage were served via an innovative approach. The vast
majority were assisted in flood-affected pourashavas and cyclone-affected areas through the
classic DPHE approach to civil works.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
A consultant firm carried out a beneficiary and stakeholder survey at the end of the
project (see Annex 5). Restructuring had eliminated the plan to have annual consumer
surveys as part of a monitoring and evaluation system, but call for one technical and
performance audit. The main conclusions were:
    x   consumers served through non-piped supplies were satisfied with the water
        quality, access, and location of the handpumped sources,
    x   beneficiaries and other stakeholders of the rural piped schemes were satisfied, but
        also had numerous suggestions about how to improve the implementation process,
    x   pourashava beneficiaries and stakeholders in some schemes had complaints about
        the water bill and water quality, but the majority were satisfied, and
    x   the failure to put in place the monitoring and evaluation system affected the
        ability to get a complete view of how beneficiaries viewed the project’s outputs.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: High
The risk to development outcome is high, since most (71%) of the beneficiaries lives in cyclone-
affected areas. The risk of another natural disaster wrecking the handpumps is therefore high
although BWSPP did create procedures intended to improve responses to future disasters. For the
non-piped water supplies in cyclone-affected areas, the project introduced standardized bidding
documents together with batch procurement of these water points at the district scale, handled by
the district DPHE. This could form the basis for expedited procurement in the response to future
disasters.
An additional risk to development outcome exists because the innovative private sponsor
approach is just now entering the operations phase. Evidence is still lacking about the willingness



                                                15
and ability of consumers to pay the necessary tariffs, and the interest and capacity of sponsors to
operate the schemes sustainably. The experience from other countries with rural private operators
managing water schemes suggests that considerable support services must be put in place to help
operators, local government institutions, and community organizations perform their expected
roles. This is challenging even in countries where the government has already committed itself to
a rural water strategy based on private operators. The task will be all the more challenging in
Bangladesh, where this approach is still one option among several under consideration.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Unsatisfactory
The PAD recognized that the Bank could make an important contribution to Bangladesh rural
water supply, and specifically the response to arsenic contamination, through piloting an
innovative private sponsor approach to rural piped schemes. The project design also rightly
carried forward the approach to deep borehole water supplies than had been successfully piloted
in BAMSWP.
However, the design of the project was overly ambitious and complex, and this contributed
significantly to the need to restructure the project in 2008. In particular the design
underestimated the following challenges:
    x   rapid scaling up of the rural piped schemes initiative, when the BAMWSP pilot schemes
        were already experiencing delays,
    x   complex pourashava private operator component, with an unrealistic timeline for
        introducing major reforms,
    x   unusually heavy procurement requirements,
    x   the overall complexity of having all of the above in a single project, and
    x   misjudging the risk for poor PMU performance, which had been a problem in previous
        projects.
(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
Supervision missions visited the project frequently. They recognized in less than a year that
implementation was off-track and signaled this through downgrading the progress ratings. The
missions regularly set clear milestones in an effort to focus implementation efforts. The Country
Director and supervision missions met with the Secretary of the Local Government Department in
an effort to address the problems with PMU management.
However, the decision to restructure the project was unnecessarily delayed. The justification was
to delay any decision until Mid-Term Review, and this was in turn delayed due to a change in the
Task Team Leader. Given that BAMWSP had by 2006 failed to construct most of its pilot piped
schemes, and BWSPP implementation was downgraded early, it should have been clear that
action was needed.




                                                16
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
The overall rating reflects that the Development Outcome and Quality of Supervision
Performance Ratings were in the satisfactory range, but the Quality at Entry Performance Rating
was unsatisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government and Implementing Agency Performance13
Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory
For most of the project period (31.5 months, or 59%) ISR implementation performance was rated
in the unsatisfactory range. For an additional 6 months, the rating was borderline Moderately
Satisfactory. The implementation problems were directly related to the PMU management
problems, and a principal factor in the restructuring. Section 2.2: Implementation has provided
background on this situation, including that at core this was a government problem in putting a
capable PMU management in place.

6. Lessons Learned
The following list focuses on those lessons that have most clearly emerged from preparing
the ICR. Additional lessons are summarized in Annex 6: Stakeholder Workshop Report and
Results and the last section of Annex 7: Summary of Borrower’s ICR.
Weak PMU capacity can significantly impede implementation, due to factors beyond the
Bank’s control. PMU performance has been a reoccurring problem for water projects
implemented through DPHE. In the cases of both BAMWSP and BWSPP, this resulted in
unsatisfactory implementation and partial grant cancellation. Different structures for the PMU
have not prevented the problem. Interventions by the Bank supervision teams and the Country
Director have not solved the problem. This is an implementation risk that the Bank has not yet
found a method of mitigating in this sector.
Given the weak capacity of the PMU, operations with DPHE should be simple and keep the
number of local institutional partners to a minimum. The PMU Team was challenged by the
complexity of the project, and by the need to work with both the local government institutions for
rural areas as well as the parallel set of such institutions for municipalities. The need to manage
two sets of partners was too burdensome for the PMU.
More attention should be paid to pre-requisites required for innovative components to
succeed. Both the rural piped water and the pourashava components experienced problems
because certain pre-requisites were not in place. In the case of the rural piped schemes, the
BWSPP component for a credit facility really should have been in place before the private
sponsors began construction. As this was not the case, the component had trouble attracting and
retaining private sponsors because they could not obtain loans for financing and capital
investment. The pourashava component, as originally designed, required changes in legislation
and buy-in from the municipalities before the private operators could effectively begin to work.
Better sequencing of various activities could have avoided at least some of the implementation
problems.


13
 The ICR Team was not in a position to unravel how DPHE performance was affected by factors in the
ministry and government as a whole. Therefore, only a single rating has been given.



                                                 17
The procurement burden, especially of innovative projects using local private operators for
water supplies, needs to be well-evaluated during project preparation. At the time of
restructuring, BWSPP had 170 procurement packages pending. But given that many of these
involved multiple steps, the burden was more like 300.
Too many innovative components in a single operation can overtax the PMU’s
implementation capacity. Attempting to introduce a private operator approach in both rural
piped and pourashava schemes was extremely demanding. The non-piped water component was
successfully implemented, despite the many problems faced by BWSPP, in part because the
approach had been developed and tested in the course of BAMWSP.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
The comments received from the Borrower may be found in their entirety in Annex 7.
The borrower points out two differences between Project Document approved by the World
Bank Board and the Revised Development Project Proforma (RDPP), approved by the
Government of Bangladesh. First, the revised target for the Project Development Objective was
570,000 beneficiaries supplied with safe water, whereas the government document retained a
target of 1.25 beneficiaries. Second, the Project Document sets the revised target for deep
tubewells in heavily arsenic affected areas at 2,000, as compared to the 3,810 target set by the
government. The ICR reports on achievements against the Results Framework. Therefore,
Section 1.7: Other Significant Changes has been added to explain how these targets differ from
those in the RDPP.
The borrower points out the various factors that should be considered in assessing
borrower performance. The borrower points out that implementation problems can be
attributed to the project being simultaneously innovative, ambitious, and complex. The ICR
points to the same factors in describing the poor implementation results in Section 2.2:
Implementation. The same factors explain why Bank performance was rated unsatisfactory in
regard to the quality of project design at entry (Section 5.1: Quality at Entry). However, Section
2.2, and the Aide memoires and ICRs on which it is based, also documents the long periods when
the government failed to appoint staff to the PMU, and kept a non-performing PMU Director in
place. Perhaps the best testimony to how poor PMU management was during this period lies in
how much implementation improved when a new PMU Director took over. However, the rating
for borrower performance must reflect the entire project period, and not only the final years.
A summary table has been added to Annex 2.3: Rural Non-Piped Water Component to show
more clearly how the number of beneficiaries for deep tubewells has been estimated. The
borrower reports a larger number of beneficiaries has been served through non-piped water
supplies than the ICR estimates. The basic assumptions used in the ICR estimations are
consistent with those indicated in the Project Document, the Beneficiary Survey, and the average
number of persons per rural household as given by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics. The
summary table with its accompanying notes and sources will hopefully make the basis for the
estimates clearer. Note, that the ICR uses a higher figure for number of non-piped water supplies
constructed than the figure given in the borrower’s completion report. The ICR team was
previously requested to use the number of constructed tubewells as of April 30th, 2011. The
borrower’s report uses the figure as of December 31, 2010.
Table 6 has now been updated with the latest figures provided by the PMU on the number
of operational connections in the rural piped schemes. The number of beneficiaries does not
change, because the earlier generous assumptions produced an estimate slightly higher than that
generated by the most recent data.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

2.1        Rural Piped Schemes Component

Physical outputs
The component constructed 21 schemes, of which 12 schemes were in operation in
November 2010.14 Each scheme comprises 2 production tubewells, one pump house, a pump and
pumping machinery, storage tank (either ground or overhead), piped distribution network, and
consumer connections. Most schemes include treatment works, and a few have begun adding
household meters. The status of civil works in these schemes as of November 2010 (one month
before project closure) was as follows:
       x   Six schemes fundamentally completed: The only outstanding work on these schemes
           was to complete the planned number of connections. All these schemes were in
           operation.
       x   Twelve schemes 80-95% completed: Seven of these schemes were not yet in operation,
           in six cases because the schemes had not yet received an electricity connection.
       x   Three schemes were 65-75% completed: Two of these schemes were not yet in
           operation.
By project closure, 17 schemes were in operation. Detailed information on their physical
completion was not available.15. Three of the 17 schemes had not yet received electrical
connections, and were operating with a generator.
Numbers served
The component achieved its revised target of serving 21 villages. The 21 schemes serve an
unknown number of villages, but far in excess of 21. The PAD had assumed that schemes would
serve about 300 households, and that they would all live in a single village. However, as the
schemes increased to cover an average of 900 households, it become less likely that they would
all live in a single village. 16 For example, Fatehnagar scheme serves 13 villages, each with an
average of around 200 households.
The component served around 10,000 households (50,000 people) with rural piped water.
The PMU reported that 7, 427 connections had been completed as of October 24, 2010, later
updated to 9,037. The note to the table at the end of this section explains how the number of
households and beneficiaries were calculated.




14
     The data in this section come from the October progress report of the PMU on behalf of the GOB.

15
  Due to this lack of data, the previous paragraph detailed construction status two months prior to project
closure.

  To complicate matters further, “village? is not an administrative unit, and sometimes even local residents
are hazy about where villages start and end.

Innovative approach piloted
The project developed and refined a process to involve private sponsors in the planning,
implementation, and operation of rural piped schemes. The principal steps in the approach
were: (1) request Expressions of Interest, (2) prequalify interested respondents, (3) sign a
Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), (4) approve Inception Reports (proposed village, socio-
economic characteristics, proposed team, water quality report, etc.), (5) approve feasibility study,
(6) approve design study, and (7) sign grant agreement. At this point, construction began. Upon
completion, the sponsors were to manage operations for 15 years, later extended to 18 years.
The planning process took a considerable time to complete. The number of months required to
go from MoU to approved design study ranged from 10 to 39 months for the 21 schemes, with a
median of 20 months. To go from MoU to grant agreement required from 16 to 55 months, with
a median of a little over 3 years. The reasons for the long lag time included the following: poor
PMU management; sponsors’ difficulty in making capital contribution, and cash flow problems;
difficulties in procuring land; need for additional test drilling; price escalation.
The project successfully recruited NGOs and a few private enterprises to serve as private
sponsors. The project twice called for expressions of interest from the private and NGO sector,
which produced 155 responses for the first round, and 104 responses for the second round. From
the first round, 84 potential sponsors completed 88 inception reports, of which 71 were approved.
The various project documents give conflicting figures as to how many sponsors proceeded
further in the process, and in any case, the decision to restructure the project limited the number
of sponsors who would be allowed to complete construction of schemes.
The failure to complete 6 of the 13 BAMWSP schemes taken over by BWSPP illustrates the
sponsor attrition problems. The reasons for dropping these schemes were as follows: 3 contracts
were cancelled due to slow or no progress on civil works; 1 sponsor decided not to continue; and
the lack of available land led to cancelling 2 schemes. Sponsors’ difficulty in getting financing
likely lies behind the 4 schemes dropped due to lack of progress and interest.
The sponsors do not have a fully commercial view of the schemes. Sixteen NGOs and 3 private
enterprises serve as sponsors for the 21 schemes constructed. All these sponsors are committed to
cost recovery. However, they all have a rather relaxed attitude toward recovering their capital
investment; they are as much concerned with providing a service to the communities. This is
even true for the 3 private enterprises, all of which manage schemes in their owners’ home
communities.
The benchmarking and monitoring framework, and the water safety plans for water quality
control, were not implemented. Both activities were part of the original design. Work on the
regulatory framework was eliminated as part of the restructuring. Water quality plans were
supposed to be completed for each scheme, but this target was not achieved, as discussed below
under Section 2.4: Capacity-building, Regulation, and Training.
Pilot-testing of the operations phase is just beginning. Most schemes have only been in
operation a short while. Two schemes have been in operation for three and four years
respectively. At the other extreme are the 9 schemes that have not yet begun operations. The
remaining schemes have been in operation for a median of 4 months. So far, service delivery is
generally for 6 hours per day, divided among morning, mid-day, and evening periods. Service
has been curtailed in this way to reduce costs in line with revenue collection. At least 1 scheme,
however, provides water 24/7.
Revenue collection exceeded estimated monthly operation and maintenance charges in September
2010, for 7 out of 9 schemes. The balances range from a surplus of US $705 to a debit of $76,
with a median of $84. The monthly O&M estimates appear to cover only routine costs, not


                                                 21
reserves for major replacements and repairs. The other 12 schemes were not in operation, or data
were not available.
Another indication of possible threats to financial sustainability is that some consumers have
successfully lobbied for tariffs to be lowered from the agreed-upon rate.
In summary, a promising start to innovative private sponsor model was made, but more
work will be needed. The project has shown that the private sponsor model could be a vehicle
for expanding piped water supply services in Bangladesh. It will be important for the Bank to
examine how it could provide follow up support to the BWSSP pilots to increase the likelihood of
their long term sustainability and scale up.

Note: These data are from November 2010 (PMU 2010). Based on these data, the number of beneficiaries was estimated as 48,770, assuming 3 households per
shared connection and 5 persons per household. An earlier calculation on the data then available had produced an estimate of 50,000 beneficiaries. Since the
two estimates are quite close, and the estimation error likely significant, the figure of 50,000 beneficiaries was retained.

Physical Outputs and numbers served
The main and additional civil works were completed in 24 pourashavas. The civil works
comprised drilling test and production tubewells, pump house construction, pumping unit
installation, and pipeline construction.
The DPHE supplied figures showed that 9,156 additional domestic (household and
public standpost) connections were delivered as a result of the project. The borrower’s
ICR contains more details on the connections and pourashava civil works.

2.3     Rural Non-Piped Water Component
Heavily arsenic-affected areas (3 upazilas in Munshiganj District
The target for this sub-component was over-achieved. The project paper on restructuring
BWSPP set the target at 2,000 deep tubewells, increased to 3,180 by the Bangladeshi
government when it revised its project documentation. As of October 2010, 3,500 deep
tubewells had been completed, and 320 were under construction.
An estimated 35,000 households (175,000 people) were served through this sub-
component. This calculation is based on the assumption that the 3,500 deep tubewells served
an average of 10 households each, in line with the assumption in the restructuring paper.
The implementation procedure developed by BAMWSP was successfully followed: Two
NGOs were contracted by the PMU to assist and train ward committees (WAMWUGs) to
select sites, collect a 10 % capital cost contribution from users, and contract for the tubewell
construction. All completed tubewells were reported to be in operation as of November 2010.
Note the following two observations about the WAMWAG approach:
The implementation procedure does not appear to have gained widespread acceptance yet.
For example, the Danida-assisted Hysawa program works through local government (union
parishads) rather than ward committees.
Comparative data on the long-term sustainability of deep tubewells managed by WAMWUGs
would help make a convincing case for this approach. Data is needed on the operation,
maintenance, and use of tubewells that were constructed, say, ten or more years ago, and
under different approaches.
The BWSPP criterion of only financing deep tubewells in villages with less than 400
households was administratively simple but may not have reflected demand from
communities. The criterion originally had a financial rationale, namely that villages with less
than 400 households could not be economically served by a piped scheme. In practice,
however, BWSPP funded piped schemes that serve villages of less than 200 households
through supplying several such villages in a single scheme (cf. Fatehnagar, Dhalikandi). Also,
BWSPP simply denied deep tubewells to larger villages without offering another option for
safe water. This had the perverse effect of keeping the project out of the villages which had
the greatest number of people in need of safe water. It became all the more arbitrary given
that the populations of some villages fluctuate over time above and below the cut-off of 400
households.

 This sub-component serves estimated 167,320 households (836,642 people) were
 served.18 The target for this sub-component was over-achieved. A total of 9,659 tubewells
 were been completed (mostly deep tubewells, but some shallow), compared to a target of
 5,000.19 The consultant survey of consumers, at the end of the project, found all tubewells
 working, and providing water of acceptable quality (DPHE 2010).
 These tubewells were constructed using the traditional DPHE approach. Sites were
 selected based on government procedures. The DPHE Executive Engineer executed the work
 through contractors, paid by PMU. The beneficiaries were not required to make a
 contribution.

BWSPP fell significantly short in updating the national database begun under
BAMWSP. The restructured project document stated in the text (but not in the table of
outcome indicators) that “the quality testing of all wells drilled under BAMWSP and BWSPP
would be completed and fed into a water quality database?. As the above table indicates, this
activity would require much more borehole testing and database entry than the quantitative
target set at the time of restructuring.
BWSPP did not develop Water Safety Plans for any of the rural piped schemes . The
description of the restructured project also stated that it would develop 21 such plans, that is,
one per scheme. None were developed, although some orientation and training on the subject
was provided by the PMU to the sponsors.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

This Annex will assess the ex-post socio-economic benefits derived from the restructured
project in providing access to safe water in the project areas; and therefore, aim to
demonstrate the degree to which the project development objectives were achieved despite
sizable reduction in the project scope. Due to major project restructuring, it would not be
possible to compare the Economic Analysis presented in the PAD with that in the ICR.
Nevertheless, economic analysis was carried out for similar components, with scope as
summarized below.
   Implementation of 21 Rural Piped Water Supply Schemes;
   Implementation of scheduled works under selected 24 Pourashavas (small towns);
   Implementation of water point sources (non-piped water supply scheme) in 3 Upazilas of
    Munshigonj District; and in areas affected by two Cyclones of SIDR and AILA.

The project benefited an estimated 996,514 people directly, and provided many positive
spillover social and economic impacts at the individual, community and national levels.
Health and environmental benefits and cost saving from medical and health related expenses
are the largest benefits of any water supply and sanitation project, but they are difficult to
quantify in entirety. The full range of economic impacts include: (i) direct benefits which
consist of access to safe water for 1.0 million people; (ii) indirect benefits that are additional
economic activities resulting from linked businesses, suppliers of goods and services,
additional employment opportunities in services sector (transport, sales, monitoring, etc.),
private sector development activities, and provision of operating inputs; and (iii) induced
benefits which measure the consumption expenditures of those who have been involved in the
investment activities directly (Private Sponsors) and indirectly (suppliers, service providers)
which further stimulate the local economy. A summary of estimated number of people
benefited from various schemes so far is presented in Table 8 below. Many more people in
project areas are expected to directly and indirectly benefit from this project when all schemes
are fully operational and expanded in the future.

Methodology - A benefit-cost framework using a “with? and “without? project methodology
has been used to calculate the Economic Rate of Return (ERR) and the Net Present Value
(NPV) of the project under various schemes. Without project situation is what would have
been prevailed without the project vis-a-vis factors such as population increase, continued
exposure to Arsenic, and economic growth. The full range of economic benefits derived from
this project cannot be measured due to incomplete and lack of data. To the extent possible,
selected meaningful quantifiable benefits are estimated for this analysis. With conservative
assumptions used, the quantified results and net benefits are therefore, an underestimation of
the true impacts of provision of safe water.


                                               28
The Economic Analysis covers a project life of 25 years (and 20 years for non-piped water
supply scheme) and cash flow is discounted at 10%, which is the cost of capital.20 For the
private sector investment in the piped water scheme, the Economic Rate of Return is
calculated at discount rates of 10% and above. For purposes of calculating the NPV of the
investment of water supply, the stream of financial cost was adjusted for impacts of taxes,
subsidies, and externalities to arrive at the economic value, using an estimated Standard
Conversion Factor (SCF) of 0.938 as of year 2009. For simplicity and the fact that the cost of
the project includes labor and physical capital, the SCF is applied to the total flow of financial
costs of the project minus the cost of land.


Sector Issue – Without Project Situation

The Arsenic related problems in Bangladesh dates to the 1970s, when large number of
shallow wells installed throughout the country, unwittingly tapping into natural occurring
Arsenic in the ground. The Arsenicosis symptoms and deadly effects of Arsenic poisoning
take a long time to manifest. According to a survey conducted by the DPHE 21, 51 (out of 64)
Districts in the country are affected by various levels of Arsenic in the ground water, putting
over 82 million of Bangladesh population at risk of exposure to Arsenic. Of this number, 53%
(43.6 million people) live in 1,575 unions (out of total of 4,498 unions) where 20% of tube
wells exceed Bangladesh drinking water limit of 0.05 mg/liter and 13.4% (11 million people)
live in 466 unions where contaminated ratio is more than 80%. That is, 33% (27 million
people) of 82 million people are at very high risk with exposure to more than 0.05 mg/liter.
Estimated 29 million people are at risk with exposure to Arsenic of 0.05 mg/liter.22 Chronic
Arsenicosis can lead to various forms of skin lesions, cancers, vascular diseases, ischemic
heart diseases, hypertension, and other disabling and deadly diseases. Each year, 46 out of
100,000 people are contracted with Arsenic related diseases. This mass poisoning has adverse
effects on the individuals, productivity, and the entire economy.

The average per capita health cost for a concentration of 0.028 mg/liter Arsenic in water was
estimated to be about TK 140 per year in 2004 current prices.23 Concentration of Arsenic in
most of the project areas is above 0.05mg/liter causing more serious illnesses (and therefore a
higher treatment cost) among a wider population, as indicated above. For example, in the 3
Upazilas of Munshiganj District where non-piped water scheme was implemented, the
concentration of Arsenic on average is 80%. With inflation rate of over 6 percent per annum,
the per capita health cost could reach at least to TK 230 in 2010.

Health impacts and diseases associated with lack of access to safe water have direct
implication for population welfare (health related quality of life) but also have financial and
economic impacts (spending on health care and loss of income or production) not only for the
individual but the entire nation. The Willingness to Pay (WTP) survey conducted by the
Private Sponsors for the appraisal of rural piped water supply schemes indicates that
households are willing to pay for safe potable water. The results indicate that they are willing

  Based on the data from World Bank Dhaka office and IMF, average interest rate for domestic public
debt is 9.7 percent, and that for foreign public debt is 0.9 percent. On average the cost of government
borrowing is around 5 percent. For cash flow analysis a 10 percent discount rate is used.

to pay average TK150 per month (or TK 1,800 per year) for safe water. As in the without the
project scenario, they actually pay somewhat higher than TK150 per months to collect water
from a water source 1 to 4 Kilometers from their houses, taking 20 to 60 minutes to collect
water. Rickshaws are hired, at a cost, in some villages on daily basis to transport water. The
water from these shallow wells is likely to have Arsenic contamination and other impurities
such as high level of iron and salinity. The water tariff that people in the project areas
actually pay indicated their willingness to pay for safe water; which factor in their
opportunity cost of time (cost of their labor), and other costs (health related, loss of output)
associated with consuming poor quality and unsafe water and other ripple adverse impacts on
their social and economic life.

The Economic Rate of Return is calculated for the 3 components of the project.24 The results
presented below shows that even with significant reduction of scope and coverage of the
original project and conservative assumptions 25 the project generates a range of economic
benefits for the beneficiaries, those involve in the implementation, and for the country as a
whole.


With Project: Economic Benefits of Piped Rural Water Supply - Component 1

This component had significant social and economic benefits for the communities, the Private
Sponsors, and the economy as a whole. Each of the 21 contract agreements consist of initial
capital investment by the Sponsors at 20% of the total costs and Operation & Maintenance of
the schemes for 18-20 years. After 18-20 years the schemes will be handover to the
respective CBOs of the Water User Group of each scheme. Economic analysis for this
component was conducted to assess the impact of the project based on incremental economic
costs and benefits. Incremental costs include investment costs (adjusted by Standard
Conversion Factor), and Operations and Maintenance (O&M) costs during the life of the
project. Quantifiable gross benefits of the piped water supply considered for the calculation of
NPV are made of an estimate of the following:

     (i) Water sold at flat tariff rate established based on the willingness to pay of the
         beneficiaries26 which comprise of economic value of incremental water consumptions
         by families who were provided with access to piped water under the project.
         Collection efficiency is appraised by the Sponsors at 95% on average. Base case
         inflation rate is estimated at 6% per annum.
     (ii) Institutional benefits for the 21 Private Sponsors. In addition to revenue earned from
          water sale each scheme, on average, has provided long term (18 years on full time
          basis) job opportunity for 3 Scheme Operators (1 Manager, and 1 Tariff Collector)
          plus 1 Pump Operator. Institutional benefits (which are indirect benefits) are
          calculated as the difference between the salaries that they would have earned without

  The Economic Analysis is carried out for the life of the project and takes into account the full scope
of the project and implementation of the entire planned design.
25
  Avoided health costs only apply to those at very high risk of Arsenic related diseases. Also, the
30 % of the health cost born by the beneficiaries already factored in their willingness to pay (or actual
payments for water) and only 70% of health cost born by the government is considered for NPV
exercise.
26
   In the ex-ante Economic Analysis carried out for the PAD, it was assumed water is sold at a tariff
rate per volume (m3) used. However, in reality the tariff charged in piped water scheme of component
1 and 2 is a flat monthly rate. Base year tariff for rural piped water was set at TK 180, TK 150, TK120,
and TK 400 for multiple, single, shared, and commercial connections respectively. This tariff is
expected to rise with inflation.

         the project (not being a steady job) with that they can earn with the project. The
         incremental institutional benefits as a result of higher earnings and steady income for
         63 persons (21 scheme times 3 people) also generate induced benefits pumped back
         into the economy (which is difficult to quantify). 27
     (iii) Health benefit of the project for country is the avoided costs of treatment of people
          with arsenic related illnesses.28 Health care costs can fall on both patients and public
          health system, which would impact the entire population and national economy. Out-
          of-pocket cost to individual is assumed to be 30% with 70% of the treatment cost is
          born by the government health system. While, the 30% cost to individual is factored
          in their willingness to pay for water, the avoided 70% remaining cost to the economy
          is incremental benefit resulting from the project, with ripple benefits to the individual
          and the country as a whole.

Economic Benefits - Conservative assumptions are used to calculate economic rate of return.
Project benefit derived from the implementation of 21 piped water schemes when subsidized
by the IDA borrowing is positive at 10% with ERR at 13.15% even without health benefits.
With health benefits, the NPV is higher with an ERR of 14.20% as presented in Table 9
below. The net benefits to the Private Sponsors and CBOs (gross benefits minus costs borne
by the sponsors) for managing the schemes are huge (higher profit margin as investment is
subsidized by IDA) with an ERR of 25.26% discounted for the period of 25 years. A Risk
Analysis with 25% increase in inflation and costs when subsidized by IDA still show positive
NPV at 10% with an ERR of 12%.

  It is assumed that the Manager earns TK 6,000 and Tariff Collector and Pump Operator each earn
TK 5,000 per month with the project. On 24 day / month basis, it is conservatively assumed that, on
average, they would lose two days of work per month without the project as they may not have steady
work. That gives TK 6000 / year incremental higher income for Manager and TK 5000 of that for the
Two Operators. This is the case for each 21 scheme.

  Health benefits for individual are factored in their willingness to pay and agreed tariff with

Economic Benefits of Urban-Piped Water Supply (Pourashavas) – Component 2

Quantifiable gross benefits of the Pourashavas piped water supply component considered for
calculation of NPV are estimate of:
       (i) Value of incremental water sold to the consumers at a flat tariff rate per connection.
           As a result of the project an estimated 9,156 new connections were provided and
           close to 22,000 households (or estimated 109,872,000 people) received connections.
           An average flat rate of TK 164 per connection per month is assumed for calculating
           the economic value of water sold.29
       (ii) Health benefits (avoided health costs to the public health system) to additional
            109,872 people in the 24 Pourashavas. The health costs to the individuals are
            factored in their willingness to pay.

Economic Benefits – The scheme is highly beneficial for the supplier and beneficiaries. The
NPV discounted at 10% is TK 128.85 million and the IRR is 14.59%, indicating that the net
benefit of the restructured project with smaller scope and coverage is still positive discounted
at much higher rate than the current cost of capital. Table 11 shows the result of ex ante
economic analysis presented in the PAD and that of the ICR, ex post. Risk analysis with 25%
increase in costs would still result in positive NPV of TK 112.15 and ERR of 14.03%.
Affordability analysis after the project completion shows that the household’s water bill as %
of their income is 1 for high income group and around 0.6 for the middle income groups,
which is in the range of the ex ante estimate.

Economic Benefits of Non-Piped Rural Water Supply – Component 3

Under this component, 3,500 point sources (tubwells) provided in 407 hot spot (80% Arsenic
concentration) in 3 Upazilas of Munshiganj District benefiting more than 175,000 people with
access to safe and more reliable water. In addition, 9,659 deep tubewells were constructed in
districts affected by SIDR and AILA cyclones; together benefiting a total of 661,642 people
with access to safe water. Quantifiable gross benefits of the new piped water supply
considered for the calculation of NPV are made of an estimate of:

     (i) Health benefits to the individual and the country as a whole. That is avoided health
         costs to the individuals and to the public health system; and its ripple positive impacts
         on the social and economic life and livelihood of individuals and well being of
         general public.
     (ii) Potential time cost saving for collecting water from distant source. One of the
          significant benefits from water supply project is the time saved by bringing the source
          of water closer to households. 30 Without the project, rural population reportedly
          spent 40 minutes per day, on average, to collect water which could still be
          contaminated. Average monthly income of rural population is estimated at about Tk
          4,500 for eight hours of work/day. The economic value of cost of time saved is
          estimated using the opportunity cost of labor or the income foregone in other income
          generating activities; which is considered benefits to the households and the society.

Economic Benefits - The non-piped rural water generate significant benefits for the
beneficiaries and economy as a whole. In particular, as the cost of capital is not high and that
the O&M cost per year is low. The ERR is 61.33% when the stream of net benefits
discounted over a period 20 years (life of this scheme). Discounting net benefits of time
saved alone has an ERR of 49% and that of the health benefits alone has IRR of 12%. Table
12 below presents the ex ante economic rate of return compare to that of ICR, ex post. The
large ERR indicates that the cost of this scheme is relatively low while the derived benefits
are substantial.

Financial Rate of Return – An ex ante estimate of financial return was presented in the PAD
for rural and urban piped water schemes. The financial rate of return was calculated for net
benefits of the water sold only and the cost includes the IDA subsidy. While, comparable ex

  While, there is a high concentration of tube wells (in many instances are shallow) in rural areas, due
to high level of contamination in several of these water sources, rural population had to walk a distance
to get safe water from sources far from their home. In Coastal areas (where affected by SIDR and
AILA cyclone) concentration of tube wells are less; therefore, it takes longer to fetch water.

above, a similar approach and concept were used to calculate the financial return for the two
piped schemes for this ICR. The net benefits are those of the water sold only. The result is
presented in table 13 below.

Business Model prepared for two piped schemes presented in the PAD to assess financial
viability of the approach (with private participation) to provide water supply in urban and
rural project areas. With project restructuring, no Private Operator was involved in
Pourashavas piped water scheme and the scheme was limited to augmentation and expansion
of the existing piped system managed by the water departments in respective Pourashavas.
That is just o add new water points in the Pourashava. With respect to the rural piped water
scheme, the 21 Private Operators have prepared detailed appraisal reports (including social
and financial analysis) for their respective project area. These reports and analysis are
prepared based on some common frameworks and parameters which agreed with respective
communities and DPHE. These appraisal reports are available with the DPHE. Most of the
21 schemes are in partial operations only less than one year. Therefore, their financial books
(profit & loss accounts and income statements) cannot be fully prepared for a meaningful
financial assessment ex post.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results
A consultant firm was hired by the PMU to do a completion report, including
beneficiary and stakeholder surveys, on BWSPP just prior to its closure. The field work
included discussions with beneficiaries and other stakeholders in the rural pipe, pourashava,
and rural non-piped components. The results are presented below.
The survey results showed that the consumers served through non-piped supplies were
satisfied with the water quality, access, and location of the supplies.
The beneficiaries and other stakeholders in the rural piped scheme component had
numerous suggestions about how to improve the process, as shown in the following table.
The following table the most frequently cited problems with the process “as-is?. The quality
of the beneficiary survey could have been improved but there are some important messages to
be taken away. From the content of the views expressed it appears that the responses seem to
come predominantly from the sponsors and possibly some members of the user associations,
although focus group discussion in each community did take place.

The methodology used for surveying pourashava beneficiaries and stakeholders
produced a positive, but ambiguous, picture of the post-project situation. The survey
covered 19 put of the 24 pourashavas, but with missing data for 2 of the 19 schemes. The
survey results showed a high level of arsenic awareness (N=17), good water quality (N=12),
and a view that the water bills were reasonable (N=15). However, the methodology was
generally weak and no firm conclusions could be drawn about the views of the ultimate
beneficiaries of the project. i.e., the water consumer.

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR
The complete PMU ICR is attached at the end of these annexes. The borrower’s
unabridged comments are inserted below:
The initial target of implementing the major 300 rural piped water supply schemes at
US $ 40 million was taken having no experience in this sector - particularly in the
form of PPP in Bangladesh.

It took substantial time to motivate private sector (sponsor) to invest money in water
supply which has enough risk for cost recovery. So, there was uncertainty of cost
recovery. At the same time, the new concept of ‘rural piped water supply scheme’
through sponsor could not be well managed. The reduction of target to piloting 21
schemes and divert the grant to other two components particularly ‘urban (paurshava)
water supply’ and hand pump installation under’ non-piped water supply component’.
The improved management create momentum in the implementation of project
activities.

Anyway, the lesson learnt from the project is now providing guidance to formulate
new project to implement with better management strategies.

This is probably the achievement of BWSPP to bring new concept to implement ‘rural
piped water supply scheme’ in light of PPP and involve the community to implement
individual point source of water supply in rural context of Bangladesh.

However, few specific comments on ICR are provided below :

           ICR of Borrower's (BWSPP) [as on December 31, 2010]
Bangladesh Water Supply Program Project (BWSPP) is one of the significant project of DPHE.
The initial project cost of BWSPP was Tk. 319,82 lakh where the IDA Grant was Tk. 232,00 lakh,
GoB fund was Tk. 34,00 lakh and community Contribution was Tk. 53,82 lakh respectively [1
million=10 lakh]. The major activities as per the original DPP was as follows :
          (i) Promoting rural water supply through implementing 300 rural Piped Water supply
               Schemes with private sector participation ;
          (ii) Promoting private sector participation in water supply in selected paurashavas &
          (iii) implement arsenic mitigation options in selected arsenic affected areas.

The original DPP was approved by ECNEC on 09.01.2005 with a timeframe from July, 2004 to
June, 2009. Due to the insignificant performance of the project, the World Bank Mid-Term
Review Mission (November 5-12, 2007) recommended for restructuring of the project in respect
of scope of work, targets, conditions, funding etc. (including reducing the IDA Grant to Tk.
12804 lakh). This resulted in a revision of the DPP. The first revision of DPP was approved by
ECNEC on 22.12.2008 with an extension up to June 30, 2010) with the following component-
wise targets :
          (i) Implementation of 21 Rural Piped Water Supply Schemes ;
          (ii) implementation of scheduled works under selected 24 paurashavas &
          (iii) Implementation of water point sources in selected 3 upazilas of Munshigonj.

According to the above target, the project has implemented its activities. In response to
Government request dated August 25, 2009, the World Bank gave its concurrence to utilize
potential project savings for the installation of additional 4000 water point sources in cyclone
AILA affected areas. The subject was discussed during the World Bank’s Implementation
Review Mission of May-June 2009 and August, 2009 during which an assessment of the current
and potential project savings were made. During the August, 2009 Mission, the World Bank also
agreed to the proposal of increasing the number of water point sources in the arsenic affected 3
upazilas of Munshigonj district.
In light of the above-mentioned recommendations in Aide Memoire of the World Bank and the
instruction of Planning Commission, the 2nd revision of DPP was made which was approved by
the Government of Bangladesh on May 26, 2010. The precise monetary picture of the revised
amount under RDPP–I & RDPP–II are given below :

                Total:                         16144.00          15579.00
                [Note: Conversion Rate in Revised DPP-II is US $1 # Tk.68.58].
This is relevant to mention here that after restructuring BWSPP conditions and activities, it has
been performed its activities satisfactorily with its new management and leadership. The World
Bank has noted this positive project implementation turnaround in its last series of Aide Memoire
and they assess that BWSPP will be completed satisfactorily. The project implementation rating
was changed from ‘Moderately unsatisfactory (MU)’ to ‘Satisfactory (S)’ during these period. As



                                               49
      per Aide Meoire of the last Supervision Mission of the World Bank (August 22-September 2,
      2010) the achievement of PDO and Implementation Progress of the project stands as ‘S’
      (satisfactory).
      The World Bank noted that BWSPP has demonstrated success and significant sector advancement
      that should be scaled up. The need to analyze and record BWSPP lessons for future scale up
      project and minimize the gap between the project end and any scale up efforts was also noted. A
      request for the World Bank to continue intervention in the rural water and sanitation by scaling up
      the BWSPP component activities which is come in to light by the name of ‘Bangladesh Rural
      Water Supply and Sanitation Project (BRWSSP).

     The precise component-wise description mentioning present status are given below:

     A.        Component wise justification of revision (along with Present Status)

     Component 1: Rural Piped Water Supply (RPWS):

     As per the original DPP, engaging private sponsors targeted it to implement 300 Rural Piped
     Water Supply (RPWS) schemes. 70 Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) were signed with the
     respective sponsors. But as per the restructured modality and revised DPP, only 21 pilot ‘Rural
     Piped Water Supply (RPWS)’ schemes were targeted for completion by the project period. It is
     also relevant to mention here that the 2nd round of ‘Request for Expression of Interest’ was called
     for implementation of ‘Rural Piped Water Supply Scheme’ and total 104 sponsors were listed
     from the submitted EOIs.

     Under BWSPP, sponsors completed 33 ‘Project Proposals (Part-I)’. After acceptance of PP-I,
     sponsors submitted 18 Project Proposals (Part-II); out of which PMU accepted 15 RPWS
     schemes and signed Grant Agreements for implementation works. Out of 11 Schemes transferred
     from BAMWSP, 6 schemes have been completed under BWSPP. So, the total RPWS schemes
     stands 21.

     Achievement of RPWS component of BWSPP:
     On the basis of the delivery of safe and pure drinking water in arsenic, salinity, manganese, iron
     prone areas of the country, BWSPP completed the program to implement ‘PPP’ based piped
     water supply scheme in selected villages. It implemented the targeted schemes through the
     sponsors in close co-ordination with the community, local DPHE Officials, and Local
     Government Institutions.

     It is relevant to mention here that implementation of ‘Rural Piped Water Supply’ system through
     public private partnership is a new approach in Bangladesh. Due to this, there are many problems
     and difficulties observed to implement the scheduled schemes properly. Overcoming those
     difficulties, 21 RPWS schemes were successfully implement under BWSPP.

     All of the physical works of the following 21 RPWS schemes have been completed in the
     respective areas as mentioned below :

Most of the schemes could able to deliver the piped water supply system to its beneficiaries
within the project completion period. This is relevant to be mentioned here that due to
government embargo some ‘RPWS’ schemes could not able to get ‘electrical connection’ from
the concerned power supply authority (Rural Electrification Board) during the closure of the
project completion period. As the entire physical works of the scheme was completed, the
concerned sponsors are operating their system/delivering the piped water to the users through
hiring generator. A formal request has been sent to the concerned authority for providing electric
supply on the remaining schemes considering the greater national interest as well as project
completion period. It is observed that the line Ministry has taken the issue in positive
consideration and it is hoping that the concerned ‘schemes’ could able to get the electric
connection in soonest possible time.

This also relevant to be mentioned that the average household under a scheme was considered as
400 nos. But at the end it is observed that the average households under the implemented 21
RPWS schemes is 920. So, it can simply say that considering the numbers of household, BWSPP
could abele to serve more than two and half times higher numbers of households than that of
initial targeted numbers of households under the targeted schemes.

Every scheme consist of two PTWs, one pump house, pump and pumping machinery, pipeline
network and house connections and other relevant works. Treatment Plan/Pressure filter are part
of the scheme – where the health hazard related water quality parameter lying above the standards
that set as ‘Bangladesh Standard’. Some schemes containing OHT and some other are ground
water reservoir. Water is delivering direct pumping where OHT is not provided. Three types of
house connections are there; a) single, b) multiple and c) shared connection. There is some
provision for the hardcore poor to get pure and safe drinking water from the scheme in free of
cost.
To implement the scheme components at the field level, technical knowledge is very important
and necessary as the schemes containing civil, electrical and mechanical infrastructures. So,
BWSPP has provided two technical persons (one B.Sc. and one diploma Engineer having 3 years
experience for both of them) from the project to implement the infrastructures perfectly in the
technical point of view. PMU personnel and the local Engineers of DPHE are frequently visited
the scheme areas to supervise the construction works. BWSPP also provided two nos. of ‘Social
Mobilizer’ to mobilize local people about merits and usefulness of piped water supply system.
This assistance directly benefited the sponsors to achieve their targeted house connections and
ensure their marketing campaign. Operation & Maintenance of schemes are being performing by
the sponsors and they will do the same for 18 years. After 18-20 years the schemes will be
handover to the CBO of user group of the scheme implemented village(s).

Status of 21 Rural Piped Water Supply (RPWS) schemes at a glance (as on December,
2010) :

Component 2: Paurashava Piped Water Supply (PPWS):

As per approved RDPP, small infrastructure works and immediate priority works at 24
Paurashavas (initial targeted 5 + 19 post flood rehabilitation paurashavas) have been targeted
under this component. As per the World Bank Mission’s recommendations, some more works
(covering max. 15% of the contracted price) have been carryied out under the concerned
paurashavas.

i.       Works under Munshiganj district:
As per Revised DPP-II, provision has been kept for installation of 3500 water point sources
through hiring Support Organizations (SOs/NGOs. NGOs was hired for working in selected 3
upazilas. After receiving scheduled training, selected NGOs were completed field level activities
like community development works, forming Ward Arsenic Mitigation Water User Groups
(WAMWUGs) and prepared ‘Ward Arsenic Plan (WAP) with the help of WAMWUGs, and
Local Government Institutions (LGIs). As per World Bank’s recommendation, additional 310
water point sources/options are installed for covering more arsenic affected villages in the
selected upazilas. The water points are only deep hand tube wells; other options are PSF, SST,
VSST, Dug wells etc. are also open for the community. But through the demand driven approach
the respective communities have chosen the ‘deep tube well’ options only. The closing
implementation status of water point sources under the 3 selected upazilas of Munshigonj district

DPHE Training division and other contractual 3rd parties. As foreign exposure training the
concerned selected personnel visited South Africa, Philippine, India. Other than the above
training, BWSPP has conducted two significant workshop like below :
              o   “Orientation Course on Rural Piped Water Supply Component? was conducted
                  on August 4, 2009 at the premises of World Bank, Dhaka office (where all
                  sponsors with 1 of their scheme concerned personnel, All field level DPHE
                  Officials are the key participants) &
              o   Paurashava Piped Water Supply Component held on December 29, 2009 on the
                  same venue (where all Mayor of Representative of them from concerned 24
                  Paurashavas and concerned DPHE Officials were the key participants).

Component 5: Development of local credit market and risk management: This component
was dropped.

Component 6: Monitoring and Evaluation: Under this component, Monitoring and Evaluation
was carried out through hiring consulting firm (DPC). The M&E Report includes the PCR also.

Component 7: Project Management Unit: As per RDPP, the project is being managed by a
Project management Unit (PMU) headed by a full time Project Director, three Executive
Engineer consultants and GOB personnel.

Other key factors :
Procurement: All of the procurement under works, goods and services under the project is
completed satisfactorily.




                                              57
Disbursement: The Withdrawal submission to Chennai is made in a monthly manner (sometimes
it happens in weekly manner) for smooth financial operation of the project. The replenishment
status is supposed to be excellent.

MONITORING AND AUDITING:
(a) Installed infrastructure under Rural Piped Water Supply (component 1) : The all
concerned DPHE field level officials under 21 Rural Piped Water Supply (RPWS) schemes are
the closest vigilance for the better implementation of the schemes on behalf of Project
Management Unit (PMU) of BWSPP. The Superintending Engineers of the concerned Circle, the
Executive Engineers of the respective District, the Asst. Engineers and the Sub-Assistant
Engineers (SAE) of the respective Upazila pays their close visit in every step for construction of
the scheme. Not only this, the DPHE field level officials put their signature for certification on
bills and vouchers and forwarded it to PMU for the payment against the completed works of the
scheme. No payment has been made from PMU if there the recommendations of the DPHE field
level officials are observed. Other than this, the respective Members of the Community Based
Organization (CBO) of every RPWS scheme were also maintained a closer visit of the
construction of the schemes. The head of CBO were also put signature for certification of passing
bill from PMU in every step.
(b) Installed infrastructure support of 24 targeted paurashavas (component 2) : The Supers,
the Executive Engineers and other selected personnel of Mayor of the respective Paurashava and
the Executive Engineer of the respective District and the Asst. Engineer as well as the Sub-
Assistant Engineers (SAE) of DPHE of the respective Sadar Upazila have closely monitored the
scheduled construction works under the paurashava for ensuring quality execution of the
scheduled works.
(c) Installation of Non-Piped options : Installation of 3810 deep tube wells under 3 upazilas of
Munshigonj district and 9966 water point sources under SIDR and AILA affected upazilas of
coastal areas (component 3):
i. Non-Piped options installation under Munshigonj district: In the rural and peri-urban area,
Community Based Organization (CBO) were formed in hot spot villages (percentage of
contaminated tube wells is t 40%). They prepared the sub-projects and opened a separate Bank
Account in a Commercial Bank to deposit community’s share (10% as per modality). At the field
level, monitoring of the project fund disbursement and supervision of interventions were
performed by the local government entities. Internal monitoring and evaluation of project
activities was the responsibility of the PMU. This was made through the Engineers and Financial
experts of PMU, BWSPP.
ii. Non-Piped options installation SIDR and AILA affected upazilas : The DPHE
Superintending Engineers of the concerned Circle, the Executive Engineers of the respective
District and the Asst. Engineer as well as the Sub-Assistant Engineers (SAE) of the respective
Upazila pays close visit in every steps of construction of the scheme. Not only this, the DPHE
field level officials put their signature for certification of their bills and vouchers. Until and unless
the payment recommendation come from the concerned filed no payment has been made from
PMU.
Audit: the ‘Foreign Aided Project Audit Department (FAPAD)’ of GoB accordingly audits the
transaction of the project of every financial year.
Reporting: The monthly, quarterly Report to GoB (DPHE, LGD & IMED) and quarterly
submission of FMR to the World Bank is made in a timely manner.

Lesson learnt from the project
Bangladesh Water Supply Program Project (BWSPP) has been launched officially in June 2005.
In the midst of the project, the World Bank Mid-Term Review Mission (November 5-12, 2007)
reviewed the implementation status of the project; identified the causes of slow progress and
recommended for project restructuring in respect of Scope of Work, implementation modalities,
funding etc.

During project implementation period, following lessons have been learnt under three main
components of the project:
1) Rural Piped Water Supply Component:
    a. The approach of ‘Public Private Partnership (PPP)’ and the involvement of Sponsors in
        ‘rural water supply system’ is new in Bangladesh. Technical knowledge and financial
        capabilities of the Sponsors are to be upgraded for sustainable investment.
    b. Revising financing modality from 50% to 70% as project grant helped the participated
        mid-level Sponsors in implementing RPWS Schemes. This approach may be continued.
    c. Care should be given in selecting scheme having some characteristics such as (i) crisis
        of potable water, (ii) densely household, (iii) affluent people and growth centers.
    d. Release of grant money through simplification of ‘Grant disbursement’ modality of
        ‘Guidelines to Sponsors’ has made the scheme implementation easier.
    e. The average household under a scheme should be minimum 500 and maximum 1000
        for smooth delivery, O&M and sustainability of the scheme in the long run.
    f. The CBO and the LGI should be involved with more actively from the very beginning
        of the Feasibility study as well as scheme implementation.
    g. The duration of the scheme operation and maintenance under the sponsor should be
        within 10 years (to get back the invested fund of the sponsors earlier and to handed
        over the infrastructure of the scheme in better position to the concerned CBO). If the
        sponsors could prove its efficiency in a significant manner, the CBO can extend the
        duration for another term as desired/settle among themselves).
    h. It is observed that OHT is an essential part of the scheme to ensure better service
        delivery. This is cautiously learned that, where OHT is not provided; sometimes the
        sponsors could not able to supply water said time to the beneficiaries due to power
        failure/load shedding.
2) Paurashava Piped Water Supply Component:
Creating Paurashava Water Supply Entity and engagement of Private Operator could be able to
help the project in sustainable implementation of this component. Unfortunately the idea was
dropped in restructured modality. This innovative idea should be practiced in some new project.
Ring Fencing of Service Provision in the project coverage paurashavas : It is mentioned in
the approved RDPP that the operations and management of the service provision in the
Paurashavas will be financially ‘ring fenced’ through separate financial account. For that BWSPP
tried it best for introducing ‘ring fencing’ service in the concerned Pourashavas in order to
improve the accountability and traceability of the water supply operation. BWSPP motivated the
‘Water Supply section’ of the respective Pourashava to separate the ‘transaction, record keeping
and maintaining books of accounts’ from their other sections.
It is a fact that the Pouarshava due to inadequate revenue generation required for sustainable
operation and maintenance often subsidizes the water supply operations. Poor revenue collection
is one of the main reasons behind the lower level of development of Paurashavas. In some
extreme cases, some Paurashavas are unable to operate its revenue collection mechanism. They
have to depend largely on Government fund for their survival, which undeniably affects their



                                              59
development programme and service standard. As such, inadequacy of urban utility services
(specially on safe water supply delivery to the city dwellers) is obvious. For a safer, sound,
transparent accountable and sustainable water supply delivery system ‘ring fencing’ is a unique
role model to follow.
At the end of the project period, it is observed that the Pourashavas have dedicated their ‘Water
Supply Sections’ to keep separate accounts.
3) Non-piped Water Supply Component:
Revising the criteria for selecting the villages having max. 200 households to maximum 400
households for installation of point sources helped more arsenic affected villages to get safe water
through this project. The demand driven modalities through forming WAMWUG under this
component is well accepted by the concerned beneficiaries and this approach may be replicated in
the upcoming project.
