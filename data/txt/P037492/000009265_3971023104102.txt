SECOND PORT PROJECT - LOAN 884-SP
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT (PCR)
PREFACE
The following is a Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Spain Sec-
ond Port Project (Loan 884-SP), prepared by the Transportation II Division,
Europe, Middle East and North Africa Projects Department. The loan for US$50
million was approved by the Bank Board on March 27, 1973.
Some delays were encountered during the construction period and subs-
tantial cost overruns were experienced during implementation. The loan amount
was fully disbursed on May 20, 1980. A two-year delay in commencement of work
required postponement of the original closing date of June 30, 1978 to June
30, 1980.
This PCR is based on the findings of a Bank mission which visited
Spain in June 1982 and obtained specific data and studies from the Port Au-
thorities.  It is also based on project correspondence files and various re-
ports during times of appraisal and supervisions.
A copy of the PCR was sent to the borrower for comments. They in-
formed the Bank that they have no specific comments on the report (see
attachment).
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this PCR has been rea'a in the Operations Evaluation
Department (OED) but the project was not audited by OED staff.

SECOND PORT PROJECT - LOAN 884-SP
PROJECT COMPLET10N REPORT (PCR)
HIGHLIGHTS
During execution of the First Port Project in Spain, the Bank was ap-
proached by the Government to finance a Second Port Project.   The project
would assist the Government in implementing the 1972-75 Port Development Plan
(para. 1.02).
The project was designed to enable the ports of Huelva and La Luz y
Las Palmas to meet traffic demands up to 1980 by expanding their facilities,
to assist nine other major ports to meet expected increase in traffic and to
reinforce and consolidate organizational and institutional reforms initiated
under the First Port Project (para. 2.16).
The project from the outset ran into difficulties which resulted in a
five-year delay (end 1977 to end 1982) in its completion, considerable cost
overruns (about 35%) and major changes in its contents.  The two-year delay in
commencement of work (due to inadequate designs and slow provision of Govern-
ment funds) was the primary cause of initial cost increase.   Basic problems
underlying the project were not fully detected until late 1977, as all revised
cost figures prior to this date proved to be optimistic (paras. 3.01 to
3.04).  Other important causes of cost overruns were currency devaluations.
The general inflation, both in the country and in the rest of the world, was
also an important factor in bringing about serious cost overruns in the proj-
ect (para. 3.30).
In addition to the delays in project implementation, cost overruns,
financing problems and the significant modifications in the project scope, the
shortfalls in forecast traffic (about 50% on volume of cargo handled) con-
tributed negatively to achieve an adequate operating performance and to real-
ize the overall financial and economic objectives of the project. Unfavorable
developments in the general economic conditions after the emergence of the
energy crunch are to be blamed for the failure to realize forecast traffic
volumes at project ports (paras. 4.01 to 4.04).  The project, however, subs-
tantially contributed toward modernization of port facilities at the project
ports and has led to improvements in cargo handling in the other nine major
ports (para. 4.06).
The financial performance of the ports did not come up to expec-
tations.  Eventhough port authorities are aware of the significance of cost
recovery aspect of tariff setting, they are faced with the problems of under
utilization of capacity because of economic circumstances beyond their control
as well as market forces which determine the points to which traffic gravi-
tates (para. 5.04).



(vii)
On the institutional development issues the following achievements
are noteworthy. Modern commercial accounting and costing systems are now ap-
plied in most of the major ports.  Steady progress was achieved towards es-
tablishment of cost-related tariff structure. The Government is aware of the
applicability of the ?rinciples of port autonomy and is in the process of
granting autonomy to more ports (paras 6.01 to 6.07).  Partial successes were
achieved in strengthening the organizational structure of the Government in
transport secLor and in bringing about a coordinated approach to investment
and pricing policies (para. 6.08).
The delays encountered in the implementation of the project, cost
overruns and shortfalls in traffic significantly contributed towards both
reducing and delaying the estimated benefits, and therefore the economic rates
of return (ER) of two of the three main project components. The ER for Huelva
port is 7% against 16% at appraisal; however, the impact that the project thus
far had on the development and industrialization of the region has exceeded
the expectations at the time of appraisal but cannot be quantified because
lack of data (paras. 7.10 - 7.11). The ER for La Luz y Las Palmas port is 17%
against 31% at appraisal (para. 7.17), and for the third major project com-
ponent, equipment for nine major ports - the ER is estimated at 26% against
18% at appraisal (para. 7.20).
The Bank played a positive role in maintaining a continuous dialogue
with the Government and bringing the project to a successful conclusion. This
project helped to continue and solidify many of the institutional, managerial
and organizational reforms initiated under the First Port Project.  Overall
the Bank played a useful, constructive and important role in the successful
completion of this project (paras. 8.01 to 8.03).

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT (PCR)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01     The Bank's involvement in the improvement and expansion of Spanish
ports began in 1965 under the First Port Project with a US$40 million loan
(429-SP) to the Government to assist in implementing the 1964-67 Port Develop-
ment Plan by financing expansion in the ports of Barcelona, Huelva, Pasajes
and La Luz y Las Palmas, and acquisition of cargo handling and floating equip-
ment for general use in Spanish ports.  The loan agreement included several
covenants requiring the Government to enact legislation for the autonomy of
ports, a port Finances Law and the establishment of adequate accounting and
costing systems as well as annual auditing of accounts by independent audi-
tors. Completion of the project scheduled at appraisal by December 31, 1968
experienced a 38-month delay principally on account of contracting and pro-
curement procedures.  The loan closing date was extended from September 30,
1969 to March 31, 1972.  In general, all project components were adequately
completed, and the loan, with the exception of US$30,000 was fully disbursed
by the extended closing date.
1.02     During execution of the First Port Project the Bank was approached by
the Government to finance a Second Port Project.  The project was to assist
the Government in implementing the 1972-75 Port Development Plan.  In order to
meet future traffic demands, it included further expansion of port facilities
at Huelva and La Luz y Las Palmas, and acquisition of quay cranes for general
use in nine other major ports. One of its important tasks was to achieve, re-
inforce and consolidate all organizational and institutional reforms outlined
or started under the First Port Project. The Second Port Project, Loan 884-SP
of US$50 million was approved by the Bank Board on March 27, 1973.
1.03     This PCR:  (a) describes  the identification,  preparation,  appraisal
and implementation stages of the project; (b) analyzes problems encountered
during implementation; (c) re-examines the outcome of objectives scheduled at
appraisal; and (d) draws out conclusions and lessons for future port pro-
jects. A brief description of the transport sector, and project content and
scope, follows below.
1.04     Spain with an area of 505,000 sq. km. and a population of about 38.0
million (1981) has a fairly well developed  transport system in which road
transport has a major role.   The total road network is about 80,000 km.,
consisting  primarily  of  local  roads  (60,000  km.).   The  railway  network
comprises about 13,700 km. of which about 3,100 km. are electrified and 2,000
km. have double track. Spain has 30 major commercial ports which handle al-
most all of Spain's imports and 90 percent of its exports, and about 200 minor
commercial and fishing ports.  Coastal shipping plays an important role in
Spain's transport system, accounting for about 30 percent of the internal and
inter-island (Canaries and Baleares) freight movement.  The National Airline



Iberia serves some major international routes and provides regular air con-
nections bezween major Spanish cities in the mainland and in the islands.
During the past two decades the transport sector has received a considerable
portion, about 25 percent, of public investment funds.
1.05     Until mid-1977 the responsibility for planning, managing and adminis-
tering transport was dispersed among a number of Government agencies. The ab-
sence of a Ministry of Transport had impeded the adoption of a coordinated ap-
proach  to transport  investment and pricing.   The Ministry of Public Works
(MPW) was responsible for all investment in the state road network and com-
mercial  ports.   Also MPW was  responsible  for administration  ot commercial
ports.  Coastal ard merchant shipping were and are controlled by the Ministry
of Commerce.  The Spanish National Railways  (RENFE) has been an autonomous
public corporation since 1964, although there is still a large degree of
Government control over its pricing and investment policies.  The Ministry of
Air Transport is responsible for infrastructure investments and operations for
both civil and military aviation, but the National Airline Iberia has an auto-
nomous status somewhat similar to RENFE.
1.06     In 1964 the Government established,  following Bank recommendations,
the Superior Council of Land Transport (Lonsejo Superior de Transportes Ter-
restres, CSTT) to achieve a better coordination of land transport modes.  It
was an advisory body within the MPW. Although its terms of reference provided
for wide authority to advise the Government on transport pricing and invest-
ment policies, CSTT remained somewhat ineffective in influencing the national
transport  policies.   The  Bank's  efforts  to broaden the  functions  of CSTT
resulted in a firm commitment from the Government that adequate funds would be
made available to CSTT in the future.  These efforts led to the establishment
of a new ministry in August 1977, the Ministry of Transportation and Communi-
cation, responsible for coordinating investment and pricing policies for all
transport modes except ports which remained under the MPW which since then
became Ministry of Public Works and Urbanization (MPWU).
1.07     Administration of ports is under the Directorate General of Ports and
Coasts (Direcci6n General de Puertos y Costas - DGPC) formerly the Directorate
General of Ports and Marine Signals (Direcci6n General de Puertos y Selales
Marftimas - DGPMS), and is a department of the MPWU.  DGPC has jurisdiction
over all major ports, except those of Huelva, Barcelona, Bilbao and Valencia.
It exercises authority at each port through a port director who is the chief
executive of a local "Junta de Obras y Servicios del Puerto, JOSP".  Although
JOSP has considerable political influence, financial control, and power to
initiate projects, in practice DGPC regulates port planning through its
provision of funds aeeded for major investments.
1.08     The Second Port Project, Loan 884-SP,  consisted of three separate
components: (a) at Huelva port, construction of 900 m. berth and acquisition
of eight cranes and a belt conveyor system for general cargo and minerals,
construction of a 13 km. long dike for protection of the entrance channel
against siltation, acquisition of a dredger to deepen the channel from 8.0 m
to 10.5 m below Mean Low Water Spring Tides Level (MLWST), and improvement of
land accesses to the new port facilities; (b) at La Luz y Las Palmas port,



construction of a deep water basin and two petroleum piers for supertankers,
and acquisition of a container crane; and (c) at other nine major ports, ac-
quisition of 58 new quay cranes to replace old inefficient ones. The project
also included other works at Huelva and La Luz y Las Palmas ports to be fi-
nanced totally by the Government.   Total project cost amounted to US$96.9
million with an estimated foreign exchange component of US$53 million, of
which US$50 million  financed by the Loan.  The Loan Agreement  (L.A.) was
signed on March 27, 1973 and became effective on August 13, 1973.
1.09     This PCR is based on: (a) feasibility studies and preappraisal re-
ports; (b) the appraisal report; (c) The L. A. and supplementary letters; (d)
Bank supervision reports; (e) progress reports provided by DGPC; (f) official
project correspondence files; and (g) miscellaneous evaluation reports; and
(h) specific data and studies provided by DGPC and the Port Authorities of
Huelva and La Luz y Las Palmas in June 1982.
II- PROJECT IDENTIFICATION, PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
Physical Improvements
2.01     The project originated from the 1972-75 Port Investment Plan which
included total investment of about Pta. 20,000 million. More than 50 percent
of the total investment was allocated to improvements in the ports of Bilbao,
Huelva and La Luz y Las Palmas. The improvements were designed to meet the
growing traffic volumes resulting from the large economic growth experienced
in the 1960s and anticipated in the 1970s. However, the port of Bilbao was ex-
cluded from the project because the investment funds needed were secured from
its own resources and the oil company using the port facilities. Government
undertook to finance other components of the Port Investment Plan.
2.02     Project content was modified between the first Government request in
June 1971 and negotiations from December 1972 to January 1973.  In June 1971
DGPSM proposed the following project composition:
(a) Huelva port: construction of an industrial and general cargo berth
700 m. long; construction of a dike to reduce siltation of the en-
trance channel; acquisition of a suction hopper dredger of 3,000 m3
capacity; increasing the channel depth from 8 to 10.5 m below MLWS
and construction of land access to new facilities;
(b)  La Luz y Las Palmas port:  extension of the main breakwater to create
a new basin for general cargo, ship supply, bunkering and ship re-
pairing; construction of a berth 500 m long for ship supply and bun-
kering; and miscellaneous works to establish specialized cargo and
passenger zones; and
(c) other ports: acquisition of dredgers for general use and replacement
of old inefficient ones: four suction hopper dredgers (two 1,500 m3
and two 1,000 m3 capacity) and three self-propelled grab dredgers
with hopper 200 m3 capacity.



- 4 -
2.03     The above proposal was based on a cost-benefit study by consultants.
The Bank reviewed the study and concluded that it did not provide an adequate
economic analysis.  It drafted Terms of Reference for a modified study.  The
Bank also requested at Huelva port a review of road and railway access de-
signs, and advised to speed up the dike-reduced model study by the National
Hydraulic Laboratory of Lisbon (NHLL). At La Luz y Las Palmas port, the Bank
recommended an improved alignment for the off-shore end of the main breakwater
to minimize wave action in the new basin.
2.04     During preappraisal mission in December 1971 DGPSM proposed to add
the following items to the project:
(a) La Luz y Las Palmas port: construction of a secondary breakwater and
two mooring stations adjacent to the main breakwater for super-
tankers; and
(b) other ports; acquisition of 98 quay cranes of various capacities for
general use in replacement of old inefficient ones.
Justification of these items was included in the modified study mentioned
above (para. 2.03). The mission told DGPSM that appraisal could take place in
May 1972 if some inconsistencies found in the study were first corrected.
2.05     The appraisal mission took place end May 1972 and found satisfactory
all relevant studies and data provided. It recommended the following project
composition:
(a) expansion of port facilities in Huelva by constructing a general car-
go and industrial berth, constructing a dike to prevent siltation in
the channel and deepening it from 8.0 m to 10.5 m below MLWS;
(b) expansion of port facilities in La Luz y Las Palmas by creating a new
basin for container, bunkering and oil traffic; and two petroleum
supertankers piers;
(c) replacement of old inefficient cranes at various ports; and
(d) procurement of dredgers for general usage.
2.06     On the basis of the modified economic study and the appraisal mis-
sion, the project was justified.  The estimated total project cost was Pta.
7,190 million (US$lll million equivalent) with a foreign component of Pta
4,350 million (USW68 million equivalent). The foreign component, however, was
US$28 million greater than the amount allocated in the Bank's Five-Year Lend-
ing Program. The Bank's was requested to decide whether the US$4O million al-
located could be increased to US068 million, it being stated at the same time
that the project components were not inter-dependent. DGPSM and Bank agreed



on the priority of works at Huelva and La Luz y Las Palmas ports over pro-
curement of cranes and dredgers, if the loan amount could not be increased to
US$68 million.
2.07     An appraisal follow-up mission visited Spain in August 1972 and told
the Government that financing for all cranes and dredgers could not be provi-
ded.  DGPSM, however,  insisted on the importance of this financing.  During
loan negotiations in Madrid December 12-15, 1972, completed by correspondence
in January 1973, the Bank agreed to finance partially this equipment and the
final composition of the project was defined and accepted (para 2.18).  The
total cost of the project (para 2.18) amounted to Pta. 6,256.4 million
(US$96.9 million equivalent) of which Pta. 3,424.8 million (US$53 million
equivalent) would be in foreign exchange. The Bank agreed to finance US$50
million of the foreign component, the other US$3 million and the entire local
component was to be financed by the Government. The US$50 million loan was
approved by the Board on March 27, 1973, and on the same day both parties
signed the L.A.
Institutional Improvements
2.08     The First Port Project had initiated several institutional improve-
ments  for the DGPMS and the port authorities.   During its implementation,
however, it became evident that they would still need further assistance. The
need of improvement of economic and financial expertise was re-emphasized
during pre-appraisal, appraisal, and negotiations of the Second Loan. Reforms
and measures to improve budgetary procedures initiated under the First Port
Project were included among specific objectives sought from the project and
received positive response from the Government. As noted later, inclusion of
these institutional objectives in the project helped to achieve full benefits
of the attempts made under the First Port Project.
2.09     The Bank's request for establishment of a well qualified and ade-
quately staffed Planning Unit within DGPSM was not accepted by the Government
on the grounds that it would contribute toward increasing administrative
costs. The Bank was informed in December 1971 that the long-range planning
efforts of the DGPSM would be best carried out through engagement of consul-
tants, and it agreed.
2.10     In May 1972, several changes were made to the organizational struc-
ture of DGPSM. The creation, following the Bank's advice, of a division res-
ponsi'ble for project evaluation was the most important.   The division was
staffed with qualified personnel and was already operating adequately at the
time of the loan approval in March 1973.
2.11     The Bank had strongly recommended that financial accounts for each
port be entrusted to a permanent and qualified staff rather than using consul-
tants on short-term contracts. The issue of the use of independent commercial
auditors was reviewed once again during appraisal. Although this was specifi-
cally included in the First Port Loan Agreement, no such appointment had been
made to date. The mission recommended appointment of an independent auditor
for Huelva as a condition for negotiations of the loan.  It also recommended



-6-
that the Government should strengthen its Audit Council staff so that it could
undertake effective auditing of all other project items under First Port
Loan.   During negotiations,  it was agreed (L.A., Section 4.02b),  that the
Government would employ independent auditors to audit the accounts of Huelva,
La Luz y Las Palmas, Barcelona and Pasajes ports.
2.12     Port  pricing policies and tariff revisions were  discussed during
project preparation and appraisal as a follow-up on the earlier dialogue es-
tablished  for the First Port  Project.   The appraisal mission  recommended
revision of tariffs at Huelva, La Luz y Las Palmas, Barcelona and Pasajes
ports and early introduction of cost-based tariffs.  Its concern over tariff
reviews stemmed partially from the need for generating adequate funds for the
implementation  of the project  (para.  2.13).   During  negotiations,  it was
agreed that in order to achieve adequate rates of return at Huelva, La Luz y
Las Palmas, Barcelona and Pasajes ports, tariffs would be revised on a cost
basis not later than January 1, 1977 (L.A., Section 4.06).
2.13     The financial plan of the project was reviewed by the appraisal mis-
sion in relation to the port tariff revisions.  The mission estimated that,
given the traffic projections and the proposed tariff revisions, the ports
would generate adequate revenues to finance about 22% of investment costs at
Huelva and about 31% at La Luz y Las Palmas.  The Government undertook to
provide, by direct grants, 28% of the total costs at the former and 41% at the
latter port. The loan was to finance the remainder.
Traffic Projections and Economic Analysis
2.14     At preparation and appraisal stages, the mission encountered various
problems which were later satisfactorily resolved.  The Government accepted
the Bank's requests for adequate traffic information and economic studies.
The economic studies were carried out by consultants under the terms of refer-
ence suggested by the Bank.  Consultants' studies, after two revisions, were
found adequate at appraisal time when no particular issue related to the eco-
nomic analysis of the project was raised. The Bank also agreed on the ade-
quacy of traffic forecasts.
Ecological Studies
2.15     The proposed port expansions in Huelva and La Luz y Las Palmas were
not expected to have adverse ecological effect on the areas involved.  How-
ever, the Bank recommended to the Government that it employ a competent local
authority to investigate the matter more thoroughly. During negotiations, it
was agreed (L.A., Sections 3.01b and 3.06) that the Borrower, not later than
January 1, 1974 or such other date as the Borrower and the Bank should agree,
would carry out both ecological studies and should, after consultation with
the  Bank,  implement  all  reasonable  recommendations  of  such  studies.

Project Objectives and Location
2.16     The project was designed (a) to enable the ports of Huelva and La Luz
y Las Palmas (Project Ports) to meet traffic demands up to 1980 by expanding
their facilities; (b) to assist nine other major ports i.e. Algeciras, Bilbao,
Cartagena, Gij6n, Malaga, Palma de Mallorca, Sevilla, Tarragona and Valencia
(Part B Ports) to meet expected increases in traffic and (c) to reinforce and
consolidate organizational and institutional reforms initiated under the First
Port Project.  Inclusion of Project Ports was also influenced by the facts
that both ports are located in two of the least developed areas of the country
and in the case of Huelva by the need of serving the existing Industrial
Development Zone (Polo de Desarrollo).
2.17     The ProjecL Ports are located: (a) Huelva on the Odiel River in the
south-west of Spain about 15 km from the Atlantic Ocean and (b) La Luz y Las
Palmas on Las Palmas Bay in the Island of Gran Canaria in the center of the
Canary Islands Archipelago.   The Part B Ports are located:  (a) Gij6n and
Bilbao on the Cantabric Sea of the Atlantic Ocean in the north of Spain; (b)
Algeciras, Malaga, Cartagena, Valencia, Palma de Mallorca (Balearic Islands)
and Tarragona from the extreme south to the north of the Mediterranean Coast
of Spain; and (c) Sevilla, the only major inland port of Spain, on the Gua-
dalquivir River in the south of Spain about 90 km from the Atlantic Ocean (Map
10057 PCR).

Land needed in the Project Ports was already owned by these ports.
2.20     In addition to the financing scheme for foreign cost as shown at the
bottom of the above table, the Government agreed to the usual standard clause
3.01 in the L.A., that "it shall provide, promptly as needed,  the funds,
facilities, services and other resources required for the diligent and effi-
cient execution of the project." The Government would be unable to live up to
this covenant because delay in the delivery of funds, aggravated by the de-
teriorating economy of the country after the loan was signed.

NOTE: Project consultants services (naval architect for the dredger) were

III. IMPLEMENTATION
General
3.01     The project from the outset ran into difficulties which resulted in
serious delays in its completion, considerable cost overruns and major changes
in its contents.   Projected traffic volumes at the Project Ports were not
achieved, both in terms of total quantities as well as in composition.  These
developments contributed to lowering the economic rate of return (ER) and
impeded full achievement of financial targets. The institutional improvements
envisaged under the project were, on the whole, successful.
3.02     The loan became effective on August 13, 1973 with a two-month delay
due to administrative difficulties. The serious delays both in commencement
of works (two years) and completion (five years) were mainly due to a) inade-
quacy of design work for the service road for port of Huelva; b) prolonged
discussions and indecision regarding procurement of a dredger for port of
Huelva; and c) delays in provision of Government funds for the project.
3.03     The two-year delay in commencement of work was the primary cause of a
Pta. 1,429 million or 23 percent initial cost increase. Already at this stage



- 1.1 -
in June 1975, DGPMS and the Bank started considering alternatives to the
problem of cost increases. The Bank suggested revisions in the project scope,
provided that the ER would not make the project unjustified.
3.04     Escalation of costs continued and by early 1977 the estimate'i cost
was 8,972 million or 44 percent higher than at appraisal. Cost overruns, and
important technical considerations (see below) led DGPMS to modify the scope
of the project in early 1977.  The Bank after review and discussions with
DGPMS, accepted these modifications on April 28, 1978.  The Bank also agreed
to extend the initial loan closing date of June 30, 1978 (L.A., Section 2.04)
to June 30, 1980 and to delete the following project components:  (a) belt
conveyor facilities for phosphates in Huelva (Item lc, Part A, Schedule 2 of
L.A.) because the main importer, Fosf6rico Espajol Company had enlarged facil-
ities; (b) dredger for Huelva port (Item ld, Part A, Schedule 2 of L.A.) due
to cost increase from US$5.5 million to US$12.0 million and the necessity of
postponing dredging of the channel until dike completion; (c) one petroleum
pier in the port of La Luz y Las Palmas (Item 2b, Part A, Schedule 2 of L.A.)
because of the decline in petroleum traffic; and (d) container crane for the
port of La Luz y Las Palmas (Item 2c, Part A, Schedule 2 of L.A.) as existing
equipment was sufficient for existing traffic and concessionaires had agreed
to acquire future additional equipment, if required. These are all changes
made in the closing date and project composition.  In the following sections,
we try to delineate causes and problems of project implementation.
Implementation of Civil Works,
At Huelva (Map 10058 PCR)
3.05     Implementation  of civil works experienced major problems.  Delays
between appraisal and actual completion  dates were  considerable, as  shown
below:
(a)   dike  construction  completion was extended  from  September  1977  to
April 1981;
(b)   dredging from the end of 1977 to the end of 1982;
(c)   five deep-water berths from mid-1977 to early 1980; and
(d)   access road and road and railway connections from September 1975 to
early 1979.
Dike
3.06     Initial delays  in  this  major  component  resulted  from  inadequate
design preparation. Completion of designs scheduled for July 1973 wae delayed
for about a year and subsequently bidding documents could not be finalized
until August 1974. Tendering process was completed by mid-1975 instead of by
late 1974, as scheduled. The contract for dike construction was awarded and
signed by end May 1975.  Works commenced on July 1, 1975.  Therefore, com-
mencement of dike work was delayed from the end of 1973 to mid-1975 due to
time lost in completing design work and tender documents.
3.07     Construction, which had to start necessarily by  the dike  service
road, progressed satisfactorily at the beginning.  By April 1976 two of the



- 12 -
three bridges were completed and quarry preparation for the dike itself was
ready.  However, soon after starting construction of the third bridge, the
Burro bridge, soil slippages occurred in the southern approach and construc-
tion works were halted. Soil tests led to replacement of the unsuitable soil
with sand. This problem could have been avoided if a more thorough geological
survey  and soil mechanics had been undertaken earlier.  Although  the dike
service road is a complementary work for the construction of the dike, it is
an expensive and important part of the civil works. The bridge was completed
in May 1977.
3.08     Work on dike itself started in July 1977.  The supervision mission of
November 1977 verified that works had progressed considerably in the first 3
km and estimated dike completion by July  1979.  The mission also verified
that, contrary to what is stipulated in Section 4.11 of the L.A., the main
bridge .eading to the dike, the Burro draw bridge, had been built with 17 m
clearance above MLWST instead of a maximum of 5 m. This deviation from the
L.A. requirement resulted in an expensive bridge of Pta. 150 million (US$2.3
million  equivalent).  The Port Authority had decided to change the design
characteristics because the Burro channel is used by most of the fishing fleet
of Punta Umbria, numerous passenger boats connecting Huelva with Punta IJmbria,
sailing vessels of a nearby club and because of specific instructions from the
Navy Authority. The Bank became aware of this breach of the L.A. as a "fait
accompli." No previous supervision reports mention any problem regarding the
design of this bridge, although the port of Huelva maintains that the new
designs were sent to the Bank.
3.09     Construction of the dike experienced financial problems with payments
delays due to scarcity of local funds, and technical problems. Works were
virtually suspended during the 1978-79 winter months, when the construction
was severely damaged by storms, particularly, during a maximum 50-year storm
which hit the port in February 1979. This resulted in a loss of time of about
a year. The dike was completed in April 1981. The quality of works is good.
Dredging
3.10     Deepening of entrance channel from 8 m to 10.5 m below MLWST was
originally scheduled to be carried out by the Government using the new dredger
to be procured under the project.  Economic analysis of the dredger assumed
completion of dredging by the end of 1977, with benefits arising from the use
of larger ships by that date.  However,  due to delays on selecting consul-
tants, designs could not be ready before March 1976 and dredger delivery could
not be expected before the end of 1977. By mid-1975, DGPMS proposed two al-
ternatives to complete the channel deepening on time:
(a)   to use existing dumb dredger MOP-Dl 24 hours a day starting early
1976 after construction of the dike had progressed sufficiently, and
either to accelerate the delivery of new dredger so as to be able to
use it to complete the seaward section during the last five months of
1977, or to allocate an additional suitable dredger to assist the
MOP-DI dredger after mid-1977; or
(b)   to contract the whole work.



- 13 -
The Bank, based on its own cost/benefit analysis, considered that acquisition
of a new dredger was the most favorable alternative.
3.11     In March 1976 DGPMS informed the Bank supervision mission of its
intention to cancel acquisition of the dredger although its designs had been
recently completed, and to execute the dredging through a contractor.  Fur-
thermore, it emphasized Lhat dredging by contractor could be completed by
September 1978, simultaneously with the dike; whereas, dredging by using the
new dredger could not be completed before December 1979. The mission based on
its own economic analysis still considered acquisition of a new dredger as the
least cost solution and advised DGPMS accordingly.
3.12     In February-March 1977, DGPMS decided to eliminate acquisition of the
dredger from the project and to execute dredging by contractor, because (a)
the estimated cost of the dredger was about US$12 million, compared with ap-
praisal estimate of US$5.5 million; (b) dredging channel by contractor would
cost about US$9 million, considerably less than the cost of a new dredger,
resulting in a short-term saving in capital investment; and (c) dredging by
contractor could be completed by the end of 1979, whereas acquisition of a new
dredger would delay completion to the end of  1982.   DGPMS  initiated new
studies  for geological  surveys,  dredging  plans,  bill  of quantities,  cost
estimates and bidding documents. The Bank finally approved DGPMS's request by
letter of April 28, 1978.
3.13     Start of dredging work was further delayed due to technical and ad-
ministrative problems. The former problems arose out of disagreement between
the Bank and Government on the appropriate width for the channel. The Govern-
ment proposed a 300 m channel, however, the Bank expressed the view that the
width proposed was not justified and that 200 m was all that was required. A
decision was reached to study this matter in detail and finally a 200 m width
was agreed upon.  It is clear that such a basic parameter regarding an im-
portant component of the project should have been studied and determined
during the preparation stage. Administrative problems arose out of budgetary
procedures  involved  in providing Government  funds.   Preparation  of  tender
documents, in addition, was slow.  In April 1979 it was estimated that prepa-
ration for the start of work would be completed by the end of 1979 and that
works would take between 2 1/2 to 3 years.  Opening of bids, scheduled for
January 1980 took place in April 1980.  Contract for Pta. 793.5 million (US*
11.2 million equivalent) was awarded in June 1980. Dredging works have been
satisfactorily completed in December 1982.
Deep-Water Berths
3.14     Implementation fell behind schedule since the beginning.  Evaluation
of bids and award of contract were originally scheduled by mid-1973 but ten-
ders were received in the Bank for evaluation review and approval on June 18,
1974. Bank cabled approval of contract award on August 21, 1974. As in other
major components, it appears that inadequate time was allowed for preparation
of bidding documents.   Construction  started on December  16,  1974 after a



- 14 -
15-month delay and when, based on recommendations of the NHLL, a new alignment
and berth protection against erosion produced by hydraulic conditions in the
Odiel River had been approved by the Port Director. The original design was
modified in accordance with the recommendations.  The modification resulted in
a new cost estimate of Pta. 1,450 million (US$26 million equivalent) against
Pta. 980 million (US$15.2 million equivalent) at appraisal, that is, a 71 per-
cent increase. Preparation and cost estimates, again were not adequate.
3.15     By early 1976, construction of berths had progressed satisfactorily.
Protection of berths against erosion had been built and about 50 percent of
the concrete piles had been driven.  Completion scheduled in June 1977 seemed
realistic. By the end of 1976, however, and due to problems during construc-
tion (displacement of heads of piles after backfilling) the construction
method had to be modified and the berth structure had to be anchored to a re-
inforced concrete beam embedded in the filling.  Variation in subsoil con-
ditions detected during the driving of piles required additional subsoil in-
vestigation. As a result, the completion date was revised to July 1978.
3.16     Construction of berths proceeded without major problems.  However, in
July 1978 the Bank drew the attention of the Port Authority to a careful re-
view of the layout of the back-up areas.  The Bank argued that the location of
proposed grain silos and of transit sheds, both included in the project, would
not guarantee an efficient operation and therefore should be re-examined.
This decision, that should have been taken at design stage, was delayed until
completion of berth construction.  Construction of berths was satisfactorily
completed by the end of 1978, but the quays could not become operational be-
cause silos, sheds, and port ancillary buildings not included in the project,
such as workshops, customs' offices and workers' canteen and toilets were not
completed. The back-up facilities were completed in early 1980 and the berths
became operational in February 1980.
Access Road and Road and Railway Connections
3.17     Construction of this component encountered similar problems as those
discussed above: inadequate preparation prior to appraisal and administrative
difficulties in providing local funds on time. Original scheduling called for
completion of access road (Carretera de Punta del Sebo) and road and rail con-
nections by the third quarter of 1975. Bidding documents for access road were
prepared on time in October 1973 but only after slow discussion with local
authorities, were submitted to the Bank on June 18, 1974. The Bank cabled its
approval in August 21, 1974.  Construction started in December 1974, with a
12-month delay.  During construction drainage problems occurred in the sub-
base along the swampy areas and failures in the wearing course. Designs had
to be corrected and a 23 cm thick cement concrete wearing course was decided.
New designs involved a cost increase of Pta. 76 million (US¢1.3 million equiv-
alent) or 91 percent over the original contract award of Pta. 83.4 million
(US$1.5 million equivalent), but construction was satisfactorily completed
without further delay by June  1978.  Bidding documents  for road and rail



- 15 -
connections were not sent to the Bank till June 1975 because DGPMS decided to
substitute existing railway line for a double track also parallel to the coast
but 200 m more to the interior, in order to free an adequate area for comple-
mentary port installations.  Bid opening took place in May 6, 1976 with a 2
1/2-year delay over the original schedule.  After the Bank's approval of the
contract award by the end of May 1975, works started in June 1974. Works were
satisfactorily completed in early 1979.
3.18     The project also included at the port of Huelva completion of a min-
eral berth and its mechanical equipment (para. 2.18, Part C).  This item,
valued at Pta. 270 million (US$4.2 million equivalent) was to be financed en-
tirely by the Government.  Completion was originally scheduled by the end of
1973.   Works, which were never halted, proceeded at a relatively slow pace
and were completed, with a year's delay, by October 1974. The quality of work
and equipment is good. By early 1975, the mineral berth and its mechanical
handling equipment were in full operation.
At La Luz y Las Palmas (Map 10059 PCR)
3.19     Two important civil works items were to be financed under the loan at
La Luz y Las Palmas (para. 2.18, Part A). The original implementation sched-
ule for the first item, an extension of the main breakwater by about 680 m and
construction of two secondary breakwaters, each about 780 m long, envisaged a
tendering process period from April to September 1973, start of construction
in October 1973, and completion by mid-1977. For the other item, construction
of two petroleum piers for supertankers, tendering period was scheduled for
April to September i976, start of construction in October 1976, and completion
by the third quarter of 1977.
3.20     Late in 1973, DGPMS and Port Authority decided to invite bids simul-
taneously for the breakwaters and the two petroleum piers, based on the large
increase of petroleum traffic during previous years and with the Bank's agree-
ment. This decision implied a nine-month delay for the breakwaters but more
than a two-year advance for the petroleum piers. Tenders were received in the
Bank for review and approval of award on June 18, 1974. The Bank cabled ap-
proval on August 23, 1974. A single contract for both civil works - break-
iwaters and piers - was signed in January 27, 1975. Works started on July 1,
1975 with a contractual period of 30 months, that is to be completed by Decem-
ber 31, 1977.  Supervision of construction, at the beginning was unsatisfac-
tory due to shortage of staff at the port entity.  The Bank discussed this
matter with DGPMS and Port Director, and an adequate supervision team was
provided about a year later.  The works, however, progressed satisfactorily
during this first year due to the high competence and capacity of the contrac-
tor. Late in 1976 works were progressing satisfactorily and were expected to
be completed ahead of schedule.
3.21     Early in 1977, the Port Authority proposed to reduce the length of
the inner secondary breakwater by about 50 m and to build instead a rock pro-
tection along the eastward side of the Generalisimo dike, on the grounds that
the change would reduce wave reflection on that dike and would therefore



- 16 -
improve the protection of the outer basin.  The Bank agreed after discussing
this matter with the Port Authority and the consultants responsible for the
design of the breakwater.  On the other hand, as bunkering had continued to
decline in 1976 (1.2 million ton in 1976 against 1.4 million ton in 1975),
DGPMS and Port Authority decided to eliminate one of the two petroleum piers
originally included in the project as well as to change slightly the location
of the other within the port. This change was not approved by the Bank until
April 28, 1978 (para. 3.04).
3.22     By mid-1977, the main breakwater had been completed.  The two second-
ary breakwaters and the petroleum pier were progressing satisfactorily and ex-
pected to be completed by March 1978 and the end of 1977 respectively.  How-
ever, due to shortage of Government funds the final phase slowed down and an
extension of one year, until March 1979, had to be granted to the contractor.
Shortage of funds, as reported in Huelva, was the subject of a Bank's letter
addressed to the Minister of Finance and discussions in Madrid in June 1978
with the Deputy Director General for External Funds. Till then, the Ministry
of Finance was pooling foreign funds but did not hold them against specific
projects. Since then, at least for the Project Ports, funds were allocated on
priority basis.  In March 1979, works were satisfactorily completed.  Its im-
plementation had faced problems which were less severe than in the case of
Huelva, leading to shorter delays.
3.23     The project included other works to be entirely financed by the Gov-
ernment (para. 2.18, Part C). A container wharf 500 m long and a general car-
go wharf 300 m long with ancillary facilities already under execution at the
time of loan approval, were satisfactorily completed by early 1975.  Cons-
truction of a bunkering pipeline duct, paving at the new basin, at secondary
breakwater and at the container berth, and works for the provision of water
and electricity supply started in early 1974 and were scheduled for completion
by end-1976. Two transit sheds were scheduled to be built in late 1976. How-
ever, due to continuous budget restrictions since 1975, the construction
slowed down or had to be halted in the case of the bunkering pipeline and the
two transit sheds at the external basin.  Since early 1979 all works resumed
appropriately and were finally completed in April 1980.
Procurement of Cargo-Handling Equipment
3.24     The project included procurement of important equipment items to be
financed under the loan.  At Huelva, eight new quay cranes,  belt conveyor
facilities for phosphates and a suction hopper dredger for deepening the chan-
nel (para. 2.18, Part A); at La Luz y Las Palmas a container crane (para.
2.18, Part A); and in nine other major ports fifty eight new quay cranes to
replace old ones (para. 2.18, Part B).
3.25     Procurement of equipment encountered several problems which have been
mentioned before (para. 3.04). All project reductions but the petroleum pier
at La Luz y Las Palmas referred to equipment.  Soon after the project started
in early 1975, considerable project cost increases and important changes in
the scope of the project, mainly due to lower traffic than predicted at



- 17 -
appraisal and uncertainty of traffic forecasts, led DGPMS to decide on a con-
siderable reduction of equipment. Although agreement with the Bank on these
reductions was reached in early 1978, DGPMS had, since early 1976, halted the
tendering process of the: (a) of the belt conveyor facilities for phosphates
in Huelva, because improvement in a private phosphate pier made them unneces-
sary; (b) dredger for Huelva, as dredging of the channel by contractor was
considered more appropriate technically and econoaically; and (c) container
crane for La Luz y Las Palmas, because it was not needed and concessionaires
have agreed to purchase it when needed. The component was therefore reduced
to sixty six new quay cranes, eight for Huelva and fifty eight for nine other
major ports. Again, it appears that all these important changes in the pro-
ject content might have been avoided if, during the preparation and appraisal
stages, a more thorough analysis of international market conditions - the de-
cline of traffic started soon after loan approval - were carried out.
3.26     Procurement of the sixty six quay cranes run relatively well.  Tender
documents were already prepared in October 1973 and all contracts were already
awarded by August 1974. However the delivery of equipment experienced a two-
year delay due to the delicate political, economic and laboral situation of
the country, with numerous strikes which paralyzed the a-rdee  firms.  By
mid-1978, all of the sixty six cranes were delivered, erected and in use. The
original work schedule called for completion by early 1976.
Ecological Studies
3.27     The Borrower undertook to carry out two studies to determine ecolog-
ical effects of the project on areas affected and to implement recommendations
of the studies. The Huelva study was carried out by the Port Authority and
sent to the Bank by mid-1976.  It concluded that none of the project works
would adversely affect the ecology of the water system and that a beach would
be formed along the outer side of the dike. This beach is already one of the
most popular recreational spots of the city of Huelva.   The Luz y Las Palmas
study was carried out by consultants and sent to the Bank in early 1981. The
study recommends a fight against pollution from oil spills in the harbor and
an improvement of port trash service for the ships.  The Port Authority is
implementing adequately both recommendations and has installed an anti-
pollution floating system to protect Alcaravaneras beach from oil spill.
Procurement
3.28     Information available indicates that the Borrower did not have any
difficulty in understanding Bank procurement procedures. However, there were
considerable delays in preparing bid documents, signing of contracts and
therefore in project implementation.  Inadequate preparation prior to the ap-
praisal stage was mainly responsible for these delays. Completion of design
work, tests and other investigative work, and preparation of technical specif-
ications were partly left for the implementation stage. These delays, which
were considerable in certain project items led to further delays because of



- 18 -
changing views on some projects items and unexpected developments in traffic.
This meant starting to prepare a new set of documents for conducting inter-
national competitive bidding (ICB).  The rate of actual disbursements under
the project clearly reflects these implementation problems.  Performance of
civil works contractors and equipment suppliers was satisfactory, and in the
case of La Luz y Las Palmas civil works contractor, very good.
Disbursement
3.29     Table  1 summarized  estimated  disbursement  schedule  at  appraisal,
revised schedules and actual  disbursements.   Appraisal  estimates were un-
realistic and estimates made by supervision missions in June 1975 and June
1976 proved somewhat optimistic. Only in October 1977, four and a half years
after L.A. signature were the problems surrounding the project fully appre-
ciated, and realistic solutions formulated; as a result a more realistic esti-
mate of disbursement was made.
Project Costs
3.30     Table 2 summarizes cost increases over the years.  Total project cost
estimated at Pta 6,256 million (US$96.9 million equivalent) during appraisal
reached Pta. 10,837 million (US$152.4 million equivalent) in February 1980 and
Pta. 11,900 million (US$130 million equivalent) in early 1982. A comparison
of total cost estimates, however, does not fully reflect the full extent of
cost overruns. As the latest figure excludes items included at appraisal but
later deleted (manufacture of dredger with related consultants' supervision,
fees and phosphate handling facilities in Ruelva; container crane and super-
tanker pier in La Luz y Las Palmas), actual cost overruns were higher than
those indicated by total cost figures. This may be illustrated by the dif-
ference between appraisal estimates and actual cost figures for individual
items.  Cost of civil works at Huelva was estimated at Pta. 2,693 million,
actual cost near completion, however, reached Pta. 6,884 million, a cost over-
run of over 200 percent. As noted earlier several engineering problems were
encountered during construction of the dike and berths at Huelva.  Many of
these problems may have been avoided by adequate preparation prior to ap-
praisal. A review of revisions in project cost estimates also suggests that
basic problems underlying the project were not fully detected until late 1977,
as all revised cost figures prior to this date proved to be optimistic. An-
other  important  cause  of  cost  overruns  were  currency  devaluations.   The
changes in the rate of exchange Pta/US$ are indicated in the Table 2.  Dev-
aluation of the dollar between the time of appraisal and in 1975 was reflected
in a sharper increase in total project costs in dollar terms than in Pta.
terms. In subsequent years, however, devaluation of Pta. dampered the cost
overruns in dollars. The general inflation, both in the country and in the
rest of the world, was also an important factor in bringing about serious cost
overruns in the project.



- 19 -
Project Financing
3.31     The financing plan agreed at appraisal called for the Government con-
tribution to meet local currency costs and all foreign exchange costs other
than US$50 million equivalent to complete the project. This represented 48.2
percent of total project costs, partly to be generated by the ports themselves
and partly from Government grants  (para. 2.13).  The serious cost overruns
during implementation resulted in financing problems.   Particularly in 1977
the problem of project financing came to the fore as a result of further in-
creases in project costs, economic recession in the country and the austerity
measures introduced by the Government. At this stage the Government proposed
to modify the scope of the project (para. 3.04) by deleting certain items to
reduce the financing gap. Even with these modifications Government financing
needed to complete the project was increased to Pta. 5,600 million from Pta.
2,900 estimated at appraisal.
3.32     Difficulties in obtaining Government funds for the project began to
affect project implementation schedule, mainly in La Luz y Las Palmas which
had been proceeding on time. Funds available under the loan were almost fully
disbursed by 1979. Therefore, completion of the project had to be carried out
solely by Government financing. Government budgets for 1980 to 1982 included
adequate allocations for the project.
Reporting
3.33     Quarterly reports were prepared in Madrid by the DGPMS based on doc-
umentation provided by the port authorities of the project.  They were sent
almost regularly to the Bank but they missed to report important developments
as the change of design in Burro bridge (para. 3.09) or the self-insurance
solution adopted by the DGPMS and port authorities (para. 6.11). The Bank re-
quested data for the PCR since February 1981 without any response until Feb-
ruary 1982. Since April 1982 the DGPC and the Port Authorities of Huelva and
La Luz y Las Palmas started collecting data requested by the Bank. These data
were forwarded to the PCR mission in Madrid, Huelva and Las Palmas in mid-June
1982.
IV. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
4.01     In addition to the mentioned delays in project implementation, cost
overruns, financing problems and the significant modifications in the project
scope, the short-falls in forecast traffic contributed negatively to achieve
an adequate operating performance and to realize the overall financial and
economic objectives of the project. The following sections summarize develop-
ments in traffic at the Project Ports and compare them with the appraisal
forecasts.



- 20 -
4.02     Tables 3 and 4 show actual traffic handled at both Project Ports
during  the period between  1972 and 1980 and  the  appraisal forecasts.  At
Huelva (Table 3) the actual volumes fell short of expectations by about 15% in
1972 and 1973. The expected growth in traffic after 1973 could not be real-
ized and by 1980 the actual volume of cargo handled at the port was about 50%
of the forecast figures. The primary cause for the short fall was the decline
in imports of crude oil and in exports of refined products; whereas appraisal
estimates expected a steady growth in this traffic during the 1970's reaching
to 12.5 million ton in 1980 from 6.8 million ton in 1971.  Traffic volumes
achieved in solid bulk cargo also fell short of expectations. However, the
difference between the actual and forecast figures was considerably less than
those experienced in liquid bulk cargo.  In the case of general cargo, the
port's actual throughput in 1980 was twice the forecast figures.
4.03     At la Luz y Las Palmas (Table 4), similarly, the forecast traffic
volumes proved to be optimistic. In terms of the actual flow of all types of
cargo, about 80% of forecast volume was achieved during the early 1970s. How-
ever, by 1980 the realized volume of port traffic fell to about 45% of the
forecast figure. Much of the shortfall was in petroleum products: the actual
volume declined steadily from about 4 million tons in 1972 to 2.6 million tons
in 1980, whereas the appraisal forecast envisaged  a steady  growth.  As a
result, the actual -volume of petroleum products handled at the port in 1980
was only 302 of the forecast volume. In the case of dry bulk goods the actual
volume was higher than the appraisal estimate: 300,000  tons as opposed  to
forecast volume of 200,000 tons.  In the case of conventional general cargo
the port achieved a modest growth during the 1970s, although the rate of
growth was slightly below the forecast figures. The volume of containerized
cargo however increased rather dramatically during the same period.  In 1972
the total tonnage of containerized cargo was about 115,000 tons; by 1980 it
increased to about 770,000 tons, almost a seven-fold increase.
4.04     Failure to realize the forecast traffic volumes at Project Ports was
primarily due to unfavorable developments in the general economic conditions
after the emergence of the energy crunch. The oil crisis directly contributed
to the substantial short-falls experienced in oil traffic, particularly at La
Luz y Las Palmas.  Moreover, the reopening of the  Suez Canal contributed
greatly toward reducing the oil traffic at this port. Whether these develop-
ments could have been foreseen during the project preparation and appraisal
stages is debatable. However, as an appraisal follow-up mission took place in
late 1972 and the Board approval was in early 1973, the first signs of the
energy crisis were visible and therefore a cautious approach to forecasting of
oil traffic should have been adopted. Moreover, the oil facilities at La Luz
y Las Palmas which the project included, were primarily designed to provide
services to the tanker traffic after the closure of the Suez Canal. Although
preparation and appraisal of the project took place before the clearance of
the Canal (April 1974) and the commencement of traffic (July 1975), it would
have been prudent in estimating the future oil traffic at La Luz y Las Palmas,
to allow for the eventual re-opening of the Suez Canal. In the case of other
commodities, the failure to achieve the rates of growth envisaged at the time
of the appraisal was primarily attributable to the fall-out from the energy
crisis which slowed the rate of economic growth in Spain.



- 21 -
4.05     It must be noted, however, that some of the adverse effects of the
short-falls in forecast traffic were avoided by modifying the project contents
during the initial stages of the project implementation. The oil crunch and
the resulting crisis in the world economy in general and in the oil trade in
particular occurred early in the project life. Also, as discussed before, the
implementation of the project start-up was delayed for about two years. This
delay proved to be a blessing in a disguise as it provided an opportunity to
adjust the new port capacity to demand. For example, at Huelva the belt con-
veyor facilities for phosphates and at Las Palmas the construction of the sec-
ond oil jetty were eliminated from the project.
4.06     The project substantially contributed toward modernization of port
facilities at the Project Ports and has led to improvements in cargo handling
in the other nine major ports.  The availability of container facilities in-
creased efficiency in the movement of general cargo in La Luz y Las Palmas.
The provision of new cranes to replace old inefficient equipment in nine major
ports and Huelva contributed greatly to cost savings in cargo handling.  The
new bulk cargo facilities at Huelva has increased efficiency in unloading
phosphate.
V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
5.01     Comparative  income  statement and balance  sheet  summaries  for  the
ports of Huelva and La Luz y Las Palmas for 1972-1978 and actuals for 1979 and
1980 are given in Tables 5 to 8. Although the project includes provision of
quay cranes at nine other major ports in addition to the provision of facil-
ities and equipment for the ports of Huelva and La Luz y Las Palmas, the ap-
praisal report concerns itself with the financial evaluation of the latter two
ports only. The financial performance of both ports, however, did not come up
to expectations.
5.02     At the time of appraisal in 1972 the port of Huelva was barely break-
ing even while the port of La Luz y Las Palmas was showing a history of modest
surpluses. Section 6.02 of the appraisal report states: "In August 1972 the
Government decreed four annual tariff increases for general cargo of 20% each
year on imported foreign goods and lOZ each year on other goods except coast-
wise. Water, electricity and cargo-handling equipment charges were also in-
creased but tariffs on ships remain unaltered. The rise in water, electricity
and equipment rates is based on the cost of providing these services. Mer-
chandise tariffs, however, are already profitable, whereas tariffs against
ships are somewhat inadequate.   DPGMS, while acknowledging this fact, con-
siders the shipping industry lobbies powerful enough to resist any such in-
creases.  Consequently, the line of least resistance was taken by increasing
charges on mechandise only. The present tariff levels will enable Huelva to
meet the original 1973 (First Port Project) 5X rate of return target in 1974
and increase the rate to 7.3% in 1977, with corresponding falls in the operat-
ing ratio to 61%. At the Luz y Las Palmas the 5% rate of return will not
quite be achieved (the highest being 4.9% in 1977) because of the Pta. 1,000
million increase in fixed assets in 1973 when the ongoing breakwater and other
port works are completed and taken into service.  After completion of the
proposed project with related increases in fixed assets, but without further



- 22 -
tariff increases, the respective rates of return are expected to fall in 1978
to 4.0% at Huelva and 4.3% at La Luz y Las Palmas. Such rates of return, de-
pending upon expansion needs at that time, will probably be inadequate and
future tariff revisions may be necessary in 1976/77. And in Section 6.07 the
appraisal report stipulates that new tariffs should be introduced by January
1, 1977, which will ensure the recovery of economic costs as well as the re-
covery of benefits and earnings accruing to parties outside the Borrower's
economy.  The financial performance of both ports improved with the intro-
duction of new tariffs in 1977. However, even after the revision of tariffs,
Huelva's performance has since been declining mainly because of low traffic
and high personnel costs.

matters and their actual compliance are summarized below.

Current Situation
5.04     The Spanish Port Authorities are fully aware of the significance of
cost recovery aspect of tariff setting, but they are also faced with the prob-
lem of under utilization of capacity because of economic circumstances beyond
their control as well as market forces which determine the points to which
traffic gravitates. Because of the generally depressed state of economic con-
ditions in many countries, of which Spain is no exception, the ports traffic
has been adversely affected. However, the present situation is being closely
watched so as to ensure that the ports at least break even financially.
VI. INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMAMCE
6.01     The main institutional problems identified during the appraisal of
the project were related basically to: a) introduction of modern commercial
accounting and costing systems, and establishment of independent commercial
auditing practices; b) establishment of a cost-related tariff structure; c)
autonomy of the ports in the areas of fiscal and personnel matters; and d) or-
ganizational and administrative changes to improve transport sector coordi-
nation and efficiency in port planning and operation. The project, therefore,
was designed to reinforce the required organization and institutional reforms.
Accounting and Costing
6.02     Efforts to improve accounting and costing systems in all ports and to
ensure uniformity in principles and techniques used started under the First
Port Project and continued under the Project.  These efforts were successful
after the establishment in DGPMS of a Central Accounting Unit in early 1974.
This Unit completed the studies needed to design and implement standard cost-
ing systems and accounting principles by the end of 1975.  Implementation of
recommendations started at Huelva and five other ports in 1976 and at La Luz y
Las Palmas in January 1977. The new accounting techniques are now applied in
most of the major ports. The Central Accounting Unit is responsible for moni-
toring on a continuous basis procedures for recording accounting and costing



- 26 -
information, analysing them and summarising the results of all ports oper-
ations in Spain.
6.03     The Government had not taken any action to appoint independent com-
mercial auditors for the ports of Huelva, La Luz y Las Palmas, Barcelona and
B-lbao, although it was stipulated under the First Port Project. During ne-
gotiations of the loan, the Government reconfirmed that measures would be in-
troduced for regular auditing by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank.
After the Bank's review of the Institute of Censores Jurados de Cuentas de
Espa]a, the Government made arrangements to appoint members of the Institute
as auditors to the four ports.  Satisfactory annual audited accounts have ar-
rived regularly in the Bank from 1976 to the present.
Tariffs
6.04     Tariff revisions had not been initiated under the First Port Project
as stipulated. During negotiations of the loan, the Government agreed to in-
troduce at all ports tariffs based on the cost of individual services and to
comply with the rate of return covenant. The revised tariffs were to take in-
to account recovering at least of the economic costs and to ensure that, so
far as is reasonable, economic benefits accruing outside the Borrowers's econ-
omy were recovered.
6.05     In August 1972 the Government approved increase of port charges on
general cargo (tariff G-3) in a step by step basis on August 1 of each year
from 1972 to 1975. Ship dues (tariff G-1) on foreign ships were increased by
100 percent between Janeu'ary 1, 1975 and January 1, 1976.  Equipment rental
fees (tariff E-1) were increased 50 percent in April 1975. By April 1976 the
Government had introduced a new round of increases in tariff G-1, both at
Huelva and La Luz y Las Palmas to be applied to ships operating in foreign
trade. As a result, the G-1 tariffs reached in 1976 nine times the level
prevailing in 1974.  In addition, the Government approved a proposal by the
port authorities to revise all tariffs according to the cost of living index
minus two points every year, and equipment rental fees every two years. This
revision has been applied since 1976. Therefore, since 1975 a steady progress
was achieved toward establishment of a cost-related tariff structure and this
goal stated by the existing Finance Law and the L.A. is being realized.
Autonomy
6.06     Under the First Port Project, the port of Huelva was granted autonomy
(October 2, 1969) and was required to conform to Goverment's overall transport
objectives.   Huelva's experience, however, was not successful and its Port
Authority did not have full power to determine its tariff, staffing, and wage
policies. Consequently during project negotiations, the Bank and the Govern-
ment agreed to exchange views on the applicability of the principles of port
autonomy. Moreover, under the project additional reforms were carried out and
efforts made to improve the long-term effectiveness of the autonomy of port
authorities.
6.07     After lengthy dialogue between the Bank and the DGPMS, a draft pro-
posal was prepared in 1977 for the autonomy of those ports with a traffic
volume of 4 million tons and more and which achieved an acceptable financial



- 27 -
rate of return. The Government approved the proposal in 1979 and, in addition
to Huelva, the ports of Barcelona, Bilbao and Valencia were granted autonomy.
The full implications of these new arrangements on efficiency in port oper-
ation and financial management have been satisfactory and the Government is
under the process of granting autonomy to more ports, one of them La Luz y Las
Palmas.
Organizational and Administrative Changes
6.08     Partial successes were achieved in strengthening the organizational
structure of the Government in the transport sector and in bringing about a
coordinated  approach  to  investment  and  pricing  policies.   The  Government
undertook to broaden the functions of the CSTT and to initiate studies to
determine national investment priorities.  These efforts resulted in the es-
tablishment in August 1977 of a new Ministry of Transportation and Communi-
cation responsible for all transport modes except ports (para 1.06). Author-
ity, which hitherto had been spread among several agencies was given to a
single ministry. The impact of the new ministry in the uniformity and ade-
quacy of transport policies has been satisfactory.
6.09     The efforts initiated by the Bank in cooperation with the Government
to strengthen DGPMS long-range planning capabilities were not successful. The
Bank's request was resisted by the Government on the grounds that additions to
personnel would increase administrative costs, and that capacity of DGPMS was
in most of the circumstances adequate.  The Bank agreed with the Government
proposal.
6.10     DGPMS initiated by its own staff a review of existing ports to pre-
pare an inventory of available facilities.  It has also established a standard
system of port statistics. All these efforts have enable the port authorities
to formulate a national port investment program, which was completed in 1976
and subsequently updated by DGPC.  This port investment program was incor-
porated and implemented into the Fourth National Development Plan (1976-1979).
Insurance
6.11     Section 4.03 of L.A. obliged the Borrower to employ insurance experts
on insurable risks, including third party risks and to take out and maintain
insurance for the Project Ports as well as for Barcelona and Pasajes. In 1977
a consultant was engaged  to review port  insurance.   The port authorities
decided that self-insurance under a port-pool fund was the best solution, as
insurance by private firms was too expensive.  The Bank was not informed of
this decision that is being implemented since 1979.
Reevaluation of Fixed Assets
6.12     DGPMS issued instructions to all ports for the revaluation of fixed
assets as at December 31, 1975 based on indices derived from the official
statistics bulletin ad economic indicators.   These instructions were  found
adequate by the Bank. On this basis, revaluation of all port fixed assets,



- 28 -
with the exception of land, was carried out and incorporated in the accounts.
A new reevaluation of fixed assets, including land valuation based on criteria
prepared and agreed to by all ports directors and DGPMS took place in 1980.
VII. ECONOMIC RE-EVALUATION
7.01     Parallel to the rapid and significant transformation of the economy
from a predominantly agricultural to one based on industry and service sector
during early 1970s, the Government embarked on a long-term port development
program based on a coordinated plan. The components included in the project
were within this overall strategy.  In addition, the Project Ports both at
Huelva and at La Luz y Las Palmas aimed at spearheading regional developments
within their hinterlands which have been the least developed regions of Spain.
7.02     Specific objectives of the project components were to (a) expand port
facilities at both Project Ports, particularly those for specialized cargo, to
eliminate and to prevent congestion, (b) improve efficiency in cargo handling
and therefore reduce costs and (c) continue the program initiated under the
First Port Project of organizational and institutional reforms. The project,
in addition to works undertaken at Huelva and La Luz y Las Palmas included
procurement of 58 cranes to replace old and inefficient equipment at nine
other major ports to meet the needs of the growing maritime traffic by improv-
ing and expanding cargo handling capacities and to reduce costs.
7.03     In the appraisal report separate economic evaluations were carried
out for each major component of the project.  At Huelva, benefits expected
from the project works primarily consisted of savings in shipping costs re-
sulting from the use of larger vessels, reductions in ship waiting times and
savings in the total transport cost of bulk cargo destined to points within
the hinterland of the port.  In addition, the project was considered as an
integral element of the Government's industrialization efforts in the region.
An analysis of costs and quantified benefits yielded an economic rate of re-
turn of 16%. At the port of La Luz y Las Palmas the project was designed to
provide facilities for petroleum products and general cargo. Benefits primar-
ily consisted of reduction in ship waiting times and cost savings in cargo
handling with an estimated rate of return of 31%. The investment in 58 re-
placement quay cranes yielded an economic rate of return of about 18Z. In the
following sections each of the project components are subjected to separate
economic re-evaluation at 1980 prices.
Huelva Port
General
7.04     The delays encountered in implementation of all project components,
cost overruns, and shortfalls in traffic significantly contributed towards
both reducing and delaying the estimated benefits and therefore the rate of
return  on  the  project.   However,  despite  these adverse  developments  the
project proved to be adequately conceived and well-timed. The impact, in



- 29 -
particular, that the project thus far had on the development and industrial-
ization of the region has exceeded the expectations at the time of appraisal.
Project Costs and Benefits
7.05     Table 9 summarizes the actual project cost stream at 1980 Pesetas.
Among the benefits generated by the project only the following were quantified
and included in the rate of return calculations: (a) reductions in ship wait-
ing times; (b) savings in the total transport costs of iron ore; (c) reduc-
tions in maritime transport costs; and (d) travel time savings resulting from
the new access road.  The quantification of these benefits is based on the
actual conditions which prevailed in 1980, the first year of full operation of
the port. The future benefits to year 1995, the horizon year for the economic
evaluation, are estimated on the basis of projected growth in traffic.  The
port has been experiencing an annual growth in traffic of about 5%.  It is
assumed that this growth rate will prevail until 1990 when the port will be-
come fully utilized. The benefits beyond 1990 are frozen at this level.
Reductions in Ship-Waiting Times
7.06     Based on the actual volume of general cargo and solid bulk traffic
handled at the port in 1980 and the number of ship arrivals and ship size dis-
tribution, the project yielded savings in ship waiting time of 560 ship/days.
Taking into account of the portion which is estimated to accrue to the econ-
omy, about 75%, the savings amounted to about 150 million Ptas.
7.07     The project has reduced the land transport cost of iron ore required
for the pelletization plant located within the hinterland of the port. In the
absence of the project, the required iron ore would have to be transported
overland from the north. It is estimated that the project yielded a transport
cost saving of about Pta. 300 per ton for 600,000 tons of ore used at the
plant, with a total saving of Pta. 182 million in 1980. Parallel to the plan-
ned expansion in pellet production, traffic volume is expected to increase to
1.2 million tons in 1990 giving rise to annual benefits of Pta. 360 million.
7.08     The savings in maritime transport costs resulting from the use of
large vessels were limited only to 15% of the solid bulk traffic received at
the port in 1980 and amounted to about Pta. 196 million. However, with ex-
pected growth in the volume of bulk traffic, it is expected that an increasing
portion will be shipped in larger vessels giving rise to increased savings in
maritime transport costs.  These are estimated to reach Pta. 390 million in
1984 and expected to increase at an annual rate of 2 percent thereafter.
7.09     The new access road to the port has both reduced traffic congestion
and increased the average speed of vehicles serving the port from an average
of 20 km/h to 40 km/h.  The reduced vehicle operating costs in 1980 were
estimated to yield a saving of about Pta. 46 million.

7.10     Table 10 summarizes the actual cost streams and estimated benefit
streams for 1974 through 1995. On this basis the estimated rate of return on
the project is about 7%.
7.11     The rate of return estimated above, however, does not fully account
for the economic benefits generated by the project.   Due to inadequacy of
data, several positive effects which resulted from the investment could not be
quantified and included in the rate of return calculations. These include the
reductions in cargo-handling costs and ship service times, elimination of con-
gestion at fishing berths, alleviation of congestion in the urban road network
which resulted from the diversion of port traffic to the new access road, a
reduction in pollution caused by bulk cargo such as coal, phosphate, and
fertilizers. Moreover, the project bulk contributed, to a significant extent,
to the industrialization of the region. Availability of an efficient port has
been a primary factor in the development of industrial activity in the region
which would not, in all probability, have taken place in the absence of the
project.
La Luz y Las Palmas Port
General
7.12     The project port at La Luz y Las Palmas, with the exception of the
second oil supertanker pier, proved to be well conceived and timely. Despite
cost overruns and the problems encountered during implementation, the project
works yielded a satisfactory rate of return.  In the economic re-evaluation
only the following benefits have been quantified:   (a) reductions in ship
waiting times; (b) cost savings in cargo handling; and (c) reductions in
operating costs.
Savings in Ship-Waiting Times
7.13     Benefits resulting from the ship waiting times have been quantified
on the basis of observed ship arrivals, average ship size and the ship-service
times in 1981.  Separate calculations have been carried out for commercial
fishing vessels and general cargo vessels.  The ship waking times without the
project were estimated to be about 33,000 ship days and that with the project
about 220 ship days. Given the average ship size of 6,000 dwt and the cost of
ship days of US$5,000 savings accruing to the economy, estimated to be 75%,
yield an annual benefit of Pta. 485 million.
Saving in Cargo-Handling Costs
7.14     As a result of investments under the project, the share of container-
ized cargo in total general cargo increased from about 15% to 30%.  Based on
average cost of per gang/hour, it is estimated that higher rate of container-
ization under the project has in 1981 yielded a saving of about Pta. 224
million.



- 31 -
Reduction in Operating Costs
7.15     Before the implementation of the project and due to inadequacy of
storage areas, cargos often had to be moved from one place to another with the
result of high port operating costs. Based on an estimated average movement
of cargo within the port area, the provision of adequate storage areas reduced
the cost by an estimated amount of Pta. 32 million in 1981.
The Cost of the Project
7.16     The cost of the project for the port of La Luz y Las Palmas in cur-
rent and 1981 prices is shown below:
Year          1975      1976     1977      1978     1979     1980      1981
Current Prices  102.6    806.8    260.2    612.5    77.1       128.2    11.3

(Pta. million)
Rate of Return Calculations
7.17     On the basis of cost and benefit estimates discussed above the pro-
ject yields a rate of return of 17%.  Streams of costs and benefits used in
the calculations are summarized in table 11.
Cranes for Major Ports
General
7.18     Provision of 58 cranes to replace old inefficient ones at nine major
ports (para. 2.18, Part B) has contributed towards expanding cargo handling
capacities  of these ports  as well  as reducing handling costs.   Benefits
generated by this component are estimated for each of the nine ports on the
basis of traffic volumes and cost savings achieved. Quantification of bene-
fits is confined to (a) reductions in operating costs and (b) reduction in
loading and unloading time.  Other benefits such as reductions  in service
interruptions due to break-downs and savings in maintenance costs are not in-
cluded in the rate of return calculations.
Estimation of Benefits
7.19     Based on operational data of the nine ports, the savings in oper-
ations resulting from the use of new cranes are estimated to be Pta. 10.7 per
ton in 1980 prices. The total tonnage of general cargo handled in these ports
yielded a benefit of about Pta. 44 million in 1980. For the same year the re-
ductions achieved in cargo loading and unloading time resulted in benefits
estimated at Pta. 861 million.

The Rate of Return Calculations
7.20     Table 12 summarizes the streams of actual costs and benefits of the
cranes in Pta. million in 1980 prices. On this basis, this component of the
project yields an estimated rate of return of about 26%.
VIII. ROLE OF THE BANK
8.01     The Bank, on the whole, played a useful and important role in the
successful completion of the project.  The port authorities involved in the
project also perceive it in the same way. During the preparation stages, the
Bank was instrumental in convincing the Government to carry out additional and
more comprehensive technical and economic studies.   Despite these, however,
the project encountered several technical problems particularly during the
early stages of its imDlementation. A more thorough approach to the project
preparation may have avoided some of these problems, e.g., delays and tech-
nical problems encountered in construction of the dike and dredging of the ac-
cess channel at port of Huelva.
8.02     Although during the implementation of the project there were major
changes in its content, the Bank played a constructive role in maintaining a
continuous dialogue with the Government and bringing the project to a success-
ful conclusion. The Bank was instrumental in securing Government funds during
difficult periods for various essential components of the project without
which the basic objectives could not have been realized. Moreover, the Bank
provided useful suggestions and guidance to modify certain project items ac-
cording to the changing market and economic conditions.
8.03     The project provided the Bank with an opportunity to continue many of
the institutional, managerial and organizational reforms initiated under the
First Port Project.  At present, it is not possible to fully evaluate the
long-term impact which the Bank will have on port planning, operation and man-
agement in Spain. As the project was the last one in the transportation sec-
tor before Spain graduated from the Bank, it can only be hoped that the di-
rection, which was adopted under the project, will be continued by the Spanish
Authorities in a long-term future.
IX. CONCLUSIONS
9.01     The project was an essential element of the long-term plans to expand
and modernize the port capacity in Spain to meet the demands of a growing and
diversifying economy. In this sense, it was timely and appropriate. Although
the scope and the content of the project had to be modified during the imr
plementation stage in response to changing conditions in the world economy,
the main objectives sought from the project at the time of appraisal were, on
the whole, realized.



- 33 -
9.02     Some of the delays encountered during the construction period were
partially due to inadequacies of preparation and therefore could have been
avoided. However, financial problems also significantly contributed to inter-
ruptions in the progress of works.   The economic stagnation which occurred
during the project period led to, among other things, the Government's inab1l-
ity to provide on time investment funds needed to complete the project.
9.03     Substantial cost overruns experienced during the project implement-
ation were similarly due to inadequacies of preparation and also to exogeneous
factors which greatly contributed toward inflationary conditions in Spain.
The fact that actual traffic in some major bulk commodities fell short of the
appraisal estimates reinforces the problems encountered in traffic projections
with a horizon of 20 years or more. However, due to close
cooperation between the Bank and the Spanish Authorities, timely revisions
were made in project components and as a result, the capacity could be ad-
justed to changing demand conditions.   Therefore,  the project proved to be
timely and useful.  It generated, although at somewhat lower level than es-
timated at the time of appraisal, benefits mainly in the form of reduced
ship-waiting and ship-service times.
9.04     Institutional reforms initiated under the First Port  Project were
only partially successful.  Under the project, however, several institutional
reforms in the areas of independent auditing systems, cost-based port charges
and imposition of financial and personnel autonomy on major ports were satis-
factorily carried out and they must be regarded as the primary contribution of
the Bank and the project.  It is unfortunate that the healthy dialogue, which
prevailed in such r--tters, will not be continued in the future as Spain has,
now, graduated from the Bank.
9.05     The most salient lesson emerging from the project is the importance
of adequate preparation prior to embarking upon appraisal of a port project.
This involves carrying out complete technical tests and design work before the
appraisal stage.  Events have proved that some of the technical problems en-
countered and delays and cost-overruns experienced could have been avoided if
the project were better prepared. Moreover, the experience gained under this
project suggests that in preparing the financing plan for the project, a more
thorough investigation of the ability of the Government to comply with it
needs to be carried out. Unavailability of local funds when they are needed
could cause serious disruptions in the progress of work as was the case in
this project.
