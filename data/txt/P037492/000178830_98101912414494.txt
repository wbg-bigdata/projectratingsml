SPAIN
APPRAISAL OF SECOND PORT PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        The Bank's involvement in the improvement and expansion of Spanish
ports began in 1965 when it made a loan ((429-SP) of US$40 million to the
Spanish Government to assist in implementing the 1964-67 Ports Development
Plan by financing expansion in the ports of Barcelona, Huelva, Pasajes and
La Luz y Las Palmas and acquisition of cargo-handling and floating equipment
for general use in the Spanish ports. Completion of the project was delayed,
principally by contracting and procurement procedures, and the Bank agreed to
extend the closing date to March 31, 1972. The Bank would have endorsed the
project if the delay had been forecast during appraisal. In general, con-
struction, equipment, procurement and supervision have been adequate and the
loan was fully disbursed except for about US$30,000 by the extended closing
date. The 1968-71 Development Plan (Table 1) totalling Ptas 12.2 billion was
also assisted by the first Bank loan.
ii.       The Bank has now been approached by the Government for a loan of
US$50 million for a second port project. The proposed loan is a continuation
of Bank involvement in developing Spanish ports and will assist the Govern-
ment in implementing the 1972-75 Development Plan, totalling Ptas 20.0 billion
(Table 1). The project is for further expansion of port facilities at Huelva
and La Luz y Las Palmas and acquisition of quay cranes for general use in nine
other ports; it will: (a) enable the two ports to meet traffic demands up to
1980; (b) allow better allocation of specialized zones in the two ports; (c)
permit adequately planned future expansion in the two ports; (d) assist other
main ports in meeting increased traffic by replacing old quay cranes; and (e)
reinforce and consolidate organizational and institutional reforms achieved
during the first Bank loan. The proposed project will involve an outlay of
about US$96.90 million equivalent with a foreign exchange component of about
US$53 equivalent. The propostd Bank loan will cover US$50 million equivalent
of the foreign exchange component. The remaining US$3 million equivalent
and the local currency needed will be financed by the Government to complete
complementary work, the majority of which is now being executed. The Gov-
ernment will continue to supply all funds for capital investment which are
not generated internally by the ports, in the form of equity. As in the
first loan, the proposed loan will be made to the Government without relending
arrangements so as to avoid discrimination between project and other Spanish
ports.
iii.      The Ports Directorate will be responsible for project design and
supervision. Consultants will be employed to design and supervise con-
struction of a dredger to be purchased for Huelva. Award of civil works
contracts and procurement of equipment will be on the basis of international
competitive bidding. Project execution is expected to take about 4-1/2 years
and to be completed by the end of 1977.



- ii -
iv.       The provision of adequate specialized staff in the Ports Directorate
and major ports is essential to improve port planning and operation, and is
provided for in the loan to be achieved not later than January 1, 1974.
v,        The economic evaluation of the proposed project shows satisfactory
economic returns of 16% at Huelva, 31% at La Luz y Las Palmas and 18% for the
cranes. The financial return on net fixed assets is estimated to improve
from 2.8% in 1972 to 7.3% in 1977 for Huelva and from 3.3% to 4.9% for La Luz
y Las Palmas during the same period.
vi.       On the basis of agreements reached during negotiations the proposed
project provides a suitable basis for a loan to the Government of Spain of
US$50 million for a term of 17 years including a four-year grace period.



SPAIN
APPRAISAL OF SECOND PORT PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Bank's first port loan to Spain was Loan 429-SP (US$40 million)
made in 1965 to help finance expansion and modernization of Huelva, La Luz y
Las Palmas, Pasajes and Barcelona; management and finance practices were also
improved and an act establishing an autonomous Port Authority for Huelva was
passed. Completion of the project was delayed, principally by procurement
procedures involving 121 international and local tenders. Consequently, the
closing date was extended twice, from September 30, 1969 to March 31, 1971 and
then to March 31, 1972. At the latter date, Loan 429-SP was fully disbursed
except for about US$30,000 which has since been cancelled. The Bank would
have endorsed the project if the delay had been forecast during appraisal
(Annex 6).
1.02      This report appraises a second port project, proposed by the Govern-
ment of Spain, which would provide for the expansion of port facilities and
acquisition of equipment at the ports of Huelva (on the mainland) and La Luz
y Palmas (in the Canary Islands) as well as acquisition of quay cranes for
general usage in nine other ports. The project is to meet expected traffic
increase in the above ports and is estimated to cost about US$96.9 million
equivalent, including a foreign exchange component of US$53 million of
which a Bank loan of US$50 million has been requested. The Borrower would
be the Government with the General Directorate of Ports implementing the
project.
1.03      Other loans made by the Bank in the transport sector include a high-
way loan for US$33 million in 1963, and between 1964 and 1971, a series of
three loans totalling US$205 million for railway modernization. The Borrower's
performance on these loans has been satisfactory.
1.04      The proposed project is based on:  (a) economic studies by the
Spanish Port Directorate's consultants, METRASEIS of Spain; and (b) an
appraisal in May-June 1972. This report has been prepared by Messrs. A. A.
Fateen (Engineer), K. C. Rodley (Financial Analyst) and H. 0. Schulte
(Economist).
II. BACKGROUND
A.   Economic Setting
2.01      Forecasts indicate that Spain will maintain an economic growth rate
during the next decade similar to that experienced in the 1960s when GNP grew
at an average annual rate of about 7.5% in real terms. Per capita GNP was
estimated at about US$1,100 equivalent in 1971. Along with this rapid growth
went a significant transformation from a predominantly agricultural economy
to one based on industry with a large service sector. To meet the resulting



forecast increases in port traffic, the Government's Port Development Plan
(including the proposed projects at Huelva and La Luz y Las Palmas) allocates
Ptas 20 billion (US$310 million equivalent) over a period of four years
(1972-75) for new works and acquisition of cranes and dredges for general use
in Spanish Ports.
2.02      Population and economic activity have traditionally been concentrated
in the North (Basque provinces), Northeast (Barcelona) and center (Madrid) of
the country. In 1965, the Government began to create new "poles of develop-
ment" in an effort to decentralize industry and to spread development to
regions that had lagged behind the general economic boom. The large distances
between centers of economic activity, and the country's mountainous terrain,
account for costly transport infrastructure investments which represented
about 25% of the total direct public investment in both the Government's
Second (1968-71) and Third (1972-75) Development Plans.
2.03      In spite of a slowdown of economic expansion in 1970 and 1971, when
the increase in GNP dropped to 5.9% and 4.6% respectively, the basic conditions
that favored economic development in the 1960s are not expected to change during
the next decade. The 1972-75 Development Plan aims at a real GNP growth of 7%
per year which is considered realistic.
B.   The Transport System
2.04      Spain has an extensive road system with some 79,000 km of Central
State roads, including about 400 km of four-lane expressways and about 61,000
km of local roads. The railway network of the Spanish National Railways (RENFE)
comprises about 13,700 km of which 3,100 km are electrified and 2,000 km are
double track. In addition, there are some 2,800 km narrow gauge railway lines
owned by private companies and local authorities. Spain has 30 major commer-
cial ports which handle almost all of Spain's imports and about 90% of its
exports, in addition to about 200 minor and fishing ports. Coastal shipping
plays an important role in Spain's transport system carrying about 30% of
internal and inter-island (Canary and Baleares) freight traffic at present.
Finally, effective air services are provided between major cities and to the
Spanish islands. Iberia Airlines also serves some major international flight
routes.
2.05      Freight traffic in Spain grew rapidly between 1961 and 1970, from
about 46 billion to about 88 billion ton-km, an average annual rate of 7.5%.
Passenger traffic grew even faster, more than tripling during the same period.
Among the different modes, the shift to road transport and the decline in
relative importance of railway transport and coastal shipping that began in
the 1950s, continued during the past decade.
2.06      The Third Development Plan (1972-75) devotes 25 percent of public
investment (the largest sectoral share) to transport. About 53 percent of
this amount is for roads, 29 percent for railways, 10 percent for airports
and 8 percent for ports. The principal effort in roads is the construction
of superhighways, a priority guided by the increase in motorization.



-3-
C.   Transport Planning and Coordination
2.07      Transport services in Spain are highly competitive.  Users have a
free choice in selecting the mode of transport and the carrier best suited
to their needs and, up to 1971, there were practically no Government regula-
tions restricting inter-modal competition. However, the absence of a Minis-
try of Transport and the dispersion of responsibilities for the various
transport modes among a number of Government agencies, makes transport coor-
dination and planning in Spain a difficult task. The Ministry of Public
Works (MPW) is responsible for all investments in the State road network and
the country's commercial pcrts; it is also responsible for administration of
the latter. RENFE, formerly run as a department of the MPW, has been an
autonomous public corporation since 1964, but there is still a large degree
of Government control over tariff policies and investments exercised through
the MPW. Coastal and merchant shipping are controlled by the Ministry of
Commerce, and the Ministry of Air Transport is responsible for investments
and operations for both civil and military aviation. Iberia and Aviaco, the
two national airlines, have a status somewhat similar to RENFE.
2.08      Investment plans for the transport sector originate in the Govern-
ment agencies responsible for the various modes and are discussed in inter-
ministerial commissions and with the Government's Planning Board: the final
investment volume in the Government's Four-Year Development Plans is the
result of a series of reductions and adjustments made often on other than
economic criteria. This is clearly an unsatisfactory procedure.
2.09      The Government, following Bank recommendations, established in 1964
the Superior Council of Land Transport (Consejo Superior de Transportes
Terrestres (CSTT)) as an advisory body within the Ministry of Public Works.
Though its Terms of Reference give CSTT wide authority to advise the Govern-
ment on transport policies and investments, its role so far has been limited
to data collection and execution of studies on specific problems and it has
practically remained outside the transport planning process. With the Third
Bank Loan (Loan No. 772-SP) to RENFE in 1971, it was agreed that the structure
and functions of the CSTT would be broadened, its organization strengthened,
and a work program for CSTT in future years would be prepared by the end of
1972, along lines agreed with the Bank. Progress on this has been slow and
the Bank informed the Government recently that a more decisive action should
be taken to accomplish the required reforms. The Bank has recently received
a firm commitment from the Government that functions of the CSTT will be
broadened, its organization strengthened and funds will be allocated to hire
consultants needed to carry out the otudies in 1973. The first draft report
is expected in April 1973 and all the studies are now scheduled for completion
by July 1974.

III. PORT FACILITIES, ADPIINISTRATION AND OPERATIONS
A.   Port Facilities
3.01      In terms of total traffic, the ports of Huelva and La Luz y Las
Palmas rank among the seven largest of Spain's 30 major ports. Under Loan
429-SP, both of these ports were improved in a phased program of expansion
and modernization - however, some items of work are still to be completed
(para 4.16). Details of the existing port facilities at Huelva and La Luz
y Las Palmas are given in Annex 1 and summarized below:
At Huelva
3.02      Huelva Port is located on the Odiel River about 15 km from the
ocean. The main operational restriction to port usage is the limited depth
of 8 m below MLWST in the access channel where the maximum tidal range is
3.7 m. Deepening of the channel by continuous dredging has proved very
difficult because of rapid siltation.
3.03      The old part of the port, now used for general cargo, dry bulk and
fish products, has a depth of 6 to 7.5 m; this depth is maintained by conti-
nuous costly maintenance dredging. Berthing facilities comprise 690 m for
general cargo, 250 m for dry bulk, 450 m for fish and 710 m for minerals;
the latter facility is owned by private companies. The new part, financed
under Loan 429-SP, comprises two petroleum berths and a mineral pier 500 m
long; all are designed to a future draft of 12 m.
At La Luz y Las Palmas
3.04      The port, located in Las Palmas bay and subject to a maximum tidal
range of 2.7 m, is protected by a 1,570 m long breakwater which shelters a
harbor basin 1,200 m wide with available depth between 6 and 19 m.  Berthing
facilities comprise 5,845 m of which 2,005 m is for general cargo, 1,720 m
for fish, 120 m for dry bulk, and 2,000 m (privately owned) for liquid bulk.
Alongside depths at berths vary from more than 10 m (for general cargo) to
4 to 7.5 m (for fish) at MLWST.
3.05      There is an adequate number of transit sheds, the majority of which
are in moderate to good condition. Three ship-repairing firms operate actively
in rlhe port area; their facilities include a floating dock 5,300 ton capacity
and eight slipways. Adequate installations for ship bunkering are available.
There are only 17 quay cranes at present and ship's gear is often used for
cargo-handling. Mobile handling equipment and berthing tugs are available
and are privately owned.
B,  Administration
3.06      The administration of Spanish ports is monitored by the Directorate
General of Ports and Marine Signals (DGPMS), which is a department of the
Ainistry of Public Works. Except for Huelva, DGPMS has jurisdiction over the



remaining 29 larger ports and exercises its authority at each port through
a port director, who besides being a member of the DGPMS staff, is also the
chief executive of a local "Junta de Obras y Servicios de Puerto, (JOSP)".
These port organizations include various government officials, and non-
official representatives from the local chambers of mines, commerce, etc., -
the latter being a minority. The JOSP has considerable financial control and
power to initiate projects, but in practice, DGPMS, through the port director,
exercises effective control over port planning and major construction, as the
allocation of State financial grants to individual ports is delegated to DGPMS
by the Ministry of Finance.
3.07      Under Loan 429-SP, the Government agreed to grant financial and
administrative autonomy to at least one of the project ports and expressed
its intention to extend autonomy to about seven other important ports, later
at intervals, in the light of experience gained. In conformity with that
Loan the Ports Finances Law (Law No. 1 of January 28, 1966) and the Ports
Authority and Autonomy Law (Law No. 27 of June 20, 1968) were passed, both
to the Bank's satisfaction and 1Huelva was granted autonomy under a statute
by Decree No. 2380 of October 2, 1969. Under the Legislation all ports are
required to conform to the Government's transport coordination objectives
and social and economic development plans. In conformity with Loan Agreement
429-SP, tariffs are to be based on costs, and revenues are required to meet
all operating costs, including maintenance and depreciation, and earn a
reasonable return on net fixed assets. In the case of Huelva the return is
specified by law as a minimum of 5%. After meeting taxes and debt interest,
net revenues are to be applied as follows:
(a) the establishment of a working capital fund up to 10%
of cash operating expenses;
(b)  the establishment of a fund for exceptional repairs and con-
tingencies; the objective, as a percentage of gross revenue,
to be established separately for each port;
(c) financing of new investments as fixed by the Government; and
(d) the balance to be paid into the public Treasury.
New investments are to be financed by (a) the port's own resources, (b)
borrowing by the autonomous ports and (c) Government grants; all investment
funds provided by the Government, from whatever source, are equity capital.
3.08      Although autonomous for three years, Huelva's experience has been
marred by (a) inability to alter tariffs, raise salaries and vary staff
establishments consequent upon the Government's wage and price freeze regula-
tions during 1969/71; (b) doubts concerning the extent of management's legal
powers and duties, which were not resolved until ministerial approval of
Internal Bylaws was obtained late in 1971; and (c) almost complete dependence
upon DGPMS for capital investment funds. Consequently, DGPMS and some other
major ports' managements are not yet convinced that autonomy is a desirable



- 6 -
objective to Spanish ports. Huelva management endorses the Bank view that
it is, and hopes to prove so, given the improved working environment resulting
from the approval of bylaws and recent substantial tariff increases affecting
revenues up to 1976. During negotiations, an agreement was reached that by
not later than January 1, 1974 the Bank and the Government shall exchange
views on the applicability elsewhere of the principles of autonomy as set
forth in the Ports Authority and Autonomy Law.
3.09      The minor ports are administered by a director and associated
Commission, named the "Comision Administrativa de Grupos de Puertos (CAGP)"
under the DGPMS, whose functions and organization resemble those of a JOSP.
These ports are subsidized by levying an annual charge against major ports
(currently 1% of operating revenue).
3.10      Besides the Ministry of Public Works, various other ministries are
involved in port matters, however, this division of responsibility did not
reduce the efficiency of port operations. The Ministry of Finance has port
auditing functions. The Ministry of Labor is responsible for registering
and mustering the labor employed by independent stevedoring companies. The
Ministry of Commerce shares responsibility with the Ministry of Marine for
pilotage, towage, control of shipping to berths, communications, and wreck
removal. The Ministry of the Interior is responsible for port health and
sanitation.
3.11      Spanish law provides that the secretary of each port (who must be a
member of the Corps of Port Secretary-Accountants) be responsible for books
and accounts. However, some members of the Corps lack the knowledge to effect-
ively perform their duties, Consequently, some ports have engaged qualified
accountants on short-term contracts until the Government allows changes in the
port organization structures. However, difficulties have been experienced due
to Ministry of Finance budgetary restrictions. It is considered that the pro-
vision of adequate specialized staff, including economists and financial
analysts, in the organization structures of DGPMS and major ports under its
jurisdiction is essential to improving port planning and operations. During
negotiations an agreement was reached that required changes will be made to
DGPMS and individual port organizational structures to provide suitably desig-
nated posts therein by not later than January 1, 1974.
3.12      In Nay 1972, a significant change was made to the organizational
structure of DGPMS by creating a division responsible for evaluation of
projects. A Division Chief has been appointed and plans for subordinate staff,
a complete organization structure and an implementation program are being
worked out.
Accounting System and Audit
3.13      In accordance with Loan 429-SP, (and the Ports Authority and Autonomy
Law as regards Huelva) the four project ports (Barcelona, Pasajes, Huelva and
La Luz y Las Palmas) have established modern commercial accounting systems
iiicluding costing systems; some other major ports have introduced modified



systems. In an attempt to ensure basic uniformity in accounting and costing
principles and techniques among the ports, the Ports Directorate in 1969
devised an accounting manual and sought Ministry of Finance approval. The
Ministry has not yet approved the manual, although it is contemplating
adapting it to the needs of other state commercial undertakings as well. To
avoid erosion of the degree of uniformity already existing in port commercial
accounts and to achieve standardization in costing methods, an agreement
was reached during negotiations that the accounting manual will become oper-
able by not later than August 1, 1973 pending the completion of a more com-
prehensive document.
3.14      Loan 429-SP required the appointment of independent commercial
auditors satisfactory to the Bank for the four project ports after the
introduction of a commerical accounting system because the Government
"Tribunal de Cuentas" in the Ministry of Finance, which is currently respon-
sible for auditing, is not equipped to conduct commercial type audits.
Commercial accounting became operative in 1970, however, appointment of
auditors acceptable to the Bank has been made only recently to provide the
required audited statements for fiscal years 1970 and 1971. The undertaking
requiring audit by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank was reconfirmed
during negotiations.
C.   Operations
3.15      In general, port operations are satisfactory, however, about 20
percent of quay cranes in Spanish ports are very old (40 to 50 years old)
and cannot meet expected traffic increase beyond 1976. Cargo handling on
ships and/or onshore is undertaken by shipping agents and stevedoring compa-
nies using their own mobile equipment. In La Luz y Las Palmas, ships are
loaded and unloaded using ship's gear; in Huelva, quay cranes owned by the
port are used for general and some bulk cargo handling. However, because
Huelva handles mainly industrial products, most of the dry bulk cargo has,
up to now, been handled on privately owned piers. Crude oil for the Rio
Tinto refinery is discharged via a submarine pipeline from a mooring station
located outside the Odiel River. Transit sheds are owned and operated by each
port, and consignees, using their own labor, collect incoming cargo from the
transit sheds and open storage areas.
3.16      In La Luz y Las Palmas, work is on a 24-hour, 6-day-a-week basis.
In Huelva, work is on a 2-shift, 6-day-a-week basis; in unusual cases, ships
may be worked three shifts. The labor used by stevedoring companies is
administered by the "Servicio de Trabajos Portuarios", (an agency attached
to the Ministry of Labor), which registers and allocates longshore labor.
Port labor disputes are few, and stoppages have been rare for many years. On
the whole, port labor relations appear to be good.
3.17      Towage, pilotage and port communications with ships at sea are
adequate. Tugs are owned and operated by private firms. Pilot boats are
owned and operated by the pilotage Corporation under the Ministry of Commerce.
The Corporation is financed through tariffs for pilotage fixed by that Minis-
try; the Ministry also fixes towage tariffs.



3.18      Traffic in general cargo through Huelva amounted to 151,000 tons
in 1971 over the equivalent of four berths. The berths seem under utilized,
however, they are handicapped by their limited depth of about 6 m below
MLWST. In La Luz y Las Palmas general cargo traffic in 1971 amounted to
1.7 million tons handled over deep-water berths totalling 2,000 m; an output
of 850 t per m which is acceptable.
3.19      In both Huelva and La Luz y Las Palmas, where a substantial number
of fishing boats are served, the available berthage for the fishing industry
is insufficient. Reallocation of specialized zones in the two ports after
implementing the proposed project will improve the situation considerably.
IV. THE PROJECT
A.   Port Development Program
4.01      The 1972-75 Port Development Plan (Table 1) totals Ptas 20 billion
(US$310 equivalent). The methodology used in preparing the Plan is the same
as that used in the previous two plans and is acceptable. The Plan is suitable
and conducive to Spain's overall economy and the development of Spanish ports.
The amount of work already in progress or contracted totals Ptas 10.36 billion,
mainly for improving the ports of Avilas, Barcelona, Bilbao, Gijon, Santa Cruz
de Tenerife and Valencia (Map 10057); details of the new projects in these
ports are given in Annex 2. Development of Huelva and Las Palmas has the same
priority as the above major ports. These two ports were chosen for Bank fi-
nancing because they are located in the least developed regions of Spain.
The financing of the Plan will be as follows:
Financing Source               (Ptas Billion)
State Grants                        8.77
Ports internally-generated
funds                          8.00
External financing (IBRD Loan)      3.23
20.00
During negotiations an agreement was reached that the Government would review
the Port Development Plan from time to time and exchange views with the Bank
thereon.
4.02      The proposed project will:  (a) enable the ports of Huelva and La
Luz y Las Palmas to meet traffic demands up to 1980; (b) allow better alloca-
tion of specialized zones in the two ports; (c) permit adequately planned
future expansion in the two ports; (d) assist other main ports in meeting
forecast traffic by replacing old cranes; and (e) reinforce and consolidate
organizational and institutional reforms initiated during the first Bank loan.

B.   Project Description
4.03      The proposed project consists of:
At Huelva Port (MAP 10058)
(a) construction of a dike about 13 km long to prevent siltation
in the access channel;
(b)  deepening the channel from 8.0 m to 10.5 m below MLWST by
providing for the purchase of a suction-hopper dredger of
about 3,000 m3 capacity;
(c)  construction of a 900 m wharf of five berths - one for
phosphate three for other minerals and one for general cargo;
(d) procurement of quay cranes for general cargo and minerals
and installation of belt conveyor system for phosphate; and
(e) improvement of an access road to the new port facilities and
construction of connecting roads and railways to serve the
new industrial zotie in the port area.
More detailed information on Huelva project items is given in Annex 3.
At La Luz y Las Palmas Port (Map 10059)
(a)  extension of the eastern main breakwater by about 680 m, and
construction of two secondary breakwaters, each about 780 m long;
(b) construction of two petroleum piers for supertankers; and
(c) procurement of a container crane. The container wharf 500 m
long is now under construction and is scheduled for completion
in July 1974.
More detailed information on La Luz y Las Palmas project items is given in
Annex 4.
Quay Cranes
Procurement of 58 new quay cranes to replace 58 cranes 40 to
50 years old in nine major ports. Table 2 gives location, number
and capacity of cranes to be scrapped and those to be acquired.
C.   Cost Estimates
4.04      The total estimated cost of the project is Ptas 6,256 million
(US$96.90 million equivalent) with a foreign exchange component of about
US$53 million equivalent of which US$50 million would be financed by
the proposed loan. The project includes some complementary works (Table 3)



- 10 -
necessary to ensure its adequate utilization and cost Ptas 479.6 million
(US$7.42 million equivalent) with a foreign exchange component of US$3
million. Most of these complementary work are now being executed and will
be totally financed by the Government. Details of the cost estimate are
given in Table 4 and summarized below:

A,B,C & D
4.05      Cost estimates for civil works have been derived largely from
prices for similar works recently completed under Loan 429-SP. The local
cost includes domestic taxes and custom duties which the government does not
intend to waive. The foreign exchange component is based on the assumption
that a foreign contractor for civil works and a foreign supplier for equip-
ment will be awarded the contracts. However, local industries who manufacture
6 and 12 ton cranes are active and are expected to bid on the supply of these
items. Therefore, depending on the success of local bidders, the loan could
finance up to a maximum of about US$3 million equivalent in local currency.



- 11 -
Land needed for the proposed project in Huelva and La Luz y Las Palmas is
already owned by these ports.
4.06      Physical contingencies are: 15% for construction of the Huelva dike;
10% for other civil works in Huelva and La Luz y Las Palmas; and 5% for the
dredger and cranes. Price contingencies for both local and foreign costs are
annually 5% for Huelva civil works; 5.4% for La Luz y Las Palmas civil works;
6.5% for cranes; and 9% for the dredger. The forecast phasing of expenditure
during construction period given in Table 5 takes these contingencies into
account.
D.   Project Financing and Execution
4.07      The Ports Directorate will be responsible for the execution of the
project which will take 4-1/2 years, and is considered competent to do so.
Except for the Huelva dredger which will be designed and supervised by
consultants, the project will be designed by the Directorate's engineers;
they will also supervise construction. The Government will meet the local
currency cost of the project and such foreign exchange as may be necessary to
complete the project and its complementary works, partly from State grants
and partly from the port 's internally generated funds. A chart giving the
scheduled construction of the various items and delivery of equipment is
shown in Annex 5; this has been agreed with the Government. Following is
the financing plan of the project:

Ptas Million          US$ Million Equivalent Total

4.08      The cross-sections of the Huelva dike have been designed by the
National Hydraulic Laboratory (NHL) in Lisbon but the final alignment is
still being studied to ensure that channel maintenance dredging will be the
minimum possible. During negotiations the Government agreed not to start dike
construction until after Bank approval of the study which is scheduled for
completion in May 1973.
4.09      To facilitate dike construction, a road, two small fixed bridges
and one small movable bridge will be constructed to connect the Huelva road
system to the construction site; their design appears to be satisfactory and
the cost for their construction is included in the project. According to
Spanish internal navigation regulations, bridges built on navigable streams
should have a 30 m movable span and 12 m clearance above water level. However,



- 12 -
it was found that traffic in the stream to be crossed by the proposed road
does not justify constructing such an expensive span. During negotiations
the Government agreed to limit the span length to 6.0 m and its clearance
above water level to 5.0 m.
E.   Consultants' Services
4.10      During negotiation3 the Government agreed to employ naval architect
consultants acceptable to the Bank to design and prepare tender documents
for the dredger and supervise its construction.
F.   Procurement and Disbursement
4.11      All contracts for civil engineering works and procurement of equip-
ment in the project will be awarded on the basis of international competitive
bidding. The preferential agreement between Spain and the European Economic
Community (EEC) does not cover materials or equipment likely to be procured
from EEC for project execution. Consequently such materials and equipment
will be subject to the same customs duties as on materials and equipment
procured from other countries. For purposes of bid comparison domestic
manufacturers would be accorded a margin of preference by adding 15% of the
CIF cost or the actual custom duties, whichever is lower to foreign bids.
Imports into Spain are also subject to compensatory tax, the "Impuesto de
Compensacion de Gravamenes Interiores" (ICGI) designed to equalize fiscal
treatment, and hence competition, between foreign and domestic suppliers.
This tax is equal to the indirect tax levied on the local production of such
items manufactured in Spain. The ICGI has been accepted by the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) as a means of minimizing distortions
and discrimination in international trade and is not regarded by GATT as a
protective device. Accordingly, for purposes of bid comparison the CIF
price would be adjusted by adding not only 15% or the actual custom duties,
whichever is lower, but also adding the ICGI (the applicable rate of which is
12% for cranes and dredger). The ICGI has been taken into account in bid
evaluation under all previous Bank loans for transportation.
4.12      Disbursement for the civil works included in the project will be
on the basis of 45%, which represents the foreign exchange component of total
costs. For the dredger, which is not expected to be procured locally, and
consultants' services, disbursement will be on the basis of the actual foreign
exchange cost. For the cranes, disbursement will be on the basis of the CIF
price i- contract is awarded to a forei-n supplier or the ex-factory price
if the contract is awarded to a local supplier. The estimated annual project
expenditure is shown in Table 5 and, assuming loan effectiveness around
April 1, 1973, the estimated schedule of disbursements would be as shown in
Table 6. Any amount uns-ent on completion o& the -roiect will be used to
finance procurement of other quay cranes that mat be needed to re lace verv
old cranes in the nine ports referred to in para 4.03.

G.   Other Work Totally Financed by the Government (Table 3) (Ptas 479.6 million)
4.13      Deepening Huelva channel to 10.5 m below MLWST will be carried out
by the Government using the new dredger to be procured under the project.
The required deepening will be completed before the end of 1977.
4.14      In addition to the cranes included in the Huelva project (two 6-ton
and six 12-ton), another eight cranes (six 6-ton and two 12-ton) are now under
construction; all will be used for the proposed general cargo and industrial
berths. The latter eight will be used between 1973 and 1977 at the existing
general cargo berths in Huelva, after which date they will be transferred to
the new berths. During negotiations, the Government agreed that the cranes
will be transferred to the new wharf as soon as its construction is completed.
4.15      A container wharf 500 m long and a general cargo wharf 300 m long
are now under construction at La Luz y Las Palmas; they are scheduled for
completion in July 1974. During negotiations, agreement was reached with
the Government that it will complete these wharves, and their ancillary
facilities, by the above date.
4.16      By the closing date of Loan 429-SP (March 31, 1972), all work
included in that project was completed except for the mineral berth and its
mechanical handling equipment in Huelva. These remaining works are valued
at about Ptas 270 million (6% of the latest revised cost estimate). During
negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government that it will finance
and complete these two items before the end of 1973. Supplementary information
on Loan 429-SP is given in Annex 6.
H.   Ecology, Urban Development and Employment
4.17      Preliminary investigations showed that the proposed port expansion
in Huelva and La Luz y Las Palmas are not expected to have adverse effect on
the ecological conditions in the areas concerned. However, the Bank recom-
mended to the Government that it employ a competent authority in Spain to
investigate the matter more thoroughly. During negotiations agreement was
reached with the Government that the study will be undertaken before January
1, 1974 and that upon completion and, after consultation with the Bank, it
will implement all reasonable precautions suggested by the study.
4.18      The expansion conforms with the planned urban development schemes
for both cities. The new Huelva dike is expected to create, by accumulation
of deposits, a new sand beach about 10 km long south-east of Punta Umbria;
this would promote tourism in that area. When completed, the project will
provide additional regular employment in cargo-handling operations at the
two project ports in the same rate as that of traffic increase.

V. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
5.01      The Spanish economy is looking increasingly outward as its total
productive capacity increases and the range of productive activities widens.
Markets are being sought for exports and the diversification on the productive
and consumption base increases import requirements. To meet the needs of
rising overseas trade (including domestic traffic with the Canary Islands,
among other points) the Government's strategy is to provide port capacity and
equipment so that these needs can be met efficiently. The proposed project
fits well into this strategy and gives a satisfactory overall economic return
(ER) of 21%, which is well in excess of any estimated opportunity cost of
capital in Spain. The economic benefits will accrue to the Spanish economy
in the form of freight charges which can be expected to be lower than if the
investments in the proposed project were not made and the inevitable congestion
to shipping resulted. Project costs used in the economic analysis include cost
of design, supervision and physical contingencies (para 4.06).
5.02      At Iluelva, the investment in the sea dike, deeper channel, dredger,
new wharves, cargo handling equipment and improved road access for the port is
required to accommodate forecast annual growth in dry bulk and general cargo
of 12% which includes a transfer of some cargo-handling from private to public
port facilities (Tables 7 and 8). This growth has resulted from successful and
continuing Government initiative to attract industry and general economic activ-
ity to the region. The investment in the dike was shown in analyses to be the
minimum cost solution, compared with heavy maintenance dredging, to provide ac-
cess to the port for larger ships than can now enter (Annex 7). Justification
of the proposed dredger is given in Annex 8. An indication of the optimality
of the length of the new wharf with respect to minimizing total cost is given
by the analysis of construction cost plus ship waiting cost for different
lengths of wharf for forecast traffic in 1978 and 1980 (Annex 9).
5.03      An analysis of total project costs in Huelva and savings in shipping
costs with larger ships and less waiting time (Table 9) together with savings
on dredging costs over a period of 30 years yields an ER of 16%. Sensitivity
analysis of the ER showed a drop to 15% return if construction costs increased
15%; to 13% if the change to larger ships is 20% less than expected; and to
12% if the increase in costs and the reduction on large ships are combined.
Hence the investment is justified over a wide range of conditions.
5.04      The port of La Luz y Las Palmas, the only commercial port on the
island of Gran Canaria, serves both as an important bunkering port for vessels
in international trade and as a base for a large fishing fleet both Spanish
and foreign. General cargo traffic handled at the port is forecast to increase
at 7% annually (Table 10). Up to 1974 existing general cargo facilities can
provide service without excessive ship waiting time (see simulation results,
Annex 10). In 1974, Government financed wharves now being constructed will be
available and in combination with the Bank financed project, will provide
sufficient capacity to meet needs beyond 1980 at which time some 30% of general
cargo traffic (about 1 million tons) will be containerized. The economic in-
vestigation included the cost of breakwaters, petroleum pier and the container
crane being financed in part by this loan, together with all other Government
investments in creating the new basin.



- 15 -
5.05      A conservative analysis, taking as benefits only the savings in ship
waiting time for general cargo over a 30-year period, gives an ER on the whole
investment of 31%. Sensitivity analyses showed the investment justified over
a wide range of conditions as follows: a reduction in ER to 28% with an
increase in project cost of 15%; a reduction to 26% with a 20% decrease in
savings in ship waiting time; to 24% if the reduction in benefits and increase
in costs are combined; and to 23% if the annual traffic growth is 6% rather
than 7%. Additional benefits which would further enhance the economic return,
but which were not directly quantified, are: savings on cargo handling costs
with containers; increased revenue from increased bunkering traffic; improved
operations of the passenger terminal and the fishing terminal; and the value
to the economy of a naval repair yard to be established by a private company.
5.06      The investment in 58 replacement quay cranes in 9 different ports
(see Table 2 for location, number and capacity) yields an estimated economic
return of 18% over a 20 year period. The analysis treated the procurement
of these 58 cranes as one investment setting the capital cost against the
overall reduction in ship service time at all nine ports together with the
total savings in operating and maintenance cost (Table 11) for the traffic
forecast to be handled by quay cranes (Table 12). Sensitivity analysis of
the economic return showed the investment well justified with a reduction on
ER from 18% to 14% with a 15% increase in cost; and a reduction to 12% if
all benefits are reduced by 25%.
VI. FINANCIAL EVALUATION
A.   Past Earnings and Present Financial Position
6.01      The financial objective agreed to in the Loan 429-SP documents
(Annex 6) was to gradually reach, by 1973, a 5% rate of return on net fixed
assets in use at each of the project ports (i.e. 1% in 1969; 2% in 1970; 3%
in 1971 and 4% in 1972). This would have required general tariff level
increases of about 11% each year for eight successive years. In fact, al-
though some rates were increased in 1967, there were no further increases
until 1971 because of Government wage and price freezes in ports and most
other public services. Nevertheless, increased bunkering traffic following
the Suez Canal closure enabled Las Palmas to show satisfactory results until
1971 when wage and salary increases prevented attainment of the rate of return
target. However, the smaller port of Huelva was barely able to break even
in 1968 and 1969 and incurred a small loss in 1971 due also to wage increases.
The income accounts of the two project ports for the years 1968-71 are shown
in Table 13. Balance sheets as at December 31, 1971 (Tables 14 and 15) show
that neither port has so far generated any surplus funds to contribute to the
proposed project, either out of revenue surpluses or depreciation reserves.
B.   Future Earnings, Finance Plan and Financial Position
6.02      In August 1972 the Government decreed four annual tariff increases
for general cargo of 20% each year on imported foreign goods and 10% each
year on other goods except coastwise. Water, electricity and cargo-handling



- 16
equipment charges were also increased but tariffs on ships remain unaltered.
The rise in water, electricity and equipment rates is based on the cost of
providing these services. Merchandise tariffs, however, are already profita-
ble, whereas tariffs against ships are somewhat inadequate. (Examples of
principal tariffs as at July 1972 are shown in Annex 11). DPGMIS, while
acknowledging this fact, considers the shipping industry lobbies powerful
enough to resist any such increase. Consequently, the line of least resist-
ance was taken by increasing charges on merchandise only. The present tariff
levels will enable Huelva to meet the original 1973 5% rate of return target
in 1974 and increase the rate to 7.3% in 1977, with corresponding falls in
the operating ratio to 61%. At La Luz y Las Palmas the 5% rate of return
will not quite be achieved (the highest being 4.9% in 1977) because of the
Ptas 1,000 million increase in fixed assets in 1973 when the ongoing break-
water and other port works are completed and taken into service. Forecast
Income accounts for the years 1972-78, based on the present tariff increases,
are given in Tables 16, and 17 and summarized below. After completion of
the proposed project with related increases in fixed assets, but without
further tariff increases, the respective rates of return are expected to
fall in 1978 to 4.0% at Huelva and 4.3% at La Luz y Las Palmas. Such rates
of return, depending upon expansion needs at that time, will probably be
inadequate and further tariff revisions may be necessary in 1976/77 (para

6.03      The investment finance plans are summarized below from the Cash
Flow forecasts in Tables 18 and 19. During the construction period, 1973-
1977, Huelva and La Luz y Las Palmas would contribute 22% and 31% of total
investment costs respectively, while the Government would finance by direct
grant 28% and 41% respectively. The Bank loan would finance 50% and 28%.
Such finance plans are acceptable.

6.04      Ports legislation provides for the establishment of two funds out of
net operating revenue (para 3.07), (a) a working capital fund and (b) a
repairs and contingency fund. The balance remaining out of net operating
revenue may be retained for port expansion up to a limit yet to be prescribed
by the Government. Accumulations of funds beyond these limits are to be paid
to the public treasury. No appropriations to these funds or other distribu-
tions have yet been made, but it is anticipated they will start in fiscal
1972. By 1978, appropriations of profits are expected to be:

=                    __
Up to 1977, the net revenues will be almost entirely absorbed in financing
the project.  During negotiations an assurance was obtained that each of the
Ports of the Borrower would be allowed to retain all moneys set aside pursuant
to the Finances Law in its working capital and its repairs and contingencies
funds and to use such moneys as needed for purposes of carrying out the project
in respect of each such port and other planned expansion thereof.
6.05      The forecast Balance Sheets (Tables 14 and 15) do not show a very
satisfactory position during the construction period, since net current assets
are insufficient at both ports to cover the working capital and repairs and
contingency funds. However, the Government will provide any shortfall in
capital funds to finance the projects in the event of forecast surpluses
not being achieved or expenditures being required out of reserves. Since all
Government contributions, including the proceeds of the proposed Bank Loan,
would be in the form of equity capital and there is no third party borrowing,
neither port has any debt. In 1978, after completion of the projects, and
in the absence of further investments, the liquid position of each port will
improve and continue to do so.
C. Financial and Tariff Policy
6.06      The present analysis indicates that should further investments be
required in 1978 and immediately thereafter, a financial rate of return of 5%
on net fixed assets would be insufficient and that further tariff increases
would be necessary. During negotiations it was agreed that all necessary steps
will be taken to enable the following financial rates of return to be achieved:



- 19 -
(i) at Huelva not less than 3.5% in 1973, 5% in 1974 and 1975
and 5.5% in 1976;
(ii)  at La Luz y Las Palmas not less than 3.5% each year to and
including 1975, 4% in 1976 and 5% in 1977; and
(iii)  thereafter, such rates as shall be determined in consultation
with the Bank not later than June 30, 1976.
The above rates of return may seem to be relatively low, however, they are
justifiable because since about 45% of the project cost is for construction
of breakwaters and a sea dike, all do not earn revenue except in the long
run, and also because of the absence of debt service.
6.07      In order to comply with the rate of return covenant, it was also
agreed that the Borrower would, not later than January 1, 1977, introduce
at the Project Ports, and at the Ports of Barcelona and Pasajes, new tariffs,
complying with the Finances and Ports Laws, based on the cost of providing
individual services and facilities and taking into account the desirability
of (i) recovering at least the economic costs and (ii) ensuring that, so far
as is reasonable and practicable, the economic savings and benefits otherwise
accruing outside the Borrower's economy are recovered by the Borrower includ-
ing the savings and benefits enjoyed by foreign ships.
Insuranceis
6.08      There is lack of uniformity amongst ports in the type and extent
of insurance coverage. It was therefore agreed during negotiations that:
(a) competent insurance experts will be engaged to advise on insurable risks,
including third party liability, borne by the Ports, (b) the Project Ports
and the ports of Barcelona and Pasajes will insure, to the Bank's satisfaction,
against such risks and in such amounts as shall be consistent with sound
business practices.
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      Agreement having been reached on the principal issues discussed
in Chapters III, IV and VI, the project is recommended for a Bank loan of
US$50 million to the Spanish Government for a 17-year term, including four
years of grace.

SPAIN
APPRAISAL OF SECOND PORT PROJECT
Port Facilities at Huelva and La Luz y Las Palmas
A.   At Huelva
Background
1.        The area served by the port is limited and hardly extends beyond
the provincial borders. This limitation is attributed to the Portuguese
border being close to the west, the port of Sevilla to the east and the rela-
tively poor road connection with the interior. Sevilla is an important trade
center with a well-developed port for general cargo; it is, therefore, in a
stronger competitive position for the areas to the north and east than Huelva.
However, Huelva port has better accessibility than the inland port of Sevilla
(90 km from the ocean on Guadalquivir River which has continuous siltation
with heavy annual variations), thus its competitive position is more favor-
able for bulk cargo.
2.        The hinterland is largely agricultural.  Mining is also important,
especially that of pyrites. Pyrite reserves have been estimated at 300-500
million tons, representing a big percentage of the world's known reserves.
Mianufacturinig is concentrated near the city of Huelva, in particular adjacent
to the port, and comprises food and mineral processing, fertilizers, cellulose,
textiles and chemicals. The Rio Gulf refinery, with an initial annual capac-
ity of two million tons of crude oil, helped in increasing port traffic by
22% annually between 1965 and 1971. According to the agreement with the Gov-
ernment, at least one million tons of oil products must be sold outside Spain,
thus adding to port traffic. Fisheries are of major importance. Most of the
fish are moved fresh to Madrid, Sevilla and Valencia and some are exported
frozen.
3.        Since it is not expected that road and rail connections to the
interior will be sufficiently improved in the near future to appreciably
change the port's present service area, Iluelva will remain principally a
bulk cargo and industrial port. Under the 1964-67 Development Plan, Huelva
was selected as one of seven development areas in Spain. Since then, port
traffic has included a continuously increasing volume from new factories,
mainly chemical plants. The future of the port will thus largely depend on
the adequacy of its facilities for serving bulk cargo ships. Increasing ac-
cess channel depth to meet large bulk cargo ships' drafts is, consequently,
very important.



ANNEX 1
Page 2
The Channel
4.        The main drawback to the port is the limited depth of 8 m below
MLWST in the access channel. A maximum tidal range of 3.7 m allows safe
entrance of ships with greater draft at high tide. The channel, 100-200 m
wide and 15 km long, is subject to heavy siltation caused by eastbound
littoral currents and overflow at sand shoals which now protect the harbor
entrance to a certain degree. The location and levels of these shoals change
considerably from one year to the next, especially after extraordinary heavy
storms which occur every three to four years. In the last four years, 8.5
million m3 of dredging increased the channel depth from 6.0 to 8.0 m below
MLWST. Of the 8.5 million m3, 3 million increased the depth and 5.5 million
were for maintenance. Unless the channel is protected against sand sedimenta-
tion by the dike included in the project, this costly continuous maintenance
dredging will be increased considerably when the channel is deepened from 8.0
to 10.5 m (from 1.4 million m3 annually to 3 - 4 million m3 annually).
Berthing Facilities
5.        The following table gives berthing facilities now available in the
port. In addition to existing berths, two berths 12 m deep for mineral hand-
ling are now scheduled for completion in September 1972.

for Huelva channel.
B.   At La Luz y Las Palmas
Background
7.        La Luz y Las Palmas is the major port of the Gran Canaria Island.
It also serves as the main shipping center for some of the smaller islands
in the Canary group.  Because of its favorable location on the world ship-
ping routes, and the available depth in the harbor of up to 19 m, it became
a major bunkering port. Passenger ships also bring large numbers of pas-
sengers and tourists. With the growing size of oil tankers, the port has
also become an important transshipment center for oil products, where super-
tankers transfer their loads into smaller vessels for further distribution
in Europe and Africa.
8.        Fisheries have always been important in the island's economy and
in total port traffic. Fish are generally cleaned and frozen on board Spanish
and foreign fishing boats operating at great distances from their home ports.
Consequently, the port is increasingly being used for cold-storage of fish
or direct transshipment into refrigerated cargo vessels, as well as for
bunkering and taking in supplies, changing of crews, and repairs.
9.        Agriculture is an important activity in the islands.  The main
crops are bananas, tomatoes, sweet potatoes, sugar cane, cereals and tobacco.
Soil conditions are generally good and there is still arable land available
but on the island of Gran Canaria, the cost of fresh water has been a limit-
ing factor to agricultural expansion. The development of cold storage facil-
ities has opened up better marketing possibilities for tomato exports and,
to a lesser extent, bananas, by reducing damage caused by temperature change.
Banana containerization, now being experimented within Central America, will
probably be adopted in La Luz y Las Palmas if it is proved to be successful.
10.       Gran Canaria has pleasant beaches and a good climate throughout
the year which are attracting an increasing number of tourists, especially
during the European winter.



ANNEX 1
Page 4
11.       The future of the port as a station on the main international ship-
ping routes will largely depend on the adequacy of its facilities for servic-
ing ships. So far, the port has offered good services as regards bunkering
and shelter, but because it competes with other nearby ports, it will stay
ahead only by providing adequate facilities.
Berthing Facilities
12.       The following table gives berthing facilities now available in the
port. In addition to existing berths, three container berths 12 m deep and
totalling 500 m long and two general cargo berths 12 m deep and totalling 300
m long are now under construction and are scheduled for completion in July 1974.

area of 76,500 m , all in Twderats to good conditions; (b) eight cold stores
with a total capacity of 67,000 m ; (c) two grain silos totalling 60,000 tons

APPRAISAL OF SECOND PORT PROJECT
Details of Development Plan (1972-75) for Major Ports
Aviles
1.        Aviles serves an important area in the north with several steel
mills and factories. Its development plan calls for deepening and widening
the entrance channel to permit passage of 25,000 dwt ships. Dredging work
is being carried out by a contractor at a total cost of Ptas 620 million.
Maintenance dredging is done by the port's dredger.
Barcelona
2.        The development program now being implemented costs about Ptas
1,200 million (Table 1), and consists of the following:
Ptas Million
Extension of eastern breakwater                300
Construction of a container berth              160
Construction of a terminal for TIR /1          350

Bilbao
3.        The amount allocated in the Plan (Ptas 1.0 billion) will be mainly
for:  (a) constructing a deep-water pier for containers and bulk cargo (now
under construction); (b) constructing a pier for liquified gas imports; and
(c) deepening the eastern harbor to 14 m below MLWS.



ANNEX 2
Page 2
4.        In addition to the above plan, the PETRONOOR refinery (a combina-
tion of American Gulf and Spanish private capital) is investing Ptas 2.1 bil-
lion to construct a new breakwater and two berths for supertankers, 150,000
dwt and 500,000 dwt. The breakwater has just been contracted and work is
scheduled for completion within four years. Water depth in the new harbor
will be 30 m.
Gijon
5.        Gijon, 15 km from Aviles, serves the same industrial complex.  Work
is already in progress at a total cost of Ptas 2.6 billion of which Ptas 1.35
billion was spent during the last development plan. Development includes:
(a) extension of the main breakwater to increase the harbor area and thus
allow for expansion of port facilities to meet the steel industry's require-
ments; and (b) procurement of mechanical equipment and conveyors for unload-
ing about five million tons of minerals annually. After breakwater extension,
the maximum size of ships calling will increase from 40,000 dwt to 100,000
dwt.
Santa Cruz de Tenerife
6.        The work, now under construction for about Ptas 1.1 billion, is
for the construction of a new basin containing 10 deep-water berths, mainly
for general cargo.

7.        Work is already in progress at a total cost of Ptas 1.20 billion
of which 0.64 billion was spent during the last development plan. Work mainly
includes: (a) construction of a breakwater to increase the port water area
(Ptas 0.75 billion); and (b) construction of a berth 600 m long with along-
side depth of 14 m, for general cargo and containers (Ptas 0.40 billion).

A.   The Dike
1.        Loan 429-SP included construction of a two-berth petroleum pier
and a two-berth mineral wharf. These facilities were designed to receive
ships of 12 m draft when enough water depth was available in the access
channel. However, the channel is subject to heavy siltation which limited
its depth to 8.0 m below MLWST with continuous maintenance dredging. Early
in 1970 the Government contracted the National Hydraulic Laboratory (NHL)
of Lisbon to study this problem by a reduced scale model. The Bank agreed
to NHL's terms of reference and retained a hydraulic engineering consultant
to assist in and review the study.
2.        The study concluded that the most suitable solution is to build a
dike about 13 km long and to 8 m depth below MLWST at the western end of
the Odiel River. The dike will reduce siltation in the channel to the mini-
mum possible and allow deepening the channel to 10.5 m below MLWS in this
phase. The dike's cross-sections for different depths were designed by NHL
and tested in a wave flume channel. The design was based on a wave height
of 4.5 m and a tidal range of 4.0 m, which is the most unfavorable condition
liable to occur. Although NHL's study is scheduled for completion in May
1973, the alignment of the dike could be determined by the end of 1972.
Construction of the dike is scheduled for completion late in 1977.
3.        The dike is designed similar to a breakwater of the mound type (a
core of quarry rock protected by suitable sizes of natural stones and con-
crete blocks). Because of the limited water depths in most of the dike's
location, work has to be conducted from onshore outward. To facilitate dike
construction, a new road (about 11 km long) will be constructed to connect
the Huelva road system to the construction site.
B.   The Dredger
4.        Deepening of the channel to 10.5 m Welow MLWST will be carried out
mainly by the suction-hopper dredger (3,000 m capacity) to be procured under
the project. There are three small dredgers currently being used in Huelva
port for maintenance dredging, but only one of them (MOP-DI) is suitable for
channel deepening and it will be so used to assit the larger dredger when it
is procured.  The proposed dredger is scheduled to reach Huelva in April 1976
and deepening would be completed eirly in 1978, a few months after completion
of the dike.  About five million m 3will be dredged to achieve the required
depth, of which about 3.6 million m will be carried out by the new dredger.



ANNEX 3
Page 2
5.        Huelva coast is subject to occasional extraordina5y storms (with
cycles of about 3 to 4 years) which add about 1.0 million m of siltation
when they occur. If such a storm occurs during 1976-77 the required depth
might be achieved late in 1978.
6.        From 1978 on, depending on the results achieved from the dike and
the future trend in shipping, the dredger will either be used in further
channel deepening in line with the available designed depths of the new
general cargo and industrial wharf and of the existing petroleum piers and
mineral berth; or transferred to other ports to assist in deepening and
maintenance dredging (Annex 8).
C.   General Cargo and Industrial Wharf
7.        The wharf, comprising five berths, is 900 m long of which 200 m
is for phosphate traffic and 700 m for other mineral traffic and general
cargo traffic. It consists of a reinforced crncrete deck 21.5 m wide,
designed to carry a live load of 8 tons per m , and is supported by pre-
stressed concrete piles. The back filling, about 200 m wide, will connect
the wharf to the shore, and be used as a storage area. This area will be
served by six railway tracks connected to the main trunk line.
8.        In 1971 the Government contracted NHL to carry out a hydraulic
model study to find the appropriate distance between the shore and wharf's
edge that would not alter the Odiel River's regime. The study is scheduled
for completion in March 1973, however, sufficient information is already
available to arrive at a cost estimate with reasonable accuracy.
9.        To handle phosphate imports, the project includes procurement and
installation of two 400 tons per hour loading towers, an underground belt
conveyor system, stacker and loaders. To handle different types of dry bulk
and general cargo traffic (on four berths), eight cranes of 6 tons capacity
each, and eight cranes of 12 tons capacity each, will be used.

A.   The New Basin
1.        Loan 429-SP included construction of a breakwater to create a basin
for fishing vessels east of the existing port. However, during construction
the Bank did not object to keeping fishing facilities in an area 7 to 10 m
deep within the existing port and realigning the new breakwater to create a
new basin for container and general cargo traffic, bunkering, and ship-repair
facilities. Under Loan 429-SP, about 2,270 m of the main breakwater was com-
pleted. The new basin has depths ranging between 15 and 40 m. This basin,
when completed by the breakwater extension to be financed under the proposed
loan, will allow better reallocation of specialized zones (general cargo,
dry bulk, passengers, fish, oil, bunkering and ship-supply, ship-repair and
military).
B.   Breakwaters
2.        In 1968, the Goverrrient retained the consulting engineering firm
SOGREAH (France) to carry out a hydraulic model study for determining the
most suitable alignment for the breakwater extension that would reduce wave
height inside the new basin to the minimum. SOGREAH submitted their report
in 1971 and their findings were approved by the Bank. They recommended ex-
tension of the breakwater in the same direction to a total length of about
2,950 m, and construction of two secondary breakwaters, each about 750 m
long. The proposed project includes completion of the main breakwater and
construction of the two secondary breakwaters; the outer one is of the mound
type whereas the inner one is of vertical reinforced concrete caissons to
allow its use for berthing ships for bunkering. The breakwater extension,
also of the mound type, was designed by SOGREAH.
C.   Petroleum Piers
3.        The proposed project also includes construction of two piers mainly
for bunkering of supertankers up to 280,000 dwt. The piers could also be
used for crude oil transshipment. For the design of the fender system for
these piers, the results of the study now underway for similar facilities
in Bilbao will be adopted.
D.   Containers and General Cargo Berths
4.        In 1970, the Government arranged with a local contractor to con-
struct a container wharf 500 m long and a general cargo wharf 300 m long,
with an alongside depth of 12 m; the wharves will be capable of receiving



ANNEX 4
Page 2
ships up to 38,000 dwt. The wharves are of concrete blocks resting on a
rock foundation. Work is scheduled for completion in July 1974 and the
Government will also finance all ancillary works including two transit sheds,
paving, water supply, electricity, crane tracks, etc.
E.   Ship-Repairing Facilities
5.        In the proposed replanned port facilities, all ship-repairing fa-
cilities will be transferred to the new basin. A new company "ASCANSA" has
been formed to finance and operate the repair facilities. In mid-1973, it
intends to start building several slipways and a Syncro-Lift of 7,000 tons
capacity to repair ships up to 180 m long. Construction of a dry dock is
not anticipated at this stage.

2.        The project was to modernize and develop selected Spanish ports to
meet the requirements of increasing traffic. It comprised: (a) civil en-
gineering works at the project ports of Barcelona, Huelva, Pasajes and La
Luz y Las Palmas; (b) provision of cranes and other operating equipment for
these ports; (c) provision of cranes and miscellaneous equipment for 17 other
ports; and (d) provision of floating and port operating equipment for general
use in Spanish ports. The project also comprised various works at the project
ports which were not financed under the Loan.
Special Covenants
3.        The Government was required to:
(a) enact legislation for "Principles of Autonomy" not later than
August 1, 1966;
(b) make at least one of the project ports autonomous not later
than December 31, 1967;
(c) enact a Port Finance Law applicable to all Spanish ports;
(d)  establish a modern commercial and, to the maximum extent
practicable, mechanized accounting system and cause books
and accounts to be audited annually by independent commer-
cial accountants acceptable to the Bank;



ANNEX 6
Page 2
(e) establish a costing system and determine the cost of pro-
viding the individual services at each project port; and
(f) take all necessary steps, including adjustment of rates, to
provide each of the project ports with sufficient revenues
to cover expenses and earn a return on the value of net
fixed assets in use of about 0.5% in 1968, 1% in 1969, 2%
in 1970, 3% in 1971, 4% in 1972 and at least 5% in 1973.
Situation on the Closing Date
4.        In general the Ports Directorate, the contractors and the suppliers
of equipment carried out the work in an acceptable manner.
i         All 121 contracts have been awarded and 119 are completed.  The
remaining two items of the project are to be financed and completed by the
Government. Completion of the project was delayed, principally by contract-
ing and procurement procedures. This was considered acceptable because the
work involved 121 international and local tenders. Consequently, the Bank
agreed to extend the closing date twice, from September 30, 1969 to March 31,
1971 and then to Mfarch 31, 1972. The Bank could have endorsed the project
if the delay had been forecast during appraisal.
6.        The latest revised cost estimate was 11% higher than originally
estimated. This was mainly due to devaluation of the Spanish Peseta in
1967 and the delay in project completion.
7.        By the closing date, all of the Loan amount was disbursed except
for US$30,186.06 equivalent, which has been cancelled.
8.        In 1971, total traffic in the project ports reached 30.4 million
tons as compared to the appraisal forecast of 32.2 million.
9.        In 1971, all project ports failed to obtain the financial return
target due to inadequate tariffs, however, substantial tariff increases have
been introduced starting August 1, 1972 and are expected to improve the ports'
financial position considerably.
10.       The balance sheet indicates a generally sound financial position
in each port.
11.       Huelva was granted autonomy in 1969.
12.       Considerable progress has been made in establishing accounting and
costing systems. Procedural conformity is needed and recommended to be a
condition of the proposed second loan.



ANNEX 6
Page 3
13.       Independent commercial auditors have been recently appointed to
audit 1970 and 1971 accounts of the project ports.
14.       Considerable progress has been made in achieving financial and
institutional changes, and continued Bank association with further measures
now agreed to be taken can assist Spanish ports in fully achieving the targets
set in 1965.

APPRAISAL OF SECOND PORT PROJECT
Port of Huelva: Justification of Dike Construction
1.        The construction of a dike to protect the access channel at the
port of Huelva, and the deepening of the channel from 8.0 m to 10.5 m below
MLWST, would yield substantial savings in sea transport costs due to the use
of bigger ships for bulk cargo traffic. It may be technically possible to
achieve the same objective, i.e., increasing the depth in the access channel,
by continuous dredging only. To justify the construction of the dike, a com-
parison has, therefore, been made of the cost of these two solutions.
2.        The attached Table shows the cost flows of the two alternative
solutions. The following figures and assumptions have been used:
(a)  Presently, about 1.3 million m3 have to be dredged each year
to maintain the access channel at Huelva at its present depth
of 8.0 m;
(b)  about 2.2 million m  of sand would have to be dredged to achieve
a depth of 10.5 m (capital dredging);
(c) the studies carried out by the National Hydraulic laboratory
in Lisbon on the Huelva dike (see para. 4.08 and Annex 3)
suggest that if the access channel were deepened to 10.5 m
and no protection dike were constructed the annual volume
of dredgiig to maintain the 10.5 m depth would be about 3.5
million m ;
(d)  past experience at Huelva has shown that exceptional storms
occur every three or four years causing additional siltation
in the channel of at least 1 million m . This would be avoided
with the construction of the dike;
(e)  the exceptional siltation of about 1 million m  would decrease
the depth in the channel by about 1 m, and it has been conserva-
tively estimated that it would take about 6 months to dredge
this volume of sand. During this time, the larger bulk cargo
ships that would normally be used for traffic to and from
Huelva could either not enter the port, or enter it only
partially loaded; the benefits of the deepening of the chan-
nel, i.e. a reduction in shipping costs, could, therefore,
not be fully realized;



ANNEX 7
Page 2
(f)  it has been assumed that maintenance dredging would be dSne
with the port's own equipment at a cost of Ptas 30 per m
while capital dredging wou~d be carried out by contractor
at a cost of Ptas 55 per m ;
(g) finally, the studies by the Lisbon Laboratory suggest that
an extension of the dike from 8 m below MLWS to 10 m below
MLWS may be required after about 15 years.
3.        The attached Table shows that the total cost of Solution II (deep-
ening of the access channel by dredging only, without construction of a dike)
discounted to present values at a rate of 10% over a period of 40 years, the
conservatively estimated economic life of the dike, would be about 8% higher
than Solution I (construction of the dike) as proposed under this project.
4.        A sensitivity test shows that if the cost of dike construction
were 10% higher than estimated, both solutions would be more or less equiv-
alent. A cost overrun is, however, unlikely since detailed engineering for
the dike has been completed and a 15% physical contingency allowance is in-
cluded in the cost estimate used. If, on the other hand, exceptional silta-
tion occurred every three instead of every four years as assumed above, or
if annual maintenance dredging without the dike had to be 4 million m  in-
stead of 3.5 million m , the cost difference would increase to 17% in favor
of the proposed Solution I. Construction of the dike, which is the most
satisfactory solution technically, is, therefore, also the most economical
one.
5.        An additional argument in favor of dike construction is that it
will allow the safe use of several km of the left side of the Odiel River
for possible future port expansion and other developments.  This length of
the river is presently subject to heavy waves and strong currents which also
make channel navigation difficult.

APPRAISAL OF SECOND PORT PROJECT
Port of Huelva: Justification of Dredger
1.        The propoSed dredger which would have an average annual output of
about 3.0 million m will have a full time schedule as soon as it arrives to
Huelva port in April 1976.
2.        As shoJn in Annex 3, para B, the proposed dredger would dredge 3.6
to 4.6 million m to deSpen Huelva channel from 8.0 m to 10.5 m below MLWS at
a cost of Ptas 30 per m including depreciation (see Annex 7, para 1 f). Be-
yond 1978 the dredger will either be used in further channel deepening in line
with the available designed depths of the new general cargo and industrial
wharf and of the existing petroleum pier and mineral berth, or transferred
to other ports to assist in deepening and maintenance dredging, mainly in
Bilbao, Sevilla and Santander.
3.        During 1969-1971 the average anr ual maintenance dredging in the
above three ports was about 4.0 million m . In Bilbao and Santander, dredg-
ing requirements will increase considerably as from 1975 in conjunction with
expansion program planned in these two ports to meet future traffic demands
(Table 1). As for the river port of Sevilla, the construction of the Sevilla-
Bonanza canal will permit to achieve a greater depth in the river access chan-
nel which in turn will result in an increased volume of maintenance dredging.
Annual mainteIance dredging in the above 3three ports is expected to reach
6.0 million m in 1975 and 7.7 million m in 1980.
4.        Dredging fleet owned and operated by Spanish ports is hardly capa-
ble of meeting maintenance dredging requirements. It includes 28 units of
which 13 are 40 to 75 years old and are scheduled to be scrapped in the next
five years (see attached Table). The operating costs of such dredgers are
very high, failures are frequent and periods of stoppage for repairs are
very long. The proposed dredger, after completing its assignment in Huelva,
could also assist in filling part of the gap caused by scrapping these very
old dredgers.
5.        In case the ports could not carry out needed maintenance dredging
with their own dredging equipment, work would have to be Sarried out by con-
tractors which is more costly (estimated at Ptas 60 per m which is conserva-
tive for maintenance dredging) due to contractors' higher mobilization and
overhead costs, higher depreciation rate and their profit margin. Since
there are no dredging companies established in Spain, contractors would have
to go to foreign companies. The financial savings that could be achieved
by using ports own equipment (estimated at Ptas 90 million annually) would
thus represent savings to the Spanish economy.

6.        The investment in the new dredger yields an estimated economic
return of 35% over a 20 year period. Sensitivity analysis of the economic
return showed the investment well justified with a reduction on ER to: (a)
25% if the dredger's estimated capital cost is increased by 15%; (b) 28% if
its estimated dredging cost is increased by 25%; and (c) 18% if the con-
tractor's estimated dredging cost is reduced by 25%.

APPRAISAL OF SECOND PORT PROJECT
Port of l{uelva: Analysis of the
Length of the Project Berth
1.        Traffic at the new general cargo and industrial berth is estimated
to be about 3 million tons in 1978, the first year during which the berth
would be fully operational, rising to about 3.4 million tons in 1980 - of
this, 1.8 million and 2.0 million tons, respectively, would be imports of
phosphate. The specialized installations for unloading phosphate on the
proposed wharf will have a capacity of 800 tons per hour (a theoretical
maximum capacity of 2.4 million tons per year assuming 3,000 hours opera-
tion per year or 12 hours per day 250 days per year). Also it is expected
that phosphate would be shipped in 25,000 dwt ships with a length of 190 m.
Adding a safety margin of 10 m, 200 m of berth length is, therefore, re-
quired to handle the phosphate traffic.
2.         The remaining traffic in 1978 would consist of about one million
tons of miscellaneous dry bulk cargo and 188,000 tons of general cargo. The
corresponding figures for 1980 are 1.25 million tons of dry bulk and 191,000
tons of general cargo. To determine the length of berth required to handle
this traffic, port operations were simulated in a computer model for 1978
and 1980 traffic volumes and varying lengths of berth. Following are the
assumptions used in this model:
Type of ships:             I - 25,000 dwt ships of 190 m length for about
80% of dry bulk cargo;
II - 6,000 dwt ships of 120 m length for 20% of
dry bulk cargo and general cargo.
Number of Ships:  1978:  40 Type I and 221 Type II ships
1980:  50 Type I and 233 Type II ships
Service Times: 7.4 days for Type I and 2.4 days for Type II ships
Distribution of Ship Arrivals: Regular for Type I, random for Type II ships
Costs per ship day in port: US$2,500 for Type I
US$1,250 for Type II
Length of Wharf:  Between 500 and 900 m, with 50 m intervals.



ANNEX 9
Page 2
3.        The result of the simulation exercise is shown in the attached
graph. Ship waiting times would be excessive at a wharf length of only
500 m, but would decrease rapidly with increasing wharf length and be nearly
zero at about 800 m of berth length. The sum of construction costs and the
cost of ship waiting times would reach a minimum with a berth length of about
675 m at 1978 traffic volumes and with a length of about 725 m at 1980 traffic
volumes. A wharf of 700 m (900 m including the 200 specialized quays for
phosphate traffic) is, therefore, adequate. A reduction of the length of the
wharf by 100 m would mean savings in construction costs of about US$.9 million,
but waiting time costs would be about US$2.8 million higher with 1978 traffic
and over US$5 million higher with 1980 traffic volumes. An increase in wharf
length by 100 m would mean an additional USS1 million in construction costs
but the decrease in ship waiting time costs that could be achieved would be
only about US$.6 million for 1980 traffic volumes and even less for 1978
traffic. The proposed total wharf length of 900 m is, therefore, close to
being optimal for the traffic volumes forecast.

APPRAISAL OF SECOND PORT PROJECT
Bases and Assumptions Used in Financial Projections
1.        That (a) State grants to the extent forecast as necessary shall
be made to the project ports to sufficiently augment
internally generated resources to enable the ports to
carry out the projects in accordance with the time
schedule forecast in this appraisal.
(b) the grants shall be non-repayable and interest-free
equity contributions.
2.        That the ports will annually contribute 4% of gross operating
revenue to Central Administration costs incurred by DGPMS.
3.        That the ports will annually contribute 1% of gross operating
revenue to subsidize the operations of minor ports (CAGP).
4.        That revenue from new concessions in La Luz y Las Palmas between
1972 and 1978 will accrue in accordance with the attached forecast
prepared by the port and based upon land requests already received.
5.        That the dredger provided for Huelva under the project will be
used exclusively for capital dredging during the latter half of
1976 and the whole of 1977 and 1978. Consequently, appropriate
running costs and depreciation have been capitalized and the
asset treated as a non-operational asset during those years.
