                              United Republic of Tanzania
          Marine and Coastal Environmental Management Project — MACEMP
                   Aide Memoire – Implementation Support Mission
                                 February 6 - 10, 2012



1.      A World Bank team visited the United Republic of Tanzania to undertake an
Implementation Support Mission for the Marine and Coastal Environmental Management Project
(MACEMP or “the Project?) from the 6 to 10 of February, 2012. The mission comprised Ann
Jeannette Glauber (TTL, Senior Environmental Specialist), Anna Corsi (Institutional and Land
Specialist), Dave Japp (Fisheries Management Specialist, Consultant), Dinesh Aryal (Senior
Operations Officer), Xavier Vincent (Senior Fisheries Management Specialist) and Tobias von
Platen-Hallermund (Junior Professional Officer). The mission met with authorities and technical
staff from the MACEMP MMT (MACEMP Management Team), Deep Sea Fishing Authority,
Fisheries Departments of Mainland and Zanzibar, Tanzania Fisheries Research Institute
(TAFIRI), Mainland’s Marine Parks and Reserves Unit (MPRU), and Zanzibar’s Marine
Conservation Unit, World Wildlife Fund, and District Representatives from Rufiji. The mission
also met with representatives of the private sector, NGOs (WWF), technical staff from other
World Bank-financed projects focusing on fisheries in the region (the Southwest Indian Ocean
Fisheries Project (SWIOPF), the Kenya Coastal Development Project (KCDP), and community
representatives. A detailed list of mission participants and mission agenda is included in Annex
A.

2.      The mission’s objectives were to: 1) review progress on ensuring the sustainability of the
Deep Sea Fishing Authority (DSFA), including the finalization of the DSFA Business Plan, its
feasibility and operationalization; 2) discuss activities for project closure and a potential follow-
on operation; and 3) carrying out a field visit to Rufiji to assess progress on the construction of
the fish landing site. The mission took place in Dar es Salaam, Rufiji and Zanzibar. The Mission
wishes to thank the Government of Tanzania, and in particular, Dr. Kassim Gharib Juma, the
Principal Secretary of the Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries in Zanzibar, Mr. Yohana Budeba,
Deputy Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries Development on the
Mainland, for their hospitality, cooperation and support for the successful completion of the
mission.

3.      This Aide Memoire summarizes the principal conclusions of, and agreements reached
during the mission (see Table 1).

Principle Conclusions

4.      Deep Sea Fishing Authority: The mission participated in a one-day workshop focused on
the DSFA performance to-date and future plans and sustainability (see Annex A: agenda and
participants and Annex F: presentations from the Mission). Participants included managers and
technical staff from DSFA, fisheries ministries, research institutions, civil society and the private
sector.


                                                 1
5.      The workshop discussed the DSFA Business Plan, noting that it was overly ambitious,
particularly regarding staffing plans and anticipated work program. The mission agreed that by
the next mission the DSFA would develop a sustainability strategy, comprising a phased
approach, linked with clear mission, vision and milestones, and associated budget requirements.
Core elements to be included in the sustainability strategy should include the following: 1.
Establishment of appropriate licensing fees relative to the the value of resources exploited. Such
fees could be based upon the WWF-supported Value Chain Analysis. 2. A strategic and
comprehensive approach toward all DSFA activities including: (i) MCS, (ii) fisheries
management (e.g. FADs, deep sea fisheries management plan), (iii) policy development as well
as harmonization of legal and institutional framework, (iv) training of DSFA staff, (v)
management-targeted research, and (vi) communication among fisheries management and
research institutions (e.g, TAFIRI and IOTC). 3. Better articulation of DFSA’s short-and
medium-term financing needs and gaps. It was agreed that by March 15 the DSFA team will
prepare a concept note including a schedule and outline of what is the work to be carried out to
develop said sustainability strategy.

6.      With regard to research, TAFIRI presented aspects of their ongoing work including tuna-
directed research and historical surveys undertaken in URT waters. In this regard the mission
noted that some key studies on fish stocks in URT waters, which are indicators of project
success, are expected to be completed by the next Bank mission. The mission further emphasized
the need to ensure that TAFIRI’s work responds to the research needs of fisheries managers,
including the DSFA. To this end, the mission recommended that the URT’s PS of Fisheries be
responsible to ensure smooth communication between DSFA and TAFIRI.

7.      The mission also reviewed the project indicators related to the DSFA, approved in July
2011, to reflect progress made towards meeting project indicators. As shown in Annex B, the
review highlighted that of the two PDO-level indicators related to the DSFA – (i) URT Revenue
generation to EEZ Authority from offshore fishery (US$/yr); and (ii) Number of daily-
observations of vessel catch and effort entered into URT Fisheries management System) –the
indicator on observations has already been met, while that relating to the government revenues is
unlikely to be achieved.

8.     The mission was informed that the Deep Sea Fisheries Act remained to be ratified by the
House of Representatives in Zanzibar. The PS Ministry of Fisheries and Livestock Development
Zanzibar assured the mission that this will not inhibit the activities of DSFA. The mission urged
the Government of Zanzibar to expedite the ratification of the Deep Sea Fisheries Act.


Potential Follow-on Operations:

9.      Regional Fisheries Project: The mission presented the concept for a regional project on
South West Indian Ocean Fisheries Governance and Shared Growth Project (SWIOFGSGP),
which is currently being developed with the Governments of the South West Indian Ocean
Fisheries Commission’s (SWIOFC) member countries with World Bank support. The proposed
project would support activities to improve regional coordination and management of tuna and
other fisheries, together with nationally-focused activities to promote the sustainable use and
economic development of marine fisheries. The GOT confirmed that there was strong interest in

                                                2
pursuing Tanzania’s participation in the SWIOFGSGP in order to consolidate many of
MACEMP’s priority activities related to management and sustainable use of deep sea and coastal
fisheries.

10.     Regarding funding for SWIOFGSGP, the GEF has preliminarily agreed to provide US
$5m for related activities in Tanzania. However, such funds require at least an additional $15m
in cofinancing, which could be provided by National or Regional IDA allocations. The mission
explained that in order to move forward with preparation of the SWIOFGSGP, the URT’s
Ministry of Finance would need to: 1) express their interest in pursuing preparation of such a
project; 2) request use of National IDA funds in support of such a project, and 3) request
additional Regional IDA funds be allocated for such a project. Once such a request is received
and endorsed, a formal preparation mission could be scheduled.

11.     The mission explained that the request for allocating Regional IDA funds for such an
effort would be strengthened were the World Bank to receive a joint letter from the Governments
of SWIOFC’s member countries, particularly Seychelles, Comoros, Mozambique and Tanzania.
The mission also encouraged the four countries to meet jointly to develop such a request, for
which MACEMP funds could be used if available. The Bank will circulate a draft letter and
concept note by April 30 which will provide the basis for discussion among the countries prior to
the meeting, and will inform the Government about the date of the meeting as soon as it is
confirmed.

12.    Lastly, regarding the GEF funding, the mission was informed that a revised letter of
endorsement from the GEF Focal Point, Dr. Julius Ningu, Director of Environment, VPO-E, is
being requested by the MoLFD and would be provided to the World Bank upon receipt.

13.      Sustainable Coastal Tourism and Adaptation Project: With MACEMP ending, there is a
need for identifying those project-supported areas that remain priority issues, and for which
sustainable funding sources are not currently in place. While the mission focused on a follow-on
operation for MACEMP’s fisheries-related elements, there is likely a need for continued support
for other core activities (e.g. Marine Protected Areas). The World Bank agreed to follow up with
a letter to the URT PS Finance to discuss potential avenues for future support.

14.     Implementation Completion Report: The mission discussed the guidelines for the
Implementation Completion Report (ICR), which is a requirement of World Bank-financed
projects after closure (see Annex C). The mission provided guidance as to the scope of the ICR,
explaining that in accordance with the project legal agreements, the GOT is required to prepare a
final project evaluation report by August 30, 2012 – the Project’s Closing Date. Such a final
project evaluation report will serve as a core component of the ICR prepared by the Bank. The
Bank provided the MACEMP team with the ICR and GEF terminal evaluation guidelines as well
as the GEF Biodiversity and International Waters Focal Areas Tracking Tools templates.

15.    The mission reviewed and finalized the TOR for the M&E/ICR study (see Annex D). The
version should be used for contracting, and as such, this Aide Memoire shall constitute the No
Objection to such TOR.




                                               3
16.     Continuity of Key Project Staff: The mission was informed that the contract for key
project staff ends in June 2012. Given that the project closes in August, and the Government may
request an additional four months grace period to complete any project-related payments and
documentation, this contract expiration represents a significant threat to successful project
completion. As such, the mission encouraged the GOT to extend the key staff’s contract until
December 2012 on an exceptional basis. The mission also confirmed that project funds could be
used to cover consultancies for work done prior to the August 31, 2012, Closing Date.

17.     Financial Management and Audits: The mission agreed that in accordance with Section
4.01 of the Credit Agreement, the borrower shall establish and maintain a financial management
system, including records and accounts, and prepare financial statements in accordance with
consistently applied accounting standards acceptable to the Association, adequate to reflect the
operations, resources and expenditure related to the Project and achievement of its indicators. In
this regard, the DSFA agreed – that as part of the overall Project audits – to submit quarterly
financial statements within 45 days after each quarters end. The financial statements should
constitute (i) Income Statement, (ii) Statement of Financial Position and (iii) Notes to the
Accounts. As such, the mission agreed that by April 30, the DSFA would submit a draft format
for such quarterly statements for World Bank No Objection.


Other Issues

18.     Pending Tasks for Closure. The mission noted that several tasks related to project
sustainability are still pending, and must be finalized prior to the closure of the project. 1. The
mission agreed that a sustainability plan/exit strategy, including a 5-year action plan for MPAs,
as discussed during the November 2011 be prepared and discussed as part of the next (May)
mission. 2. The inventory of project outputs along with the specific products obtained (e.g.
electronic copies of any project-supported studies, list of degrees supported and their subjects,
etc.) must be completed and forwarded to the Bank before the next mission. 3. The mission again
recommended that all key project outputs be posted on the appropriate government website so as
to make the results available for future activities. 4. MACEMP present a list of training activities
(long term courses, short term courses, and study tours) financed under the Project for staff
working in the respective Fisheries Ministries. It was agreed that by May 1, MACEMP will
provide the details of the training supported under the project, including i) the name of individual
staff that benefitted from training, ii) the subject of the training for each individual, iii) the a
mount spent for each individual training, and iv) the purpose and outcome of each study tour.

19.     Safeguards. The mission again requested that by May 1 the GOT forward to the Bank a
summary of the environmental licensing requirements for all civil works supported through the
project, together with a copy of the relevant EIA for each site.

20.     Procurement: The mission agreed that updated project Procurement Plans, including only
packages that can be implemented by the project closing date, would be submitted to the Bank
for their review by April 30.

21.     The mission discussed the status of various critical consultancies, highlighting the need to
fast-track their contracting. As discussed during the previous mission, the MMT will need to

                                                 4
closely monitor the processing of remaining packages to ensure that the goods and services are
delivered by the project closing date. Any works, goods and services not delivered by the project
closing date will not be eligible for project financing.

22.    Reallocation of funds: The mission noted that some of the disbursement categories have
already reached 100% of the allocated amounts while others had low disbursement rates. The
mission again recommends that consideration be made to undertake another reallocation exercise
immediately. A formal request, clarifying the changes needed, will have to be sent to the Bank
for approval by April 30.

23.     Field Visit: The mission conducted a field trip to assess progress in the building of the
Nyamisati fish landing site. Overall the mission was impressed with the advanced stage of the
construction of the new landing site. However, the mission noted that some key elements (e.g.,
installation of freezer room and power generation, and remaining pavement and construction
and/or repair of the boat jetty) were still to be completed. The mission requested that by May 1
the GOT clarify whether project funds are supporting: (a) installation of the freezer room; (b) the
alternative power generation (e.g., a generator); and (c) remaining pavement and construction
and/or repair of the boat jetty. A report of the field visit findings is included in Annex E.

24.     Next Mission. In order to facilitate Bank-Government cooperation in the final project
stages, it was agreed that a monthly meeting would be held every third Wednesday of the month
to evaluate project progress and issues. It was agreed that the next and last formal
implementation support mission would tentatively take place on or around the last week of May,
2012.

25.     Disclosure: Under the Bank’s Access to Information Policy introduced on July 1, 2010,
the Aide Memoire may be made public, if the client and Bank agree. The disclosure of this Aide
Memoire was discussed and agreed to with project counterparts led by Dr. Omar Ali Amir,
Deputy Principal Secretary, Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries Development Zanzibar, at the
wrap-up meeting that took place on February 10, 2012, at the Zanzibar Beach Resort Hotel, in
Zanzibar. The client and Bank agreed that the Aide Memoire would be classified as Public.

 FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF THE OVERALL PERFORMANCE AND RESULTS OF
MARINE AND COASTAL ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PROJECT (MACEMP)

BACKGROUND

1. Introduction

MACEMP is a 6-year project developed by the United Republic of Tanzania with a focus
on sustainable management and utilization of the coastal and marine resources.
Supported by the World Bank and the Global Environmental Facility, the project was
developed as a result of an extensive planning process within Tanzania, seeking to
adopt sustainable use and practices for the coastal and marine environment. The goal of
MACEMP is to improve management and use of Tanzania’s Exclusive Economic Zone
(EEZ) ― the 200 nautical mile ocean space which is Tanzania’s territory under the Law
of the Sea Convention —and its coastal resources. Key elements of the project include
establishing and strengthening a common governance regime for the EEZ; supporting a
comprehensive system of managed marine areas in the territorial seas, building on
Integrated Coastal Management strategies; and providing coastal communities with
access to economic opportunities to improve their livelihoods.

2. The Project Objective

The project has developmental and global environmental objectives. The project
developmental objective is to strengthen the sustainable management and use of the
Borrower’s Exclusive Economic Zone, territorial seas, and coastal resources resulting in
enhanced revenue collection, reduced threats to the environment, better livelihoods for
participating coastal communities living in the Coastal Local Government Authorities, and
improved institutional arrangements. The Project Global Objectives are to develop an
ecologically representative and institutionally and financially sustainable network of
Marine Protected Areas, and to build capacity in the United Republic of Tanzania to
measure and manage trans-boundary fish stocks.

3. Main components of MACEMP

MACEMP has four main components as follows:

  i. Sound Management of the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), which aims to
     establish and implement a common governance regime for the EEZ that
     contributes to the long-term sustainable use and management of EEZ resources. A
     shift from an open-access towards a managed-access near-shore regime that
     protects biodiversity, while providing additional development opportunities for local
     populations through greater involvement in local resource management decisions
     is the expected outcome for this component.

                                           26
       ii. Sound Management of the Coastal Marine Environment and intends to
           establish and support a comprehensive system of Managed Marine Areas in the
           territorial seas, building on ICM strategies that empower and benefit coastal
           communities.


      iii. Coastal Community Action Fund whose objective is to empower coastal
           communities to access opportunities so that they can request, implement and
           monitor sub projects that contribute to improved livelihoods and sustainable
           marine ecosystem management. The expected outcome is a reduction in income
           poverty, and increased participation of rural communities in sustainable resource
           management decisions and benefits.


      iv. Project Implementation Support, which specifically includes a comprehensive
          Monitoring and Evaluation (M & E), Strategy and Development Communication
          Strategy support project coordination unit which facilitates project implementation
          support.

 4. General objectives of this assignment
 The purpose of the assignment is to:

i.       Provide a complete and systematic account of the performance and results of the
         project, and


ii.      Capture and disseminate experience from the operation design and implementation
         so as to improve the design and implementation of future interventions through
         lessons learned.


 Specifically, the assignment will include:

       i.    Assessment of the project design—objectives, components, and
             organization—including its realism and the degree of complexity; were the
             project’s objectives and components clear, practicable, and feasible within
             its time frame? Were the capacities of the executing institutions properly
             considered when the project was designed? Were lessons from other
             relevant projects properly incorporated in the project design?

      ii.    Assessment of risks and mitigation measures identified during project
             design – were risks correctly identified? Were identified mitigation
             measures appropriate? Were there additional risks that affected project’s
             implementation and outcomes? And were they appropriately addressed?

      iii.   Description of the factors that contributed to successful implementation or
             gave rise to problems and actions taken in response to problems;

                                               27
 iv.    Assessments of the project’s M&E system including an assessment of the:

        a.   M&E design—the extent to which adequate indicators were identified
             to monitor progress toward PDO/GEO using effective collection
             methods, given the specific PDO/GEO and already available data;

        b.   M&E implementation—the extent to which appropriate data was
             actually collected using appropriate collection methods (to ensure
             data quality), including an assessment of whether or not there has
             been adequate periodic oversight of activities during implementation
             to establish the extent to which inputs, work schedules, other
             required actions and outputs have operated according to plan; and

        c.   M&E utilization— the extent to which appropriate data was evaluated
             and used to inform decision-making and resource allocation, including
             an examination of the extent to which MACEMP immediate and
             development objectives were aided by the M&E systems engaged.

  v.    Assessment of the outcome of the operation against the agreed
        objectives (PDO and GEO) - the extent to which the operation's major
        relevant objectives were achieved efficiently as measured against the indicators
        outlined in the Project’s Results Framework. This will include:


        (a) Assessment of the project’s contribution to global environmental objectives;
        (b) Review and evaluation of the qualitative and quantitative aspects of the
            project achievements;
        (c) Comparison of plans for outputs, terms and costs with the results and
            analyze the efficiency of project implementation -- Was the project the least
             cost option?


 vi.    Critical analysis of the implementation and management arrangements of the
        project, including an assessment the project’s effect and impacts (intended or
        unintended, positive or negative) on institutional development, particularly
        longer-term development of the country’s capacity and institutions;


vii.    Assessment of the sustainability of the project’s interventions, including a
        description and an evaluation of the proposed arrangements for future operation
        of the project;


viii.   Listing and documenting of lessons learned (positive and negative) concerning
        project design, implementation and management;


                                           28
        ix.   Assessment of project relevance to national priorities;


        x.    Complete the GEF Tracking Tools: (i) GEF Biodiversity Management Effectiveness
              Tracking Tool (METT) -- Assessment of MPA management effectiveness; and (ii)
              GEF International Waters (IW) Tracking Tool --Assessment of regional aspects,
              stress reduction aspects and socio-economic & environment aspects (see
              Attachment 1).


        xi.   Evaluation of the borrower’s own performance during the preparation and
              implementation of the operation, with special emphasis on lessons learned that
              may be helpful in the future;

       xii.   Evaluation of the performance of the Bank, any co-financiers, or of other
              partners during the preparation and implementation of the operation, including
              the effectiveness of their relationships, with special emphasis on lessons learned.

       Project performance will be measured based on the Project’s Results Framework, which
       was revised in June 2011, which provides clear performance and impact indicators for
       project implementation along with their corresponding means of verification. Success
       and failure will be determined in part by monitoring changes in baseline conditions.



       The consultant will coordinate and collaborate with other ongoing studies (socio-
       economic impact and environmental impact especially).

Annex E: Summary of Field Trip to Inspect Rufiji (Nyamisati) Landing Site


The team visited the Nyamisati landing site on 7 Feb 2012. The following summarises the main
findings of the team:

      The landing site construction appears about 75% completed – most elements (buildings,
       paving, fences etc.) are still under construction. The overall impression is that it is a well
       located facility and is a much-needed facility for the fisher community in the area.
      Electricity wiring is being installed but no power supply from the national grid is likely in
       the future. The alternate power supply is expected to be provided by an on-site generator
       - it was not clear to the team, however, if and when this will be done or who will fund it
       (is it part of a MACEMP contract already procured?).
      The fish processing shed is incomplete – it comprises four tables – water is still to be
       provided through tanks at the top of building with a pump supplied by the community.
      The fish processing shed has a paved path leading directly down to water adjacent to
       fishing village and current slipway – this will provide fishers with direct access to the fish
       processing shed.
      This shed also has one store room and a room that is designated as a freezer room (-40
       0
         C?). There is no evidence that once it is built, who will be responsioble for maintaining
       it.
      The whole area is paved, has a security gate (“askari station?), one small office with store
       and toilet and another building comprising toilet only.
      The old jetty is in poor condition and is a dangerous landing facility for fishers and
       commercial vessels operating from Mafia;
      The mission observed plans indicating that MACEMP would repair or construct
       alternative structures on the current jetty – this is much needed but it was not clear if this
       is part of the current contract. Clarity is needed on this – the plans suggest it is part of the
       MACEMP contract but the MACEMP team indicated this was not the case.
      The expected completion of the site may take a bit longer. Although the mission was
       informed that it would be done in the next five months. The mission noted that unless it is
       closely monitored, it could take well beyond the current closing date of the project (Aug
       2012).
      The intertidal area adjacent to the slipway and jetty on both sides is badly eroded –
       mangroves are collapsing and the integrity of the bank on the edge of the water suggests
       both erosion due to rising sea levels and human-induced impacts;
      The intertidal area next to the slipway is polluted and smelly with signs of organic waste.
       Although the mission was provided with an EIA certificate, it was not provided with the
       actual assessment. The mission requested to get a copy of it as the EIA would provide
       information on the state of the jetty and environmental impacts on the surrounds.
      The mission noted that there seemed to be lack of awareness about the landing site
       among the fishers. The mission suggested that the government team do more out reach
       regarding the purpose of the facility.
      After discussing with fishers, the mission noted that there seemed to be a gap in the
       knowledge in the fish species and optimal size for harvest among the fishers. For
       example, the catch per unit of effort has decreased while the size of the fish has
       significantly decreased. There is also no incentive for releasing undersize fish. In this
       regard, it would be good for government to have some knowledge sharing exercise
       including some materials in local language (e.g., size limit, spawning period, types of
       species,etc.).
