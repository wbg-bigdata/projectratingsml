MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
AND THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN AND CREDIT TO
THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
FOR THE SICHUAN PROVINCIAL HIGHWAY PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan and
development credit to the People's Republic of China is submitted for
approval. A proposed loan for US$75.0 million would be for 20 years maturity
including 5 years of grace at the Bank's standard variable interest rate and a
credit for SDR 36.1 million (US$50.0 million equivalent) would be on standard
IDA terms with 35 years maturity would help finance the expansion and
improvement of the highway network.
2.        Background.  The transport system in China has been severely taxed
by the pace of recent economic development, and capacity constraints are
evident in all modes. The most serious transport need is for dramatically
expanded road capacity, especially in rural areas where increased agricultural
and small-scale industrial production have created an urgent demand for better
farm-to-market transport services. Road transport will also face a growing
share of the demand for passenger transportation from the increasingly mobile
population. In the railway subsector, the network capacity has severely
hampered delivery of energy supplies (i.e. coal), and even with recently
initiated investments in rail line electrification and new line construction,
it will take several years to alleviate bottlenecks between major mining areas
and coastal cities. China also needs to substantially expand its port and
waterways facilities to relieve the growing hindrance to external trade caused
by inadequate berth capacity and container handling capacity. China's Seventh
Five-Year Plan (1986-90) recognizes all these sectoral needs. By the end of
the plan period, freight traffic is projected to be 45% higher than in 1985,
and passenger traffic 60% higher, with a disproportionately greater share of
the increase falling on road transport. To meet th.ese needs, substantial
investments are envisioned, especially in highway network expansion, new rail
lines, double-tracking and electrification of existing lines, and more berths
at coastal ports. The Plan also proposes to secure efficiency gains in
transportation from operational improvements; these include the development of
integrated transportation networks, in particular for coal transportation and
for import/export trade, and technological improvements such as container
handling facilities and intermodal transport centers. To facilitate these
developments, the Plan envisions significant institutional changes in the
sector, including and extension of the policy of separating the functions of
Government from those of operating enterprises and delegating authority to
local managements.  The Bank fully subscribes to the Government's objectives
for development of the transport sector and is supporting its initiatives with
financial and technical assistance. Three railway projects (Loans 2394-cHA,
2540-CHA and 2678-CHA, and Credit 1680-CHA) are assisting the expansion of
capacity on key routes and the manufacture of electric locomotives, passenger
coaches and signalling equipment. Four port projects (Loans 2207-CHA, 2689-
CHA, 2907-CHA and 2977-CHA) will effect improvements at Tianjin, Shanghai,



- 2 -
Huangpu and Dalian Ports. The two Bank Group financed highway projects in
China (Loan 2539-CHA/Credit 1594-CHA and Loan 2811-CHA/Credit 1792-CHA)
involves the construction and improvement of national, rural roads and the
first expressway in China.
3.        While all the transport modes in China are in urgent need of expan-
sion and modernization, road transport presents the most difficult
challenge. Road freight traffic has been increasing at about 17% per annum
frow 1980 to 1986 mainly due to the burgeoning market economy, and passenger
traffic is growing at about 15% per annum. Road congestion was already a
serious problem in the early 1980s, and near major cities has now grown
worse. Increased road capacity is urgently needed. Furthermore, of the
approximately 942,000 km in 1985 only some 195,000 km, or 21%, have asphaltic
or concrete pavement. These pavements are generally of poor quality; most
have exceeded their design life and are deteriorating rapidly with the
increasing traffic. Accordingly, the highway mode is receiving increased
attention under the Seventh Five-Year Plan (SFYP). The SFYP for the highway
subse.tor is to upgrade at least 80,000 km of existing road, and to construct
about 60,000 km of new roads of which 1,580 km would be Expressway or Class
One standard roads.
4.        The main objectives for highway development in the 1980s are to
provide adequate capacity in the heavily congested corridors, to upgrade and
improve the eyisting network, and to expand the network in remote rural
areas. The proposed 340km Chengdu-Chongqing Road is part of the plan for high
standard road investment in Sichuan Province. The proposed program for eval-
uation and strengthening the paved roads in Sichuan serves the objective of
upgrading and improving the existing poor quality and low standard paved road
network. The proposed rural road improvements serve the objective of rural
road network expansion and rural development. There is also an urgent need in
the province for more modern techniques in the planning, design, construction
and maintenance of roads.
5.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank supports the government's
objectives and initiatives for development of the transport sector with both
financial and technical assistance to remove the transport bottlenecks imped-
ing economic growth. The strategy for the Bank's involvement in the highway
subsector is to meet the most urgent needs of road network expansion and to
support a program of studies on key policies issues. Bank's involvement in
the highway subsector, particularly in terms of policy, institutional and
technical matters under the first and second projects, aims at helping to
modernize the subsector by bringing the Bank's experience to bear on the
problems and by expediting the introduction of advanced technology to solve
them; ongoing studies in these projects cover important problems related to
roads financing, road safety, road congestion and the methodology for evaluat-
ing existing road pavements. The proposed project, besides helping to alle-
viate congestion on this most congested corridor of Sichuan Province, would
continue Bank's support in these matters and encompass new tasks related to
road pavement strengthening and planning. The project is one of the four
highway projects currently being prepared to focus Bank assistance at the
level of four provinces simultaneously.



6.        Project Objectives.  The existing Chengdu-Chongqing highway is now
heavily congested. The proposed project would help expand transport capacity
in this important corridor between the provincial capital of Sichuan and the
major industrial center and river port in the province. The rural road
program includes the improvement of two roads, one in Ya'an prefecture and one
in Mianyang prefecture--two of the poorest areas in Sichuan province. The
project would also address the following specific policy, institutional and
technological objectives: (a) improvement of road planning techniques through
the preparation of a road data bank; (b) evaluation of existing paved roads
and preparation of a pavement strengthening and maintenance management
program; (c) strengthening highway research; (d) assistance in staff training
program; (e) assistance to modernize design, construction, and materials
specifications and contract documentation; and (f) carrying out a road safety
program.
7.        Project Description.  The Sichuan Provincial Transport Department
(SPTD) and the Chongqing Municipal Government would be responsible for carry-
ing out the project under the overall supervision of the Sichuan Provincial
Government. The project components are: (a) construction of a 340 km high-
way, comprising 88 km of Class I standard road near Chengdu and Chongqing and
252 km of Class II standard road, connecting the provincial capital of Chengdu
and Chongqing, the third most highly populated municipality in China and the
largest economic and trade center of southwest China; (b) improvement of the
rural road network in Ya'an and Mianyang prefectures; (c) evaluation of the
paved roads and preparation of a program for strengthening betterment and
maintenance; (d) staff training; (e) assistance to SPTD in improved road plan-
ning including setting up a computerized road data bank; and (f) purchasing
equipment for (g) road management, operation and maintenance; and (h) highway
research laboratory.
8.        Schedule A shows the estimated project costs and financing plan.
Schedule B procurement methods and estimated disbursements. Schedules C and D
show a timetable for project processing and statement of Bank Loans, IDA
Credits and the IFC operations for China, respectively. Maps showing the
Sichuan Provincial Transport Network and the Chengdu-Chonqging Highway are
attached. A Staff Appraisal Report, No. 7168-CHA, is being distributed
separately.
9.        Agreed Actions.  Agreement was reached during negotiations with
Sichuan Province to: (a) implement in Sichuan province the findings of the
road safety study done by Ministry of Communications (MOC) under the first
Bank's highway project (Loan 2539/Credit 1594); and (b) carry out the road
pavement evaluation, road data bank, and staff training programs according to
terms of reference and timing agreeable to the Bank. During negotiations
assurances were obtained from Sichuan Province that resettlement under the
project would be done in accordance with the plan agreed with the Bank Group.
10.       Benefits.  On many sections of the existing road, traffic already
exceeds capacity and congestion is a serious problem leading also to increas-
ing accident rates. Economic benefits under the proposed project are expected
mainly from vehicle operating cost savings due to: (a) distance saving;
(b) road quality improvement; and (c) congestion and accident reduction.  The



- 4 -
ERR for the Chengdu-Chongqing highway would be 27% and for the rural roads the
ERR would range from 17% to 21%.
11.       Risks.  There are no major risks foreseen in the project.
Consultants, financed by the United States under its Trade Development Program
(TDP), have reviewed the project design and cost estimates and have helped
prepare bid documents. Thorough field surveys and subsurface explorations
have been carried out. Adequate and suitable materials will be available for
road construction and no special problems are expected for the tunnel works.
Although the new highway passes throu-h difficult terrain and includes several
tunnels and large bridges, the sequence of work has been carefully planned and
early construction of key sections by force account will facilitate work on
adjacent portions of the project. This will reduce the risks of delays in
construction.
12.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank Group and recommend that the Execu-
tive Directors approve the proposed loan.

/a As credits are denominated in SDRs (since IDA Replenishment VI), undisbursed SDR
credit balances are converted to dollars at the current exchange rate between the
dollar and the SDR. In some cases, therefore, the undisbursed balance indicates a
dollar amount greater than the original principal credit amount expressed in dollars.
Notes:  (1)  The status of the projects listed in Part A is described in a separate report
on all Bank/IDA financial projects in execution, which is updated twice
yearly and circulated to the Executive Directors on April 30 and October 31.
(2) Subsequent to the above data of Statement A, a loan of $63.0 M and a credit
of SDR 19.8 were approved for the Huangpu Port Project, and a credit of
SDR 123.8 was approved for the Third Rural Credit Project.
