INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO IRAN
FOR A FISHERIES PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to Iran for the equivalent of US$12.5 million to help finance a fisheries
project. The loan would have a term of 14 years, including four years of
grace, with interest at 8 percent per annum. The proceeds of the loan would
be on-lent to the Agricultural Development Bank of Iran (ADBI) at 8 percent
per annum and to the Southern Fisheries Company (Shilat Jonoub) at 8-1/4
percent interest per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic report entitled "Current Economic Position and Pros-
pects of Iran" (R71-129) was distributed to the Executive Directors on June 1,
1971, and an updating Memorandum (R73-74) was distributed on March 26, 1973.
A Basic Economic Mission visited Iran in September/October 1973. Volume I,
the Main Report (378a-IRN) of the mission, was distributed to the Executive
Directors on June 17, 1974. Volumes II and III are being finalized. Coun-
try data sheets are attached as Annex I.
3.        During the 1962-72 period Iran has been able to achieve an average
annual growth rate of about 11 percent in real GNP. The boom in oil rev-
enues, which increased sixfold from about $400 million in 1962 to about $2.5
billion in 1972, has been an essential factor underlying this performance.
Part of the receipts from oil has been absorbed by defense spending and
other current expenditure, but a major part has been utilized by the Gov-
ernment to finance investment in economic infrastructure and a rapidly grow-
ing, modern industrial sector. Domestic capital formation rose from 22 per-
cent of GNP in 1968 to over 25 percent in 1973. The oil receipts also en-
abled the Government to borrow abroad on a large scale and enabled develop-
ment to proceed, at least until the past two years, with relative price
stability, because the ready availability of foreign exchange allowed the
Government to use import policy as an anti-inflationary device. However,
largely because of increases in import prices, the consumer price index
rose six percent in 1972 and an estimated 11 percent in 1973.
4.        The sustained tempo of economic activity has been accompanied by
substantial changes in economic structure. The share of agriculture, which
accounted for 33 percent of non-oil GDP in 1962, fell to 20 percent in 1972,
while the share of manufacturing increased from 15 percent to 20 percent over
the same period. Employment in agriculture, as a proportion of the total
active population, declined from 52 percent to 40 percent, while industrial
employment rose from 15 percent to 21 percent. In 1962, 35 percent of the
population lived in urban areas; in 1972 the figure was 42 percent.



- 2 -
5.        But rapid growth has also highlighted the problems of income dis-
tribution and regional development, because different socio-economic groups
and geographic areas have not received the benefits of development equally.
Consequently, there are large contrasts in the consumption per head in dif-
ferent regions. Increases in real income have accrued to only about half
the population over the past ten to fifteen years. While large cities are
equipped with modern social and economic infrastructure, in most villages
progress has consisted mainly of the greater availability of a small range
of cheap manufactured products and the provision of part-time social welfare
facilities such as health clinics and primary school classrooms. The majority
of Iran's 60,000 villages still do not possess electricity, piped drinking
water, graded roads or other communications. In the medium-size towns the
situation is better and there is little apparent dissatisfaction with the
pace of progress, but there is a growing sense that places such as Kerman,
Kermanshah and Hamedan, have great potentialities which can now be more
fully exploited for the benefit of the local people. In the larger urban
centers, there is little or no open unemployment, and underemployment lhas
also been reduced in recent years. Nevertheless, in the towns as a whole
there is still a considerable number of poor households, though not as many
as in the rural areas where average income levels are only 20 percent of the
average urban incomes.
6.        The Government has long aimed at a more balanced development, but
only recently has a serious commitment been made to redress some of the in-
equalities in income distribution. It is now officially recognized that
there is a need to develop wider domestic markets for the products of in-
digenous manufacturing in order to maintain industrial growth rates; the
Government also desires to disperse migration to a larger number of cities
so as to avoid excessive concentration which is already causing substantial
congestion costs in major centers such as Tehran. Some progress has been
made in establishing decentralized poles of development, and a number of
important administrative and organizational changes have recently been in-
troduced. At the center, the Government's administrative machinery is now
generally well-organized, but it has been recognized that there is still
a need to strengthen provincial and local authorities in order to promote
development in less advanced regions.
7.        Rapidly growing oil revenues have enabled the Government to pursue
a highly expansionary economic policy and have also relieved the fiscal au-
thorities of any sense of urgency in establishing a more flexible system of
domestic resource mobilization. While increases in revenues from sources
other than oil, particularly direct taxes, have kept pace with GNP, it has
been expenditure policy which has mainly determined the level of public
savings; in particular, defense and security spending, which constituted
over half of the increase in current expenditures during the period 1967-
1972, has risen rapidly. Consequently, the growth in oil revenues did not
reduce the Government's deficit as much as might have been expected. In
addition, the Government has resorted to substantial borrowing from abroad.
As of December 1973, external debt outstanding was about $7.4 billion, of
which about $4.0 billion was disbursed; about 60 percent of this debt was



- 3 -
held by governments, private debt owed to foreign suppliers and private fi-
nancial institutions made up 30 percent, and the Bank accounted for the re-
maining 10 percent.
8.        The Fifth Plan, which came into effect on March 21, 1973, envisaged
a total investment program of Rials 2,460 billion (roughly $36 billion equiv-
alent), out of which Rials 912 billion was in the private sector and Rials
1,548 billion was for public development expenditures (including Rials 760
billion, or nearly half, in agriculture and the social sector). Following
the increase in oil prices during October 1973, the overall target for the
public development spending of the Fifth Plan was revised to Rials 1,909
billion (about $28 billion equivalent). Planners indicated that some 20
percent of the proposed program would have to be financed from foreign
sources but the situation changed radically with the further upward revision
of oil prices in December 1973. On the basis of present prices, oil revenues
during the Plan period could total as much as $68 billion (compared with es-
timates of $23 billion a year ago, on which the Plan was based). The ori-
ginal Plan had assumed oil revenues amounting to $3.1 billion in 1973 and
to $3.7 billion in 1974. It now appears that oil revenues were possibly in
the order of $3.9 billion in 1973 and will rise to as much as $18 billion
in 1974.
9.        The prospect of extremely high oil revenues over the coming years
has transformed both the short-term and the longer run prospects for the
balance of payments, as well as Iran's plans for development spending,
domestic resource mobilization and external borrowing. Almost overnight,
Iran changed from a capital-importing country to become a capital-exporting
country which has already indicated its willingness to provide financial
assistance both to developing and advanced countries in the new world
situation. However, development does not occur overnight. Iran still
faces the challenge of raising living standards equitably across the nation
and of providing the appropriate administrative and policy framework for
establishing a viable economy in the years towards the end of the century
when oil could play a less important role.
10.       During the period of the Fifth Plan, the Government has the unique
opportunity of being able to continue its rapid modernization of the economy
while at the same time ensuring that less-privileged Iranians are provided
with the means and the incentives to move from traditional, low-productive
occupations into more productive fields. This means, first, the spread of
high quality education to all corners of the land. Secondly, it means more
widespread provision of health and other social facilities. Thirdly, it im-
plies a greater decentralizatior. of economic activity and the faster growth
of cities and regions outside Tehran. Fourthly, it involves a commitment to
transform traditional methods of agricultural production while encouraging
further progress in commercial agriculture. And finally it implies the
stronger development of a basis for providing new sources of foreign ex-
change earnings, such as higher exports of manufactured goods, non-oil
minerals, petrochemicals or financial services.



-4-
11.       The projected current account surpluses also mean that the present
external debt no longer constitutes a problem. It could be paid off in any
number of ways, including complete redemption in one lump sum, without af-
fecting balance of payments equilibrium in the short or long run. By the
same token, there will no longer be any real need to borrow from abroad,
although there will continue to be a need for various kinds of technical as-
sistance. In other words, this new situation resolves almost completely any
debt problems that Iran may previously have had. Indeed, Iran is more likely
to become a net lender - and a "terminating borrower" from IBRD - than to con-
tinue to rely on foreign financial support to maintain the very high import
growth rates characteristic of recent years. There is a strong possibility
that capital movements will increasingly take place in response to market
incentives as in most industrial countries. When that happens, the rate of
long-term capital inflows will be more in the nature of an index of economic
performance than an indicator of Iran's ability to maintain balance in its
external accounts. This index will reflect, among other things, the poten-
tial growth of the domestic market and of exports of products other than oil.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN IRAN
12.       The Bank has made 32 loans to Iran, amounting to $1,170.5 million
(net of cancellations), of which $547.4 million has been disbursed and $228.9
million repaid by the end of July, 1974.   On May 16, 1974, the Executive
Directors approved three loans for ports, power and industrial credit projects
in the amount of US$148 million. These loans were signed on June 13, 1974,
but are not yet effective. On August 13, 1974, the Executive Directors ap-
proved a third loan for agricultural credit to ADBI of US$40.0 million.
This loan will be signed shortly. Annex II contains a summary statement of
Bank loans and IFC investments as of July 31, 1974, and notes on the execu-
tion of on-going projects.
13.       Until four years ago Bank lending to Iran, which began in 1957, had
been mainly for roads, irrigation, and industrial credit. However, since 1969,
lending increased rapidly (from $70 million in FY69 to $223 million in FY74),
and has also been greatly diversified to cover power, telecommunication, ports,
pipelines, agriculture, education, population, and urban transport.
14.       The first IFC investment in Iran was made in 1959 for a ceramic
tile plant.  Since June 1969, IFC's activities in Iran have expanded rapidly
and it has made seven investments in a steel products company, pulp and paper,
carbon black manufacturing, synthetic fibers, food products, and automobile
manufacturing. As of July 31, 1974, total gross IFC investments in Iran
amounted to US$41.3 million.
15.       Before the recent changes in the oil sector the Bank had planned
to maintain during the next few years a high level of operations in Iran.
These plans have now been reconsidered following a series of discussions
held in Telhran in January and February, 1974. First, the Iranian authorities



have confirmed their desire to continue an active association with the Bank
because of the technical assistance and institutional building benefits that
they would obtain through project loans for high priority sectors requiring
substantial structural changes and administrative and financial improvements.
The volume of lending would be much smaller, however, than previously contem-
plated. Secondly, a new financial relationship has been worked out with Iran,
which would become a net lender to the Bank. As a step towards achieving this
objective a first loan of $200 million from the Government of Iran to the Bank
was signed on March 22, 1974. Further loans to the World Bank are likely to
follow. Apart from this type of lending, the Government has agreed to "off-
set" periodically by additional loans to the Bank any future commitments the
Bank would make to Iran. Thus the three loans approved on May 16, which con-
cluded fiscal year 1974 lending programs, will be offset by a loan from Iran
of US$150 million which has been negotiated and will be presented shortly to
the Executive Directors.
16.       The thrust of the Bank's activities - lending operations as well as
technical assistance - over the next two or three years would give special
emphasis to a more balanced regional development of Iran and would aim at
supporting the diversification of the economy to enable a smooth transition
towards an industrial and modern society. The Bank activities should concen-
trate mainly on agriculture and rural development, education, population and
nutrition and urbanization, and to a lesser extent on industry and mining.
17.       Improving the living conditions of the rural population is an im-
portant objective and the IBRD Agricultural Task Force has been set up to
this end. During its first year of operation in Iran, the Task Force has
concentrated on developing a knowledge of Iranian agriculture and establish-
ing a common understanding and full cooperation with the various ministries
jointly preparing projects, such as a small-farm consolidation program, live-
stock development and agricultural credit to small farmers. It also is re-
viewing Government schemes which aim at providing rural development centers
and building up rural industries, schemes which are being undertaken to gen-
erate employment, income, improved rural infrastructure and social amenities.
It is hoped that a pilot project based on these rural development centers
schemes being prepared jointly by the Government and the Task Force, would
result in a first rural and regional development project.
18.       A second important objective of the Bank is to advise on methods
and programs to organize and promote education and training. At the request
of the Government discussions are continuing on possible future education
project loans. It was agreed with the Iranian authorities to set up an
Iranian Education Task Force which is receiving advice and assistance from
Bank and UNESCO staff and which is expected to report in the coming months
as to the areas for future cooperation between Iran and the Bank in educa-
tion and training. Furthermore, since Iran tends to become highly urbanized,
decentralization away from Tehran and regional development and urbanization
programs become increasingly important. Urbanization projects (e.g. city
planning development, urban transport, water supply, sewerage), which would
largely benefit people with lower incomes are therefore being considered for
Bank lending, and an urban sector survey is planned for the fall of 1974.



- 6 -
A water supply and sewerage sector survey mission has returned from Iran
and is expected to recommend actions to improve facilities in the sector,
particularly in the provinces outside Tehran. Finally, given the necessity
to reduce the high level of population growth (3 percent net per annum),
special attention is given to the progress of the first population loan which
could result in a second and much larger project, and which would also include
a major nutrition component based on the preparatory study financed under the
first loan.
19.       In addition to the proposed loan, we also expect to present to the
Executive Directors in FY1975, a proposed loan for the Lar Multipurpose Water
Project for supplying water to Tehran, which has already been appraised, one
of the three agricultural projects mentioned in paragraph 17 and a village
electrification project. As agreed with the Government, we are also colnsider-
ing for FY1975 a possible loan to a mining exploration fund, the main features
of which would be presented to the Executive Directors before inviting the
Government representatives for negotiations.
PART III - THE FISHERIES SECTOR
General
20.       There are two major fishing areas in Iran:    (a) the well-known
Caspian Sea in the north which has long been exploited for its caviar and
other rich fish resources, and (b) the Persian Gulf and Oman Sea in the south
which is particularly abundant in shrimp, but where fishing activities are
not so extensively developed. Inland fi-,heries are few and largely unexploited.
21.       From the Caspian Sea, Iran produces about 200 tons of caviar yearly,
90 percent of whichi is exported. In addition, the latest official statistics
indicate a harvest of about 6,400 tons of scaled and non-scaled fishes for
1969 and 1970. Because of the popularity of these waters for fishing there
has been concern of over-exploitation of their resources. Partly in response
to this an Irano-Soviet agreement for economic and technical cooperation was
signed in 1963 which included, among other things, a study of the fishery
resources of the Caspian Sea. This study has not yet been completed.
22.       The Gulf and Oman Sea cover 200,000 km2 of rich marine waters
whicha are shared by a numiber of nations. Iran has water rights to about
50 percent of the total area. The abundant shrimp resources of the Persian
Gulf have for years been exploited through concessions given to foreign
firms.  Thie total landings appear to have increased from about 365 tons tail
weight in 1956-59, to at least 8,500 tons in 1972-73. It is estimated that
about hialf the total shrimp catch comes from Iranian coastal waters. In
addition, however, this area is believed to have substantial bottom and sur-
face feeding fish resources which are largely unexploited. The FAO estimates
that there is more than 500 mg of carbon per m2 in both the Persian Gulf and
Oman Sea, resulting in high phytoplankton production and, therefore, large
quantities of fish feed. Even assuniidg a conservative average productivity



- 7-
of 25 kg of fish per ha., the potential resource size of the whole area
would be about 600,000 tons or 20 times Iran's present production level in
the area. It is believed that with improved fishing techniques, adequate
shore facilities and proper handling and marketing methods, the total annual
fisiL production could be expanded to at least 300,000 tons, representing Iran's
share of fishing resources within its territorial waters in the Persian Gulf
and Oman Sea.
23.       Developing these resources is therefore important to Iran, espe-
cially since meat production is not likely to keep pace with the growiag
demand for animal protein. Fish consumption could help fill the gap, parti-
cularlv for those lower-income segments of the society who suffer from nutri-
tional deficiencies but cannot afford more costly meat products. However,
due largely to the present low level of fish production and the general lack
of sufficient refrigeration and marketing methods, Iran's annual per capita
consumption of fish is one of the lowest in the world: 0.4 kg as compared
to 1.5 kg in Saudi Arabia, 5.5 kg in the USA, 8.8 kg in the United Kingdom,
and 13 kg in the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen. A rough projection
of a minimum annual rate of increase of demand at 10 percent over the next
five or six years for fish compares favorably with the Fifth Five-Year Plan
projections of 8.0 percent, 10.1 percent and 14.2 percent for respectively
beef, mutton, and poultry, and would bring the per capita fish consumption
still only to 1.4 kg in 1978. Apart from domestic consumption, increased
production would also be available for export, thereby contributing to overall
world food supply. NIoreover, development of fishery activities in the southern
coastal region would also help create increased employment opportunities in
this poor and underdeveloped area of Iran, which has little other agricultural
or industrial potential.
24.       At present, the development of fishing operations in these southern
waters is iinhibited by institutional constraints described below, as well as
by the outdated and inefficient vessels and equipment used by the fishermen
in the area. This applies to both the two main types of fisheries which co-
exist in the Persian Gulf and Oman Sea: (a) the commercial industrial fish-
eries whicth consist of four Iranian companies whlich totally operate about 70
shrimp trawlers many of which are mole tnaa 15 yeaz's old and (b) traditionalis
operations which consist of about 400 individually owned medium sized boats,
many diesel powered and up to 25 m long or longer, employing an estimated
6,000 people and capable of operating commercially, and 1,800 smaller motorized
boats or canoes employing about 8,200 fishermen who use fairly primitive fishimg
methods and aside from home consumption either sell their catch at local markets
or to larger commercial operations. Most boats are well constructed but need
Mechanical and technical improvements.
25.       Although there is a strong demand among fishermen to replace and
expand their present fleet, the lack of credit facilities and well-organized
sales outlets for fishing gear and equipment prevent the necessary invest-
menits in the fisheries sector. Although some credit is available, it is
provided largely outside thie banking system. Loans to fishermen are typically
made by suppliers, commercial fishermen, processors of fishi products and
private money lenders.   The banking community is represented along the southern
coastline, but the banks generally restrict their financing to short-term
requiremeints of commercial fishermen.  These fishermen in turn supply the daily
requirements of the traditional fishermen, who do not qualify for loans from
thie banking system. The latter must therefore rely exclusively on scarce and



- 8 -
expensive financing from non-institutional credit sources. The interest rates
paid bv traditional fishermen are sometimes up to 40 percent.
Fisheries Administration
26.       There is no ministry of fisheries to regulate and manage marine
resources. However, twvo Government owned companies, the Northern Fisheries
Company of Iran (Shilat Shomal) and the Southern Fisheries Company of Iran
(Shilat Jonoub) are entrusted with the managing, exploiting and developing
of marine resources, in the Caspian Sea and off the southern coast (Persian
Gulf and Oman Sea) respectively. These companies have different status
and are responsible to different Government bodies. Shilat Shomal, more than
70 years old, was a joint Irano-Soviet venture from 1927 to 1950 when it was
nationalized and became responsible to the Ministry of Agriculture. Shilat
Jonoub, founded only in 1965, is a semi-public organization jointly owned by
the Arned Forces Consumers Cooperative Organization and the Iranian Red Cross.
27.       Sliilat Jonoub had a good profit record in its early years of opera-
tiuns, based on substantial royalty payments by foreign shrimp operators.
However, these concessions ended in 1970, when Shilat Jonoub acquired its own
fishing fleet and terminated practically all contracts with foreign operators.
This has had far-reaching effects on Shilat and, together with poor management,
lack of technical know-how and experience, and organizational and operational
deficiencies, led to a severe deterioration of the company's profitability.
In 1973, a new Mtanaging Director, General Esmail Riahi, a former Minister of
Agriculture, was appointed. Ile has instituted a number of major changes which
have helped in dealing with some of the most obvious shortcomings, but have
only been a start in solving the basic organizational problems which still
remain severe.
28.       Apart from its commercial activities, Shilat Jonoub has also been
assigned a key role in the development of the fisheries sector of the area.
It has regulatory powers over the entire fisheries industry and the utiliza-
tion of sea products in the Persian Gulf and Oman Sea. By its charter it
lhas, for instance, the right to approve any parties fishing off Iran's
southern coast and to set down the principles and criteria governing such
operations. However, Shilat in the past has not been able to perform its
regulatory functions effectively and the development of fisheries activity in
this area has consequently been hindered. To put Shilat on a sound footing,
a reorganization of the company would be required, together with management
and staff reinforcement. Technical assistance through the services of a
consulting firm specialized in management and fish processing and marketing
would be required for an extended period of time.
PART IV - THIE PROJECT
29.       In 1970, a Bank agricultural sector mission identified opportuni-
ties for substantial investment in fisheries along the southern coast of Iran,
and a subsequent FAO fisheries mission confirmed its findings and recommenda-
tions.  During preparation work in 1972 and 1973, it was confirmed that shrimp



- 9 -
and other proven demersal fish resources along the coast could serve as the
basis of a project. The proposed project was appraised in November 1973.
A report entitled "FAppraisal of a Fisheries Project--Iran", No. 375a-IRN,
dated August 7, 1974, is being distributed separately. A Loan and Project
Summary is attached as Annex III. A map sho-wing the location of the project
is also attached. Negotiations were held in Washington, D.C. from July 29
to August 1, 1974. The Iranian delegation was composed of Mr. Hassein Moadi,
Deputy Governor, ADBI, who represented ADBI and Shilat Jonoub, Dr. Mohammed
Hassan Pour-Abbas, Director World Bank Loan Division of the Ministry of
Economic and Financial Affairs, and Mr. Nasser Safa-Esfahani of the Iran
Economic Mission in Washington, D.C.
Project Description and Objectives
30.       The proposed project would be the first Bank project for fisheries
in Iran, following six other loans for agriculture--three for agricultural
credit and three for irrigatiun. It includes technical assistance to Shilat
Jonoub, the establishment of two centers for training traditional fishermen,
and credit facilities for commercial and traditional fishermen, to be extended
through ADBI and Shilat Jonoub.
31.       The project would improve exploitation of the important fish and
shrimp resources of the Persian Gulf and Oman Sea. These resources have
favorable market prospects but are inadequately developed because of: (a)
substantial organization and management problems in fishing, processing,
and marketing; (b) lack of credit facilities to fishermen; (c) lack of exten-
sion services; and (d) lack of shore facilities (mainly roads and jetties),
as well as inadequate siting of existing processing and storage facilities.
32.       The major objectives of the project are to:   (a) improve Shilat
Jonoub's organizational structure, operating policies, marketing activities
and regulatory functions; (b) train traditional fishermen to improve and
modernize their production techniques; and (c) provide credit to a wide range
of commercial and traditional fishermen to increase production. The credit
to commercial fishermen would enable about 120 private fishermen and fishing
companies to expand and modernize their fleets by covering the purchase of
such large and medium sized vessels as trawlers, trap fishing and tuna net
fishing boats and necessary ancillary velhicles and equipment (refrigerated
trucks and boat engines to power fish carriers and launches). Credit to very
small-scale traditional fishermen would be provided under an estimated 1,500
to 1,800 loans and would purchase fishing gear and equipment to improve small
motorized fishing boats (canoes and wooden vessels) covering purchase of 25-HP
engines, nets, traps, ice boxes, radio, telephone and other items that the
training and research centers would recommend for improving traditional fish-
ery productivity. The Government, which is very interested in promoting fish-
eries development, plans to develop the necessary infrastructure in the
southern shore area and the project would complement these efforts. In addi-
tion to increasing the supply of fish and helping improve nutrition, the
project would increase employment opportunities in areas with limited agri-
cultural and industrial development potential.

33.       In view of Shilat Jonoub's key position in the fisheries sector
on the southern coast, its development is essential for the fisheries activity
in that region; to carry out its role, however, it must be significantly
strengthened. Under the project, technical assistance to Shilat Jonoub would
be provided by a consultant firm experienced in fisheries and processing. It
would review the company's organizational structure, develop a training program
for management and technical staff, appraise investment plans and develop a
priority program, with a view to separating the regulatory functions from
commercial activities (Section 3.01 (b) of the Shilat Project Agreement). To
this end, the consultant team would assist in setting up a new Fisheries
Department to carry out research and formulate policies for scientific
management of fisheries resources and domestic marketing of fish by the
private sector. A Commercial Department would be set up to operate Shilat's
factories and promote marketing of their fish products in domestic and foreign
markets. In addition, it would assist Shilat in seeking advice and cooperation
from Government agencies and public and private organizations with regard to
policies and regulations in the fisheries subsector (Section 3.02 of the
Shilat Project Agreement). Consultants would also help establish training
programs at Bandar Abbas and Busher, which would extend modern production
teclniques to traditional fishermen.
Project Administration
34.       Credit would be provided directly to commercial fishermen by the
Agricultural Development Bank of Iran (ADBI) and to traditional fishermen by
the Southern Fisheries Company of Iran (Shilat Jonoub) which would receive
funds through ADBI. Bank funds for technical assistance would also be chan-
neled through ADBI. A full description of ADBI is contained in the President's
Report dated July 31, 1974, on the the third loan to ADBI. A brief description
follows.
35.       ADBI is an autonomous statutory corporation, wholly-owned by the
Government, and established in 1968 to encourage private investments in com-
mercial agriculture, livestock production and associated industries by pro-
viding medium- and long-term credit for Iran's commercial agricultural sector.
It has been the recipient of three Bank loans to help finance its lending
operations: a $6.5 million loan in 1970, a $14 million loan in 1972, and a
$40.0 million loan approved by the Executive Directors on August 13, 1974.
ADBI's financial operations have grown considerably over the past years and
its two-year lending program is estimated to reach over $100 million by 1976.
ADBI is beginning to implement a program of establishing branches over the
entire country. ADBI is ably managed by its President, Mr. Mehdi Samii,
whose wide interests and vision have substantially contributed to ADBI's
developrent. Also stimulated by the Bank, ADBI has just recently begun to
become involved in the development of the fisheries sector, where its banking
experience can be of paramount importance.



Project Cost and Financing
36.       The total estimated cost of the project is about $18 million, in-
cluding a foreign exchange component of $14.6 million. The proposed loan of
$12.5 million would cover about 70 percent of total costs. The remainder
would be provided by the Government and ADBI, each contributing about 11 per-
cent, and by the sub-borrowers for about 8 percent. For specific investments
individual fishermen would be required to put up at least 10 percent.
Relending Terms
37.       The Government would make the proceeds of the proposed loan avail-
able to ADBI and Shilat Jonoub on the below terms and conditions (Section
3.01 (b) and (c) of the Loan Agreement). The length of the loans for credit
are calculated to correspond to the life of the asset being financed.
(i) $10.9 million to ADBI at 8 percent interest per annum; repay-
able in 14 years, including a 4-year period of grace.    This
portion of the loan would be on-lent by ADBI to commercial
fishermen and fisheries cooperatives at 9 percent interest per
annum, repayable in four to ten years, including a grace period
of up to three years, depending on the nature of the sub-project.
Credit would cover such major investments as purchase of medium
and large fishing vessels and vehicles. The commercial fisher-
men or fisheries cooperatives would carry the foreign exchange
risk (Section 2.01 (a) of the ADBI Project Agreement).
(ii) $0.6 million to Shilat Jonoub, which would repay this portion
to the Government, through ADBI, over a period of twelve years,
with no grace period; interest at 8-1/4 percent per annum,
including a 1/4 percent service charge levied by ADBI. Shilat
Jonoub would onlend this amount to traditional fishermen and
fisheries cooperatives at 9 percent interest per annum, repay-
able in one to two years, with no grace period, terms which are
appropriate for the types of fishing gear and equipment to be
purchased (Section 2.2 (c) of the Shilat Project Agreement).
(iii) $1.0 million to Shilat Jonoub as a technical assistance grant.
The amount would be used by Shilat Jonoub to pay the consultants
required under the project. The Government would carry the
foreign exchange risk.
38.       ADBI's existing interest rates are 8 percent for on-farm develop-
ment, and 9 percent for agro-industries. It is the Government's policy not
to raise interest rates for agriculture and fisheries beyond 9 percent in
order to stimulate their development. This policy has recently been strength-
ened by legislation which provides for a wide range of investment incentives
in agriculture and fisheries. Under these circumstances the Bank staff has
agreed that an interest rate of 9 percent for long-term credit to commercial
fishermen would be acceptable. Traditional fishermen would also pay 9 percent
interest for short-term credit from Shilat Jonoub.

Procurement and Disbursements
39.       ADBI sub-borrowers would procure vessels, refrigerated trucks, and
engines under close supervision of ADBI, and on the basis of international
competition. However, only limited advertising would be required and in the
evaluation of bids special consideration would be given to preferences of
individual operators who already own small vessels or truck fleets, in order
to maintain a reasonable standardization of operators equipment, to reduce the
need for large and costly inventories of spare parts, as well as to avoid
delays due to slow and difficult deliveries to the remote project areas. Sub-
borrowers would be required to submit tender documents to ADBI for review
prior to the issue of invitations to bid; Bank approval would be sought in the
case of contracts exceeding $200,000 (ADBI Project Agreement Section 2.09).
40.       Shilat Jonoub, on the basis of local advertising and under the
supervision of ADBI, would procure equipment and small fishing gear for tradi-
tional fishermen through bulk purchases, locally or abroad, in at least three
orders (Section 2.02 (i) of the Shilat Project Agreement). Management consult-
ants would be selected in accordance with the Bank's guidelines. The Bank
would assist Shilat Jonoub in the selection of these consultants (Section
2.02 (a) of the Shilat Project Agreement).
41.       The proceeds of the proposed loan would finance 100 percent of the
foreign exchange component of consultants' services relating to management and
training; 90 percent of sub-loans made by ADBI for the procurement of vessels,
refrigerated trucks, and 50-lIP engines; and 55 percent of sub-loans made by
Shilat Jonoub for the procurement of fishing gear and other equipment for
traditional fishermen.
Ecology
42.       An examination of the fish and shell fishery resources to be exploited
suggests that they are not at present undergoing any adverse effects due to
marine pollution or oil drilling, and are fully capable of sustaining the proj-
ecte(' annual harvest.  In addition, the scientific research program which is
one of the proposed functions of the future Fisheries Department of Shilat
Jonoub can be expected to improve markedly the scientific understanding of
these resources and their environment, and to provide an improved basis for
protection and conservation measures designed to ensure a sustained yield of
tihe marine resources.
Justification
43.       The project is expected to generate about 19,000 tons of fish and
shrimp per annum, valued at US$9.6 million. Increased consumption of fish
would substantially contribute to improve the presently poorly balanced diet
of a large segment of the population, especially of low-income groups living
in the cities. 'Meat production is not likely to keep pace with the growing
demanu for animal protein, and increased fish supply could fill part of the
-ap by making available animal protcin at moderate prices. Regional benefits
through new employment opportunities would also be achieved in areas which
have limited agricultural and industrial development potential.   The invest-
ments would be part of the Government's plans to develop fishery resources,



- 13 -
sliore facilities and social infrastructure along the southern coast and be
fully consistent with the Fifth Five-Year Plan.
44.       The project is a first phase to rehabilitate the fisheries sector.
Technical assistance to Shilat Jonoub would have a direct impact on establish-
ing a sound institution which would be in a better position to exploit the
neglected marine resources off Iran's southern coast, act as a major organi-
zation to develop the fisheries industry, and enable it to fulfill its role
as a regulatory body. The training program, referred to in paragraph 32,
would extend modern production techniques to 120-150 traditional fishermen
per year, improving their production potential, quality of products and, as
a result increase the standard of living. About 720 to 900 fishermen would
benefit from the effects of the training program at full project development.
45.       There is a strong demand among the commercial fishermen to replace
or expand their fleet, but lack of credit facilities have hindered their in-
vestments so far. The project assists in providing such credit. Aside from
helping meet this demand, the investments themselves are sound: representative
investment models show in all cases a satisfactory net income and financial
returns ranging from 49 percent for refrigerated trucks to 21 percent return
on 600-GT stern trawlers. The activities of the traditional fishermen are
also seriously impaired by the lack of equipment. They are aware of the need
for improvement, but inadequate distribution of fishing gear and equipment,
together with inaccessibility to credit facilities have so far precluded
their ability to make the necessary investments. Individual calculations for
each improvement introduced in traditional fisheries have not been computed.
However, it is expected that a minimum accumulated incremental income of
about $2.9 million per annum would result from the expected $1 million
investment made by the time the project reaches full development. The economy
of Iran would realize a return of 35 percent from total project investment,
including technical assistance.
PART V - LEGAL INSTMIENTS AND AUTHORITY
46.       The draft Loan Agreement between Iran and the Bank and two draft
Project Agreements between the Bank and the Agricultural Development Bank
of Iran (ADBI) and between the Bank and the Southern Fisheries Company
(Shilat Jonoub), the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III,
Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a draft Resolu-
tion approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Di-
rectors separately. Features of the Loan and Project Agreements of special
interest are referred to in paragraphs 33 through 40 of this Report.
47.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION -
Loan No. 517; Ghazvin levelopment; US$11.0 million, Loan of October 17, 1967;
Closing i)ate: June 30, 1974
Thie progress of construction, pace of development and quality of
supervision under the Project are generally satisfactory. The loan amount
was reduced by half in 1971 due to the reduction in the scope of the Project
and more local procurement than had been originally anticipated. On comple-
tion of Stage II, which is now being carried out by the Borrower with its
own resources, a total of 52,000 ha (including 26,000 h1a under Stage I) will
be fully developed. Because of a reduction in some elements of the project
for technical and financial reasons, utilization of the funds has been some-
what slow. In order to enable the Borrowqer to utilize the undisbursed funds
for a proposed purchase of agricultural equipment and material, the Closing
Date was postponed for a third time to June 30, 1974. A supervision mission
has reviewed the final implementation of the project. The loan is now fully
disbursed and a completion report is being prepared.
Loan No. 594; Dez Irrigation; USS28.0 r,willion, Loan of April 1i, 1969;
Closing Date: December 31, 1974
The progress of thie agricultural development is proceeding at an
improved rate. The decision of thie Ministry of Cooperatives and Rural Af-
fairs to pay KWPA to level 6000 ha of land in the farm cooperatives area
within three years instead of the 10 vears previously planned is very en-
couraging. The rate of development of the land by three of the four agri-
business companies is progressing satisfactorily. The (Irainage program in
the south of the Dez Pilot Irrigation Project (DPIP) was completed by 2Iay
1974. The expansion of the Agricultural Research Center is completed but
professional staffing is not up to strength.
Loan No. 697; Roads V; US$40.0 million, Loan of June 29, 1970;
Closing Date: June 30, 1975
The revision of the Government's bid evaluation procedures delayed
the award of ri,ost of the thiirteen road construction projects; all are well in
progress and three have been completed satisfactorily.   Thtere were also lengthy
delays in Governient awarding two consultants contracts for the Transport Co-
ordination Study and the Road 1aintenance Study.   However, Phase I of each
has now been completed and terms of reference for Phase II of each study has
been agreed upon. Procurement of road maintenance equipment to the value of
US$6 riillion, identified by the Road Maintenance Study, will covmence shortly.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them.  They slhold be read in this sense, and with the under-
standiing that thiey do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.



ANNEX II
Page 4 of 6
In 'March 1971 consultants commenced work on the Telbran Urban Transport Study,
and in July 1972 recommended an Immediate Action Program. This program formed
thie basis of a loan approvec in August 1973.
The rate of disbursements, initiallv slow, accelerated as road con-
struction camae itito full swing, and is now satisfactory. A mission went out
in the field in early June 1974 to review thy progress of the project and will
issue its results shortly.
Loan No. 716; lehran Power Distribution; US$60.0 million
Loan of December 18, 1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1974
The project is proceeding satisfactorily. All Lmajor contracts
hlave been placed and about 50% of the planned distribution and transmission
facilities have been installed. About 100,000 new customers have been con-
nected. Although disbursements are behind schedule, they have accelerated
considerably and the loan is more than 60 percent disbursed. There are
still major accounting problems at TREC preventing the issuance of an audit
certificate. These are being studied by the consultants.
Loain No. 717; Telecommunications I; US$36.0 million Loan of December 18, 1970;
Closing Date: March 31, 1975
Good progress is being imiade witlh exchaange installations in the
Tehran area and th-e targets may be exceeded; works for provincial exchanges
;and telex networks are belhind sclhedule by about a year.  Disbursements under
the loan hiave accelerated and the bulk of the loan amount has been committed.
Loan No. 713; Education I; US$19.0 million, Loan of Decermber 18, 1970;
Closing Date: June 30, 1977
The project is progressing satisfactorily. The implenmentation of
the project is about five months behind schedule due to delays in the selec-
tion of consultant architects.   Itowever, the Project Unit is functioning
satisfactorily.  The dlisburserent schiedule has been revised and envisages
an increase in disbijrsements in the next year.   International competitive
hitiding for civil works beean in !ay 1974 and bids were opened in early July
1974, with construction starting in October.
Loan No. 805; Pipeline; U$3'2.0 million, Loan of Mlarch 3, 1972;
Closing i)ate: June 30, 1975
After some initial delay due to the reorganization of thne Enginieer-
ing Department of the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC), the contract for
the construction of the Rey-labriz oil pipeline and the contract for the
Ahwaz-Kev crude oil pipeline were awarded in Miarch 1973. ilowever, due to
the review of requirements for the Rey-Nashad section, work on thiis line hias
been cielayedl and tlie :I)C is consiuering alternative proposals for expansion
of the !;ey-iashad system to cope with the demand in h-ortli-Eastern Iran.  A

major amendment has also been proposed for the Rey-Tabriz contract. Before
reimbursement is made against this amendment, the Bank is sending a mission
in the field to update cost estimates.
Loan No. 821; Agricultural Credit - ADFI II; US$14.5 million, Loan of May 22,
1972; Closing Date: November 30, 1976
The loan became effective on September 25, 1972 and by August 1974,
about 69 percent had been disbursed. Acceleration of the rate of disburse-
ments will continue and the Loan is expected to be fully disbursed by December
1974.
Loan No. 855; Ports; US$29.0 million; Loan of September 8, 1972;
Closing Date: April 30, 1978
Implementation of all elements of the project is proceeding satis-
factorily. Improvements in PSOS organization and financial structure have
been made and the Ports Master Plan Study will be completed on schedule by
September 1974. A contract for a comprehensive training program has been
concluded with World ORT Union. All contracts for civil works, floating craft
and cargo-handling equipment have been let and are proceeding satisfactorily.
Disbursements, although behind schedule are expected to accelerate now that
all work is under contract and are progressing satisfactorily.
Loan No. 856; Power Transmission; US$51.0 million, Loan of September 20, 1972;
Closing Date:  March 31, 1977
The procurement for the 400/230-kV transmission facilities associated
with the Reza Shah Kabir 1000-M14 hydro-station has been delayed because of
extension to the project and design changes introduced bv the Iranians, but
most of the major contracts are now awarded and disbursements should soon
accelerate. The project cost is now estimated to be about 33 percent above
the appraisal estimate due to the changes and the recent general price es-
calations. Institutional improvement with TAVANIR, the beneficiary, have been
slower than expected. A major training program is still not implemented but
negotiations with prospective training conisultants are about to be completed.
Institutional improvement with TAVANIR should now accelerate under the re-
cently-signed Power loan to TAVANIR.
Loan No. 927; Telecommunications II; US$82 million, Loan of August 9, 1973;
Closing Date: March 20, 1976
The Loan became effective from December 4, 1973. A mission has
recently returned from the field where they reviewed progress under the proj-
ect. Procurement is proceeding well, and disbursements should increase rapidly.

Loan No. 928; Population; US$16.5 million; Loan of August 9, 1973;
Closinig Date: December 31, 1976
Project implementation has commenced but at a very slow pace. A
functioning project unit has failed to be established and this has, in turn,
caused delays in starting civil works, site selections and vehicle procurement.
Finally, contracts for the management and nutrition studies are not yet signed,
although progress is being made on finalizing both contracts. A supervision
mission has just returned from the field, and discussions with the Government
are continuing in order to resolve the difficulties.

The objective of the project is the improvement of public transport
in Tehran through expansion and reorganization of the United Bus Company, in-
cluding the purchase of new buses, and provision of advisory services to the
Government on a suitable long-term transport system for Tehran. The loan be-
came effective on July 19, 1974. Disbursements of up to $7 million are ex-
pected in the next six months.

Procurement:         Procurement of trawlers, vessels, refrigerated trucks,
and engines would be carried out by ADBI's sub-borrowers
on the basis of international competition, under super-
vision of ADBI. However, special consideration would be
given to preferences of individual operators who already
own small vessels or truck fleets. Shilat Jonoub, under
the supervision of ADBI, would procure equipment and small
fishing gear for traditional fishermen through bulk pur-
chases, locally or abroad, in at least three orders. Pro-
curement would be made through local advertising.
Disbursements:       The proceeds of the proposed loan would finance 100 per-
cent of the foreign exchange cost for consultants' serv-
ices relating to management and training; 90 percent of
sub-loans made by ADBI for the procurement of vessels,
refrigerated trucks, and 50-HP engines; and 55 percent
of sub-loans made by Shilat for the procurement of fish-
ing gear and equipment for traditional fishermen.
