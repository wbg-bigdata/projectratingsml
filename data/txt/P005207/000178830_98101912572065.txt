FISHERIES PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        The rapid increase in the standard of living in Iran has drastically
changed consumption patterns, bringing about a rising demand for animal pro-
tein. However, meat production prospects are not likely to keep pace with
this demand and fish consumption is expected to help fill the gap.
ii.       Apart from the Caspian Sea where the Northern Fisheries Company of
Iran (Shilat Shomal, Government-owned) has had a long fishing tradition in
exploiting caviar and sturgeon for export, the fisheries subsector in Iran
has long been neglected. Detailed historical data and information on fish-
eries are scarce; however, there is ample evidence that there are substantial
unexploited fish resources in the Persian Gulf and Oman Sea. The Southern
Fisheries Company of Iran (Shilat Jonoub, also Government-owned), has been
responsible since 1965 for managing, exploiting and developing marine resources
off the southern coast. However, its activities have been hampered by substan-
tial organization and management shortcomings in fish processing and marketing
of sea products, lack of extension services and inadequate shore facilities.
iii.      A fisheries project is proposed for the southern coasts of Iran,
in the Persian Gulf and Oman Sea. This would be the first IBRD fisheries
project in Iran. The project would provide: (a) technical assistance to
Shilat Jonoub to improve its organization, operating policies, marketing
and regulatory functions; (b) training to traditional fishermen to improve
and modernize their production techniques; and (c) credit to private fisher-
men to increase production and consequently improve standards of living of
populations with nutrition problems and precarious employment opportunities
in areas with limited agricultural and industrial development potential.
These investments would complement Government's plans and fundings to deve-
lop fisheries resources, shore facilities and social infrastructure along
the southern coasts.
iv.       The technical assistance to Shilat Jonoub would be provided through
a management consultant firm experienced in fisheries, food processing and
marketing. This firm would provide five resident staff experts for about 40
months. Two training centers, each with two technical instructors and ap-
propriate machinery and vessels, would extend improved fishing methods to
traditional fishermen in Bandar Abbas and Bushehr where fishing activities
are well developed. Credit would be provided through the Agricultural De-
velopment Bank of Iran (ADBI) to about 120 commercial fishermen or companies
for purchase of 62 fishing vessels ranging from 50 GT to 1,200 GT, 6 refri-
gerated trucks and 50 engines of 50 HP; and through Shilat Jonoub to about
600 traditional fishermen for purchase of equipment including iceboxes,
winches, radio-telephones, 25-HP engines, dugout canoes, fishing nets and
traps.
v.        The project would cost Rl 1.2 billion (US$18.0 million), of which
81% or Ri 987.0 million (US$14.6 million) would be foreign exchange. The Bank



- ii -
loan would cover 70% of the total cost or RI 843.8 million (US$12.5 million),
or 85% of the foreign exchange cost. Government would be the Borrower, and
would assume the foreign exchange risk on all Bank loan funds destined for
Shilat. The Bank financing would be supplemented by Government funds esti-
mated at R1 141.8 million (US$2.0 million), ADBI's own resources of RI 134.9
million (US$2.1 million), and individual subborrowers' funds of Rl 94.5
million (US$1.4 million).
vi.       ADBI would be the channel for Bank funds.  The Government would
on-lend to ADBI the portion of the loan destined for the commercial fishermen
on the same terms as the Bank loan to Government. ADBI would assume full bank-
ing responsibilities over these funds. ADBI would on-lend these funds and its
own resources at 9% per annum for 4 to 10 years including up to 3 years' grace.
ADBI subloans would finance up to 90% of the subborrowers' investment require-
ments.  ADBI would seek Bank approval for any loans exceeding Rl 25 million
(US$370,000). The Government would make available to Shilat Jonoub, funds for
financing its technical assistance and lending to traditional fishermen. ADBI
wold manage the Bank funds to Shilat, on behalf of Government, for a fee
of O..25%. The funds for technical assistance from the IBRD loan and Government
,ould be made available to Shilat Jonoub on a grant basis. The funds for lend-
Sz-44 to traditional fishermen would be passed to Shilat Jonoub at 8.25% for 12
years and would serve to procure fishing gear and equipment to be made avail-
able to traditional fishermen on credit of up to 2 years at 9% interest.
vii.      Subborrowers would procure project vessels, refrigerated trucks,
and engines under close supervision of ADBI. The procurement of these major
investment items financed by project subloans would be made through interna-
tional competition; ADBI would seek Bank prior review and approval for con-
Lracts exceeding US$200,000 equivalent. Evaluation procedures would give
special consideration to personal preferences of individual operators who
already own vessels or truck fleets. Shilat Jonoub would procure equipment
and small fishing gear for traditional fishermen through bulk purchases local-
ly or abroad in at least three orders. The services of the management consult-
ants would be procured in accordance with Bank guidelines.
viii.     The incremental production generated by the proposed project would
be about 18,860 tons of fish annually at full development. This would rep-
resent about 48% of the present marketed production in Iran and about 18%
of projected marketed production by 1980. The financial returns on indi-
vidual investment would range from 21% to 49%, and appear to be sufficiently
high to make them attractive to fishermen. The overall economic return
would be 35% from total project investments including technical assistance
for management and training services.
i~x.      laving received satisfactory assurances on all important points
during negotiations, the project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$12.5
million for a term of 14 years, including a grace period of 4 years.

FISHERIES PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      In April-May 1970, an I1BD Agricultural Sector Mission visited Iran
and identified opportunities for substantial investment in fisheries along
the southern coasts of Iran. The Sector Mission proposed a program including
preinvestment financing of an 18-month test fishing program and financing of
shore facilities, processing plants, vessels and technical assistance. A
subsequent FAO Sector Mission confirmed these findings and recoimmendations.
At the request of the Government, in April 1971, IBRD had the University of
Rhode Island prepare terms of reference for a pelagic test fishing program
off the southern coasts. For interim development, it was decided that shrimp
and other proven demersal fish resources along the coast could serve as the
bpasis of a project. The project was identified and prepared by two IBRD
missions early last year and appraised in November 1973.
1.02      The proposed project would be the first IBRD project in the fish-
eries sector in Iran. IBRD has made five other loans for agricultural devel-
opment in Iran--two in agricultural credit, and three in irrigation: US$6.5
mAillion for ADBI I (662-IRN, FY1970), US$14.0 million for ADBI II (821-IRN,
FY1972), US$11 million for Ghazvin Irrigation (517-IRN, FY1968), US$4 million
for Dez-Pilot Irrigation (274-IRN, FY1960), and US$28 million for Dez I (594-
IRN, FY1969). Funds for these projects are either fully disbursed or commit-
ted. The Bank is considering a repeater agricultural credit project for fis-
cal year 1975, and is actively assisting the Government in preparing several
irrigation and rural development projects to be appraised before the end of
fiscal year 1975.
1.03      This report is based on the findings of an appraisal mission to
Iran in November 1973 consisting of Messrs. B. M4erghoub, F. Kada (Bank),
J. de Obarrio and L.M. Svoboda (Consultants).

Central Government allocation of about US$28 billion equivalent. This would
more than double the GNP per capita from an estimated US$440 in 1971 to about
US$900 by 1977. However, with the upward revision of oil prices in December
1973, these projections should be revised, as the estimated oil revenues dur-
ing the Plan period could total as much as US$68 billion as compared to the
estimated US$23 billion on wh2.ch the Fifth Five-Year Plan was based. The
Fifth Plan makes special reference to balanced regional and sectoral devel-
opment. It aims to link industrial and agricultural development through
establishment of rural and regional infrastructure programs, greater assis-
tance to private investors, promotion of agribusiness ventures, and upgrading
of the cooperative movement. At the request of Government, IBRD has assigned
in March 1973 an Agricultural Task Force to assist Government in assessing
agricultural priorities and preparing specific rural development projects.
The proposed fisheries project is thoroughly consistent with the Fifth Five-
Year Plan objectives.
B. Fisheries Sector
Fish Ike qurces
2.02      The Caspian Sea in the north of Iran, covering 416,000 km2, is the
largest saltwater lake in the world; it is below sea level (-28 m) and its
maximum depth is 325 m. About 20% of the shoreline is Ironran, and the
remainder Soviet.  The water level has been subject to periodic fJ,ctuations
due to evaporation and changes in the rivers flowing to it; these fluctuations
have been mainly caused by construction of de  mp4, ad rig4tiQ  canals, which
have adversely affected shallow spawning areas and fish st;ck (Annex 1).
2.03      Iran produces about 200 tons of caviar yearly, about 90% of which
is regularly exported. It is often reported that, except for sturgeon, the
harvest of Caspian fish of all kinds (mullet, white amur, carp, 6ea trout,
perch, mackerel, etc.) has declined sharply, from almost 10,000 tons in the
early 1930's to about 2,000 tons in the early 1960's. This trend, however,
seems to have been reversed, since the latest official statistics indicate
a harvest of about 6,400 tons of cartilaginous and scaly fishes for 1969 and
1970 (Annex 1, Table 2). In 1963, an Irano-Soviet agreement for economic
and tech-nical cooperation was signed; it includes, among other projects, a
study of the fishery resources of the Caspian Sea. This study has not been
completed.
2.04      The aecond important fishing area in Iran is the Persian Gulf and
Oman Sea in the south, which covers 260,000 %m2.  The Persian Gulf is a shal-
low sea--average depth is 35 m and maximum depth 150 m. The Gulf is open to
the Oman Sea and the northwest 7ndlan Ocean through the Strait of Hormuz.
The waters of the Tigris, Eupé-ha.ev and Karun Rivers, and, periodically,
other rivers, supply fresh water acd autrients to the Gulf and are respons-
ible for its abundant mari-e Ii-e.  The periodic strong upwell.ngs along the
coast due to the monsoon winds 1o';wing from the Indian Ocean also increase
the fertility of these waters. -he Gulf- and Oman Sea are shared by a number
of nations, with Iran having water ri,hts to about 50% of the total.  The
grounds on the Iranian s;aroe c-f :he Gul- are particularly good for trawling,
as a great part of the bo0:toz. sea 7is sand or mud.



- 3 -
2.05      The Persian Gulf is rich in shrimp resources, which have been ex-
ploited over the years through concessions given to foreign firms. The
catches are usually taken within 20 km of the coast, down to depths of 25-
35 m. Penaeus semisulcatus is the dominant species in the Gulf, accounting
for about 90% of the catches.  The total landings have increased from about
365 tons., tail weight, in 1958-1959 to at least 8,500 tons in 1972-1973.
About half the total catch in the Persian Gulf 's taken from --anian coastal
waters. Accurate information on the catch is not available, since the re-
corded landings do not include catches made by traditional fishe=aen for
their own consumption or local marketing, and somie catches are directly
off-loaded and transshipped at sea.
2.06      The Persian Gulf and Oman Sea are believed to have substantial
demersal and pelagic fish resources which are largely underexploited. More
than 215 different species were identified by a Danish scientific investiga-
tion in 1936/37, including sea breams, snappers, pomfrets, mackerel, skipjack,
spade fish, groupers and grunt. The FAO Atlas of the Living Resources of
the World estimates that there is more than 500 mg of carbon per im2 in both
the Gulf and Oman Sea, resulting in high phytoplankton production and there-
fore large quantities of fish feed. Even assuming a conservative average
productivity of 25 kg of fish per ha, the potential resource size of the
whole area would be about 600,000 tons or 20 times Iran's present production
level in the area. It is believed that with improved fishing techniques,
adequate shore facilities and proper handling and marketing methods, the
total annual fish production of Iran could be expanded to at least 300,000
tons of fish representing Iran's share of fishing resources within her terri-
torial waters in the Gulf and Oman Sea. Prospects for developing tuna and
sardine canning industries in the area appear particularly promising (Annex 1).
2.07      Inland fisheries, which is the responsibility of the Ministry of
Agriculture and Natural Resources, is not well developed. There are reported-
ly only five fish farms in the country: two privately owned trout farms in
Karaj and Jajrud and three carp farms near Karaj, Rasht and Hyderabat. The
potential for fish farming projects is substantial in many important reser-
voirs of the country. An FAO study of 1970 recommended sites for fish farm-
ing in Yazdabad (Isfahan), Mazandaran and Gilan. One of the most critical
bottlenecks to developing new projects is the lack of adequately trained
technical staff.
Vessels and Equipment
2.08      Two main types of fisheries coexist in the Persian Gulf and Oman
Sea: commercial industrial fisheries, largely in foreign firms' hands; and
traditional fisheries, which employ primitive fishing methods.
2.09      The commercial fishing operation consists of about 70 shrimp
trawlers of waich more than 45 are owned by foreign firms.  Most of these
vessels are 21 to 27 m long, use double rig nets 20 m wide and operate with
engines of 240 to 425 horsepower. Apart from those owned by Shilat Jonoub,
most vessels operating in Iranian territorial waters are more than 15 years
old and need to be replaced.  The Iranian fleet comprises two stern trawlers
inclu`lng Shila: jo-hoUo 's "Arvand" factory ship and about 30 trawlers that



- 4-
need to be modernized. There is strong demand among the fishermen to replace
or expand their fleet. However, lack of credit facilities has hindered their
investments (para 2.26).
2.10      The traditional fishing operation consists of canoes powered by
outboard engines and diesel-powered wooden vessels of traditional design up
to 25 m long. There are no statistics available on fishing boats or fisher-
men, but according to the mission estimate based on official and unof,z Jial
reports, there are about 2,200 motorized fishing boats of all sizes and about
14,200 fishermen on the Iranian coast between Iraq and Pakistan. About 60%
of the 2,200 vessels off the southern coast of Iran are less than 10 m long.
They are canoes 6 to 7 m long with 1 to 3 fishermen on board, or slightly
larger boats 9 to 10 m long with removable coverings made of palm leaf r-Lbs.
These boats are used to set drift and seine nets for small fish.  The other
20% of the fleet is constituted of boats up to 15 m long and broad-beamed
boats 10 to 29 m long. They have removable decks, carry up to 30 people and
are used in gill net fishing for tuna, sardines and kingfish. Except for
the small canoes, most boats are well constructed, but need mechanical and
technical improvements such as winches, insulated iceboxes and radio commu-
nication equipment. The lack of such equipment seriously impairs quality of
production in the hot climate of the south. The fishermen are aware of the
need for these improvements; however, inadequate distribution of fishing gear
and equipment, together with inaccessibility to credit facilities, have pre-
vented investment (paras 2.20, 2.24 and 2.26).
Shore Facilities
2.11      Numerous fishing ports exist along the southern coast, but none of
them is well developed for fish industry. Bandar Abbas, at the junction of
the Oman Sea and Persian Gulf, is probably the most modern commercial Iranian
port. It was completed about eight years ago at a reported cost of abuut
US$70 million. This port is regarded as providing only temporary facilities
for fish off-loading and the Plan Organization is considering construction
of a new commercial and fishing port about 10 km further west. The other
main southern ports are Abadan and Khoramshahr on the Karun River and Bushehr
where a small shipbuilding industry exists. There are several traditional
shipyards scattered along the coast where fishermen construct their boats
with wood imported from East Africa through Pakistan, India and Dubai. Most
of the traditional fishing vessels are, however, imported from Pakistan, and
spare parts, engines, and other equipment are procured from Kuwait, Saudi
Arabia, and Dubai (see map).
2.12      Iran has a total cold storage capacity of over 50,000 tons, suit-
able for storing fish and sufficient to cover the country's present needs.
However, many oL these cold storages are improperly sited, necessitating
costly transshipment of produce by refrigerated trucks. This is the case
along the southern coast, where the Ms3t Organization and private firms ope-
rate about 6,000 tons capacity cold a-:orage. In this remote area, Government
plans to construct cold storages in the near future of 50 to 100 tons each,
totaling about 3,000 tons.. These cold storages will be operated by Shilat
Jonoub, the Meat Organization or local Government agencies.  The bulk of



the frozen or canned fish is shipped to Tehran by refrigerated trucks op-
erated by the fishing companies themselves or two main trucking companies:
Tehran Bus and Transportation Company (TBT) and Hirsh International Trans-
port. The service offered by these trucking firms is good, but additional
trucks are needed.
Marketing
2.13      Iran's annual per capita consumption of fish is one of the lowest
in the world--0.4 kg of edible weight as compared to 0.8 kg in Iraq, 1.5 kg
in Saudi Arabia, 13 kg in PDR Yemen, 5.5 kg in the US and 8.8 kg in the
United Kingdom. About 27,500 tons were marketed in Iran in 1972-73, of which
about 20,000 tons came from the southern coast. Tehran accounts for 50% of
the annual consumption and the coastal areas 42%. According to a household
expenditures survey carried out by the Bank Markazi (Central Bank of Iran),
annual per capita consumption of fish in urban areas (mainly Tehran) reached
about 1.5 kg in 1972 compared to 20 kg of beef and mutton. Fish consumption
has reportedly increased five-fold in ten years, despite poor quality of
fish products and inefficient marketing methods. Iran imports negligible
amounts of frozen fillets and canned fish, and exports 90% of its shrimp and
caviar production. Most fish retails for less than Rl 54 per kg, which is
a bargain when compared to mixed meat which costs more than twice as much.
2.14      Fish in Iran is sold either fresh or processed (smoked or frozen).
More than 40% of the products are marketed on the beaches along the coast in
very unsanitary conditions. Little or no ice is used to keep the fish from
spoiling in the extreme temperatures of the Gulf. In the main cities of the
Gulf--Abadan, Khoramshahr, and Bandar Abbas--there are fish markets and re-
tail shops where fresh and frozen fish is sold. The bulk of the production,
however, is frozen and shipped for sale to Tehran by Shilat and private firms.
2.15      To increase consumption of fish in Iran, steps must be taken to
improve fish quality and to popularize fish products among consumers through-
out the county. This would necessitate a wide range of investments, includ-
ing technical assistance and training,
Fisheries Administration
2.16      There is no ministry of fisheries to regulate and manage marine
resources. Two Government-owned companies, the Northern Fisheries Company
of Iran (Shilat Shomal) and Southern Fisheries Company of Iran (Shilat
Jonoub), are entrusted with managing, exploiting, and developing marine
resources in the Caspian Sea and off the southern coasts (Persian Gulf and
Oman Sea), respectively. Although Governmental, these companies have dif-
ferent status and are responsible to different Government bodies.
2.17      Shilat Shomal.  This company is more than 70 years old.  Before
1927, all rights to it were held by the USSR, which paid royalties to Iran.
The company was a joint Irano-Soviet venture until 1950, when it was nation-
alized and became responsible to the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Re-
sources.

2.18      Shilat Jonoub.  Shilat Jonoub (Shilat), founded in 1965, is a semi-
public organization engaged in fishing for processing and marketing of sea
products from the Persian Gulf and Oman Sea (Annex 3). Apart from its com-
mercial activities, the company also has regulatory powers over the entire
fishing industry and the utilization of sea products in the area. Shilat is
jointly owned by the Armed Forces Consumers Cooperative Organization and the
Iranian Red Cross.
2.19      Shilat had a good profit record in its early years of operations,
based on substantial revenues derived from royalty payments by foreign shrimp
operators fishing under license in Iranian territorial waters. This condition
ended abruptly in 1970, when Shilat acquired its own fishing fleet of 15 trawl-
ers and one factory mother ship, and terminated all but one contract with for-
eign shrimp operators. Due to a drastic decline in revenues from royalties,
and continuous large losses incurred in the operation of its fishing fleet,
Shilat's profitability has since shown a rapid deterioration. The company's
net income declined from an annual average of Ri 217 million in fiscal years
1967/1968 and 1968/1969 to a mere Ri 67 million in 1969/1970 and turned into
a deficit in 1972/1973, estimated at Rl 44 million, following two years of a
break-even operation.
2.20      Poor management, lack of technical know-how and exDerience, and
serious organizational and operational deficiencies have been the prime
causes of this deterioration. Above all, the acquisition of the 15 shrimp
trawlers and the factory mother ship have proven a costly investment, prac-
tically tying up all the company's free funds accumulated in its earlier
years of operations. The 3,500-ton factory ship, a second-hand converted
Japanese tuna vessel, is clearly oversized and altogether unsuitable for
the shrimp fishing and processing operations. The trawlers, purchased in
Spain, have been plagued since the start with technical problems due to in-
adequate equipment and lack of spare parts, resulting in almost half of the
vessels being out of service at any given time.
2.21      Shilat's two-fold functions as a regulatory body and a business
enterprise ensure it a privileged position but result in an inherent conflict
of interest in its operations. While revenues from fishing royalties still
remain a major source of Shilat's income, the company's procedures of issu-
ing fishing licenses have caused considerable criticism from private fishing
operators, creating a general climate of uncertainty and insecurity in the
private sector of the industry.
2.22      In July 1973, following the appointment of a new Managing Director,
sweeping changes were made ifn the company's organization, involving replace-
ment of practically all the senior staff in executive positions. The new
Managing Director, Cenera Esmail Riahi, a former Minister of Agriculture,
has shown, in the short time since he took office, great drive and determi-
nation in trying to put the company on a sound footing.  'e has- instituted
a number of organizational measures aimed at decentralizing the operations in
preparation for their nlanned expansion.  These measures have helped in dealing
with some of the most obv-ous shortcomings, but they have only been a start
4n solving the bas.c organizational problems.



-7 -
2.23      Shilat has recently requested Government financial assistance in
the execution of a US$10 million investment program, planned over the next
two years, involving a substantial expansion of its Bandar Abbas canning
factory and large-scale investments in off-shore facilities and those al-
ready under construction by other Government agencies. Shilat's management
has recently accepted a proposal by the Industrial and Mining Development Bank
(IMDBI) and the Agricultural Development Bank (ADBI) of a Joint industrial
venture involving the creation of a new company, which would take over and
expand the operation of Shilat's canning factory, with Shilat having an
equal share in the ownership of the new company with each of the two finan-
cial institutions. This represents a step in the right direction, as it would
not only relieve Shilat of a difficult industrial management problem but
would also form a sound basis for the development of an efficient fish
processing industry in the southern coastal areas.
2.24      Shilat Jonoub, as the principal fisheries organization on Iran's
southern coasts, has been assigned a key role in the development of the
fisheries sector of the area. Because of lack of organization and inade-
quate managerial experience and professional know-how, Shilat in the past
has not been able to perform its regulatory functions, and its commercial
ventures in large part have proven unproductive, involving the company in
heavy losses. To put Shilat on a sound footing, a reorganization of the
company would be required, together with management and staff reinforcement.
Technical assistance through the services of a consulting firm specialized
in management and fish processing and marketing would be required for an
extended period of time (paras 3.03-3.05).
Training and Research
2.25      The only training program existing for Iranian fishermen is spon-
sored by the Caspian Research Institute under Shilat Shomal jurisdiction at
Bandar Pahlavi. The Institute trains about ten technicians every year for
the Northern Fisheries Company's staff requirements. It also operates well
equipped laboratories for biological and chemical research, and three small
research stations, each having a small aquarium and a hatchery for sturgeon
and rainbow trout. No training or research centers exist on the southern
coast. Some surveys and investigations of marine resources were made in the
past by foreign missions, but no follow-up work has been done. The Bank has
recently assisted Shilat Jonoub in drafting terms of reference for a pelagic
test fishing study in the south. Shilat Jonoub has since obtained proposals
for carrying out the test but a final decision has not been made (para 3.07).
Credit
2.26      Credit practices are well developed in the fishery subsector, but
are largely outside the banking system. Large number of loans to fishermen
are made by fisheries input suppliers, commercial fishermen, processors of
fish products and private moneylenders. The banking network, which is quite
dense along the southern coastline, includes: (a) Government-owned agricul-
tural banks such as the Agricultural Cooperative Bank of Iran, the largest
agricultural bank in Iran; and tne Agricultural Development Bank of Iran
(ADBI), which has been selected to channel Bank funds and to lend directly



-
to commercial fishermen under the project (para 4.01); and (b) commercial
banks such as Bank Melli Iran, Bank Saderat, Industrial Mining and Development
Bank of Iran, and others. The banks generally restrict their financing to
short-term requirements of commercial fishermen. These fishermen in turn
supply the daily requirements of the traditional fishermen, who do not qualify
for loans from the banking system. They must rely exclusively on scarce and
expensive financing from non-institutional credit sources. The bank interest
rates charged to commercial fishermen are around 11%, while those paid by
traditional fishermen are 30 to 40%. (See paras 3.08-3.13.)
2.27      Agricultural Development Bank of Iran.  ADBI (Annex 5 and the
appraisal report of the Third Agricultural Credit Project to ADBI) was es-
tablished in 1968 as an autonomous statutory corporation to encourage private
investment in commercial agriculture, livestock production and associated in-
dustries, by providing credit for medium- and long-term investments in sound
projects. Under an amendment of its Charter, ADBI recently changed its name
from Agricultural Development Fund of Iran (ADFI) to Agricultural Development
Bank of Iran (ADBI), to reflect that its functions are in line with Iran's
Monetary and Banking Regulations and also to bolster its public image as a
development bank.
2.28      ADBI's authorized capital, originally Ri 1 billion, was raised in
1972 to Ri 1.2 billion and wholly subscribed by the Government. Its principal
sources of loan capital so far have been IBRD and the U.S. Commodity Credit
Corporation, sharing 60% and 40%, respectively. ADBI's credit activities in
the recent past have shown a marked increase, due mainly to the IBRD agricul-
tural credit programs under the two Bank loans. Between June 21, 1970 and
March 21, 1973, loans outstanding increased from Rl 221 million to Rl 1,612
million, and equity investments from Rl 216 million to Rl 983 million, rep-
resenting increases of more than seven times and four times over less than a
three-year period. ADBI is in good financial condition. Its past due loans
are negligible. In the past two years, ADBI's profits have averaged Rl 12
million per annum after accounting for doubtful debts. With the growing
lending volume, ADBI's operating results may be expected to further improve.
III. THE PROJECT
A. General Description
3.01      The project would improve exploitation of the important fish and
shrimp resources of the Persian Gulf and Oman Sea (para 2.06). These re-
sources have favorable market prospects but are inadequately developed be-
cause of: (a) substantial organization and management problems in fishing,
processing, and marketing, especially within the Southern Fisheries Company;
(b) lack of credit facilities to fishermen; (c) inadequate fishing and proc-
essing techniques; and (d) lack of shore facilities (mainly roads and jetties),
or inadequate siting of existing processing and storage facilities.



- 9 -
3.32      The major objectives of the project would be to:  (a) improve
Shilat's organizational structure, operating policies, marketing activities
and regulatory functions (para 2.24); (b) train traditional fishermen to
improve and modernize their production techniques (para 2.25); and (c) pro-
vide credit to a wide range of private fishermen to increase production (para
2.26); when fisheries cooperatives are established, as it is planned, they
wili also be eligible for credit (Annex D).  The support to private fishermen
would improve the standard of living of populations with nutrition problems
and precarious employ.aent opportunities in areas with limited agricultural
and industrial development potential. These investments would complement the
plans and fundings arranged by Government for shore facilities and social in-
frastructure in the area (para 2.12 and Annex 1).
B. Detailed Features
Improvement in Shilat Jonoub's Management and Operations
3.03      Technical assistance to Shilat would be provided through a consul-
tant management team which would review its organizational structure with a
view to separating its regulatory from its commercial functions. This would
help overcome the shortcomings described in paras 2.20-2.21. In view of the
complex nature of this technical assistance, a firm of management consultants
experienced in fisheries, food processing and marketing would be employed over
a 40-month period. This firm would provide five resident staff including one
team leader with economics and business administration experience, one econ-
omist, one fisheries biologist, one financial expert and one processing and
marketing expert. Detailed terms of reference for the technical assistance
are in Annex 4.
3.04      The consultant team would assist Shilat in setting up:
(i) a Fisheries Department to carry out research and formulate
policies for scientific management of fisheries resources
and domestic marketing of fish by the private sector; and
(ii) a Commercial Department to operate Shilat's factories
and promote marketing of their fish products in domestic
and foreign markets.
3.05      The consultants would 4aso help strengthen Shilat's management and
develop a training program for the company's management and technical person-
nel. Finally, the consultants would appraise Shilat's present investment
plans and develop a priority program based on a selected review of the com-
pany's activities and investment requirements. The consultants would be
backed by specialized staff, such as a naval architect or a fisheries in-
dustrial engineer to assist in the company's industrial operations.
3.06      Assurances were obtained from Shilat that it would:  (a) entrust
the technical assistance to a firm of management consultants acceptable to
the Bank; (b) zake immediate steps to separate its regulatory from its commer-
cial functions; and (c) with the assistance of the consultants, seek advice



- aU -
and cooperation from Government agencies and public and private organizations
with regard to policies and regulations in the fisheries subsector.
Training to Traditional Fishermen
3.07      The project would also provide for the establishment of two train-
ing centers in Banciar Abbas and Bushehr where there are active fishing opera-
tions. Shilat would operate these centers and equip them with appropriate
training aids.  Training vessels would be used to extend improved fishing
methods to traditional fishermen. The training would be financed over three
years and would be extended thereafter with Government and Shilat's own
financing. About 120 to 150 fishermen would be trained each year (Annex 1).
Credit to Commercial Fishermen
3.08      Credit would be extended by ADBI to a wide range of private
fishermen and fishing companies. The credit program would be mainly for re-
placement of existing investments or for increasing investments in profita-
ble fishing activities. It would consist in providing credit to about 120
commercial fishermen or companies to finance 62 fishing vessels ranging from
50 GT class to 1,200 GT class, 6 refrigerated trucks, and 50 engines of 50
HP. The proposed program would provide only for about half of the current
investment plans for these commercial fishermen.
3.09      As the demand for second-hand stern trawlers is substantial, the
project would provide funds for financing one second-hand 1,200-GT stern
trawler and one 600-GT stern trawler, or two 600-GT stern trawlers. The
second-hand 1,200-GT vessel would have a steel hull with an overall length
of 68.2 m. It would be powered by a 2,800-HP diesel engine. The vessel
would be procured abroad at about half the cost of a new vessel of the same
class and specification, estimated at about US$4.0 million. The vessel would
engage in fishing operations and would function as mother ship, supplying
fuel, water and food to smaller trawlers at the fishing ground. The 600-GT
trawler would have a steel hull with an overall length of 60 m and would
cost about US$2.0 million. It would be powered by a 1,300-HP diesel engine
and would carry a crew of 30.
3.10      The project would provide for credit to finance ten 27-m double
rigger trawlers, each costing about US$325,000. Each trawler would have a
capacity of about 220 GT, would have a steel hull, would be powered by a
425-HP diesel engine, and would have the capacity to freeze and hold in
cold storage about 136 m3 o  fi 5sa.
3.11      The project would also finance 25 trap fishing vessels and 25 tuna
drift net boats.  These vessels, of 50-GT capacity, would have wooden hulls
with an overall length of 16.5 M. They would be powered with 90-HP diesel
engines and would carry crews or about i5 and hold about 30 tons of fish.
The boats would be equ_"ped w -rh m-echanical trap or net haulers, insulated
iceboxes, and short-wave rah ese imorovements in the traditional
vessels would be designed a          mined Dy the master fishermen in the
training centers of Bandar Abas arLd Bushehr.  The boats would be procured
either abroad or constructed in Iran,  each at a cost of about US$40,000 for



- 11 -
the trap fishing boat and US$50,000 for the tuna drift net boat. General
description and drawings of the vessels to be financed are in Annex 6.
3.12      The project would provide credit to finance 6 refrigerated trucks
and about 50 engines of 50 HP. The trucks, of 20 tons capacity, would be
used by fishing companies to ship frozen fish from the landing areas to cold
stores along the coast or to marketing centers in Tehran and other main urban
areas. The 50-HP engines would be used to power fish carriers and launches
equipped with insulated holds and which buy fish from the fishing crafts at
sea, and supply it to markets and processors at shore. These purchasing
boats have a very useful function, as they allow for longer fishing time and
avoid frequent transport trips for the main fishing vessels.
Credit to Traditional Fishermen
3.13      The credit program for the traditional fishermen is designed to
remove serious technological and credit limitations (para 2.10 and 2.26).
Shilat Jonoub would sell fishing gear and equipment on credit to traditional
fishermen. An estimated 1,500 to 1,800 loans would be made during the project
repayment period for the purchase of 25-HP engines, nets, traps, iceboxes,
radio-telephones and other items that the training and research centers in
Bandar Abbas and Bushehr would recommend for improving traditional fisheries
productivity. Details on equipment supplied under credit by Shilat Jonoub are
in Annex 6, Table 1.
C. Cost Estimates
3.14       Total project cost is estimated at Rl 1.2 billion (US$18.0 million
equivalent), of which 81% or Ri 987.6 million (US$14.6 million) would be fo-
reign exchange. Detailed unit cost estimates are presented in Annex 7 and are
summarized below:

3.15      Cost estimates are based on November 1973 manufacturers' or ship-
yard prices including freight, insurance, and installation costs. Import
duties or other levies are not included since fisheries is a "preferred in-
dustry" and the Ministry of Economic and Financial Affairs exempts potential
subborrowers from import duties. A 21% contingency has been included in the



- 13 -
project cost to meet an expected 12% annual inflation on vessels, foreign
and local costs and an estimated 10% physical contingency on the overall
project cost. The inflation rate is based on actual price increase for the
vessels and items listed under the credit component category and experienced
during the last few years. The physical contingency is an estimated rate
applied to meet the cost differences due to subborrowers' preferences in
vessel design, and to unexpected cost increase for technical assistance,
buildings and equipment over the four-year disbursement period.

3.17      In view of the high foreign exchange component of the project cost,
the proposed Bank financing would be lirtited to 85% of foreign exchange or
US$12.5 million, constituting 70% of the project cost. The subborrowers would
contribute 8% and ADBI and the Government 11% each. The Bank loan would be
made to Government, since, under its Charter, ADBI cannot lend to Government-
owned enterprises such as Shilat. The Bank loan would be for 14 years in-
cluding 4 years of grace at the standard interest rate. This term is based



- 14 -
on a disbursement period of 4 years after effectiveness and subloan repayment
terms of up to 10 years including grace periods of up to 3 years. ADBI would
act as the channel for Bank funds, and would receive from Government a 0.25%
service charge on those funds made available to Shilat. The form of financing
for principal investment items would be as follows:

Assurances were obtained from Government that it would: (a) assume the
foreign exchange risk on all Bank loan funds destined for Shilat; (b) on-lend
to ADBI the portion of funds destined for the commercial fishermen on the
same terms as the Bank loan to Government; (c) make available to Shilat, on
a grant basis, the funds for financing its management and tra-ining services,
(d) on-lend to Shilat the portion of funds destined for traditional fishermen
for a period of 12 years, at 8.25% interest; and (e) pay to ADBI a 0.25% service
charge on funds made available to Shilat and managed by ADBI on Government's
behalf. Assurances were obtained from ADBI that it would act as the channel
for Bank funds, and that it would have commercial fishermen bear all foreign
exchange risks on subloans extended to them.  Assurances were obtained from
ADBI and Shilat that they would re-on-lend to the fisheries subsector any
funds from early subloan repayments under the project.
3.18      The management service to Shilat as well as training for traditional
fishermen would be financed by the Government and Bank loan.  IBRD would con-
tribute 100% of the foreign exchange cost of the technical assistance con-
tracts while the Government would provide for local cost of these contracts
and full costs of the additional counterpart staff, buildings, vehicles, equip-
ment and administration as detailed in Annex 7. Assurances were obtained
from Government that it would allocate budgetary funds to cover these costs.
3.19      Credit to individual commercial fishermen and fishing companies
would be provided from ADBI's own resources and the Bank loan. These subloans
would finance up to 90% of the subborrowers' investment cost. ADBI would
contribute 10%, while the Bank loan would provide for 80% representing the
estimated foreign exchange cost of most investments, except for trawlers for
which the investment cost is ,0O% in foreign exchange.  In these cases ADBI's
10% contribution towards investment cost would be in foreign exchange, esti-
mated at Rl 67.5 million (IJS$1.O million) for the 4-year disbursement period.
The proposed levels of financing take into consideration the large size of
investments under the project and are consistent with financing conditions in
Iran's fisheries subsector. Incremental working capital is essential to bridge



- 15 -
the gap between start of operations and fish sale. Although usually provided
by commercial banks, at present such funds are difficult to obtain. Assurances
were obtained from ADBI that it would provide or arrange for such financing.
3.20      The investment made by traditional fishermen in fishing gear and
other equipment would be financed up to 90% of total cost by loans of one or
two years, depending on the equipment. These loans would be a combination
of Bank funds for the estimated foreign exchange cost of the investment (50%)
and Government funds for the remaining 40%. Assurances were obtained: (a)
from Government that it would allocate appropriate budgetary funds to this
effect; (b) from Shilat that it would arrange for financing traditional fisher-
men's working capital requirements, including fuel and food supplies as re-
quired; and (c) from Government that it would provide bridging finance to
Shilat for purchase of the equipment, from own or other resources, as required.
Such bridging finance would be necessary, as ADBI's withdrawal from the Bank
loan would be on a reimbursement basis against documentary evidence.
E. Procurement
3.21      Subborrowers would procure project vessels, refrigerated trucks
and engines (approximately US$13.5 million) under close supervision of ADBI.
Procurement of these major investment items financed by project subloans
would be made through international competition; however, evaluation proce-
dures would give special consideration to personal preferences of individual
operators who already own small vessel or truck fleets. These preferences
would be based on criteria such as: (a) performance of the vessel; (b) neces-
sity to maintain a reasonable standardization of operator's equipment to
reduce the need for large and costly inventories of spare parts and to avoid
delays due to slow and difficult deliveries in the remote project areas; and
(c) scarcity of trained personnel to operate and maintain the vessels and
trucks. Prior to the issue of invitations to bid, the subborrowers would be
required to submit to ADBI for review and approval the justification copy of
the proposed advertisement for invitations to bid, the bidding documents, and
the proposed methods and places for advertising. Before orders are placed, the
subborrowers would submit their recommendations for awards to ADBI for review
and approval. For contracts exceeding US$200,000 equivalent, ADBI would seek
Bank approval of proposed tender documents, bid analyses and proposals for
awards; and would furnish the bank two conformed copies of the contracts
promptly upon their execution. For contracts under US$200,000, equivalent,
the subborrower would obtain whenever possible three quotations. ADBI would
ensure that the 1,200-GT second-hand stern trawler will not be more than five
years old, will be classified by an international shipping society, and will
be inspected by an authorized surveyor.
3.22      Shilat would procure fishing gear and equipment for traditional
fishermen (approximately US$1.1 million) through bulk purchases locally or
abroad in at least three orders. Procurement would be made on the basis of
local advertising under the supervision of ADBI. The bidding documents would
indicate the approximate type of equipment and total quantity required, and



- 16 -
potential suppliers would quote prices on various quantities of each type of
equipment. Shilat, after consulting ADBI, would place orders based on pro-
curement budgets established after an assessment of traditional fishermen's
equipment requirements (Annex 3, Appendix A).
3.23      Shilat would procure consultant services in accordance with IBRD's
guidelines on employment and use of consultants.
3.24      Assurances were obtained from ADBI and Shilat that they would follow
procurement procedures outlined in paras 3.21 to 3.23.
F. Disbursements
3.25      The proceeds of the proposed Bank loan would finance 100% of the
foreign exchange cost for consultants' services relating to management and
training; 90% of subloans made by ADBI for the procurement of vessels, refrig-
erated trucks, and 50-HP engines; and 55% of subloans made by Shilat for the
procurement of fishing gear and equipment for traditional fishermen. Any
savings would be used to finance further fisheries development. A quarterly
schedule of estimated disbursements is given in Annex 9.
G. Ecology
3.26      The fishery resources to be exploited under the project do not
appear to be adversely affected by marine pollution or oil drilling, and are
fully capable of sustaining the projected annual harvest. Further, the
proposed research and training program (Annex 1, Appendix A) would markedly
improve the scientific understanding of these resources and their environment;
this could provide the basis for protection measures to ensure a sustained
yield of marine resources in the future.
IV. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. Project Entities
4.01      Shilat Jonoub and ADBI would have overall responsibility for proj-
ect implementation. ADBI would act as a channel for, and would manage the
IBRD loan funds. It would make loans to commercial fishermen under conditions
described in B and C of this Chapter.  ADBI's Agro-industrial Projects Depart-
ment would be responsible for evaluating and supervising subloans; its staff
would need additional technical experience in appraising some of the larger
vessels to be financed under the project. This would be provided by the
marine specialists hired for Shilat's technical assistance program and as
necessary by specialists from international organizations such as the Inter-
national Executive Service Corps (IESC). ADBI would also: (a) closely



- 17 -
supervise Shilat's procurement, sales and credit activities (Annex 5, Appendix
A); and (b) collect Shilat's payments on the Government loan; assurances were
obtained from ADBI accordingly.
4.02      Shilat Jonoub, as the principal fisheries organization on Iran's
southern coasts, would be responsible under the project for promoting com-
mercial and traditional fishing activities. This would be carried out with
the assistance of a consulting firm (paras 3.03-3.07). To implement its
credit program for traditional fishermen, assurances were obtained from Shilat
that it would: (a) develop its existing sales outlets and establish others
at strategic points along the coasts, served by a central warehouse; and (b)
prepare procurement budgets and a sales program based on a regional assessment
of fishermen's equipment requirements.
B. On-lending Policies and Procedures
4.03      ADBI would make subloans to commercial fishermen under the project,
mainly for the purchase of fishing vessels, following its normal lending
policies and procedures, as reviewed by the Bank and amplified under the
two previous IBRD loans for agricultural credit projects. Subloans would be
approved on the basis of a full appraisal of the economic, technical and
financial aspects of the projects. It is proposed that ADBI be able to
extend credit for fishing vessels up to 90% of the estimated value of the
project or 75% of the assessed value of the borrower's mortgageable assets,
whichever is lower. The term of the subloans would be determined in accord-
ance with the estimated life of the project after careful assessment of the
repayment capacity of the subborrower. Commercial fishermen would bear all
foreign exchange risk on subloans extended to them by ADBI. Subloans in
excess of Rl 25 million (US$373,000) would be subject to prior Bank approval.
All subloans would be secured by chattel mortgage on the vessel and, where
necessary, by additional liens on subborrowers' other assets. ADBI would
require its subborrowers to insure the vessels. Assurances were obtained
from ADBI that it would comply with the proposed lending policies and proce-
dures (for details see Annex 5, Appendix A).
4.04      Shilat would make withdrawals of funds against documentation of
expenditures, based on approved budgets for the technical assistance and the
small fishermen's credit programs. It would make subloans to fishermen,
subject to a full appraisal of their equipment needs and their past opera-
tional and financial performance. Shilat would develop an efficient system
of supervision of its loans and would extend technical and managerial assist-
ance to its subborrowers as may be necessary. Assurances were obtained from
Shilat accordingly (for details see Annex 3, Appendix A and Annex 5, Appendix A).

C. On-Lending Terms
4.05      Terms of subloans would be determined by financial evaluation of
the investment to be financed. However, interest and repayment terms would
generally be in accordance with the following schedule:
Sub-
borrower's                       Grace   Repayment

4.06      The present institutional credit conditions for Iran's fisheries
sector provide for interest rates ranging between 10 and 12%. The proposed
interest rate of 9% is ADBI's current rate for medium- and long-term lend-
ing to agro-industries. The blended cost of capital to ADBI under the proj-
ect would be about 7.2% and would give ADBI a gross spread of 1.8% per annum,
considered adequate for administrative expenses and overhead and leav,ing a
sufficient margin for slippage and bad debts (Annex 10). ADBI would charge
0.25% for administering the funds channeled to Shilat. As there is no finan-
cial risk involved in this operation, the service charge of 0.25% should be
sufficient to cover ADBI's administrative expenses and overhead. Shilat
would therefore receive 0.75% to cover any slippage and bad debts it might
incur. Shilat's administrative and handling charges would be included in
the equipment costs. Assurances were obtained from ADBI and Shilat that they
would introduce the foregoing on-lending terms.
D. Accounts and Audit
4.07      Under the provisions of Shilat Jonoub's Charter, each year the
General Meeting elects an auditor who examines and certifies the balance
sheets and income statements and submits an annual report to the Board of
Directors for approval of the General Meeting.  The auditor also performs
all other functions stipulated for inspectors under the Commercial Code.
The auditors' reports have been often vague and their recommendations too
general to be of practical value. Assurances were obtained from Shilat that
it would obtain an independent auditor, satisfactory to the Bank, who would
make regular and complete audits of its books, and that the audited accounts
and the auditor's report would-be sent to the Bank within four months of the
end of Snilat 's fiscal year.



- i:9 -
4.08      A Government inspector, appointed by the General Assembly on the
recommendation of the M4inister of Finance, audits ADBI accounts and certifies
the correctness of the accounts and financial statements. A firm of interna-
tional public accountants, Coopers and Lybrand, which assists him, also in-
dependently audits and certifies such statements, besides advising ADBI on
accounting matters. Assurances were obtained from ADBI that it would keep
separate accounts for the fisheries project, that would continue to have its
accounts audited by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank, and that it
would send the audited accounts and the auditor's report to the Bank within
four months of the end of ADBI's fiscal year.
E. Project Evaluation
4.09      ADFI would be responsible for evaluating the benefits realized
under the project. It would monitor the subloans made to commercial as
well as to traditional fishermen to make periodic evaluation of the eco-
nomic impact of the credit program. It would also evaluate the training
extended to fishermen. ADBI would make available to the Bank project
evaluation reports within six months after the close of each fiscal year.
These reports should briefly discuss results and trends for each project
component. Assurances were obtained from ADBI accordingly.
V. PRODUCTION, MARKETS AND OPERATING RESULTS
A. Production
5.01      The incremental production generated by the proposed fishing ves-
sels and resulting from improvements to existing fishing boats would be about
18,860 tons of fish and shrimp at full development. This incremental produc-
tion would represent about 48% of Iran's present marketed production, and
about 18% of marketed production by 1980. In view of the large existing
resources (para 2.06 and Annex 1), these production levels can be easily
reached and sustained.
B. Markets and Prices
5.02      The projected expansion of the Iranian economy is expected to re-
sult in a rapid increase in the standard of living, drastically changing
consumption patterns. Meat production prospects are not likely to keep pace
with the growing demand for animal protein and fish consumption is expected
to fill in the gap. A quantitive analysis of the future market for fish is
difficult to make at this stage, since statistics on total catch and sales
are very incomplete. However, a rough projection of a minimum demand increase
of 10% over the next five or six years can be made on the basis of: (a) the
very low current per capita consumption of fish in Iran as compared to other
Gulf states or Middle Eastern countries with comparable eating habits; (b)



- 20 -
the increasing per capita income, forecast at an annual rate of 6.9% over
the Fifth Plan period; and (c) the annual population growth of 2.9%. At 10%,
the estimated annual growth rate of demand for fish compares favorably to
the Fifth Plan projections of 8.0%, 10.1% and 14.2% for annual demand growth
for beef, mutton, and poultry, respectively. It would bring the per capita
consumption level to 1.4 kg, slightly under the Tehran current consumption
rate of 1.5 kg (Annex 2).
5.03      Export prospects for fish are excellent.  World prices have increased
steadily, and the trend might be further sustained if the producing countries
attempt to influence prices by expanding their territorial water limits. The
ex-vessel prices for fish and shellfish in the US increased by 47% between
1968 and 1972, while the price of shrimp increased by 35% during the same
period. By 1980, it is estimated that world demand for shrimp and prawns
will outstrip supply and that excess demand will be moderated by rising
prices which are expected to increase by 15% per year (Annex 2).
5.04      It is expected that project fish production would be marketed in
Iran while project shrimp production (500 tons annually at full development)
would be exported. Marketing of project production would be easily achieved
because of improvements in the marketing system expected from technical
assistance and other investments provided under the project.
C. Operating Results
5.05      The financial benefits derived from representative investment models
are detailed in Annex 11, and summarized as follows:

- 21 -
5.06      let in::-me and financial return would be sufficiently high to make
the proDose-i investment attractive. The current prices for both input and
outrut were anplied in calculating these returns; any inflationary pressure
would be exzected to have an impact on both prices and maintain the present
relationship.  V'arious sensitivity tests were applied to each model, assuming
lower catch or high costs. The financial returns have remained satisfactory
in all cases.
5.07      Individual calculations for each improvement introduced in tradi-
tional fisheries have not been put into models. It is, however, expected
that a minimum accumulated incremental income of about US$2.9 million would
result from the expected US$1.0 million investment that the traditional
fishermen would lhave made by the time the project reached full development.
VI. ECONOMIC BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
6.01      The project is expected to generate about 18,850 tons of fish and
shrimp per annum at full development, valued at US$9.6 million, of which about
IJS$1.5 million would- result from export of shrimp. The prices of fish were
assumed at current Iranian price levels, wiich are about 33% under the inter-
national prices FOB Bandar Abbas. Shrimp were valued at current international
Frices FOB Bandar Abbas. The project production, which would constitute 35%
oF the projected Iranian domestic consumption and 65% of the expected incre-
mental consumaption by 1980, would substantially improve the diet of most lower
income groups. This contribution would be made through increased availability
of less costly animal protein (Annex 2).
6.02      The technical assistance for management would have direct impact
on establishing a sound institution to manage long-neglected marine resources
off Iran's southIern coast. The management assistance would also contribute
to planning further investment programs for the Persian Gulf and Oman Sea,
as well as processing and marketing investments in other parts of the country.
The training nrogram carried out in Bushehr and Bandar Abbas would extend
modern production techniques to 120 to 150 traditional fishermen per year,
improving their production potential, the quality of their products and, as
a result, their standard of living. About 720 to 900 fishermen, representing
the livelihood of 3,600 to 4,500 people, would have benefited from the effects
of the training program at full project development. Finally, the project
would provide valutable experience to ADFI in fisheries credit operations,
while it would improve the financial conditions of a wide range of fishermen,
through some 180 loans to commercial fishermen and 1,800 loans to traditional
fishermen during the 14-year repayment period.
6.03      The economy should realize a return of 35% from total project in-
veetment. A'Lthough the costs of technical assistance and training were in-
cluded in project investment costs, their benefits were not quantified. A
sensitivity analysis was applied to test the project components against
chang-2s in investnment cost and production results. By increasing project
investment costs or operating costs by 10% without increasing the value of
the benefits, the overall returr. would drop to 31%. By decreasing the value



- 22 -
of the benefits by 15% without changiTig project investment costs and operat-
ing costs, tne return would drop to 22% (Annex 12).
VII.  AGREEMETS REACHED AND REC0MENDATIONS
7.01       During negotiationsr, assurances were obtained or. the following
nrincipal points fro: Goverr-nent, as Borrower, that it would:
(i)  on-lend tc ADBI the portion of funds destined for the
commercial fishermen on the same terms as the Bank loan
to Government (para 3.17);
(ii)  make available to Shilat, on a grant basis, the funds
for financing its management and training services (para
3.17); and
(iii)  on-lend to Shilat the portion of funds destined for tradi-
tional fishermen for a period of 12 years, at 8.25% interest
(para 3.17).
7.02      During negotiations, assurances were obtained on the following
principal points from ADBI, that it would:
(i)  act as the channel for the Bank funds (para 3.17); and
(ii)  have commercial fishermen bear all foreign exchange risks
on subloans extended to them (para 3.17).
7.03       During negotiations, assurances were obtained on the following
principal points from Shilat Jonoub that it would:
(i)  entrust the technical assistance to a firm of managemenz
consultants acceptable to the Bank (para 3.06);
(ii)  take prompt steps to separate its regulatory
from its commercial functions (para 3.06); and
(iii)  witi, the assistance of the consultants, seek advice and
cooperation from Government agencies and public and
private organizations, wlth regard to policies and
regulations in the fisheries subsector (para 3.06),
7.14      The proiect constitutes a suitable basis for an IBRD loan of US$12.5
million under standiard IBRD terms.

IRAN
FISHERIES PROJECT
The Fisheries Subsector
A. GeneraL
1.        Iran's fisheries subsector has contributed very little to the
economy, providing less than 0.001% of the value added contributed by agricul-
ture as a whole. The animal protein deficiency in the diet of many Iranians
makes the development of fish production extremely important, particularly
in view of the promising potential of the Persian Gulf and Oman Sea in the
south. Other sources of production are the Caspian Sea in the north, and
inland fisheries which is in the exploratory stage.
2.        The Caspian Sea is the largest saltwater lake in the world, covering
416,000 kim2; it   iightly below sea level (-28 m), and has a maximum depth
of 325 m. Salinity is 12 parts per thousand as compared to 35 parts per
thousand found in open seas. This is one reason for development of diadro-
mous fauna type of fish such as sturgeon and padolle fish. Twenty per cent
of the shoreline is Iranian, and the remainder Russian. Iranian territorial
waters extend approximately 135 km into the lake from the Iranian coastline
between Bandar-e-Pahlvi and Babolsar. About 200 rivers and streams, most of
them from the Soviet shore, feed the lake. However, construction of dams and
irrigation canals for agriculture have seriously affected the rivers flowing
to the sea and this might have disrupted shallow spawning grounds and increased
the water salinity.
3.        The second marine fisheries in Iran is in the south, in the Persian
Gulf and Oman Sea.  The Persian Gulf covers 180,000 kmi2, and is generally
shallow, with an average depth of 35 m; its deepest point is 150 m. The Gulf
is open to the Oman Sea and the Northwest Indian Ocean through the Strait
of Hormuz. The bottom adjacent to the Iranian coastline is slightly deeper
than along the Arabian peninsula. Trawling is possible over large parts of
the Gulf, particularly on the Iranian shore where the bottom is mud or sand.
Water evaporation is very high in the Gulf, especially in summer when water
temperature reaches 35'C. Salinity ranges between 37.2 and 42.6 parts per
thousand. The marine life in the Gulf is particularly abundant because of
the conjunction of severa' factors, among them: (i) the more than 26 million
m3 of fresh watery rich in nutrients, discharged each year in the Gulf by
the Tigris, Euphrates and Karun Rivers, and periodically, other rivers; (ii)
the strong stirring up of water due to the high evaporation and replacement
flow coming from the Oman Sea and the Indian Ocean; and (iii) regular upwelling
during the monsoon periods.  The Gulf is shared by a number of nations; the
Iranian coastline accounts for about 1,060 km. In November 1973, Iran decided
to extend its territorial waters in the Gulf and Oman Sea to 50 nautical miles
from the coastline, or at 50% of the distance between the coasts, whichever
is less (Map).

4.        The Oman Sea and the Strait of Hormuz are the most promising grounds
for harvesting of sardines, mackerel, tuna, hilsa, pumfret, and mullet. The
sea covers 60,000 km2 of which about half is under Iranian jurisdiction. Like
the Persian Gulf, the fertility of the Oman Sea is greatly supported by the
strong upwelling which occurs during the monsoon season.
5.        The third type of fisheries in Iran is the inlar.d £fiheries; which
is largely unexploited.  This sector is under the authority o$ the Minis':ry
of Agriculture and Natural Resources.  It is estimated that 35,000 km2 might
be developed along the rivers and in many water reservoirs such as those of
Mazandaran and Jilan Provinces. At present only five fish farms exist in
Iran - two privately owned trout farms in Karadi and Jajroud (IBRD has contri-
buted to financing of the latter through Loan 821-IRN), and three carp farms
in Karadj, Rasht, and Hyderabad, of which two are privately owned. In 1970,
FAO carried out a study of fish farming in Iran and made recomnendations for
investment and training in suitable areas of the country for this type of
activity.
B.  Current Production and Resource Potential
6.        Table 1 of this annex shows the production by area for the last
decade and the estimated resources. Statistics on fish production and histo-
rical data are inaccurate and lacking in most cases. Data were obtained from
various Government and private sources.
7.        The Caspian Sea produces a great variety of scaly and cartilaginous
fish. Among the scaly fish the most produced are: mullet - 40% of the total
catch, white fish - 14%, carp - 6%, pike perch - 1.4% and mackerel - 1%.
The Russian sturgeon constitutes the most produced of the cartilaginous fish
- 21% of the total catch; and great white sturgeon and Caspian sturgeon, each
account for 11%. It is said that the harvest of Caspian fish of all kinds,
except sturgeon, has declined sharply from almost 10,000 tons in the early
1930's to about 2,000 tons in the early 1960's. This could have resulted
from poor management practices and destruction of spawning grounds by changes
in the rivers flowing to the Caspian. The latest statistics reveal, however,
a production of more than 6,400 tons for 1971, of which 2,700 tons were
sturgeon and 3,600 tons scaly fishes (Table 2).
8.        There is no information on the resource size of the area,  An agree-
ment signed with USSR in 1963 provides, among other things, for a study of the
fishing resources of the Caspian Sea. However, apparently the study has not
yet been done.
9.        FAO statistics estimate the annual production from inland fisheries
at 3,200 tons, or 8% of total Iranian production in 1972-1973. Very little
is published on the resource potential of inland fisheries, although this
sector is believed to have great potential.

?age 3
10.       The Persian Gulf and Oman Sea are the principal fishing areas,
accounting for more tnan 75X of the total national catch, In 1937-1938 a
Danish Scientific Mission to the area identified more than 215 different
species of fish, among them, sea breams, snappers, pumfrets, mackerel, skip-
jack, spadefish, croakers, groupers, grunt, threadfin, gizzard shad, yellow-
fin mullet and cods. Official statistics are not available on individual
species. The bulk of the catch is for subsistence purposes; the rest is
marketed under a variety of aspects from fertilizer to quality fresh and
frozen fillets.
11.       The shrimp fisheries of the Persian Gulf have seen rapid expansion
since 1959. Statistics are poor but it is believed that the 'argest single
share of the shrimp resources occurs off the Iranian shore, about 50% of the
total shrimp harvest in the Gulf. Figure 1 gives the location of the actual
fishing grounds. Most of the catches are taken within li_m (12 miles) of
the coast, down to depths of 25-35 m.  No significant cAtli*s have been made
so far in deeper waters or in the sea area off the Trucial States.
12.       The FAO Indian Ocean Fishery Commission Report of August 8, 1972,
estimates that Penaeus Semisulcatus species accounts for more than 90% of
the catches; the rest is constituted by many other species such as Penaeus
lastisculcatus, Parapenaeus  Mp., Metapenaeus spp., Solenocera and possibly
others. The main spawning period for these species is in spring and early
summer; and recruitment into the fishery takes place in July and August.
The life span in the fishery is 12-14 months, therefore making each season's
fishery dependent upon one recruit class. The Report estimated the catches
of whole shrimp in the Gulf at 14,000 tons, 17,000 tons, 12,000 tons and 9,000
tons in 1967, 1968, 1969, and 1970, respectively. These figures do not include
traditional fisheries, neither the catch by local trawl fishing in Iran nor
off-loadings and transshipment at sea which are unrecorded. It is reported
that the minimum estimated total catch of shrimp in the Persian Gulf is 12,000
tons of shrimp tails per year, equivalent to 20,000 tons of whole shrimp. The
1972 FAO Report attributed the considerable fluctuation in quantity and size
composition of the catches in some years (particularly 1969 and 1970) mainly
to changes in recruitment or catchability due to variations in natural factors,
rather than to changes in fishing effort. The report also concluded that at
that time (1971) it was likely that shrimp fisheries off Iran and off Qatar
were not being fully exploited. Tables 3 and 4 indicate the number of vessels
operating in Iranian waters during 1965-66/ 1973/74 and recorded catch estimated
on the basis of information from official and unofficial sources. The data con-
firm that the fluctuations of 1969 and 1972 mentioned by the FAQ study were
due to natural factors, as the catch continued to increase with the increase
in the number of boats thereafter. The current annual catch per boat is 60-80
tons compared to an average 25 tons per boat achieved in areas off Mexico and
Panama, the largest exporting countries of shrimp in the world.
13.       It is believed that the potential for fisheries development in the
Persian Gulf and Oman Sea is exceptional.  The FAQ Atlas of the Living Resources
of the World estimates that there are more than 5   mg of caron per m  in
both the Guxf and Oman Sea. This results in high phytoplankton production



,ANNEX 1
Page 4
and therefore large quantities of fish feed. Even assuming a conservative
average productivity of 25 kg of fish per ha, the potential resource size of
the whole area would be about 600,000 tons, or 20 times Iran's present produc-
tion in this area. Good prospects exist for an increase in catch of all the
species if markets were developed and improved processing and marketing tech-
niques were employed. At present the most promising fish resources appear to
be (a) oil sardines:  Sardinella fin brata for canning; and sardine-.fike fisht
Sardinella melanura and Sardin&ella simdersis for fish meal; and {b) tuna:
Thunnus tonl  Euthynnus alletleratus and Katsiwanus pellanis (skipJack)o
for domestic and export consumption either in canned or frozen products.
14.       There is thus much room for improvement and expansion of fish
production, keeping in mind that Iran has the longest coastline (1,800 km)
of any country bordering the Gulf and Oman Sea and has about 50% fish resources
of the area.
C. Fishing Vessels and Equipment
15.       Two types of fisheries coexist in the Persian Gulf and Oman Sea:
commercial industrial fisheries, largely owned by foreign firms until 1970
when Shilat Jonoub decided to discontinue these enterprises; and traditional
fisheries which employ primitive fishing methods.
Commercial Fisheries
16.       The commercial fishing operation consists of about 70 shrimp trawlers
(see Table 3), of which more than 45 are owned by foreign firms. Most of these
vessels are 21-27 m long, use double rig nets 20 m wide, and operate with en-
gines of 240-425 horsepower. Apart from those owned by Shilat Jonoub, most
of the vessels operating in Iranian territorial waters are more than 15 years
old and need to be replaced. The Iranian fleet comprises two stern trawlers
including Shilat Jonoub's "Arvand" factory ship bought in 1970 from Taiyo
Fisheries of Japan. This vessel, built in 1972, weighs 3,500 GT and has a
daily freezing capacity of 60 tons, a daily ice-making capacity of 60 tons,
and cold storage for 1,300 tons. The vessel is not operationally independent
and cannot provide complete services to the trawler fleet it is supposed to
serve. It requires a crew of 80-100 and costs as much as US$1 million per
year to operate. In view of the fishing conditions in the Gulf and Oman Sea,
the "Arvand" is not suited for operation in this area. The second stern
trawler is owned by a private enterpreneur. It is a side trawler of USSR
origin with 700 GT capacity, used for trawling and also as a combination
factory ship and supply vessel. When not trawling it buys fish from local
fishermen, and freezes and sells ice and other supplies. Cost operating
outlays average about US$15,000 per month, while it catches an average 100
tons a month of fish worth US$35,000 excluding the value of fish purchased.
The size and type of this stern trawler appear more suitable for Iranian
fishing conditions than those offered by "Arvand." The private Iranian com-
panies have expressed interest in equipping their fleets with three or four



ANNEX la
Page 5
of these stern trawlers. The proposed project provides for financing two
of them. Beside stern trawlers, the four main Iranian fishing companies
operate a fleet of about 30 trawlers that need to be modernized. The pro-
posed project provides for renewal of one-third of this fleet over a period
of three years.
Traditional Fisheries
17.       The traditional fishing operation consists of canoes powered by
outboard engines and diesel-powered wooden vessels of traditional design up
to 25 m long. There are no statistics available on fishing boats or fishermen,
but according to the mission estimate based on official and unofficial reports,
there might be 2,200 motorized fishing boats at all sizes and about 14,200
fishermen on the Iranian coast between Iraq and Pakistan (Table 5).
18.       Oman Sea,  This remote and isolated area extends from Jask to
Chabahar. Species such as tuna are caught here in reasonable proximity to
the coast. According to numerous sources, the area contains perhaps the best
grounds for food fish in Iran. About 500 local wooden boats fish in the
Oman Sea together with some 5 to 10 trawlers and one factory ship for purchase
and freezing of fish.
19.       The StraiAht Region.  About 400 diesel-powered fishing boats plus
100 outboard-powered canoes operate in the area which extends from Bandar-
e-Lengeh to Jask. These boats either deliver their fish directly for village
sale, or to the markets at Bandar Abbas and Bandar-e Lengeh, or sell at sea
to the collector boats of Shilat Jonoub and other fish traders. The outboard
canoes fish mostly with hand lines and bay nets during the tide flux and
reflux in the river mouths and also beach seines cast from shore by 8 to 12
fishermen, In this later case 2 to 3 canoes may fish together as a unit.
The diesel-powered boats fish either with drift nets 2,000 m long and 18 m
deep, the most expensive and modern gear of the traditional fishermen, or
operate wire traps that are lowered to the bottom of the sea where they
remain one day or more until the quantity caught is sufficient. Each boat
operates 25 to 100 of such traps, made of wood and wire and about 2 m in
diameter and 2 m high. The fish in the trap remains alive and well preserved
until removed. This passive fishing together with the self imposed closed
season during the hottest summer months appear to well preserve the stock
fish. The boats working with traps carry 5 to 12 people while those operating
fishnets carry a few more. The proceeds of the catch are generally divided
fifty-fifty between the boat owner and the crew.
20.       The Persian Gulf.  Bandar-e Lengeh to Abadan is the most active
area for shrimp operations (Figure 1). An estimated 1,200 traditional out-
board canoes and diesel-powered fishing boats, including about 350 small
shrimp trawlers, operate in this area where in this area where two important
ports are located - Abadan and Bushehr - and where trading activities with
Kuwait and other Persian Gulf countries are well developed. Most of the
fishermen share their time between fishing and trading; their boats are used
for transportation when the fishing season is closed.



ANN.Ex 1

21.       About 80% of the 2,200 vessels along Iran's southern coast are less
than 10 m long. They are canoes 6 to 7 m long with 1 to 3 fishermen, or
slightly larger boats 9 to 10 m long with removable coverings made of palm
leaf ribs. These boats are used to set drift and seine nets for small fish.
The other 20% of the fleet is constituted of boats up to 15 m long and broad-
beamed boats 10 to 29 m long. They have removable decks, carry up to 30
people and are used in gill net fishing for tuna, sardines and kingfish.
Except for the small canoes, most boats are well constructed but need soyne
mechanical and technical improvements such as winches, insulated iceboxes and
radio communication equipment. The proposed project provides for this equip-
ment as well as replacement of an estimated 30% of the 12 m wooden vessels.
D. Shore Facilities
22.       Fishing Ports and Shipyards - There are numerous fishing villages
along the southern coastline, none of which have well developed fishing ports
facilities. In many instances fish are landed at protected areas along
beaches. Bandar Abbas is probably the most modern Iranian port; located near
the important shrimp, tuna, and sardine fishing grounds, it is developing
rapidly. The commercial port is situated about 10 km west of the town, and
was completed about eight years ago at a reported cost of US$70 million. It
handles commercial traffic at reportedly 10 - 20% of its capacity, and also
the Iranian Navy. This port is regarded as a temporary arrangement for fish
off-loading--the authorities do not permit the use or installation of perma-
nent winches. The fish are therefore unloaded by a human chain. The Plan
and Budget Organization is considering construction of new a commercial port
about 10 km further west along the coast. No details on this project are
available. Bandar Abbas has good road connections to Tehrar and other major
cities and fairly well developed infrastructure and is centrally located in
the Gulf and Oman Sea. The other main ports in the south are Abadan and
Khoramshahr on the Karun River and Bushehr. Their installations, however
are less developed than those of Bandar Abbas. Bushehr also has a small
shipbuilding industry, the Iran Shipbuilding Company, which constructs small
fiberglass or steel boats for transportation or leisure. The traditional
fishing boats are constructed at scattered centers in the Gulf and Oman Sea
by the fishermen themselves with wood imported from East Africa through
Pakistan, India and Dubai. But most of the traditional fishing vessels are
imported from Pakistan. Engines, spare parts and other equipment are pro-
cured mainly from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Dubai. They are also procured,
at higher prices, from a number of firms in Tehran, Abadan, Ahwaz and Bandar
Abbas. The project would leave investment in port facilities to a later
stage, when the studies being undertaken by the Plan and Budget Organization
have been completed.

23.       Cold Storage and Other Processing Facilities.  Iran has over 50,000
tons cold storage capacity, distributed all over the country; 45% is operated
by the private sector and 55% by Government companies. The Meat Organization
alone operates cold storages in eight cities, totaling 12,300 tons capacity
(Table 6). The Government intends to further develop cold storage all over
the country, specifically in the south. Most of the existing cold stores
are less than five years old and are satisfactory for present needs.
24.       Virtually all existing shore-based freezing and storage capacity
in the south is located at Abadan - Khorranshahr (4,150 tons storage capacity)
and Bandar Abbas (1,500 tons storage capacity). Details of the existing plants
and those under construction or soon to be constructed are shown in Table 7.
The storage check tariffs charged by the Meat Organization are in Table 8 and
vary from Rl 45 to Rl 70 per day and per ton depending on quantities and sto-
rage time.
25.       In addition to storage facilities, Shilat Jonoub owns a canning
factory in Bandar Abbas. The factory was founded by Danish interests in 1936
and is situated about 3 km from the center of town, on valuable land 200 km
from the beach but 15 km from the commercial port where fish is landed. The
factory has a canning capacity of 20,000 tins of tuna and sardine per day,
and also produces 100-150 tons of fishmeal per season. The factory employees
180-200 people of whom 80 are women. It operates nine months per year when
the fishing activity is underway (mid-September to mid-June). Shilat Jonoub
is considering modernization and expansion of this factory. Details on this
plan are given in Annex 3.
26.       Transportation.  The bulk of the processed frozen or canned fish is
transported to Tehran from where it is distributed to other urban centers by
refrigerated trucks. Apart from a limited fleet of three or four refrigerated
trucks operated by the fishing companies themselves, the cargo is mostly
handled by two main trucking companies: Tehran Bus and Transportation Com-
pany (TBT) and Hirsch International Transport. TBT, the largest company,
has about 450 passenger buses, 150 trucks for dry cargo and 30 refrigerated
20-ton trucks. It has its own mainteamnce department and in total employs
about 2,000 people. The company has been in business for over 20 years and
has been transporting frozen fish for 8 years. Hirsch International also
transports frozen fish and operates about 30 refrigerated 20-ton trucks.
The trucks are not equipped with radiophones and the company does not carry
insurance on the cargo but in effect "self insures". To date they have had
no problems with losses. The prices vary between Ri 2.7 and RI 4,7 per ton
per kilometer depending on the area and quality of roads. In general the
companies charge RI 85,160 for transporting one 20-ton load of frozen fish
from Bandar Abbas to Tehran, which takes about 50 hours. They charge about
Rl 44,500 for the same load from Abadan to Tehran, which takes from 27 to 30
hours. In both cases, the rate is negotiable depending on back haul, availa-
bility of trucks and size of contract. Private fishing companies have suc-
ceeded in obtaining contracts 10 to 15% lower than those negotiated by
Shilat Jonoub.

E. Supporting Services
27,       Fisheries Administration and Legal Framework. - The fisheries admin-
istration is carried out by two Government-owned companies in Iran: The
Northern Fisheries Company (Shilat Shomal) for the Caspian Sea, and Lhe
Southern Fisheries Company of  ran (Shilat Jonoub) for the Persian Gulf and
Oman Sea.  Shilat Shomal is more than 70 years old.  Before 1927 all i1:s
rights were held by the USSR who paid royalties to Iran. From 1927 to '950
the company was a joint Irano-Soviet venture before being nationalized in
1950, when it became responsible to the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural
Resources. Over the years, the company had greatly expanded its commercial
activities as well as its regulatory and organizational preroratives over
Caspian fishing activities. It has initiated scientific and technicai
research (para 29), established fish hatcheries, organized training programs,
and established 40 fishermen's cooperatives on the Caspian coast. the com-
pany has also a blast freezer (-65∞C) and a cold store of 1,000 tons capacity;
it has recently acquired five 100-GT boats and one factory ship of 1,100 GT.
Its Rasht sturgeon factory, built in 1969 with the assistance of the USSR, i's
located near the village of Sangar on the Sefid-Rud River. This hatcnery
aims to produce sturgeon fingerlings on a large scale to compensate for
deteriorated spawning conditions attributed to construction of a dam on the
Sefid-Rud River.
28.       Detailed information on Shilat Jonoub is in Annex 3.  Wher.
created in 1965, Shilat Jonoub was granted broad powers to exploit, manage,
and control Iran's south coast fisheries. Shilat also has the social respon-
sibility, as a function of its development role, to improve the standard of
living of local fishermen and assist fishing cooperatives. Because of lack
of expertise, Shilat has so far achieved very little in fisheries administra-
tion, and has taken few steps to improve conditiotns for local fishermen.  Since
the appointment of the new management in July 1973, Shilat has been in the pro-
cess of reorganization, and is anxious to give a fresh start to the fisheries
in the south. The proposed project aims to assist Shilat: (i) to establish
a Fisheries Department to carry out the regulatory functions extended to the
company by law (see Appendix A); (ii) to create two training centers for local
fishermen; and (iii) to distribute credit to traditional fishermen.
Shilat has also recently commissioned a survey with a view to creating fishe-
ries cooperatives along the coast. Reportedly, 19 fishing cooperatives exist
along Iran's southern coast.  These cooperatives are in the embryonic stnge
and their only role is to serve as intermediaries for licensing individual
fishermen.  The role of cooperatives might be strengthened and diversifed
if adequate staffing, proper training and expanded credit facilities were
extended to their members. Action in this regard should, however, be carefully
planned and supervised oy -he M.Ltaistry of Cooperatives and Rural Affairs,
which has the experience and financial and technical means to achieve thi.s
objective.



Ai-X 1

29.       Training and Research. - The only training program existing for the
fishermen in Iran is the one organized by the Caspian Research Institute under
Shilat Shomal jurisdiction at Bandar Pahlavi. The Institute trains about 10
technicians every year for the Northern Fisheries Company staff requirements.
The Institute, which has a separate Board of Directors, has a staff of about
60 people, well equiped laboratories for biological and chemical research,
and three small research stations, consisting of a small aquarium and a
hatchery for sturgeon and rainbow trout, on the shore of the Caspian Sea at
Bandar-Pahlavi.
30.       There is no training program for the south coast fishermen.  The
proposed project would establish a training center in Bandar Abbas and one
in Bushehr each to accommodate 20 to 25 fishermen at one time. The centers
would require about 175 m2 and would have a classroom, storage and housing
accommodations, and would be equipped with teaching materials. The training
courses would consist of theoretical and practical instruction. Details on
the training program are in Appendix B.
31.       There is no permanent research center on the southern coast.  Some
surveys and investigations were made in the past by foreign biological missions,
but no follow-up work on marine resources has been done so far. In 1971,
Shilat requested Bank assistance in drafting terms of reference for pelagic
test fishing. The Bank provided such assistance in 1971 and 1973, and Shilat
has subsequently obtained proposals from several firms, without however hiring
a firm to date.
32.       The project proposes the construction of three research centers;
one main center2occupying 200 m2 in Bandar Abbas, and two secondary ones
occupying 100 m each in Bushehr and Abadan-Khoramshahr. These centers would
have the following technical staff:
Bandar Abbas                             Abadan-Khoramshahr       Bushehr
1  fishery biologist (Expatriate)        1 biologist          1 assistant biologist
1  fishery biologist (Iranian)           1 assistant
biologist         1 assistant quality
1 oceanographer                          1 assistant quality   control specialist
1  quality control specialist               control specialist
1 assistant quality control specialist
2 assistant biologists
The centers would have to gather all information and statistical data, and
conduct investigations of marine resources to determine the effects of natural
factors and changes in fishing intensity on resources. The studies would
serve as a basis for resource management policy in the Gulf and Oman Sea.
33.       Credit. - The banking network is quite dense along Iran's southern
coast; howevert credit to the fisheries sector is limited, and restricted to
short-term lending to commercial fishermen. Data on amounts involved are



ANNEX 1
Page 10
unavailable, but many banks have reported financing to a large extent working
capital of fishing entrepreneurs who in turn finance, in kind, the daily
requirements of local fishermen. The interest rate charged by the banks is
generally around 11% per year, while the fee charged by the traders and
fishing companies to local fishermen is around 30-40% per year, The project
would provide for loans to fishermen at much lower interest and for longer
terms,

Fish Marketing in Iran
Fish Consumption
1.        Consumption of fish in Iran is very low--about 27,500 tons in
1972-73 of which about 20,000 tons came from the southern coast (Table 1),
Tehran accounts for 50% of the annual consumption and the coastal areas 42%.
Iran's annual per capita consumption of fish is one of the lowest in the
world--0.4 kg of edible weight as compared to 0.8 kg in Iraq, 1.5 kg in
Saudi Arabia, 13 kg in PDR Yemen, 5.5 kg in the US and 8.8 kg in the United
Kingdom. Annual per capita consumption of fish and shellfish for selected
countries is in Table 2. According to a household expenditures survey carried-
out by the Bank Markazi (Central Bank of Iran), annual per capita consumption
of fish in urban areas (mainly Tehran) reached about 1.5 kg in 1972 compared
to 20 kg of beef and mutton. The consumption of fish has reportedly increased
five-fold in ten years, despite poor quality of fish products and inefficient
marketing methods.
2.        Fish consumption follows a seasonal trend, peaking in winter and
decreasing substantially after the new year (March 21). These seasonal varia-
tions are caused by the lack of refrigeration in many homes; the particularly
low quality of fish in summer since frozen fish are neither gutted nor glazed;
and the fact that meat prices peak during the winter months, causing fish to
be used as a protein substitute.
tmports and Exports
3.        Iran imports negligible amounts of frozen fillets and canned fish
that are marketed exclusively by supermarkets in urban areas. No statistics
are available on these imports and retail prices observed are very high.
4.        Iran exports 90% of its shrimp catch to the US and Japan, and about
the same proportion of its caviar to the USSR and other countries. It also
exports some 2,000 tons of sturgeon and an estimated 10,000 tons of fish
annually from the Gulf and Oman Sea to the other Gulf states. The total value
of these exports was about RI 1.0 billion in 1972-73, or US$ 15 million
equivalent.
Prices
5.        Most fish retails for less than Rl 100 per kilogram; Tables 3 and 4
show average retail fish prices in Shilat Janoub's shops in Tehran. Retail
prices for grades 1 and 2 have increased by 30% and 56% respectively in five
years. Grade 2 fish accounts for about two-thirds of the tonnage sold in
Shilat, and despite the increase in price to Rl 54 per kilogram, it still
remains a bargain when compared to mixed meat which costs more than twice as



rage  2
much.  The prices set out by Shilat are supposed to constitute the leading
prices in the market. However, prices are usually higher in suLermarkets
and private retail shops.  The quality is also slightly bezterQ,  Tolbe 3 shows
that the margin between product:.ioon prices and retail prices is betweeni 50 and
100%, while wholesale prices are about 10% off the retail prices,
6.        Prices of tuna and sazrdeles cannied by Shilat hcave remaived fixaH
during the last three years at- RI S and RI 25 respectively . S-ince thl sn 2ply
of these commodities is very 11k4ted because of the inefficiency of b-ir-
Abbas factory, an active black mzrRzt exists with prices substantlally above
those set by Shilatf,
7.        The prices of meat and poultry have increased su1btantiallh y over
the past few years (about 337  n five years), despite Governmitent efforts to
the contrary,  Three years ago the Government created thle Meat Organization
(MO) as a department of the Yin.stry of Agriculture to improve aeat disti.bu-
tion, increase output and slow dowrn retail price increases in the cLtles of
Tehran and Isfahan. MO is plannring to expand its operations to all urban
areas. MO purchases sheep, goaits, and cattle which it slaughters and sells
at a fixed price,  according to a quota assigned to each butcher shop, Tne
price for red meat was set at RI 72 per kilogratm. Given prices paid to
farmers, it lost about Rl 30 per k:ilogram. However, at the prices ,ho paid
the farmers, supply was not forthcoming to satisfy demand and a buoyant black
market developed.  To solve this problem, MO began by increasing 6;s i1aports
from 9,064 tons in 1969 to 20000 tons in 1972 and 40,000 tons in 19731. It
also started returning the by-products to the farmers, thereby improving the
paid price by an equivalent :increase of RI 25-30 per kilogram of carcass
weight.  This succeeded in deflating the black market,  Retail prices vary
according to quality and loct-ion -in the city.  In the poorer Sreas, the
retail price is about RI 95 pe  ki-ogram of "mixed meat", while -ln the
northern suburbs of Tehran it re.ees up to RI 200 per kilogram,  Pou!i:rv,y
consumption is, to a great extent, liniited to urban areas, ar.o t1s r.retaii
price is similar to that of mutton,  Prices change seasonally, reaching their
highest level during the winter.  It is during that time that the demand for
fish is greatest. In a recent study, ADFI projected increases in demand of'
8.09 10.1 and 14,2% per year for beef, lamb and poultry, respectively', between
1973-74 and 1979-80, Since it is nlot expected that the suppiy, either through
domestic production or imports, is likely to keep pace with the projected
demand, it is forecast thiat meaz prices w7ill continue to r:i:se rapi±'ly.
Market Prospects
8.        The Iranian economy has enjo;ad a very high growth of its GNP over
the past ten years; It is ex .2ed  co ccntinue its present annual -rowth of
about 11% over the F-flth Plan  ri&  until 1977.  This, i  achieved, will
lift the GINP per capita from US$440 Ci  1971 to US$900 by 1977.  This rapid
increase in the standard of liv2.ng combined with the annual population groWrti



ANNEX 2
Page 3
of about 2.9% will result in drastic changes in consumption patterns, bringing
about a rapid increase in the demand for animal protein. However, meat produc-
tion prospects are not likely to keep pace with the growing demand, and fish
consumption is expected to fill in the gap.
9.        A quantitative analysis of the market for fish is difficult to make
at this stage, since statistics on total catch and sales are very incomplete.
However, a rough projection of minimum demand over the next five or six years
can be made on the basis of: (a) the very low per capita consumption of fish
in Iran as compared to other Gulf states or Middle Eastern countries with
comparable eating habits; (b) the increasing per capita income, forecasted
at an annual rate of 6.9% over the Fifth Plan period; and (c) the annual
population growth of 2.9%. Assuming an income elasticity of demand of 1.0
and taking into account the annual population growth, it is realistic to
anticipate a minimum annual fish consumption growth of about 10.0%. This
rate compares favorably to the Fifth Plan projections of 8.0%, 10.1% and 14.2%
for annual demand growth for beef, mutton and poultry, respectively. At a
rate of 10.0% fish consumption in Iran will increase from 27,541 tons in 1973
to 53,650 tons in 1980, or a consumption of edible fish of 1.4 kg per capita,
which compares to 1.5 kg per capita consumed in Saudi Arabia and Egypt in
1964-66 and in 1969-70, respectively (Table 5). This increase of 95% over
seven years could be easily achieved on the supply side because of large
existing resources (Annex 1, paras 10 to 14) and on the distribution of
marine products (Appendix A). Project production would cover only 65% of
the expected incremental market:ed consumption by 1980.'
10.       Export prospects for fish are excellent.  World prices have increased
steadily, and the trend might be aggravated if the producing countries attempt
to influence prices by their territorial water limits; for example, on October
31, 1973, Iran extended its offshore territorial limit to 50 nautical miles
in the Oman Sea and to the edge of the continental shelf in the Persian Gulf.
The indices of ex-vessel prices for fish and shellfish between 1968 and 1972
in the US are in Table 6. A study of future consumption of shrimp in the US,
published by Commercial Fisheries Review of March 1970, indicates that world
demand for shrimp and prawns may outstrip supply in 1980. This is assuming
that demand in other countries increases at least as rapidly as in the U.S.
It is expected that after maximum worldwide harvest potential is reached,
excess demand will be moderated by rising prices, which are estimated to
increase by 15% per year.
11.       Both domestic and export market prospects for Iranian fish production
appear excellent, provided that some efforts are made to improve processing
and marketing.
Fish Distribution Outlets
12.       Fish in Iran is sold either fresh or processed (smoked or frozen).
More than 40% of the products are marketed on the beaches along the coast
in very unsanitary conditions. Little or no ice is used to keep the fish
from spoiling in the extreme temperatures of the Gulf. In the main cities
of the Gulf-Abadan, Khoramsha'r, and Bandar Abbas-there are fish markets
and retail shops where fresh and frozen fish is sold. The bulk of the



Page 4
production, however, is frozen and shipped for sale to Tehran by Shilat and
private firms. Shilat sells its frozen fish through a chain of 15 retail
stores in Tehran and other urban areas. It also uses supermarket outlets
and supplies fish to public institutions such as hospitals, universities and
restaurants. Shilat has opened a seafood restaurant in the wealthy northern
suburbs of Tehran in an effort to promote fish consumption; it also p:lans 4-o
open a few restaurants in the poorer sections of town. The private firms
sell their fish to wholesalers at the gate of several cold storages in Tehran,
which in turn sell to small shops and supermarkets.
13.       Fish marketing promotion necessitates a wide range of methods to
improve the quality of fish and its popularization among consumers through-
out the country. The proposed project would help promote fish consumption
in Iran through financing of: (a) investments likely to improve the quality
of fish such as iceboxes, radio-telephones, engines, etc.; (b) training of
local fishermen in the use of fishing devices; and (c) technical assistance
to Shilat Jonoub to define marketing policies and measures, including better
processing of marine products.

FISHERIES PROJECT
General Outline of Measures to be Taken by Shilat Jonoub
to Improve Fish Marketing
The following measures are recommended:
1.   The preassembled cold storages with their facilities (flake ice pellets,
electric generators) to be constructed at various points along the coast
should be provided in double units, to assure continuous operation when
damage occurs. These centers should also be equipped with radio-telephones,
to properly organize the collection of the catches. Reliable sea and land
transportation should be provided.
2*   More fish markets should be constructed along the coast and close to
inland cities, while retail stores should be increased in Tehran.
3.   Attention should be paid to good presentation of fish to customers.
To this effect the following steps should be taken:
a.   The fishing boats should be equipped with insulated
holds or carry insulated boxes with ice;
b.   Fish should be packed in wooden compartments or in plastic
boxes during transportation, unloading, freezing and storage.
This would avoid the deterioration caused by the pressing
weight of the top layers of fish when it is handled in bulk;
c,   Fish should be wrapped individually in heated, sealed heavy
plastic bags or by some similar method to avoid oxidization
or drying especially during prolonged storage;
d.   Fish, if not frozen, should be maintained in ice at all
stages of handling, and should be gutted as soon as it is
caught to avoid spoilage;
e,   Husking and drying techniques should be carefully reviewed
and improved to suit each type of product;
fo   A fish consumption promotion campaign should be launched,
wnen improvement in fish presentation has been made. The
campaign should attempt to change the attitudes and eating
hab cs of consumers by increasing their awareness of fish
as an att_active and nourishing food.  The campaign may
consist of:

IRAN
FISHERIES PROJECT
Shilat Jonoub (Southern Fisheries Company of Iran)
General
1.        Sherkat Sahamii Shilat Jonoub (Shilat), the Southern Fisheries Company
of Iran, was established in 1972 in succession to a company of the same name
founded in 1965 which was terminated. Shilat is jointly owned by the Consump-
tion Cooperative Organization of the Imperial Armed Forces (64%) and the
Iranian Red Cross (36%). The company operates on a commercial basis subject
to the provision of the law establishing it (Law No. 150-4), the Commercial
Code and its Articles of Association. Detailed by-laws for Shilat's operations
have not been passed.
Objectives
2.        Shilat's objectives, according to its Charter, comprise:  (a) fishing
for, processing, and marketing sea products from the Persian Gulf and Oman Sea
and the rivers emptying into them; (b) developing and improving medical facil-
ities for the residents of the southern coast; and (c) establishing fisheries
cooperatives as well as giving direct assistance to local fishermen. In addi-
tion to its commercial activities and public services, Shilat Jonoub exercises
regulatory functions over the fishing activities of the private sector along
the entire southern coast.
Powers
3.        Apart from the usual powers granted commercial firms, Shilat enjoys
a number of special powers and privileges, including: (a) the right to approve
any parties fishing off Iran's southern coast and to set down the principles
and criteria governing such operations; (b) a 15-year tax holiday on payment
of income tax and customs duties, starting in 1967; and (c) the responsibility
for implementing Government fishery projects along the southern coast prepared
by Shilat or the Planning Organization.
Capitalization
4.        Shilat's capital is Rl 500 million, consisting of 25,000 shares of
Rl 20,000 par value each, distributed as follows:
(a) Consumption Cooperative of the Imperial Armed Forces -
16,000 shares;
(b) Red Lion Sun (Iranian Red Cross) - 9,000 shares.



ANNEX 3
Page 2
As of Mlarch 21, 1973, Rl 400 million (80%) of the share capital had been paid
up. The company can borrow up to Rl 1,000 million from foreign or local
sources and the Government is authorized to guarantee such loans.
board and Management
5.        The General Meeting approves all major policy decisions.  Membership
consists of the Minister of War as Chairman, the Managing Director of the
Iranian Red Cross and the D)eputy Prime Minister. (See Cihart I for detailed
membership list.) Shilat's financial statements and yearly budgets are ap-
proved annually at a General Meeting.
6.        The Board of Directors consists of five members elected by the
General Meeting for two-year terms and approved by Royal Decree. These are
the Managing Director (Chairman), the Deputy Prime Minister, a representative
of the Consumption Cooperative of the Imperial Armed Forces, and two senior
company officers. (See Chart 1 for details.) The Board is formally responsible
for Shilat's management, for safeguarding its assets, concluding all financial
transactions, and preparing executive programs and annual budgets. Directors
are liable for wrongdoing and negligence. The Managing Director, as Chairman,
exercises a decisive influence on the Board's decision-making process.
7.        The Mianaging Director is responsible for the good management of the
company's affairs in accordance with resolutions and decisions of the General
Meeting and the Board. This comprises all principal operational and adminis-
trative responsibilities, including signing checks and contracts, appointing
executive employees subject to Board approval, and representing the company
before the courts. The Managing Director is elected by the General Meeting
and appointed by Royal Decree. General Riahi, the present Managing Director,
was appointed in July 1973. In the short time since he took office, he has
shown great drive and determination in trying to put the company on a sound
footing. However, he lacks the necessary expert advise and adequate profess-
ional staff backing to achieve the desired administrative improvements.
Organization and Staffing
8.        Shilat has its Head Office and principal sales office in Tehran;
it maintains a Regional Office in Bandar Abbas and branches in Khoramshahr,
Bushehr and Abadan.
9.        Over the years, Shilat has developed an organization largely pat-
terned after a Government administration, following the principle of a direct
line of command, with all powers and responsibility vested in the Managing
Director. The lack of consistent policy direction, the absence of qualified
professional staff, and management's unwillingness to delegate authority on
executive levels, have adversely affected Shilat's operational efficiency and
thus its progress and financial results. Shilat still has no fisheries depart-
ment to take charge of the re'gulatory functions and carry out research and
resource studies. These duties are now dispersed among various departments



ANN,   3
Page 3
with a navy bacteriologist on part-time duty with Shilat carrying principal
responsibility. Shilat's organizational concept makes it difficult to clearly
identify line-and staff assignments, while the functions of the advisors seem
to be loosely conceived.
10.       Although -the new managements since july 1973, has taken some steps
to improve organization (Chart 2)s these have barely toucned the surface, being
limited mainly to replacement of senior personnel, with little, if any, change
in overall organization. While the benefits of a decentralized administration
now seem to be acknowledged, the basic groundwork to effect it is still missing.
The situation is further complicated by the company's two-fold assignment,
combining commercial activities with Government regulatory functions. A ten-
tative outline of an Organization Chart based on the principle of separation
of Shilat's regulatory functions from its commercial activities is given in
Chart 3.
11.       The company has a staff of 137, comprising 33 professionals, (includ-
ing 2 fisheries specialists, 3 engineers and 18 accountants), 59 administrative
and clerical staff, and 45 technical and service personnel. (A list of the
senior professional staff is given in Chart 1.) In the Bandar Abbas Canning
Factory, Shilat employs 238 technicians and industrial workers; and in the
fishing fleet, a total of 91 technicians and marine personnel, more than half
of whom are expatriates under contract with a French consulting firm in charge
of operation of the fleet (para 19).
12.       Following the appointment of the new Managing Director in July 1973,
sweeping changes were made in Shilat's senior staff, involving replacements
in practically all important middle management positions. Most of the new
appointees are newcomers from outside with college degree who have little
experience in the particular field of their assignments. They could benefit
greatly from further specialized training.
13.       In view of Shilat's organizational problems and management's inex-
perience in business administration and corporate finance, the company should
seek the assistance of a firm of competent management consultants which would
advise on, and assist in, the company's internal reorganization, the institu-
tion of appropriate operating procedures and the development of an effective
staff training program, to insure a solid basis for an efficient and sound
operation.
Activities
14.       Shilat's activities cover a wide range of commercial interests in-
cluding fishing for, and processing and marketing of, fish and shrimp. Through
its regulatory functions, Shilat carries principal responsibility for super-
vising, directing and developing fisheries activities along Iran's southern
coasts, with important socio-economic implications for the region and for the
nation as a whole. Shilat's revenues from license contracts with foreign and



ANNEX 3
Page 4
local shrimp fishing operators are a major source of income. In recent years,
these revenues have fluctuated widely due to yearly variations in number and
size of fishing fleets and to seasonal fishing conditions (Tables 1 and 2).
15.       In November 1973, the Government submitted to Parliament a draft law
extending Iran's territorial water rights in the Persian Gulf and Oman Sea to
50 nautical miles from Iranian shores or, in cases where the entire distance
across the Gulf is less than 100 miles, to half the distance between the two
shores. The Iranian and Iraqi are reportedly negotiating the final settlement
of their territorial rights in these waters. If rigidly applied, this exten-
sion will directly affect fishing activities in the Gulf and Oman Sea, since
the Iranian coastline is more favorable for trawling.
16.       Fishing Fleet.  In fiscal year 1971/72, Shilat started operating its
own shrimp   eet co-nsisting of 15 trawlers and a 3,500-ton factory ship, the
"Arvand". The factory ship serves as the mother ship for the trawlers, pro-
viding them with fuel and supplies and receiving their shrimp catch for pro-
cessing. In addition, the "Arvand" also processes shrimp delivered by private
local shrimp operators (mainly Motraghi Brothers and Kamangar), which are by
far its most important raw materials source, representing 92% of total deliver-
ies in fiscal year 1972/73. Trawling is concentrated mainly from July to
December, which is the shrimp fishing season. In the interim period, the
trawlers have also been used for fishing, with good results despite their
using shrimp gear rather than fishing gear.
17.       The fleet has operated from the start at a considerable loss due to
basic shortcomings in its composition and equipment, and to poor management
and technical know-how. In particular, the "Arvand", a converted tuna vessel
purchased from Taijo Fisheries, Japan, for US$2.3 million, has proved to be a
costly investment. Because of its oversized capacity and excessive operating
cost and overheads, the vessel has been operating at heavy losses, and accord-
ing to experts cannot be expected to be run economically in a shrimp operation
of this kind. The 15 trawlers were purchased in Spain at a reported US$100,000
each, apparently the lowest bid. However, Shilat allegedly has since spent an
equal amount for refitting and repairs. These vessels have been continuously
plagued with mechanical problems and only about half the number has been fit
for operation at any one time. Three of the vessels are being cannibalized
for spare parts and have never been operated. No arrangements have been made
for regular overhauls.
18.       No detailed data are available on the "Arvand's" operations; how-
ever, based on available information, production in its first two full seasons
was as follows:

(metric tons)
Frozen Shrimp                               250             640

Equivalent days freezing                     4               24
The "Arvand's" operating costs-are prohibitive, and the mission has estimated
yearly losses on its present operations at US$600,000.
19.       In July 1973, Shilat contracted with Casacrus, a French fisheries
consultant firm, for the management of the shrimp fishing fleet during the
1973/74 fishing season. Under the contract, Casacrus is to manage eight of
the trawlers and the factory ship to get the highest sustainable catch;
undertake the technical supervision and maintenance of the vessels (at
Shilat's expense); gather data on test fishing; train the local crew; and
make recommendations on the organization of fishing operations on completion
of the contract. The contract provides for 39 marine and technical personnel
to run the "Arvand" (a fleet captain, 2 officers, 2 engineers, 18 technicians,
2 foremen and 7 processing and other personnel), and a total of 16 patrons and
technicians for the trawler fleet, headed by a captain.
20.       The yearly contract price is Ff 2.464 million, equivalent to
US$524,000, consisting of the following:
(in US$'000 equivalent)
Personnel (including social charges)
"Arvand" mother ship                           338
8 trawlers                                     138
476
Managing contractor for services and
management fee                                     48
524
In addition, the contract provides for bonuses to the captains, crew and
managing contractors based on catch tonnage and shrimp size and quality.
This involves payments to the fleet captain of US$1.90 per ton of the total
catch; to the crew and technical personnel, payments ranging from US$9.60



ANNEX 3
Page 6
per ton for shrimp catch over 3 tons up to US$33 for catch in excess of 20
tons and to the managing contractor, payments ranging from US$21 per ton to
US$85 per ton in minimum and maximum premiums.
21.       The Casacrus team operates under the supervision of the Iranian
Connander of the fishing fleet.  In its first contract year 1973/74, despite
initial delays, they have been able to raise the "Arvand's" production con-
siderably, apparently due to increased operating efficiency but also as a
result of substantially increased shrimp deliveries by private shrim?
operators. 1/ The "Arvand's" shrimp production from July to November 1973
was estimated as 800 tons, and was expected to reach 1,000 tons by the end
of the year. This is a marked improvement over 1972/73 production (640 tons),
but it still remains far below the "Arvand's" breakeven level, estimated as
4,000 tons.
22.       The private shrimp operators, apart from being major suppliers of
shrimp to the "Arvand", are also an important source of revenue to Shilat
through contract payments under their fishing licenses. These are either a
fixed percentage of the FOB value of the catch (up to 45%) or they are cal-
culated in the adjusted sales price of the shrimp averaging about 60% of the
market price. These arrangements have been the source of much criticism and
complaints from the private shrimp operators, in particular because of the
arbitrarv nature of, and frequent changes in, Shilat's fishing regulations
and their adverse effects on the shrimp operators' business activities.
23.       Bandar Abbas Regional Office.  This office is in charge of Shilat's
canning factory, its port and shore facilities and collector vessels, and it
supervises the operations of Shilat's branches in Khoramshar and Bushehr. The
office also maintains business contacts with the fisheries cooperatives lo-
cated along the shore and on the islands.
24.       Canning Factory.  The factory is about 3 km from the center of the
town of Bandar Abbas and 15 km from the commercial port from where landed fish
is transported by refrigerated trucks to the factory. The plant has a canning
capacity for tuna and sardines of 20 000 tons a day and for fishmeal of about
150 tons per season. There is a work force of 20 technicians and office per-
sonnel, and 218 manual works of which over 40% are women. The plant, estab-
lished in 1936, is greatly in need of modernization, as some of its machinery
is outdated (cooking plant) or worn out. The factorv normally operates nine
months per year and closes down fron mid-June to mid-September.  Frequent
stoppages have also occurred during the working season due to inadequate
fish supplies and storage planning.
l/   Total deliveries to Shilat contracLed witlh private op,e!ators for the
! 7 3/74 fish-ing season are stated as 2,650 -ons fish aati 1,550 tons
m;rinp (see Table 3).



ANT1EX 3

25.       The factory products are of satisfactory quality for this kind of
plant and they find a ready local market.  The main problem is the often poor
qtality of fish received by the factory and the consequent high rate of wastage.
Frozen fish in Iran is not glazed, resulting in quick deterioration through
oxidation and reduced taste appeal. The canning process is largley by hand
(preparation and filleting); tins are prepared in reform line.  No cost data
are available at present, but the introduction of cost controls is planned
under a proposed new accounting and controls system.
26.       The factory's production and sales figures for the four fiscal years
ended March 21, 1973 are given in Table 4. Canned output during the past four
years has ranged from 1-1/2 to 2 million tons per year. Fishmeal production,
reported in 1972/73 as 100 tons, showed a marked decline from the average
output of the preceding years (130 tons), apparently due to a reduction in
spoilage of fish and shrimp. On the other hand, overall production costs
have increased considerably due to wage increases and rising costs of main-
tenance, repairs and overheads, bearing heavily on the low level of production.
27.       The new General Manager recently appointed to the Bandar Abbas
Regional Office is very much aware of the many shortcomings and problems.
A U.S. graduate in business administration, he seems to have a good back-
ground though little practical experience for the job and has demonstrated
a great deal of initiative and drive in starting up a process of gradual
technical and administrative improvements. Proposed expansion plans provide
for a three-fold increase in production capacity over the next two years, with
relocation of the factory to the port area envisaged at a later stage.
28.       The planned factory modernization is justified, and adequate finan-
cing from the Plan Organizations seems assured. Ultinate action on this plan,
however, will very much depend on Shilat's final decision in regard to the
factory's future status. At present, management decided to associate its
company in a greatly enlarged and modernized canning operation within the
framework of a joint venture in cooperation with IMDBI and ADBI. This plan
appears to offer a practical solution to the difficult organizational and
technical problems under the present limitations of Shilat's managerial capa-
city and technical know-how.
29.       Fish Collection.  Virtuallv all the fish processed by the Bandar
Abbas factory is purchased at sea by Shilat's seven fish carriers, which
transport the fish to the Bandar Abbas commercial port for trucking to the
factory. These vessels were built in Pakistan (all but one new). They are
wooden, 18 to 23 m long, carry ice and have small compartments to keep the
fish chilled. Crews vary from 10 to 14 including captain and engineer.
(Further technical data are given in Table 5.)



ANNEX 3
Page 8
30.       Depending on the season, the collector vessels cover a radius extend-
ing from Bandar Lenge in the west to Jask in the east, roughly a 12- to 15-hour
run from Bandar Abbas in each case. Except for trap fishing, which is carried
out at central points with traps well tended by the fishermen, most fishing is
done by gill-netting and handling by small fishing boats which are widely dis-
persed and often change their position.  The fishermen, using small canoes winh
outboard motors but no radio equipment, are difficult to locate and rarely
carry any ice storage facilities. Consequently, their catch is often of poor
quality when eventually picked up by the Shilat collector boats. This could
be improved by introducing radio communications between the collector boats
and the fishermen and also by quality controls and price reduction on fish of
inferior quality.
31.       Marketing.  Apart from a small quantity of fish sold locally at
Bandar Abbas, all fish frozen or canned by Shilat is shipped to public wa:ce-
houses in Tehran. From there it is distributed to the company's own retail
shops mainly in Tehran but also in Shiraz, Isfahan and IVashad. Shilat trans-
ports the fish in its own refrigerated vehicles and also hires private trucks.
The company owns two refrigerated 20-ton trailers; one refrigerated 12-ton
truck; and two 7-ton, three 5-ton and three 3-ton trucks.  In 1973, it had
contractual arrangements with a shipping contractor (Hirsch Co.) for fish
shipments from Bandar Abbas to Tehran at Rl 4,200 per ton (compared to
Rl 3,800 per ton paid by private enterprises). Shilat plans to purchase
up to ten additional 20-ton trucks for its shipping operations.
32.       For storing the fish and fish products in Tehran, Shilat rents space,
including cold storage facilities, of 1,000 tons capacity, from a private firm
at Rl 40 per ton per day. Shilat owns and operates 15 retail stores of which
9 are in Tehran; it works with 8 supermarkets and also supplies several hotels
and restaurants including one of its own. In December 1973, Shilat signed
supply contracts with 40 stores owned by the Ministry of Cooperation and Rural
Affairs.
33.       Shilat's turnover of fresh fish and shrimp in the local rmarket has
fluctuated considerably in the recent past. Sales of fish in fiscal year
1971/72 dropped to an all-time low of 60.4 tons, equal to less than one-tenth
of their average level in each of the preceding two fiscal years. This wa,3
apparently due to the very poor fishing season and also in part to consider-
able inventory write-offs made for the year. Shrimp sales, stated for the
year as 36.3 tons, increased some over the preceding two years but remained
insignificant compared to the export business. Nio data have been releasec
by Shilat on the 1972/73 sales volume of fish and shrimp, but preliminary
balance sheet figures indicate a considerable improvement in both due to ,
favorable fishing season.
34.       Shilat's sales organization, served by the company''s own marketing
outlets, nave proved costly and ineffeczive. Under a rigidlv controlled sys-
ter.1, fish deliveries from the factory and factory supplies are centrally con-
trolled from the Tehran office with lictle, if any, forward planning or ad-
vance information on the sales program.  All distribution centers are supplied
from the Tehrar warehouses, including those located near the factory (Shiiraz),



ANNEX 3
Page 9
resulting in wasteful duplication of transport and handling costs. At the
initiative of the new Bandar Abbas factory manager, a reorganization of the
present sales system is planned, based on a greater measure of market intelli-
gence and sales planning and using a network of private sales agents as market
outlets.
Earning Record
35.       Summary Income Statements for the past six fiscal years ended March
21, 1973 are given in Table 1. Because of Shilat's inadequate accounting sys-
tem and lack of supporting documentation, the mission in its financial inves-
tigations had to rely heavily on information derived from personal interviews
with the Financial Manager and senior staff. The following review of the
financial aspects is based on the limited information available.
36.       Shilat Jonoub derives its income from two principal sources:  (i)
royalty payments from private shrimp operators fishing under license in Iranian
waters; and (ii) income from the company's industrial and commercial activities,
The importance of these two sources for Shilat's profitability is clearly in-
dicated in the company's income returns for the past six years. Shilat oper-
ations prior to 1970 were highly lucrative. Annual gross revenue in fiscal
years 1967/68 and 1968/69 averaged RI 253 million, of which 81% was derived
rom royalty payments. Net income averaged RI 217 p.a. allowing distribution
of Rl 290 million in dividends for the two years, representing 135% of paid-up
capital. In the subsequent four fiscal years this situation was reversed,
due mainly to a change in Shilat's policies involving the start-up of its own
shrimp fishing and processing operations and the restriction of licenses to
foreign shrimp operators. Because of a sharp decline in royalty revenues,
net income in fiscal years 1969/70 fell to Rl 67.5 million; it averaged RI 5.8
million in fiscal years 1970/72, followed by a deficit in fiscal years 1972/73
estimated at RI 44.6 million. This rapid deterioration was due mainly to the
continuous substantial deficits incurred since 1971/72 in the operation of the
Arvand factory ship and the trawler fleet. For fiscal years 1972/73 the operat-
ing expenditures of the fishing fleet are stated as Rl 246.1 million against
income from sales of processed shrimp of Rl 142.2 million, leaving a deficit
of Ri 103.9 million. This represents a further deterioration over the deficit
of the preceding fiscal year (Rl 80.8 million); however, both figures appear
subject to upward adjustment for administrative expenses and for certain cost
items bearing on the Arvand operation. This in particular concerns the cost
of shrimp, which apparently is calculated at the discount price paid by Shilat
to private shrimp operators under its license contracts, including a price
reduction of up to 40% in lieu of license fees.
37.       Royalty payments from foreign shrimp operators in 1972/73 amounted
to Rl 59.1 million, a decline of Rl 42 million (41%) from the preceding year's
level. This was due in part to a reduction of foreign shrimp fishing licenses
from three to two companies, i.e. Ross Persian Sea Food Co. and Mishary Khaled
Alzaid Co., but mainly to a considerable lower shrimp catch recorded by the
former. Sales of canned and frozen fish totalled Rl 11.2 million and of fresh
fish and shrimp Rl 17.3 million, compared to Rl 8.4 million and Rl 1.3 million



ANNEX 3
Page 10
respectively in 1971/72. The marked improvement in sales reflects the gener-
ally favorable fishing season, and may be partly due to reduced spoilage and
wastage of products. The substantial sales increase of fresh shrimp apparently
was due to the considerably larger shrimp deliveries by the local shrimp oper-
ators stipulated under their current license contracts (Table 3).
38.       Because of the inadequacies of Shilat's accounting system and cost
controls, it is not possible at present to determine the relative profitability
of its fishing, processing and sales activities. Profitability in recent years
has been affected on the one hand by rising labor costs and substantially in-
creased depreciation charges (in particular of the fishing fleet), and on the
other hand by low production levels. An important factor bearing on Shilat's
profitability is the lack of management controls and the general inefficiency
in operations. For example, according to Shilat's annual reports in fiscal
year 1971/72, there was a deficit in fish stocks of 31.5 tons (net weight),
representing more than half of total fish sales in that year. (The cumulative
shortfall of stocks since 1965 amounted to 68 tons gross weight.) It has not
been possible to determine whether this shortfall was due to spoilage in cold
storage or to other reasons. On March 21, 1973, Shilat carried in its receiv-
ables a per contra item of Ri 60 million, representing a disputed contractual
claim on the Gulf Fisheries Company of Kuwait in respect to the 1969/70 fishing
season. Final settlement of this matter was reached in 1973 and the claim will
be paid up in full during the current fishing season.
Financial Position and Investments
39.       Summary Balance Sheets for the fiscal years ended March 21, 1968 to
1973 are given in Table 2. On March 31, 1973, Shilat had total assets of
Ri 783 million in assets, and a net worth of Rl 685 million, representing
increases of 29% and 26%, respectively, over a five-year period. Gross
fixed assets rose from Rl 61 million in 1968 to Ri 576 million in 1973, an
increase of RI 515 million relative to new investments in building plant and
equipment. This included Ri 452 million for vessels, machinery and equipment;
Rl 46 million for building construction; and Rl 17 million for land acquisition
and other investments, mainly extensions of cold storage and ice-making plants
and other shore and port facilities, replacements of machinery and equipment
for the industrial plants and additions to the truck fleet, including two
large refrigerated vehicles. Investments in fishing vessels represented by
far the largest item, comprising Rl 197 million for the Arvand factory ship,
Rl 182 million for the trawler fleet and Rl 29 million for the fish collector
vessels at Bandar Abbas.
40.       Moreover, during the five-year period, Shilat increased its working
capital by Ri 90 million, making for a total investment in the operation of
RI 605 million. Of this total, Ri 213 million was financed from the inflow
of new funds, including additional paid-in share capital of Rl 185 million,
and a Government grant of Rl 28 million; the remaining Rl 392 million was
co _ _Cr_om internal resources, including depreciation accruals and retained
earnings from earlier years set aside in reserve. In the process, the company
reduced its li-quid funds (temporarily invested in Government bonds) by Rl 338.8
million, leaving a balance of Rl 55.3 million carried in fixed bank deposits.
(For further details see Table 6.)



ANNEX 3
Page 11
41.       The estimated loss in FY 1972/73, Rl 44.6 million, represents an
impairment of capital of 11%.  In the current fiscal year (1973/74), the
company has called up an additional Rl 50 million share capital, raising its
paid-up total to Rl 450 million. This should strengthen Shilat's financial
position and provide adequate funds for the present size of the operation.
To carry out Shlilat's overall expansion plans on the scale presently planned
a substantial inflow of new funds would no doubt be required. The Plan
Organization informed the mission that a budgetary allocation for the modern-
ization of the Bandar Abbas canning factory was under active Government con-
sideration.
Auditors
42.       Under the provisions of Shilat's Charter, each vear the General
Meeting elects an auditor who examines and certifies the balance sheets anid
income statement and submiits an annual report to the Board of Directors Eor
approval of the General Meeting. The auditor also performs all other func-
tions stipulated for inspectors under the Commercial Code.  The companv's
balance sheets and financial statements nave been signed by two inspecZ-;S
for the past several years, one being a senior Government official. 2he
auditors' reports are often vague and their recommendations too general to
be of practical value. There appears to be little follow-up by the manage-
ment on the auditors' proposals made in regard to the company's operations
and policies. These have included: (i) investigation of the sharp decline
in shrimp catch by foreign contractors since 1969/70; (ii) organization of
a publicity drive to introduce Shilat and its products to the general public;
(iii) establishment of prefabricated cold storage plants of suitable size in
appropriate locations on the southern coasts; and (iv) engagement of foreign
consultant engineers to study the development of the fishing industry in
selected coastal areas.  A firm of competent, independent auditors should be
appointed who would carry out regular and complete audits of Shilat.
Expansion Program
43.       In November 1973, Sliilat submitted to the Plan Organization an
investment program for the expansion of its cannery to 5 million cans of
tuna and sardines per annum, or about twice its present capacity, and for an
increase in the factory's freezing facilities for fish to 5,000 tons and for
shrimp to 3,300 tons, representing increase over present levels of three and
four times, respectively. Considerable expansions of shore facilities on the
mainland and on the islands are also planned, including new constructions or
extension of cold storage and icemaking plants, construction of jetties and
dockyards, a major workshop, and purchase of refrigerated trucks. The pro-
gram, planned over a period of two years, is estimated to cost US$10 million.
Apart from the proposed cannery expansion, much of this program is still in
an early planning stage and subject to revision, pending completion of a
Government survey of existing facilities and those under construction. Shiilat
informed the mission that the Plan Organization was considering its request
for financial assistance for the expansion program and that Government was
considering a budgetary allocation for the cannery expansion, pending sub-
mission of further details.

FISHERIES PROJECT
Agricultural Development Bank of Iran (ADBI)-/
General
1.        ADBI was established in 1968 as an autonomous statutory corporation
to encourage private investment in commercial agriculture, livestock produc-
tion and associated industries, by providing credit for medium- and long-term
investments in sound projects. Its activities are covered by its Statute and
Charter and the Banking and Monetary Law of Iran. ADBI can make loans to a
single project up to 10% of ADBI's paid-in capital, and its total investments
in a project, including equity participation, must not exceed 25% of the
paid-up capital. The lower limit of ADBI's loan has recently been lowered to
US$15,000, which equals the upper lending limit of the Agricultural Coopera-
tive Bank, an institution lending to small farmers on concessionary terms.
Under an amendment of its Charter, ADBI recently changed its name from Agri-
cultural Development Fund of Iran (ADFI) to Agricultural Development Bank of
Iran (ADBI), to reflect its functions in line with Iran's monetary and bank-
ing regulations and also to bolster its public image as a development bank.
Resources
2.        ADBI's authorized capital, originally Rl 1 billion, in 1972 was
raised to Rl 2 billion and wholly subscribed by the Government. The paid-in
capital on March 20, 1973 was Rl 1.4 billion, and it was fully paid up on
March 20, 1974. ADBI, under its extensive borrowing powers, can raise loans
up to Rl 15 nillion (US$224 million) abroad and up to Ri 5 billion (US$75
million) locally. Its principal sources of loan capital have been IBRD and
the Commodity Credit Corporation, sharing 60% and 40%, respectively, in ADBI's
long-term loans outstanding on March 20, 1973, totalling Rl 1.25 billion.
ADBI borrows on short-term from the Central Bank. It can issue bonds guar-
anteed by the Govermnent, obtain loans from the Government and accept savings
deposits, but to date it has made no use of these facilities.
Management and Organi.zation
3.        ADBI is controlled by the General Asserably, chaired by the Minister
of Agriculture, and managed by the High Council, consisting of the Governor
of the Central- Bank (Chairman), ADBI's President,  the Managing Director of
the Plan Orgwnization and undersecretaries of various ministries. The
President, appointed by Royal Decree, is the Chief Executive with wide powers
1/   For further detafIs, see the a-praisal report for Iran's Third ADBI
Agricultural Credit Pro,ect, No. 398a--IR.

(including veto power over loans), and is assisted by an Executive Vice
President similarly appointed. ADBI operates from its Head Office in Tehran
and a system of five regional branch offices planned shortly to be extended
natiornide. ADBI has separte departments for project appraisals, loan super-
vision, economic research, legal affairs and finance and administration, em-
ploying in all 88 professionals and 77 administrative staff. Two department
heads have received Bank training and all have benefited from an EDI course
held in Tehran. By and large, ADBI is well managed and has a competent staff.
Mr. Sami, formerly Governor of the Central Bank and Managing Director of the
Plan Organization, was appointed President of ADBI in September 1973. He has
started an organizational build-up of ADBI, to prepare for a planned rapid
credit expansion.
Operations
4.        ADBI's credit activities in the recent past have markedly increased,
due mainly to IBRD's agricultural credit programs under the two Bank loans.
Between June 21, 1970, and March 21, 1973, loans outstanding rose from Rl 221
million to RI 1,612 million, and equity investments from Rl 216 million to
RI 983 million, representing increases of more than seven times and four
times over less than a three-year period. Loans granted under the IBRD agri-
cultural credit projects represented 70% of the total loans outstanding, with
the first Bank loan (662-IRN) fully disbursed and the second 821-IRN) one year
ahead of schedule. A third IBRD loan for an extended agricultural credit
project is under active Bank consideration. The balance of ADBI's loan port-
folio represents credits covered from ADBI's own resources and from facilities
available from the US Commodity Credit Corporation. In July 1972, ADBI and
Bank Melli started a joint Credit Program sharing 60% and 40%, respectively,
in credits extended under the program aimed at supporting smaller agricultural
investment projects. Of the RI 1.5 billion target figure for the program,
Rl 500 million is expected to have been utilized by the end of March 1974.
Financial Record
5.        In the first four years of ADBI's operations, the low level of
lendings was inadequate to cover ADBI's high administrative expenses, result-
ing in annual losses averaging Rl 12.5 million in each of the years 1968/69
to 1969/70, and Rl 7.5 million in FY 1970/71. Following the subsequent
rapid business expansion, ADBI in FY 1971/72 and 1972/73 has had profits
averaging Rl 12 million p.a. after accounting for doubtful debts. With the
growing lending volume, ADBI's operating results may be expected to further
improve. Past due loans are negligible and the reserve on bad debts is ample.
ADBI is in good financial condition, mainly due to large and frequent infu-
sions of capital by Government. However, possible exchange losses estimated
as Rl 81.6 million (US$1.2 million) computed at exchange rates obtained on
March 21, 1973 could significantly impair net worth. The losses will arise
because subloans under the second IBRD project have been denominated in US
dollars, whereas disbursements have been in various other currencies. Approp-
riate arrangements for protecting ADBI's financial interests are currently
under discussions among ADBI, the Government and the Bank (Tables 1 and 2).

6.        Accounts and Auditing.  A Government auditor, appointed by the
General Assembly on the recommendation of the Minister of Economic and Fi-
nancial Affairs, audits ADBI's accounts and certifies the correctness of the
accounts and financial statements. A firm of international public accountants,
Coopers and Lybrand, which assists him, also independently audits and certifies
such statements, besides advising ADBI on accounting matters. ADBI would keep
separate accounts for the fisheries project, for each of the two previously
financed Bank projects, and for its own operations apart from these projects.

FISHERIES PROJECT
Project Organization and Lending Procedures
IBRD Loan
1.        A Bank loan of US$12.5 million would be made to Government to cover
85% of the project's foreign exchange cost. The loan would be for 14 years
including 4 years of grace, at the standard interest rate. ADBI would be
the channel for Bank funds. Government would on-lend to ADBI US$10.9 million
of the Bank loan to finance the commercial fishermen. From the proceeds of
the Bank loan, Government would also on-lend to Shilat US$0.6 million for
credits to traditional fishermen and would grant to Shilat US$1.0 million
for technical assistance. The commercial fishermen would bear the foreign
exchange risk on all loans extended to them by ADBI, and the Government would
bear the foreign exchange risk on all Bank loan funds destined for Shilat.
In addition to the Bank loan, Government would contribute to Shilat US$1.7
million for technical assistance and US$0.4 million for credit to traditional
fishermen.
Lendings to Commercial Fishermen
2.        ADBI under its credit and investment policies can cover a wide
range of borrowers. The minimum size of its loans has recently been re-
duced to Rl 1 million (US$15,000). ADBI's maximum lendings are restricted
to 10 percent, and its equity investments to 15 percent, of ADBI's paid-in
capital and reserves, respectively. Based on ADBI's present paid-in capi-
tal and reserves (Rl 2.0 billion), its maximum lendings to any one borrower
could be Rl 200 million. (US$3.0 million) and its total investments includ-
ing equity participation Rl 300 million (US$4.4 million).
3.        ADBI, in approving subloans under the fisheries project, would be
guided by its policy regulations which have been reviewed by the Bank under
the two previous Bank loans for agricultural projects and amplified to ensure
a sound credit operatior. This in particular applies to the following:
(1)  ADBI approval of subloans is subject to a full evaluation
of the economic, tec..nicaz and financial aspects of the
project against the borrower 's overall investment plans,
the quality of its management and the borrower's credit-
worthiness.
(2)  ADBI shall ensur-e that adequate working ca?ital is avail-
able for the project, and -`t would assist the borrowers
in oGtaining commercial barik credits for the purpose,



ANNEX 5
APPENDIX A
Page 2
where such arrangements cannot be made, ADBI would provide
the working capital for a limited time period.
(3) Repayment periods of subloans are to be related to the ex-
pected economic life of the assets to be financed and care-
ful assessment of the repayment capacity of the enterprise.
4.        It is proposed that all subloans under the fisheries project above
RI 25 million should be subject to prior Bank approval.
5.        It is proposed that ADBI would be required in regard to the maximum
proportion of lending for financing of individual fishing vessels and the
security arrangements on such lendings:
(a) To approve credits up to 90 percent of the purchase value of
the fishing vessels or 75 percent of the borrower's total
mortgageable assets employed in his fishing operation,
whichever is lower. The proposed high loan portion in the
financing of fishing vessels reflects the large foreign
exchange component in their total cost. Considering the
limited availability in a fisheries operation of other
mortgageable assets including real estate, the proposed
75 percent would be justified provided adequate insurance
is taken out on the vessel(s).
(b) The credits would be secured by chattel mortgage on the
vessel(s) financed under the loans which would be supple-
mented by additional security (in the form of mortgage of
real estate, chattel mortgate on other vessels, bank guar-
antees, securities, etc.), as and where needed. The bor-
rower would be required to take out adequate insurance on
the vessel during its construction and when in operation
(all risk) and to endorse the policy to ADBI. This would
require an amendment of the ADBI loan regulations which at
present do not provide for chattle mortgate to serve as
security for its loans.
6.        Procedures.  ADBI's lending procedures are suitably organized for
this kind of operation. Loan applications are received by ADBI's head office
and its branches. After preliminary screening and acceptance of the applica-
tion, ADBI's staff assists the borrower in preparing a full presentation of
the project. Evaluation of the project is assigned to a team from the Proj-
ect Department, consisting of an economist, an engineer and a financial
analyst, who prepare a full appraisal report. The report together with loan
recommendations is submitted to the management for approval. Loans up to
Rl 5 million are approved by ADBI's President and those above Rl 5 million by
the Loan Committee consisting of four speciFied members of the High Council
(Board), chaired by ADBI's President. Contractual documents prepared by



ANNEX 5
APPENDIX A
Page 3
ADBI's Legal Department comprise a standard form of Loan Agreement with ap-
propriate special legal covenants as and where required, a mortgage agreement
and other legal papers. A Loan Supervision Department is charged with the
follow-up on the projects.
7.        ADBI's staff will need additional technical experience in the ap-
praisal of some of the larger vessels to be financed under the project. This
could be provided by the engagement, from time to time, of specialists avail-
able from the International Executive Services Corps (IESC) and other inter-
national and UN organizations. In the economic and technical appraisal of
fisheries projects, ADBI's staff would benefit from cooperation with the
marine specialists provided to Shilat under the technical assistance program.
Financing of Shilat Jonoub
8.        ADBI would manage on behalf of the Government the project funds
provided under the Bank loan. A specific department in ADBI (Project De-
partment) would be assigned the prime responsibility for the operation,
which basically would fall into two parts, i.e., (a) technical assistance
to Shilat and (b) loans to traditional fishermen. ADBI would establish an
IBRD Loan Account for the loan operation and would set-up appropriate ac-
counting procedure to provide a complete and detailed record of the flow of
Government loan and grant funds to Shilat in financing the project and of
Shilat's loan repayments under the traditional fishermen's credit program.
9.        To ensure an efficient and smooth operation, appropriate procedural
arrangements would be worked out as outlined below.
10.       Credits to Traditional Fishermen.  The Bah  loan for this project
would be 14 years, including a 4 year grace period. The loan from the Govern-
ment to Shilat would be for 12 years at a rate of interest 8-1/4 percent and
Shilat's loans to the fishermen would be for up to 3 years at 9 percent in-
terest. Of the interest spread on the Bank loan, Shilat would share 0.75
percent and ADBI 1/4 percent to cover their respective administrative ex-
penses. Withdrawals by ADBI from the Bank loan would be on a reimbursement
basis within the proposed four years disbursement period. The utilization
of the Bank loan would be subject to conditions laid down in a formal agree-
ment between the Government, ADBI and Shilat Jonoub, including inter alia
the follows:
(a) A commitments by Shilat,
(i) to prepare a budget for the procurement of the equip-
ment based on the credit program;
(ii) to organize its sales outlets for the equipment;
(iii) to grant credits to the fishermen up to 90 percent
of the sales value of the equipment based on a



ANNEX 5
APPENDIX A
Pagee 4
thorough assessment of their past operational and
financial performance;
(iv) to develop an efficient supervision system on its
loans and extend technical and managerial assistance
to the borrowers as and where required;
(v) to maintain appropriate records and documentation
on the operation and prepare regular reports on its
progress;
(b) An undertaking by ADBI,
(i) to keep under review ShwLat's equipment budgets and
credit program;
(ii) to carry out general supervision of Shilat's sales and
credit operations and coordinate and submit to the Bank
progress reports on the project.
For further details see Note on Proposed Organization Set-Up for Credits to
the Traditional Fishermen, in Annex 3 Appendix B.
11.       Technical Assistance to Shilat.  Shilat, in consultation with ADBI,
would prepare a budget for the Technical Assistance Project comprising the
remuneration of the managing consultants under their contract together with
the local counterpart expenditures and the estimated local costs of the proj-
ect including costs for building, equipment and operational expenses. The
budget would be supplemented by a payment schedule phased over the four-
year disbursement period, and both would be subject to periodical review
as and when required. ADBI would make an advance to Shilat to cover its
initial expenditures and would make subsequent payment for the foreign
costs of the project against documents, drawing on the IBRD loan. ADBI's
withdrawl from the Bank loan would be on a reimbursement basis againts
documentary evidence.
12.       Shilat would submit to ADBI periodical progress reports on the proj-
ect for review and transmission to the Bank.

FISHERIES PROJECT
Description of Proposed Credit-Financed
Investments Under the Project
Vessels
1.        The project stern trawlers would fish mainly in the Oman Sea, and
would function as mother ships, supplying fuel, water and food to smaller
trawlers at the fishing grounds in either the Oman Sea or the Persian Gulf.
The project proposes financing of one 1,200-GT second-hand stern trawler
and one 600-GT stern trawler, or two 600-GT stern trawlers.
2.        The 1,200-GT second-hand stern trawler and the 600-GT stern trawler
would have the following specifications:
1S200 GT                  600 GT
(a)  length               68.2 in                    60.0 m
(b)  breadth              11.2 m                      9.6 m
(c)  denth                 7.4 m                      4.2 m
(d)  hull                 Steel                      Steel
(e)  engine               2,800 HP                   1,300 HP
(f)  gross capacity       1,200 tons                 600 tons
(g)  freezing capacitv   20 tons/day                 14 tons/day
(h)  hold capacity        900 m3                     600 m3
(i)  fuel tank capacity  550 m3                      250 3
(j)  water tank capacitv 68 m3                       30 m
(k)  crew members         50                         30
(1)  service speed        12 knots/hour              11 knots/hour
(m)  main nautical        magnetic compass,          gyro compass, auto-pilot,
equipment            gyro compass, auto         magnetic compass, direction

fish finders, echo        sounder, radar, short-wave
sounder, radar, short-   radio, and trawl fishing
wave radio, and trawl    gear
fishing gear
3.        The 1,200-GT second-hand stern trawler would be procured abroad at
about half the cost of a new vessel of the same class and specifications
estimated at US$4.0 million under the present quotation. The vessel should
not be more than five years old. It should be classified by an international
shipping society, and should be inspected by an authorized surveyor. This
size vessel can be serviced in Abadan, Bushehr, or Bandar Abbas, and its



ANNEX 6
Page 2
spare parts easily supplied by local agents,  The vessel is expected to make
eight fishing trips of about 25 days each per year and land a total of 3,000
tons of fish.
4.        The 600-GT stern trawler would be constructed abroad in 12 months
after the order is placed and is estimated to cost US$2.0 million under pre-
sent quotation. The vessel would be serviced in Abadan, Bushehr, or Bandar
Abbas. It would cover the distance between the Oman Sea, its fishing ground,
and Abadan, the farthest point, where it might be serviced or land its catch
after a 48-hour run. The trawler is expected to make about 10 trips of 20
days each per year and land a total of 2,000 tons of fish.
5.        The third category of trawlers proposed by the project is the 26.5 a
double rigger trawler destined for shrimp catching in the Gulf and for fish-
ing operations in the Oman Sea. Ten of these trawlers would be financed
under the project and are intended to replace the existing outdated Iranian
fleet in the Gulf. The vessels would be constructed abroad in 12 months and
would cost about US$325,000 each under present quotation. The main specifi-
cations of the 220-GT double rigger trawler would be:
GT Capacity:   220 tons       Fish hold freezing capacity:  135.9 m
Length:        26.5 m         Fuel tank capacity:  9,300 gallons
Breadth:        7.0 a         Water tank capacity: 2,000 gallons
Depth:          3.7 m         Crew members:  25
Hull:          Steel          Service speed:  11 knots/hour
Engine:        425 HP         Nautical equipment:  Magnetic compass, auto-
pilot, radio-telephone,
direction and fish finders
6.        The double rigger trawler would catch shrimp for about four months
and fish for about six months a year. The expected annual catch of shrimp
would be about 700 tons and of fish about 350 tons. This class of trawlers
would also be serviced in one of the three main fishing ports ofAbadan,
Bushehr, or Bandar Abbas.
7.        The project also proposes financing of 25 trap fishing vessels and
25 tuna drift net boats. These vessels, of about 50-GT capacity, would have
a wooden hull with an overall length of 16.5 m, breadth of about 6.8 m and
depth of about 2.9 m. They would be powered with a diesel engine of about
90 HP and would carry a crew of about 15 and hold about 30 tons of fish.
The boats would be equipped with mechanical trap or net haulers, insulated
iceboxes, and short-wave radios. These improvements over the traditional
vessels should be designed and determined by the master fishermen in the
proposed training centers at Bandar Abbas and Bushehr. These boats would
either replace or add to the existing aging fleet of same tonnage and broad
specifications. The boats would be procured either abroad or constructed
in Iran in four months, at an estimated cost of Ri 3 million (US$40,000) for
the trap fishing boats and RI 3.5 million (US$50,000) for the tuna fishing
boats. These vessels might be serviced by the fishermen themselves and in



ANNEX 6
Page 3
many ports along the coast of the Gulf and Oman Sea, such as Chabahar, Jask,
Bandar-Lengeh, Doyyer, Bushehr, etc.
8.        The trap fishing boats are operated for about nine months a year,
from September to June, because of the hot weather. They use 60 to 100 traps
made of circular wire and wood of about 2 m diameter and depth. The traps
cost Rl 3,000 each and last about one fishing season.  The expected annual
catch per boat would be about 85 tons.
9,        The difference in cost between t_ t-rap fishing boat and the tuna
drift net fishing boat is essentially due to the cost of the drift net, esti-
mated at Ri 500,000 (US$10,000).  The net wouSd be made of nylon twine, and
would be 2,000 m long and 18 m deep. The fishermen would cast the tuna drift
net in the evening and haul it in the next morning. It is expected that each
boat would catch annually about 65,000 pieces of small Indian Ocean blue fin
of about 4 kg each. The catch would be gutted, cleaned and salted on board
and sold in the coastal markets.
Refrigerated Trucks and Boad Engines
10.       The proposed project would provide funds for financing six refri-
gerated trucks and about 50 engines of 50 HP. The refrigerated trucks, of
20 tons capacity, would be used by fishing companies to ship frozen fish
from the landing area to cold storages along the coast or to marketing centers
in Tehran and other main urban areas. The estimated cost of a truck is about
US$80,000 equivalent. The 50-HP engines would be financed to power fish
carriers and launches equipped with insulated holds. These crafts would buy
fish from the fishing boats at sea, and supply it to markets and processors
on shore. These purchasing boats have a very useful function as they increase
the maneuverability of the fishing boats. The estimated cost of a 50-HP
engine is US$5,000 equivalent.
Miscellaneous Fishing Gear and Equipment
11.       Finally, the project provides for financing miscellaneous fishing
gear and equipment for traditional fishermen. This investment is intended
to remove serious technological limitations. It would include 25-HP outboard
engines to equip dugout canoes, traps, radio-telephones, insulated iceboxes,
beach seine nets and small trawl nets.  The quantities, costs and life span
of the equipment proposed is presented in Table 1. This equipment would be
made available to fishermen, under credit by Shilat Jonoub's Commercial De-
partment, and would be promoted for use by the training centers in Bushe-ar
and Bandar Abbas.

Projected Financial Results
1.        The internal financial returns, and those from sensitivity analyses,
for representative main investments in the Iranian fisheries project are
shown below:
Internal    Investment   Operating   Annual

600-GT Stern Trawler                21            18            18        16

Trap Fishing Boat                   23            20            16        17
Tuna Drift Net Fishing Boat         31            26            24        24
20-Ton Refrigerated Trucks          49            38            45        35
2.,       The internal returns are based on benefits resulting from the in-
vestments after income tax of 15%. The current prices for both inputs and
outputs were applied in calculating these returns, assuming therefore that
they will continue at their present levels. The production yields applied
are generally conservative when compared to the yields obtained presently
by the private fishing companies along the sourthern coast of Iran. Detailed
assumptions used for computation are shown in Tables 1-7.
3.        The various sensitivity tests applied to each model assume lower
catch or higher costs; the returns have remained satisfactory in all cases.
Net income from these investments would be sufficiently high to make them
attractive to the sub-borrowers.
4,        It is expected that a minimum accumulated surplus income of about
US$2.9 million would result from the US$1.0 million investment that the
traditional fishermen would have made by the time the project reached its
full development.

ANNEX 12

FISHERIES PROJECT
Economic Return Calculations
1.        The main project benefits to the iranian economy would be:
(a) increased fish production for domestic consumption and shrimp
for export estimated at 18,358 tons and 500 tons respectively,
at full development. This annual incremental production is
valued at US$9.6 million of which about US$1.5 million would
result from export of shrimp;
(b) better management of marine resources along the southern coast
of Iran;
(c) better fish marketing techniques in the domestic market, which
would increase the availability of less costly animal protein
for lower income groups;
(d) extension of modern fishing methods to traditional fishermen
and increase in their production potential, resulting in an
improved standard of living;
(e) extension of credit facilities to a wide range of fishermen
along the southern coast; and
(f) valuable experience for ADFI and Shilat Jonoub in fisheries
credit operations.
2.        In calculating the economic return, the following assumptions were
made:
(a) the prices of investment items and operating cost items are
in real terms at current price levels;
(b) the prices of fresh and frozen fish produced are in real terms
at Iranian current price levels because the quality of tha
fish produced precludes their being traded internatioually
under the present production conditions in Iran, These prices
(US$441/ton) are about 33; under the international prices fob
Bandar Abbas. Shrimp werF valuEd at international pr.ces fob
Bandar Abbas (US$3000/ifon>;
(c)  the prevai-ling commercial         exacI s axc'ange rate was applied to
foreign exchar.ge costs and protect benefits;



ANNEX 12
Page 2
(d) the labor component was costed at the financial wage rates;
(e) cost of management and training to Shilat Jonoub, including
technical assistance, additional counterpart staff, build-
ings, vehicles and equipment and administrative costs, was
charged to the project; and
(f) benefits opportunities as a result of technical assistance
and training were not credited to the project; however, it
was assumed that investment in engines and equipment would
result in 5% incremental production, due to longer fishing
time and increased productivity because of less time spent
in repairs, and also to Improved production techniques.
3.        Based on these assumptions, the overall economic return would be
about 35%. To test the project components against changes in investment cost
and operating results, a sensitivity analysis was carried out which gave the
following returns:
+ 10% investment costs          31%
+ 15% investment costs          29%
+ 10% operating costs          31%
+ 15% operating costs          29%
- 10% sales                    27%
- 15% sales                    22%
4.        The test shows that investments projected are attractive and would
result in substantial gain to the economy.
