                              RESTRUCTURING PAPER



A. SUMMARY

1.      In letter dated October 31, 2012 the Ministry of Planning requested the
International Development Association (IDA) to proceed with the restructuring for the
Bolivia Land for Agricultural Development Project Credit No. 4366-BO, P087925. This
level II restructuring of the Credit would provide for (i) the reformulation of the Project
Results Matrix to better reflect and quantify the targets of the Project as the result of the
Mid-Term review held in February, 2012; (ii) the establishment of a new disbursement
category; and (iii) a reallocation of Credit proceeds.

2.     The current restructuring does not extend the Credit closing date. The closing
date was extended once on May 30, 2012 from June 29, 2012 to March 31, 2014.

3.    The proposed changes would allow the Project to: (i) fully reach its Project
Development Objective; (ii) use and disburse all the Credit funds; and (iii) strengthen the
monitoring and evaluation activities.


B. PROJECT STATUS

4.      Project implementation has continued to show improvement. The Project has
helped to establish 236 Productive Associations (PAs), benefitting approximately 2,862
mainly poor indigenous families and resulting in the inclusion of approximately 155,000
has of land for productive uses. Two new municipalities have been added to the Project
area within the pilot department of Santa Cruz (Concepcion and San Ignacio de Velasco,
in the Chiquitania region), following the completion of additional social, environmental
and economic analyses

5.      The Project Coordination Unit (PCU) is performing satisfactorily. It has
improved its fiduciary performance. The FM rating was upgraded from Moderately
Unsatisfactory to Moderately Satisfactory, and Procurement rating from Moderately
Satisfactory to Satisfactory. As of December 2012, US$9.4 million (63%) of Credit
funds have been disbursed. Disbursement pace will accelerate further in the second half
of FY2013, as new PAs start their productive investments.

6.     Government commitment to the Project remains strong. The Minister of Rural
Development and Land has been monitoring closely Project implementation, and the
President of Bolivia has participated in recent launching events in the new municipalities.
A decision has been made to focus the Project on the “community shares? land access
mechanism, aimed mainly at indigenous peoples’ territories (TCOs), reflecting (i)
                                             1
government priorities; (ii) substantial demand for this mechanism; and (iii) land market
trends that have resulted in lack of affordable land outside TCOs, coupled with slow
progress on property regularization within the Project area. As a result, there will not be
a need to make the revolving fund operational. At the same time, this decision has helped
to simplify project implementation arrangements since it will not be necessary to bring in
an Intermediary Financial Institution to help implement component 1 for establishing a
land credit facility.


C. PROPOSED CHANGES

      Results/indicators

7.      Adjustments to the Project Results Matrix are proposed in Annex 1. These
adjustments reflect (i) the evolution of Project design, including particularly the
Government’s decision to focus on the community shares land access mechanism; (ii) the
recommendations from the analysis carried out during the February 2012 MTR to ensure
better monitoring and evaluation, and (iii) increased attention to gender issues and the
related measurement of gender-differentiated impacts

      Disbursement arrangements

8.      The establishment of a new disbursement category in the Financing Agreement is
proposed to make explicit the expenditures for consultant services, training and operating costs
for Part B of the Project. This Part consists of the support for investment subprojects, and
financing of not only investment subprojects but also technical assistance and training for the
preparation of investment plans. No changes to procurement arrangements will be needed.

       Reallocations

9.      A reallocation of Credit proceeds is proposed across disbursement categories to reflect
the evolution of the Project, which has resulted in an increased emphasis on the community
shares land access mechanism under Part B of the project, and the need of additional field staff
for implementation, technical assistance and for the communication strategy.

10.    With the exception of category (1) that will be reduced, and (4) for the PPF that remains
unchanged, all other categories will be increased.
