PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BANGLADESH SHALLOW TUBEWELLS PROJECT
(CREDIT 724-BD)
HIGHLIGHTS
The project was a direct product of the 1972 Bank Group-sponsored Land
and Water Resources Sector Study that emphasized, inter alia, groundwater develop-
ment in Bangladesh where surface water resources were seasonally scarce. The main
objectives of the project were to increase foodgrain production and farm incomes,
rationalize and strengthen rural institutions, and improve utilization of existing
irrigation facilities. These goals were to be met through sale, installation and
utilization of about 10,000 shallow tubewells (STWs) to enable dry season irriga-
tion, credit facilities through the nationalized commercial banking system,
upgrading repair and maintenance facilities for all irrigation equipment in the
NW region, and evaluation studies assessing project impact and the effectiveness
of repair and maintenance services.
The project was generally well conceived andJcan be considered a success.
Government's performance in carrying out its obligations under the project was
generally satisfactory. Due mainly to initial procurement problems, implementation
took 1.5 years longer than originally expected. Nevertheless, appraisal targets of
STWs sold were eventually exceeded by 10%. Cash sales did not meet expectations,
but credit sales to individuals were about double appraisal estimates. Civil
work targets were met except for thana-level workshops and storage tanks.
However, only about 50% of expected tools and equipment for various workshops
was obtained. Socio-economic studies were conducted, and various technical
reports on equipment maintenance were prepared. Reflecting mainly taka devalua-
tion during implementation and some reductions in project scope, total project
cost proved about 15% less than appraisal estimates, and IDA Credit savings
totalled US$1.8 M (11%). The project resulted in an estimated 102,000 tons of
incremental foodgrains by 1982-83, which are expected to increase to about
120,000 tons by full development in 1988-89. The project's economic rate of
return is estimated at 46%, compared with an appraisal estimate of 48%. About
118,000 farm families have received irrigation capability through the project,
and to date about 6.4 M mandays of annual incremental employment have resulted.
Other points of interest are:
-    Elimination of the public hire-purchase system for STWs and establishment
of commercial banks as creditors for STW purchases proved important insti-
tutional successes of the project (paras 3.03(b), 5.06, and 8.01).
-    Benefiting farmers to date have generally not cultivated wheat with dry
season STW irrigation, as expected at appraisal, but have opted for paddy
(paras 6.01-6.08).
-    After initial STW procurement problems, incorporation of farmers' choice
procedures in such procurement was satisfactory and expediting (paras 5.02-
5.04).
-    Further exploitation of groundwater, especially in the NW region, should be
preceded by establishment of an integrated system for its regulation, includ-
ing necessary legislation, legal sanctions, and regular monitoring (paras
1.06 and 8.01).






I. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 1/
Identification, Preparation and Appraisal
1.01    The Project was identified in 1972, prepared in early 1975, appraised
in 1976, and completed on December 31, 1982. 2/ Credit 724-BD was signed on
July 1, 1972, became effective on December 9, 1977, and closed December 31,
1982. 3/ The main objectives of the Project were to increase foodgrain
production in Northwest Bangladesh and to strengthen institutional services
complementary to this goal. The Project had four components carried out over
four years: (a) sale and installation of 10,000 STWs on cash and credit, (b)
credit facilities through nationalized commercial banks (NCBs) to eligible
IRDP groups and individuals, (c) upgrading repair and maintenance facilities
for all irrigation equipment in the NW, and (d) evaluation studies for
assessment of project benefits and effectiveness of repair and maintenance
facilities. The Project was to be carried out principally by three agencies:
BADC, IRDP, and two NCBs (Sonali and Janata). For effective coordination,
the Project's organizational structure was to include three executive
committees at Project, district and thana levels, as well as a coordination
committee at ministerial level.
Implementation
1.02    Due mainly to initial procurement problems, implementation took over
1.5 years longer than originally expected. However, appraisal targets of
STWs sold were eventually exceeded by 10% with installation of 11,000 wells.
This was made possible by developing and following a farmers' choice proce-
dure (paras 5.02-5.03). However, due to difficulties in organizing eligible
IRDP groups, sale to IRDP groups fell short of the appraisal estimate (39%
vs. 60%). Cash sales also did not meet expectations, but NCB credit sales to
individuals were about double that of appraisal estimates (58% vs. 30%).
Although implemented behind schedule, civil works of the regional workshop at
Bogra, five zonal workshops and 80 thana workshops were completed by December
1982. However, only about 50% of expected tools and equipment for various
workshops was obtained. Evaluation studies for assessment of Project
benefits and socio-economic characteristics of beneficiaries have also been
completed, but behind original schedules due to change of consultants.
Various reports of a workshop management consultant have also been finished.
Reflecting (a) changes in Project content with respect to workshops,
machinery and equipment, as well as (b) GOB's restrictions on import of
1/ This report incorporates comments received from GOB on an earlier draft.
2/ Actual Project completion was about 18 months later than appraisal
estimate (June 1981).
3/ Credit closing was extended (telex, December 23, 1981) by one year from
its original date of December 31, 1981. GOB has recently advised IDA
that the undisbursed balance in the Credit (US$ 1.8 M) may be cancelled.



vehicles, and (c) taka devaluation over the course of implementation, total
Project cost (US$21.5 M) was 15% less (in US$) than appraisal expectation
(US$25.4 M), and Credit disbursements up to May 16, 1983 were US$ 14.2 M, out
of the original allocation of US$ 16.0 M.
1.03    Agricultural Impact.   Compared with an appraisal estimate of 10,000
STWs irrigating 150,000 ac @ 15 ac/well, 11,000 STWs were actually installed
by 1982-83, irrigating about 118,000 ac @ 10.73 ac/well on average. At full
development, expected in 1988-89, these 11,000 STWs are anticipated to
irrigate a minimum of 140,000 ac @ 12.73 ac/STW on average. Cropping inten-
sities increased from 133% (without-project) to 176% (-ith-project) by
1982-83, against appraisal expectation of 144% to 176%; by fual development
it is expected to reach 180%. Incremental foodgrain optduction of 92,000
metric tons, comprising 40,000 tons of rice and 52,000 tons of wheat, was
projected at appraisal. By 1982-83 this reached about 102,000 tons, compris-
ing only rice. At full development, some reduction in rice is now expected
with a corresponding increase in wheat, and incremental foodgrains of 120,000
tons are anticipated consisting of 80,000 tons of rice and 40,000 tons of
wheat. Farmers in the Project area are expected by full development to
realize about 95% increase in farm incomes on average. In addition, about
6.4 M mandays of employment is currently being generated with the Project,
which is anticipated to rise to 7.8 M mandays by full development.
1.04    Economic Impact.   The Bangladesh economy is projected to realize a
46% ERR on Project investments, in contrast to 48% estimated at appraisal.
Economic returns are expected to remain highly attractive even with no fur-
ther cropping pattern changes into the future. These results confirm the
merit of GOB's emphasis on STWs for irrigation sector development.
1.05    Borrower and IDA Performance.   GOB's performance in carrying out its
obligations under the Project generally was satisfactory. IDA supervision
was regular and done with a high degree of staffing continuity.
1.06    Lessons Learned.   The STW Project was well conceived and is con-
sidered generally a success. The Project would be suitable for replication
with the following suggested modifications, some of which were introduced
during implementation: (a) allowing farmers' choice of equipment; (b)
streamlining procedures for processing STW applications; (c) providing
simpler application procedures for credit from NCBs; and (d) encouraging more
private sector participation in repair and maintenance activities. Group
purchase has been less successful under the Project; on equity grounds,
therefore, it would be desirable to give increased attention to design of a
future project to ensure group purchase and equitable and productive use of
shared equipment. The Rural Development (RD) I Project (Cr.631-BD) and the



DTW II Project (Cr. 1287-BD) with their IrrigatieLr Manageu.ent erogram
approach 1/ could provide some guidance for such design adjustments. However
practical problems involving, inter alia, socioeconomic power imbalances at
village-level and the difficulties in group formation and cooperation, in its
true sense, are definite constraints to rapid expansion of IMP or similar
programs. These grassroots constraints should be recognized and well under-
stood. The Project's revolving fund, initially established by GOB at Tk 4.5
M, was an asset to the Project but should be enlarged in any future project;
such enhancement, however, may prove difficult in view of GOB resource
limitations. The possibility of avoiding proliferation of project-specific
administrative committees should be examined, and the feasibility of
strengthening existing, more general agricultural and rural institutions for
implementation should be explored. Lastly, and perhaps most importantly,
a future STW project should be implemented with prerequisite regulation of
groundwater development, supported by necessary legislation, legal sanctions,
and regular monitoring of groundwater exploitation. The need for such
regulation is recognized within GOB as evidenced by some very recent prelimi-
nary codification of groundwater development regulations.
II. BACKGROUND
2.01    The Bangladesh economy depends heavily on agriculture.    The agricul-
tural sector accounts for about 55% of GDP, 70% of the labor force, and over
80% of all exports. Moreover, much of its industrial output comes from
processing agricultural produce or producing inputs for use in agriculture.
Rice is by far its most important crop, accounting for about 78% of cropped
area, followed by jute (6%) and a variety of other crops such as pulses,
oilseeds, wheat, sugarcane and vegetables (16%).
1/ One of the main reasons for underutilization of minor irrigation equip-
ment is the poor organization and management of user groups. To remedy
this problem, the Irrigation Management Program (IMP) was introduced
first under the RD-1 Project in 1979-80. BADC, IRDP, and Department of
Agriculture (Extension) officers at district and thana levels are jointly
responsible for implementing IMP which aims at increasing the command
area per unit of irrigation equipment and thus reducing irrigation costs.
The essential features of IMP are, inter alia: (a) preparation of action
plans; (b) organization of KSS meetings to explain the utility of water
management; (c) training of managers, model farmers and chairpersons of
KSSs, TCCA inspectors, village accountants, block leaders, fieldmen, and
tubewell operators; (d) laying of proper irrigation channels; and (e)
preparation of irrigation budgets. IMP proved very successful when first
implemented on a limited scale under close supervision, and is intended
for gradual replication nationwide, currently underway for DTWs and LLPs.
Limited cooperative spirit and disputes involving compensation for field
channel realignments (land and labor), however, have slowed progress in
certain areas.

2.02    During the 1960s, agricultural production grew at an annual rate of
about 2.5% and foodgrain production at 2.4%, both lagging behind population
growth of about 3% p.a. As a result, foodgrain imports increased from 0.6 M
tons in 1960-61 to 1.5 M tons in 1969-70. Severe drought coupled with the
disruptions caused by the 1971 liberation war resulted in sharply reduced
production in 1972-73 necessitating food imports of 2.8 M tons. Despite
substantial recovery over the next decade, Bangladesh still has had to import
on average about 1.6 M tons of foodgrains annually.
2.03    Agricultural development in Bangladesh is constrained by scarcity of
cultivable land, limited potential on a large part of cultivable land, a long
dry season from November to March, the small and fragmented nature of farm
holdings and climatic vagaries. On the positive side, Bangladesh has large
areas of highly fertile deltaic soils, a tropical climate suitable for
year-round cropping, some surface water and abundant groundwater resources
for dry season irrigation. The need to maintain minimum flows in rivers
during the dry season limits the potential for surface water irrigation, but
considerable groundwater potential still remains to be developed. Two kinds
of tubewells are used in Bangladesh--deep tubewells (DTWs) and shallow
tubewells (STWs). In 1978-79 only about 9,000 DTWs and 7,000 STWs were in
operation, irrigating about 0.37 M ac. In contrast, by 1980-81 about 11,500
DTWs and 24,000 STWs were in operation, irrigating about 0.91 M ac. Compared
to DTWs, STWs are simpler to install and maintain, require much smaller
farmer groups for optimal utilization, and are considerably less expensive.
Accordingly, GOB has shifted priority to STWs wherever possible. GOB's major
agricultural development objectives are to achieve self-sufficiency in
foodgrains, create employment for the rural poor, and to increase export
earnings. The strategy adopted emphasizes strengthening rural institutions,
better utilization of existing irrigation facilities and further expansion of
irrigation through low-cost, short gestation, minor irrigation schemes. The
Shallow Tubewells Project was designed in consonance with these objectives.
2.04    Bangladesh has received IDA assistance for various agricultural
development projects, several of which relate to water resource development.
Prior to independence, two IDA-financed water control projects were com-
pleted. Since independence more water development projects have been
completed--e.g., Chandpur II Irrigation Project (Cr. 340-BD), Northwest
Tubewells Project (Cr. 341-BD), and the Shallow Tubewells Project
(Cr. 724-BD). In addition to the latter projects, six additional irrigation
projects are currently being implemented that include distribution of minor
irrigation facilities: Low Lift Pump Project (Cr. 990-BD), Hand Tubewells
Project (Cr. 1140-BD), Deep Tubewells II Project (Cr. 1287-BD), Barisal
Irrigation Project (Cr. 542-BD), Karnafuli Irrigation Project (Cr. 605-BD),
and Muhuri Irrigation Project (Cr. 725-BD). Also, the RD-I Project (Cr.
631-BD) and the Agricultural Credit I Project (Cr. 1147-BD) provide finance
for small-scale schemes.
2.05    This report is based on a draft completion report prepared by the
Economics Department of the Rajashahi University under contract with BADC,
the findings of a limited follow-up IDA mission in 1983, and a review of IDA
files.



III. IDENTIFICATION, PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
3.01    The Project was identified as part of the 1972 Land and Water
Resources Survey ("Nine-Volume Study") conducted by IDA and was prepared
by BADC in 1975. Following the priority given to STWs, by 1976 GOB had
approved, or was considering, proposals for installation of an additional
35,000 STWs over the next 4-5 years--2,500 under the IDA-financed RD-1
Project, 5,500 under the ADB-financed Agricultural Credit Project, 17,000
under bilateral assistance from Japan, Germany and India, and 10,000 under
the IDA STW Project. An IDA mission visited Bangladesh in February 1976 to
appraise a proposed STW project, and a follow-up mission, in August-September
1976.
3.02    The major objectives of the Project were to (a) increase foodgrain
production, (b) improve farm income levels, (c) rationalize and strengthen
rural institutions, and (d) improve utilization of existing investments in
irrigation facilities. The Project was in consonance with the strategy set
forth in the Bangladesh Land and Water Resources Sector Study by the Bank
Group in 1972 that emphasized the advisability of groundwater development
where surface water resources were not readily available.
3.03    In view of the concurrent operations of other projects involving
groundwater development (e.g., BADC's on-going program of "hire purchase"
for sale of tubewells on credit, IDA's RD-1 Project, and ADB's Agricultural
Credit Project through Bangladesh Krishi Bank (BKB)), issues that arose
during appraisal were (a) appropriate geographical areas to be covered under
the Project, (b) institutional arrangements for sale of STWs and provision of
credit to farmers, (c) feasibility and consistency of GOB's overall program
for STW development, (d) scope of the project, and (e) cost recovery for
irrigation. The following formulations were agreed to during appraisal and
negotiations by GOB and IDA:
(a) To benefit relatively poorer zones and to increase food
production in food-deficit areas in the NW, the Project
would cover all areas with technically acceptable groundwater
potential rather than be limited only to areas with optimal
potential;
(b) To strike a balance between the objectives of growth, equity,
and institution building, distribution of Project-financed
tubewells would be through three channels: (i) cash sales by
BADC, (ii) sales to IRDP groups with credit from nationalized
commercial banks (NCBs), and (iii) sales to individuals on
CB credit with larger downpayments and stricter security
arrangements than for IRDP groups. All three channels were to
operate in parallel. To ensure participation by small farmers,
5,000 STWs would be reserved initially for IRDP groups. It was
agreed further that institutional arrangements and terms and



conditions for sale of Project-financed STWs would be satis-
factory to IDA and that by end-December 1977, BADC would phase
out its hire-purchase system for STWs on a countrywide basis;
(c) After reviewing the feasibility and consistency of the overall
program for the total proposed 35,000 incremental STWs, it
was agreed that uniform pricing principles should be followed
for all STWs installed in the Project area, irrespective of
financing source and procurement method. GOB also agreed
to establish an expert committee to review the issue of
groundwater development in Bangladesh, and submit to IDA for
review not later than December 31, 1979 its proposals for
regulation of groundwater development; 1/
(d) Since an Extension and Research Project was anticipated
for the NW, 2/ the Project would include only services
essential for the successful operation of Project STWs,
i.e., strengthening of repair and maintenance facilities
for irrigation equipment in the NW; and
(e) While there were no subsidies on STWs, other modes of
irrigation (low lift pumps, deep tubewells, and gravity
irrigation), often existing side-by-side with STWs, were
still heavily subsidized. Therefore during Credit nego-
tiations, the IDA delegation emphasized concern about
lack of a consistent GOB policy for cost recovery under
various irrigation schemes currently under implementation,
and proposed an additional covenant requiring GOB by
December 31, 1978 to submit to IDA a comprehensive plan to
recover O&M costs and as much capital costs as possible for
all irrigation facilities, and a timetable for implementa-
tion of this plan. However, it was agreed eventually that
GOB would only prepare and submit to IDA for comment a cost
recovery plan with respect to irrigation facilities and
1/ While no such expert committee was ever established, the covenant was
partially met for the NW by extension of the groundwater model prepared
by Sir M. MacDonald and Partners Ltd. originally prepared under the
Northwest Tubewells Project. In the original exercise, the extent of
groundwater in the aquifers was analyzed, a groundwater model developed,
and exploitation potential determined. Later, to incorporate STWs, the
model was modified by refining hydrologic units into smaller areas. GOB
authorities unfortunately have failed to utilize the study results to
regulate groundwater exploitation or to formulate legislation for this
purpose. Similarly, model results have not been updated since requisite
thana irrigation maps have not been kept current.
2/ Two such projects were established (Cr. 729-BD and Cr. 828-BD). The
first was concentrated in NW; the second had nationwide scope.



schemes under BADC purview. 1/ Regarding those carried out
by other agencies, the GOB delegation agreed to convey IDA's
concern to higher authorities.
3.04    The project was approved by the IDA Board of Directors on June
16, 1977. The Credit was signed on July 1, 1977 and became effective on
December 9, 1977.
IV. THE APPRAISED PROJECT
4.01    Project Description.   The Project was designed to provide irrigation
to about 150,000 acres, and repair and maintenance facilities for irrigation
facilities in NW Bangladesh. It included four basic components:
(a) Installation of STWs. Provision of equipment, materials and
spare parts for installation of 10,000 power-driven STWs and
about 500 standby pumpsets, and preparation of thana irrigation
maps, including groundwater investigation where necessary;
(b) Credit Facilities. Provision of credit through two NCBs,
Sonali and Janata, to eligible IRDP groups and individuals
for financing purchase of about 9,000 STWs--an estimated 6,000
by IRDP groups and the balance by individuals; provision of
vehicles and office equipment for IRDP, TCCAs, and the NCBs;
completion of an inventory of all overdue and outstanding
institutional debt owed by members of KSSs; and preparation
of land registers for KSSs;
(c) Repair and Maintenance Facilities. Servicing infrastructure
for existing and proposed irrigation equipment in the NW,
including construction and equipping one regional workshop
(Bogra), five zonal workshops and about 100 thana workshops;
provision of a workshop management expert; equipment for
private workshops; and vehicles for BADC field staff;
(d) Monitoring and Evaluation. Carrying out Project evaluation
studies to assess (i) direct and indirect economic and financial
benefits derived from Project-financed STWs, (ii) socio-economic
characteristics of beneficiaries, and (iii) effectiveness of
improved repair and maintenance facilities.
4.02    Cost and Financing.   Total Project cost was estimated at US$ 25.4 M
(Tk 381 M at an exchange rate of US$1 = Tk 15), including about US$ 4.6 M in
import duties and taxes but excluding any incremental administration and
1/ No such report was ever submitted. However, BADC has agreed under
Imports Program Credits to phase out all rentals by end-FY84 (except
DTWs) and to institute full-cost pricing (except DTWs).

supervision costs. Foreign exchange costs were estimated at US$ 14.6 M, or
about 57% of total costs. Cost estimates were based on March 1977 price
levels. Originally estimated Project costs and financing plan are summarized
below:

4.03    The IDA Credit of US$ 16.0 M was to cover full foreign exchange costs
and a portion of local costs, or about 77% of the total net of taxes and
duties.  The balance (US$ 9.4 M) was to be financed from domestic sources.



- 9 -
To ensure availability of funds for prompt payment of local expenditures, it
was agreed that GOB would establish and maintain a Project Revolving Fund
with an initial contribution of Tk 4.5 M (US$ 0.3 M). The fund would be
replenished from: (a) IDA reimbursements against project expenditures, (b)
BADC receipts from cash sales of STWs and spare parts and rental of standby
pumpsets, (c) payments from IRDP-TCCAs and NCBs for purchase of vehicles and
office equipment, (d) contributions by NCBs for financing their share of
credit STW purchase, and (e) downpayments and installation payments (net of
repayments to NCBs) by farmers for tubewells purchased on credit.
4.04    Conditions of Credit effectiveness were that GOB approve a con-
solidated Project Proforma (PP) and that it establish the revolving fund and
make an initial contribution of Tk 4.5 M.
4.05    Management and Organization.   Project implementation was to involve
three principal agencies:
(a)  BADC would have responsibility for procurement, installation
and after-sales servicing of Project-financed STWs, and enhanced
repair and maintenance facilities for all irrigation equipment
in the NW. For regional and zonal workshops, BADC was to be
responsible for design finalization, tender document preparation,
contract awards, construction supervision and workshop equipment
procurement;
(b)  IRDP would have charge of organizing farmer cooperatives for
credit sales to groups, and administering and supervising credit
to TCCA-KSSs; and
(c)  Janata and Sonali Banks would provide credit to individual and
group buyers. These NCBs were also to have sole responsibility
for administering and supervising lending to individuals and to
help IRDP in this regard for group credit. In addition, the
Ministry of Land Administration, Local Government and Rural
Development and Co-operatives (MLGRD&C) was to participate
in project implementation by supervising construction/comple-
tion of thana workshops, helping to verify of credit records
of borrowers under the Project and providing project coordi-
nation through local governments in the field.
4.06    GOB provided assurances that an adequate number of additional staff
would be assigned to the various implementing agencies. It also gave
assurances that it would make adequate budgetary allocations to BADC and
IRDP for proper O&M of buildings, vehicles, and equipment used in the Project
and for importation of spare parts necessary for maintenance of irrigation
equipment.
4.07    Successful project implementation necessitated close coordination
among BADC, IRDP, and the NCBs. The organizational structure to achieve
this was modelled after that used in the RD-1 Project. The Project proposed
to have three levels of executive committees--thana, district and the



- 10 -
Project--each with defined composition and functions. In addition, a Project
Coordination Committee (PCC) was proposed at ministerial level.
4.08    Benefits.   It was expected that the Project would enable increased
cropping intensity and a shift from low-yielding, risky rainfed crops to
relatively low-risk, high-yielding irrigated crops. Three land use patterns
were distinguished according to ecological zones based on flood depths:
(a) Zone I:    Deep flooded area, dominated by Broadcast Aman paddy.
(b) Zone II:   Shallow flooded area, well suited for transplanted
Aman, but poorly suited for jute and Aus.
(c) Zone III:  Medium shallow flooded area well-suited for T. Aman
as well as for jute and Aus.
In Zone I cropping intensity was expected to decline from 135% to 120%
reflecting an anticipated shift from Aus/B. Aman and pulses to Boro paddy.
In the other two cases, it was to increase significantly: from 110% to 200%
and 160% to 200%. Paddy would continue to dominate the cropping patterns;
however, there would be considerable change in the relative weights of dif-
ferent crops. Wheat production was to increase significantly, and irrigated
HYV Boro would become the main paddy crop. Boro paddy was expected at
appraisal either to replace B. Aman or Aus, or to be an additional crop on
formerly dry season fallow land. With relatively cooler climate and more
permeable soils in the NW, the Project was also expected to induce a substan-
tial increase in irrigated wheat. Pulses and oilseeds grown as catch-crops
using residual moisture in the dry season were expected to be replaced by
vegetable crops, e.g., chillies, potatoes, brinjals and tomatoes. Supplemen-
tary irrigation during the wet season was also expected to cause a shift from
local to HYV T. Aman. The Project was expected to bring under irrigation an
additional 150,000 ac formerly producing mainly a single crop under rainfed
conditions. This irrigation expansion was projected to generate an addi-
tional 40,000 tons of rice and 52,000 tons of wheat.
4.09     The more intensive land use with-project would create incremental
farm labor demand of about 7.5 M mandays p.a., an increase of about 60% over
the pre-project level. With secondary employment effects, total employment
was projected to increase by 10-11 M mandays. Landless laborers were
expected to benefit most significantly. Emphasis was also given to institu-
tional development to assist small-medium farmers as well as farmer-groups.
Overall, about 40% of land expected to receive irrigation with-project was
anticipated to be operated by farmers then below subsistence levels, and
two-thirds of farm families directly benefitting to then have incomes below
subsistence levels.
4.10    The economic rate of return (ERR) to Project investments was
estimated at about 48%. Separate analyses with different cropping patterns
and ownership arrangements indicated that all such cases would be economi-
cally viable, the lowest return being about 35%. Sensitivity tests carried
out under a variety of unfavorable assumptions resulted in ERRs of over 30%.



- 11 -
Thus, the Project was found to be feasible technically and highly attractive
financially and economically. High expected returns were expected essen-
tially because of two factors: a low unit investment cost and short gestation
period. High economic returns, coupled with large unexploited groundwater
resources, made STWs among top priority investments for agricultural
development.
V. THE IMPLEMENTED PROJECT
5.01    Project Start-Up.   There was some delay in GOB approval of BADC's
Project Proforma (PP), one of the Credit effectiveness conditions. Accord-
ingly, the Credit was declared effective only on December 9, 1977 instead of
on September 30, 1977 as originally intended. The Project had a fairly
satisfactory start with respect to tender document preparation for STW
engines, pumps, and accessories and to preparation of thana irrigation maps.
ICB STW tenders were floated in March 1978; however, due to procurement
problems discussed below, actual procurement and installation of STWs started
only from 1979-80, instead of from 1977-78, and was completed in 1981-82
instead of 1980-81 as per the appraisal plan.
5.02    Procurement and Sales of STWs.   Procurement and sales of STWs lagged
far behind the original implementation schedule.   However, total sales even-
tually exceeded original targets as shown below:

/a  Includes standby pumpsets:   appraisal, 500 and actual, 50.
STW procurement delays were caused by failure of the ICB floated in March
1978 when none of the 62 engine/pump combinations offered by 47 bidders were
considered responsive by either BADC or IDA. To accelerate implementation,
IDA subsequently suggested, and BADC accepted, a procedure whereby BADC would
procure through prudent shopping an initial 1,500 STWs (later raised to
3,000) with spares and accessories, provided that these purchases (a) con-
sisted of 4-5 makes of STWs then operating satisfactorily in Bangladesh and
(b) encompassed a sufficiently wide price range to give farmers a choice
between lower cost/higher maintenance and higher cost/lower maintenance
pumpsets.



- 12 -
5.04    To procure the remainder, GOB set up a committee chaired by the
Secretary, MLGRD&C, that ranked STW sets already in operation as well as new
sets deemed technically suitable. This ranking was based on tested perfor-
mances of different pumps, taking into account comparative investment and
operating costs of different pump/engine combinations then operating in
Bangladesh as well as of new ones considered technically satisfactory. IDA
subsequently endorsed the selection committee's approach, and types and
numbers were agreed upon. A farmers' choice procedure was then developed
under which BADC first would obtain firm quotations for selected types six
months ahead of delivery and then immediately prepare and distribute
brochures containing descriptions and prices and inviting applications from
farmers. Farmers were then to indicate three preferences with applications
and to include downpayments of Tk 2,000/STW from groups and Tk 4,000 from
individuals. Based on farmer choice survey results, BADC placed orders, and
thereafter procurement progress was satisfactory.
5.05    In total, 11,050 sets were finally procured and 11,000 sold and
installed, leaving 50 standby pumpsets, as against an appraisal estimate of
10,500 procured, 10,000 sold, and 500 for standby.
5.06    Actual distributions of STWs by sales mode and district were as

While cash sales to individuals and credit sales to IRDP groups ultimately
fell short of appraisal estimates, NCB credit sales to individuals far sur-
passed expectations. It should be noted, however, that the appraisal did
not make any firm allocations between the three sales channels (para 3.03
(b)), allowing them to operate in parallel with actual allocations determined
by actual demand. IRDP group sales were disappointing due mainly to dif-
ficulties in organizing required groups within the limited time. Moreover,
many "groups" acquiring STWs proved in fact to be individuals and extended
families. On the whole, however, the overall program of STW sales, although



- 13 -
behind schedule, must be considered generally satisfactory. The Project
successfully introduced NCBs as creditors for STW purchase and, judging from
the larger sales percentage to individuals with credit, it is likely that in
future more farmers will come to NCBs for similar credit requirements. This
must be reviewed as a major institutional achievement of the Project.
Through November 1982, 8,760 applications had been received by NCBs for loans
totalling Tk 182.2 M, almost all of which were eventually sanctioned.
However, reports of lengthy and complicated procedures for obtaining credit
from NCBs, and of lack of sufficient experience on the part of bank loan
officers merit attention and correction in future, if valid. Unfortunately,
preliminary indications are as well that overdues are developing, in line
with the general, chronic problem in the rural credit sector.
5.07    Preparation of Thana Irrigation Maps.   All necessary boring and
testing were done expeditiously and results incorporated into the maps used
to facilitate site selections. All 69 thana irrigation maps were completed
as planned, but now these need updating with additional recordings of LLPs,
DTWs, as well as STWs.
5.08    Construction of Workshops.   The Project was to enable completion of
construction of the partially completed regional workshop at Bogra and con-
struction/development of five zonal workshops by May 1979. However, due
chiefly to lack of coordination among different BADC Irrigation Directorate
divisions this Project component stagnated for some time. All workshops were
administered by the M4echanization and Pumps (M&P) Division, also responsible
for LLPs but not STWs or DTWs, whereas the STW Division was responsible
for Project implementation. Delays were also caused by initial
non-availabilities of estimates for repair and renovations, problems in site
selection (Dinajpur), and temporary occupancy of the Bogra regional complex
by army personnel. Progress was made only after decisions were taken that
(a) M&P would continue to operate workshops and (b) funds would move from STW
to M&P to complete civil works and equipment purchases. Although behind
schedule, civil works on the regional workshop, five zonal workshops, and 80
of the 100 thana workshops were completed by December 1982. Out of 19
planned fuel storage tanks, civil works on 13 were completed; however,
because of high costs involved, construction of the remaining six fuel tanks
and 20 thana workshops was dropped ultimately from the Project.
5.09    Procurement of Machinery and Equipment.   To strengthen repair and
maintenance facilities for all irrigation equipment (LLPs, DTWs and STWs) in
the NW, the Project was to provide incremental machinery, equipment and hand
tool requirements for the Bogra Regional Workshop, five zonal workshops, and
about 100 thana workshops. A lump sum provision was also made for import of
machinery and hand tools for sale to private sector workshops. Reflecting
GOB's increased emphasis on privatization, the Project was later revised to
provide incremental machiaery, equipment and handtool requirements only for
the Bogra Regional Workshop, and incremental equipment for the zonal
workshops was dropped. In addition, zonal workshops proved not to have
enough skilled manpower to effect repair and maintenance since many staff
left for Middle East jobs. Procurement for tools and equipment for private
sector workshops for six district and 12 sub-divisional units was started,
but progress was slow due to procedural changes by BADC. Some suppliers



- 14 -
refused to deliver goods ordered. Out of 18 private workshop
owner-applicants, eight took back downpayments due to delay in equipment
procurement. The remaining ten private workshops owners are now getting
loans for equipment under the Agricultural Credit Project (1147-BD) directly
from the Bangladesh Bank/NCBs. About 250 toolboxes were to be sold to
trained mechanics. About 200 toolboxes were procured, but coula not be
distributed due to high prices and to inability to arrange credit with NCBs.
Therefore, these toolboxes were retained by BADC for use by its own
mechanics. On balance, about 50% of the original workshop machinery,
equipment and tools has been procured and put in use.
5.10    Repair and Maintenance.  To   strengthen repair and maintenance serv-
ices, BADC planned to employ an additional 125 mechanics and 375 assistant
mechanics during the Project period; but due to GOB restrictions on new
appointments up to end-December 1982, none could be hired. However, BADC
reports that after retraction of this hiring embargo for "Core Projects,"
most remaining positions were filled. About 250 private practicing mechanics
have also been trained in BADC zonal workshops. Of the total trained, more
than 50% (131) were recruited through IRDP and the rest, through BADC.
5.11    Vehicles and Office Equipment.    Procurement of office equipment for
BADC has been completed, but due to delay in indent processing and subsequent
GOB embargo on purchase of vehicles, the vehicle procurement target could not
be fully achieved. Out of 31 pickups proposed, none could be procured and
only some jeeps and 3-ton trucks were purchased. In total, 24 vehicles, 80
motorcycles and 500 bicycles were procured, against an appraisal estimate
of 74 vehicles, 135 motorcycles and 800 bicycles. Out of these totals, two
vehicles, 40 motorcycles, and 320 bicycles were supplied to IRDP. GOB's
general restriction on procurement of vehicles was a principal cause of
procurement shortfalls. However, vehicles and equipment provided from other
assistance, e.g., RD-1 Project, compensated to some extent for these short-
falls, and implementing agencies seemed to experience minimal hindrance to
their operations under the Project.
5.12    Project Evaluation Studies.   Monitoring and evaluation were con-
sidered an integral part of the Project. Initially, Bangladesh Institute
of Development Studies (BIDS) was selected to undertake Project evaluation
studies assessing direct and indirect economic and financial benefits
derived from Project-financed STWs and socio-economic characteristics of
beneficiaries. BIDS agreed to submit its report by December 1981. Unfor-
tunately, after a lapse of one year, they informed of their inability to do
the work and later an offer was obtained from Rajshahi University. With IDA
approval, detailed TORs were prepared, and it was agreed that the final
evaluation report would be submitted by end-December 1982. A consultant from
the University submitted his report within this deadline.
5.13    Technical Assistance.  To help in implementation of the repair and
maintenance improvement program in the NW, a Workshop Management Expert was
to be hired for two years. Accordingly, a consultant was appointed as
Workshop Management Consultant in March 1978, initially for 24 months and
with later extension to 58 months (upto December 1982). His assignments were
to: (a) check existing layouts of completed workshops, (b) review sites and



- 15 -
layouts for proposed regional and zonal workshops, (c) prepare a detailed
work program for construction completion of various workshops, procurements
and installation of workshop equipment, recruitment of additional staff,
etc., (d) delineate responsibilities for workshops at thana, zonal and
regional levels, and (e) advise on keeping of stores and inventories. The
consultant performed his assigned duties satisfactorily and submitted regular
detailed reports with useful suggestions.
5.14    Costs and Financing.   Chiefly as a result of changes in Project
content as described above, total cost decreased from the appraisal estimate
of Tk 381 M (US$ 25 M equivalent @ US$1 = Tk 15) to Tk 368.4 M (US$ 21.49 M
equivalent at a weighted average exchange rate of US$1 = Tk 17.145). IDA
disbursement up to June 1983 was US$ 14.2 M, against the Credit allocation of
US$ 16.0 M. Local contribution was US$7.3 M equivalent, against an appraisal
estimate of US$9.40 M. Both appraisal estimates and actual expenditures
shown below exclude incremental administration and supervision costs borne by
GOB, equivalent to about US$ 2.24 M. A summary table is given below; details
of public expenditures are in Annex 2.

VI. AGRICULTURAL IMPACT
6.01    Appraisal estimates of agricultural impacts, actuals in 1982-83, and
current estimates for full development in about 1988-89 are discussed below:
6.02    Irrigated Area.   Appraisal estimates of STW distribution and
irrigated area in different ecological zones, compared with actuals in
1982-83 and current estimates for full development, are shown in detail in
Annex 3 and are summarized as follows:
STWs and Irrigated Area
Number of STWs          Irrigated Area (ac)
Installed       Average Area/STW      Total
Appraisal                10,000                 15           150,000
1982-83                  11,000              10.73           118,000
Full Development         11,000               12.73          140,000
Compared with the appraisal estimate of 10,000 STWs eventually irrigating
150,000 ac @ 15 ac/unit, the 1982-83 Rajshahi University evaluation study
found about 11,000 STWs installed and irrigating about 118,000 ac in 1982-83
@ 10.73 ac/unit on average. This lower average rate of STW coverage was
mainly due to a large shortfall in Zone III (9.52 ac vs. 20 ac/STW estimated
at appraisal). At appraisal this zone was expected to experience increased
cultivation of irrigated wheat requiring much less water than Boro paddy;
however, this wheat production did not materialize.

In view of the rapid increase in irrigated wheat cultivation in adjacent
areas and based on discussions with area farmers, at full development the
11,000 STWs are now expected to irrigate a minimum of 140,000 ac @ 12.73 ac
per STW on average.
6.03    Cropping Patterns. At appraisal the Project was expected to increase
cropping intensities and cause a shift from low-yielding, risky rainfed crops
to relatively low-risk and HYV irrigated crops. Paddy was expected to con-
tinue to dominate cropping patterns, but there was to be considerable change
in the relative importance of the various paddy crops. With the Project,
irrigated HYV Boro would dominate and would be cultivated either as a
replacement to B. Aman or Aus crops, or as an additional crop on lands
formerly left fallow during the dry season. There was expected to be a
substantial increase in wheat cultivation with irrigation. The area under
oilseeds and pulses, however, was to decrease considerably. Appraisal
estimates of cropping patterns by ecological zone and for the whole project
area are shown in Annex 4, actuals in 1982-83 in Annex 5, and current
estimates at full development in Annex 6. Comparisons are summarized below:

6.04    As envisaged at appraisal and based on comparisons of
Project-benefitted areas and adjacent areas not serviced by irrigation, Boro
paddy in fact replaced a large portion of Aus and B. Aman by 1982-83;
however, wheat cultivation declined. As projected at appraisal, the area
under pulses and oilseeds also dropped, but cultivation of vegetables
likewise failed to develop, in large measure due to marketing constraints.
Judging from the current trend of wheat cultivation in the NW, however, and
in view of the fact that irrigation water requirements for wheat are half
those of Boro paddy, is likely that at full development there will be some
reduction of the present (1982-83) Boro paddy area and corresponding increase
,in wheat. Accordingly at full development, Boro paddy is now expected to
cover about 90,400 ac and wheat, 49,900 ac, while the relative importance of

the other varieties of paddy and other crops would remain the same as in
1982-83.

were projected at appraisal (see Annex 7). In 1982-83 incremental production
amounted to about 103,000 tons of rice and -600 tons of wheat, totalling
102,000 net tons (see Annex 8). Current estimates for 1988-89 (full develop-

should decline, as anticipated at appraisal; but in contrast to appraisal
expectations, vegetable production will decline.
VII. FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC RESULTS
7.01    Impact on Farm Income and Employment.   STW investments enabled area
farmers to switch from relatively low-yielding, risky rainfed crops to lower
risk and HYV irrigated crops, as discussed above. These changes in cropping
patterns resulted in significant changes to farm incomes. Estimates of these
changes are summarized below by ecological zone (para 4.08) for repre-
sentative one-acre farms:
Without Project     With Project      Change
----------------(Taka)---------- (%)-
Zone I          2,000               3,505          + 75
Zone II         2,240               4,605          +105
Zone III        2,035               4,240          +108
Lower estimated with-project returns for the representative Zone I farmer
reflect the limited cropping possibilities in his deep flooded area during
the monsoon season. To take full advantage of the Boro season for paddy
cultivation, he must forego most of his monsoonal paddy crops. Farmers in
Zones II and III are utilizing irrigation for cultivation of both Boro paddy
and wheat as substitutes for less profitable oilseeds and pulses. An
estimated 118,000 farm families to-date have received irrigation capability
through the Project; by full development this is expected to increase by
about 20%. Incremental annual employment estimated at 6.4 M mandays has
resulted thus far with the Project, which is expected to reach about 7.8 M
mandays by full development. This contrasts with 7.5 M mandays p.a.
estimated at appraisal.
7.02    Socio-economic Impact.   Several initial conclusions can be drawn
about the socio-economic impact of the Project and the characteristics of
Project beneficiaries. These are considered tentative and best presented as
a qualitative summary, each meriting future investigation toward fuller
understanding of grassroots dynamics:
(a) Based on the Rajshahi University evaluation study, it appears that
irrigating farmers consistently own and operate more land on average
than non-irrigators, and try to acquire more land through leasing
to take more advantage of STW technology.
(b) Group sales under the Project seemed to have failed, with most
ownership "groups" either fictitiously formed or deteriorated
because of intra-group friction.
(c) While the degree and impact of power concentration with STW
manager/owners remain somewhat unclear, these manager/owners tend
to have higher literacy, larger holdings and significantly higher



- 21 -
proportion of their holdings under STW schemes, relative to other
group participants.
(d) Higher farm incomes from STW access have reduced the financial
pressure on small and medium farmers to sell land, but, in
accordance with traditional patterns of increasing concentration
of wealth, large farmers are observed stll buying a larger
amount of land.
(e) The price of irrigated land has traditionally been increasing more
rapidly than non-irrigated land in Bangladesh; however, such prices
rose dramatically in the first year of STW operation, only to have
slowed down in later years.
(f) While recent reports from NW STW groups under the Agricultural
Credit I Project indicate otherwise, no serious complaints of
groundwater shortage attributable to STW installation were
received in the evaluation study; a few isolated cases were
observed, however, of HTWs and dugwells going dry due to STW
interference.
7.03    Appraisal Economic Estimates.   The following assumptions, inter alia,
were made at appraisal in estimating the Project's economic impact:
(a) STWs would have a useful life of seven years and no scrap value.
With a four-year implementation period, Project life would be
11 years;
(b) All costs except price contingencies, taxes, and duties were
included in the economic analysis. Full maintenance facility
costs to service all irrigation equipment in the NW were
included. A SCF of 0.75 was used to shadow local costs;
(c) Estimated annual economic costs of administration and supervision
of the credit program by CBs, IRDP, TCCAs and KSSs were included;
(d) Annual incremental crop production costs included irrigation O&M
costs; and
(e) Only increased production in the directly benefitted areas was
considered. Even though at the farm-level tubewell benefits
would start within six months of installation, to allow for time
taken for installation of equipment, a one-year lag was assumed
between investment expenditures on tubewells and start of
benefits. Conservatively, a one year lag was also assumed
between expenses on crop inputs and benefits from farm
production.
On the basis of assumptions described above, the Project's ERR was estimated
at about 48%. Separate analyses with different cropping patterns and owner-
ship arrangements were also conducted, and all cases were found viable with
the minimum at about 35%.

7.04    Current Economic Estimates.   The recalculation of the Project's
economic impact essentially follows appraisal report assumptions. Main dif-
ferences are:
(a) The re-analysis more realistically assumes a useful life of seven
years for an STW engine, ten years for a pump, and 20 years for a
tubewell. With two replacements of an engine and one replacement of
a pump, a STW unit would have a useful life of 20 years. As a
result of these and the above assumptions, the Project period was
redefined at 24 years; and
(b) Prices and Exchange Rates. All costs and benefits were expressed
in constant 1983 US$. For the historical period, local and foreign
costs (excluding taxes and duties) were adjusted by an international
price index 1/ with local costs first adjusted to border basis by
year-specific standard conversion factors. 2/ Costs and benefits
expressed in taka were converted to US$ at exchange rates prevail-
ing. Projections of future commodity prices were based on latest
Bank forecasts 3/ to 1995 expressed in constant 1983 values. Annex
11-A provides a summary of economic prices used in the recalcula-
tions.
7.05    The Bangladesh economy is expected to realize a 46% ERR on Project
investments, based on re-analysis. This ERR estimate approximates well that
made at appraisal. Assuming an Opportunity Cost of Capital of 12%, net
incremental benefits of US$66.9 H equivalent in present worth (PW) terms are
expected from the entire Project period, or US$8.6 M on an annualized basis.
The updated economic real flow for the Project is presented in Annex 11-B,
with further detail of underlying assumptions.
7.06    As discussed in paras 6.03-6.04, current projections for full
development (1988-89) include reduction in paddy cultivated area, par-
ticularly Boro, and concomitant increase in wheat. Water savings from this
projected 25,000 ac reduction in HYV Boro paddy cultivation over current
with-project levels are anticipated to enable additional cultivation of about
50,000 ac of wheat. Two analyses were performed to test the sensitivity of
the estimated economic impact of the Project to variation in this expecta-
tion. First, actual (1982-83) with- and without-project cropping patterns
were maintained into the future, and secondly, a full development
without-project case and actual with-project case were assumed. In the
latter scenario, without Project investments Aus (local) and T. Aman are
expected to increase over current 1982-83 estimates (see para 6.03). Results
are summarized below:
1/  Unit Value Index of Manufactured Exports (MUV).
2/ 1978/79-1981/82 SCF = 0.75; 1982/83-2001/02 = 0.83.
3/ July 1983.

Should the current cropping pattern remain into the future, returns on
investments would remain highly attractive, even allowing for increased paddy
cultivation without the Project. Substitution of wheat for Boro paddy,
however, would lead to a slightly increased return of US$1.7 M (NPW), or
about 3%, reflecting an expansion of the total command area from 118,000 to
140,000 as a result of lower water requirements for wheat.
VIII. BORROWER AND IDA PERFORMANCE
8.01    Given the relatively complex organization of the Project, involving a
number of different loosely coordinated agencies (BADC, IRDP, CBs), the
Borrower's performance in carrying out its obligations under the Project was
not unsatisfactory. While a STW-specific, inter-agency executive committee
was in fact formed at the Project-level, no such specific committees were
formed at thana and district levels. Project officials maintain that forma-
tion of these originally proposed new committees would have been duplications
of other, more general agricultural and rural development committees already
in existence at thana and district levels. STW Project matters were handled
by these, and Project-related agency representatives were called upon to
attend as required. Therefore, the fact that once procurement difficulties
were overcome, progress with STW distributions was satisfactory indicates
reasonable success with working within the existing system. Should the
Project be replicated in future, the option to use such existing institutions
should be explored. Lack of coordination among the various BADC divisions,
however, was seen as problematical since each tended to operate independ-
ently. This was exemplified by the failure to comply with the Credit
covenant requiring merger of BADC's LLP, DTW, and STW Divisions in the NW.
BADC subsequently agreed to such a merger on a nationwide basis in the con-
text of the joint GOB/IDA minor irrigation sector review. By end-1979, the
STW hire-purchase system had been discontinued. IRDP had fair to excellent
success in completing debt inventories in the five Project districts, but was
hampered in this activity by Cooperative Department issuance of new loans to
farmer groups without notification to IRDP. Lastly, GOB regrettably has
failed to regulate exploitation of groundwater resources and to draft legis-
lation toward this end. As a result, exploitation continues in a rather
non-rationalized manner. Relatedly, it has neglected the updating of thana
irrigation maps, a necessary input into the MacDonald groundwater model that
potentially forms a sound technical basis for regulated development of NW
aquifers.
8.02    Progress reporting was regular and timely, although report quality
was sometimes less than satisfactory. BADC maintained Project accounts of



- 24 -
receipts and expenditures but in a manner criticized by IDA. To improve
accounting procedures, BADC engaged an accounting consultant to prepare an
accounting manual. Two drafts were submitted to IDA for comment, and IDA
found both unacceptable. Despite indications from BADC that account auditing
was in fact done in a timely manner, such audit reports were not sent to IDA
for review.  Evaluation studies to assess (a) the direct and indirect
economic and financial benefi s and the socio-economic characteristics of
benieficiaries, and (b) effect veness of the improved repair and maintenance
fa ilities nave been prepared    The former included a satisfactory analysis
of the agri ultiral impact of the Project, but contained insufficient quan-
titative anElys.is of financia  and e,:onomic impacts.
8.03    IDA project supervision was regular and carried out with staffing
continuity (one person was on five of seven missions between October 1977 and
April 1982). In addition, RMB was in continuous touch with Project-level
staff and made regular field visits. HQ mission data are recorded in the
Basic Data Sheet. Summary Project evaluations from HQ supervision reports
are in Annex 12.

SUlMMARY PARAGRAPHS IN SUPERVISION REPORTS
First Supervision Report, October 1977
Due to delays in approval of the Project Proforma by the Govern-
ment, the Credit could not be declared effective by September 30, 1977.
At Government's request, a two-month extension has been granted for ful-
filling the conditions of effectiveness. After some initial delays,
tender documents for procuremient of equipment and materials for the
tubewells have now been finalized. Tender doc'nents for procurement of
other equipment and materials are under preparation and are expected to be
ready by December 1977. Preparation of Thana Irrigation Maps is progress-
ing satisfactorily. Delays in locating and hiring a suitable Workshop
M4anagement Consultant may delay implementation of the workshop improvement
program.
Second Supervision Report, October 1978
After a satisfactory start progress has slowed down. IDA concur-
rence has been given to GOB's decision on first 1,500 Shallow Tubewells.
Equipment procurement has been initiated but going rather slow.     BADC's
engineering consultant is assisting with preparation of BADC's list of
workshop spares in conjunction with an ILO consultant. Trend is likely to
improve. Regional Workshop at Bogra is not yet released to BADC
(MIN/ERD). Construction of LGRD workshops is delayed due to delays in
resolving funding process (BADC/LGRD). Purchase of accessories by fresh
tender cannot be done in time for Boro 1979 installation. Means must be
found to salvage old tender. A detailed program has been prepared for
construction of workshops, procurement and installation of workshop equip-
ment for Thana and Zonal workshops.
Third Supervision Report, May 1979
The project had been at a standstill due to management constraints
in procurement, but progress has recently been made as orders tlave now
been issued by BADC for engines and pump sets, tools and equipment, office

equipment and transport. Preparatory steps for implementing the workshop
component have also begun.
Trend is likely to improve.
Problems.
(i)  Implementation of farmers' choice procedures for the procure-
ment of pumpsets (even number and fair exposure of all
makes);
(ii) Organization of maintenance and repairs;
(iii) Zonal workshops are overcrowded with obsolete equipment which
is taking valuable space in and outside of existing build-
ings; and
(iv)  IRDP has not completed the 'debt inventory' and 'land inven-
tory' for farmers groups in the project area, because the
Cooperative Department has recently issued fresh loans to
farmers groups without notifying IRDP.
Fourth Supervision Report, November 1979
Status. The recommendations of the last supervision mission on
the procedures to be followed to develop a farmer's choice system of pump
procurement have been carried out. Phase 1 has been completed and arran-
gements are now going ahead for Phase 2. The project's procurement of
shallow tubewell pumpsets, although beh4nd schedule, is proceeding as
2,050 pumpsets would be distributed on or about mid January 1980. For the
second order of 5,000 STWs, BADC has agreed to obtain quotations for
August 1980 delivery from those manufacturers/suppliers who were selected
to supply STW units under the first project procurement and other manufac-
turers whose equipment has been satisfactorily tested and shown to be
suitable for Bangladesh conditions, and approved by GOB and IDA. Price
quotations will be obtained by the end of February 1980. The construction
of workshops is proceeding with only a few delays (See Annex 7).
Trend is improving. BADC assured the mission that a new Implemen-
tation Schedule would be prepared by December 1, 1979 (DCA 4.06 (b)).
Problems
(i) The purchase of accessories required for the pumping units
has been delayed;



-40-
ANNEX 12
Page 3
(ii)  Field management responsibility of the STWl program is not yet
formalized;
(iii) Vehicle purchase for the field staff has been held up; and
(iv)  BID's benchmark study that was to be started in June has not
yet started.
Fifth Supervision Report, July 1980
Status. Earlier procurenent problems have been overcome; the
project is now progressing satisfactorily. Phase I of pump set procure-
ment has been delivered and most units sold. Farmers' choice sur-vev is
complete, and orders based on this have been placed.
Progress on workshop construction and renovation is slow. The
mechanic training program is yet to start.
Trend. The project shows marked improvement. Procurement will be
completed ahead of schedule.
Problems.
(i)  Progress on workshop construction is slow.   Regional
workshops have not been cleared of unserviceable equipment.
(ii)  Training of mechanics has been delayed by BADC's lack of
response to consultants' proposals and delays in procurement
of training tools.
(iii) Thana irrigation maps have been completed but are not being
kept up-to-date.
(iv)  An unsatisfactory accounting manual has been submitted by
consultants.
(v)  No evaluation studies have started.
(vi)  There is lack of coordination at field level in the workshop
program.
Sixth Supervision Report, June 1981
Status. Procurement and delivery of STW have been completed.
Sales of STW have been delayed by late arrival of pumpsets from suppliers
and early rains which discouraged farmers fron tying up their money. The
mechanic training program has begun and will continue through December

ANNEX 12
Page 4
1981. The consultant who will conduct the monitoring and evaluation
study, and prepare data for the draft completion report, has been
appointed and the studies will begin by July. Progress on workshop civil
works (especiallv zonal workshop) is satisfactory. Equipment for the
workshops will'be ordered before June 1, 1981 but may not be delivered
until December 1981.
Trend. The project's progress has shown improvement, particularly
with procurement. As most of the public sector (BADC) workshops have now
been dropped, total disbursements and estimated cost will be much lower
than estimated at appraisal.
Problems.
(i)  Progress on sales of STW is slow.
(ii) BADC's field staff and credit institutions are not recording
surface and groundwater pumpsets (except HTW) on the thana
irrigation maps.
(iii) The second draft of accounting manual is completed but must
be approved by BADC and
(iv) BADC is slow to procure workshop equipment and BADC is delay-
ing the purchase of inexpensive mechanic's tool boxes.
(v)  Delay of the mQnitoring and evaluation study and data gather-
ing for the draft completion report.
(vi) Project completion will be delayed due to slow sale of STW
and delays in delivery of machine shop equipment.    Therefore,
it will be necessary to extend closing date to December 31,
1982.
Sevevth Supervision Report, June 1982
All STW (including an extra 550 above appraisal estimates) have
been procured and sold to farmers and farmers groups. The mechanic train-
ing program is proceeding and will continue through December 1982. The
consultant will complete the final monitoring and evaluation report by
July 1, 1982. Progress on the regional workshop is proceeding and will be
completed by November 1982. All equipment and tools, too, will be ordered
by that date.

The project's progress has improved, particuiarly sal.es and opera-
tions of tubewells.  It is ex?ected thac as most of the public sector's
workshops have been dropped, total disbursements and estinaced cost will
be lower than estimated at appraisal.
(i) Thana Irrigation maps are not being updated with recording of
LLPs, DTWs and STWs;
(ii) IDA/STW office is redundant and upkeep is costing valuable
funds; and the same objective could be achieved by closinig
this office and having the Project Manager in Headquarters -
BADC for easy access to resolve remaining problems;
(iii)  Consolidation of field activities of LLP, DTIl, and STW has
not taken place and ib further fragmented by ne! separaL,2

DTW, STW and LLP for equipnent znd tools for workshops;
(iv)  Defective engines from several manufacturers of the pumpsets
have been reported to BADC; and

Subject: Project Completion Report on Bangladesh
Shallow Tubewells Project (Credit 724-BD)
Ref.: Your D.O. letter dated November 1, 1983
on the above subject.
Irrigation wing of the Planning Commission Government of the
People's Republic of Bangladesh examined the report referred above
and have the following comments to offer:
1.   The report shows that the approved targets for procurement
and sale of STWs under the project have been exceeded by 5% and
10% respectively. But the reported STW coverage i.e. 10.73
acres/unit on average is less than the estimate of 15 acres/unit
in the approved PP. The unit coverage could have been much
higher in such a project where concerted efforts were envisaged.
The report did not mention as to the measures taken, at all, for
increasing the command area under the STWs of this project. It
seems that emphasis was mainly on selling STWs rather than on
increasing coverage.
2.   Although the overall sale of STWs was satisfactory, STW
sale to irrigation groups fell short of the target. It could be
appreciated if more than target could be sold to the groups than
to individuals.

ANNEX

3.   Non-availability of water by STWs and sinking of STWs in excess
of feasible numoer were reported from some Thanas in the project area.
This report is silent about that problem. The problem of proper siting
and spacing of STWs should also have been touched in the report.
4.   The report shows that 24 vehicles, 80 motor cycles and 500 bicycles
were procured against the appraisal estimate of 74 vehicles, 135 motor
cycles and 800 bicycles respectively. But, as per approved procurement
were 50, 114 and 2040 respectively.
5.   It is observed that construction of 20 Thana Workshops out of 100
and 6 fuel storage tanks out of 19 were dropped because of enhanced
cost. Planning Commission has not been reported earlier of such
revision of the target. Reduction of targets of any other item except
that of vehicles is not in the knowledge of Planning Commission. Number
of vehicles was reduced from 50 to 28 in the cost rationalisation
exercise made in the Planning Commission.
It will be highly appreciated if our views are given due consideration
in formulating the final conclusions of the project completion report.
