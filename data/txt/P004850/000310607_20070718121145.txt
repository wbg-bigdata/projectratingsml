F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (from Program Document)
The objectives of PRSC 1 were:

 i) Improving the climate for the private sector, thereby generating jobs and higher
wages

 ii) Reforming State enterprises to improve efficiency and free up fiscal resources for
poverty reduction program

 iii) Restructuring the banking system to reduce the risk of financial crisis, which could
otherwise undermine poverty reduction efforts

 iv) Integrating with the world economy to expand labor-intensive exports



                                           xi

  v) Improving public expenditure management

Revised Program Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
The scope of PRSCs 2-5 was wider than PRSC 1, being aligned to the government's
Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy which was approved in 2002
and expanded in 2003 to cover infrastructure.

  The objectives of PRSC 2-5 were aligned closely to the three pillars of the CPRGS
namely:

  (i) completing the transition to a market economy, including through actions to further
international integration, strengthen the equitization process for SOEs, accelerating
banking reform and improving the investment climate;

  (ii) ensuring social inclusion and sustainable development through actions to improve
the financing of healthcare for the poor, quality of education for disadvantaged groups, as
well as adoption of tools to promote environmental protection; and

  (iii) building modern governance, through focusing on development outcomes,
strengthening the transparency and management of public finances, simplifying
procedures for obtaining public services, and fighting corruption.

  The original objectives of PRSC 1 were thus mainly subsumed under Pillar I, and also
under Pillar III

1. Program Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

        Vietnam has been on a sustained path of economic reform since the launching of
Doi Moi (renovation) process in 1986. The overall tenet has been an increased reliance
on market mechanisms, while paying respects to the socialist principle. The latter can be
interpreted as care for social inclusion and equity while maintaining and protecting a
leading role for the state and the party. In practice, the process has involved a systematic
piloting of reforms, followed by some forms of evaluation with an effort to forge
consensus among relevant stakeholders, and finally the scaling up of reportedly
successful initiatives. With this approach, reform progress had its stops and starts,
depending on where the country is in this process: it was moving rapidly in the early
1990s, slowed down in the late 1990s, then the pace picked up again in the early 2000s.

        Taken together however, for the past two decades, initial comprehensive
economic policy correction of past inappropriate policies unleashed rapid and pent-up
growth in the economy and subsequent policy measures established and consolidate
remarkable progress and achievement on development outcomes. Vietnam has been
among the fastest-growing economies in the world. GDP per capita has increased at
roughly 6.9 percent per year in real terms. Vietnam has made great strides in its external
sector with exports gaining in value, volume, and diversity within a short period of time,
bringing the country from a rice-deficit status to that of the third largest rice exporter.

        Given the very low level of domestic prices at the inception of the reform process,
and the subsequent appreciation as the economy develops, the average growth rate of per
capita GDP measured in dollar terms has been well into two-digit figures. With an initial
agriculture-based reform and a resulting rapid economic transformation, there has been a
relative stability of inequality indicators. They probably reflect the dire needs of the
country in the initial phases of economic transition to staunch the serious food shortages
due to agricultural collectivization and inter-provincial bans in commerce. The return of
agricultural land to individual households, the dismantling of collectives and price
controls, and the lifting of trade bans and subsequent liberalization of trade in agricultural
products contributed to the rebound of the economy and improvement in the living
standards of the population at large, especially in the country side. Based on a
consumption basket of food and non-food items sustaining an intake of 2,100 calories per
person per day, the poverty headcount declined from 58 percent in 1993 to less than 20
percent in 2004. Other social indicators, including child mortality, have shown equally
remarkable improvements.

        There was a considerable acceleration of reforms in 2001, justifying the first
series of PRSCs from the Bank, and then again in 2006. The former was marked with the
approval of an enterprise law to facilitate business registration and operations, the signing
of a bilateral trade agreement with the United States that strengthened global integration
and resulted in important legal improvements, the adoption of the first serious steps



                                              1

towards SOE divestiture and the strengthening of public financial management. The
latter culminated in the country's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO), the
adoption of an ambitious banking reform roadmap, a new resolve to equitize large SOEs
and transfer the exercise of state ownership rights out of line ministries and provincial
governments, the drive towards introducing universal programs for social protection, and
the adoption of a determined anti-corruption drive. There is little dissent regarding the
direction for economic reforms, and internal debates are increasingly focusing on
strengthening the mechanisms for citizen's feedback and government accountability.

        The Bank marked its involvement with the country's reforms and changes in the
early 1990s, as the doi moi policy was implemented with projects in infrastructure and
social sectors (education). The first Structural Adjustment Credit was signed in October
1994. This was followed by the series of PRSCs with the first one approved by the Board
in 2001 and the fifth one completed in 2006, ending the first PRSC series of operations in
support of Vietnam's structural development and sustained economic growth.


1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

         The PRSC 1 was originally planned as the second Structural Adjustment Credit
(SAC 2), an integral part of a package of programmatic SACs designed to help the
Vietnamese government to carry out its structural reform program as was reaffirmed in
the CAS Progress Report of May 2000. The planned second SAC eventually took the
form of a PRSC during the transition to the new lending instrument.

        PRSC 1 was envisioned as the first of a series of three PRSCs for Vietnam for up
to US$450-550 million, over four years. It focused on structural reform issues and on
public expenditure management, primarily because incomplete structural reforms were
seen as the most important impediment to poverty reduction in Vietnam at that time. As a
full PRSP was not available, PRSC 1 was based on an I-PRSP. It was, however,
expected that under a full PRSP and a new CAS, the focus of PRSCs would expand to
social sectors and governance in subsequent operations. PRSC 1 came at a crucial time
for Vietnam as it sought to reinvigorate its development efforts after three years of slower
growth (compared with the previous decade). The slower progress of these three years
was due to an inadequate policy and institutional framework as well as to the regional
financial crisis. The objectives of PRSC 1 were:

    · Improving the climate for the private sector, thereby generating jobs and higher
        wages
    · Reforming State enterprises to improve efficiency and free up fiscal resources for
        poverty reduction program
    · Restructuring the banking system to reduce the risk of financial crisis, which
        could otherwise undermine poverty reduction efforts
    · Integrating with the world economy to expand labor-intensive exports
    · Improving public expenditure management

1.3 Revised PDO and Key Indicators, and Reasons/Justification

        The CPRGS provided a blueprint for Vietnam's development over the period
2002-2005 and served as the basis for the subsequent PRSCs 2-5. The CPRGS, approved
by the Prime Minister of Vietnam in May, 2002, translated the vision laid out in the Ten-
Year Strategy for 2001-2010 into concrete public actions. The Ten-Year Strategy
envisions a path of transition towards a "market-economy with socialist orientation". The
CPRGS built on this foundation. The CPRGS represented a sharp improvement from
earlier planning documents based on a "command and control" view of the economy.
Rather than spelling out detailed sector-by-sector production targets, the CPRGS focused
on development outcomes such as poverty reduction and the Vietnam Development
Goals (a localized version of the MDGs). Empirical evidence and a broad consultation
process were used to identify the policies best suited to attaining those development
outcomes. Efforts were also made to "cost" these policies and to align resources towards
their attainment. A set of monitoring indicators was developed to monitor progress in
implementation. In 2003 the CPRGS was "expanded", with a new chapter providing a
thorough discussion of the role of infrastructure in promoting economic and social
development. The inclusion of this chapter filled what the Government perceived as an
important gap in the original CPRGS.

        The objectives of PRSC 2-5 were aligned closely to the three pillars of the
CPRGS namely:

        (i) completing the transition to a market economy, including through actions to
further international integration, strengthen the equitization process for SOEs,
accelerating banking reform and improving the investment climate;

        (ii) ensuring social inclusion and sustainable development through actions to
improve the financing of healthcare for the poor, quality of education for disadvantaged
groups, as well as adoption of tools to promote environmental protection; and

        (iii) building modern governance, through focusing on development outcomes,
strengthening the transparency and management of public finances, simplifying
procedures for obtaining public services, and fighting corruption.

        The CPRGS pillars were not self-standing but rather connected through cross-
cutting themes such as employment generation for poverty reduction and the link
between public financial management and effective delivery of social services to the poor.

        Other important policy developments have influenced this reform agenda recently.
By mid-2003 the government decided to aim for a rapid accession to the WTO, and in
late 2003, a new anti-corruption strategy started to emerge, with the emphasis shifting
from punitive measures to increased transparency and the strengthening of the systems
through which the government operates.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program:

        PRSC 1 focused on the areas of global integration and trade policy, private sector
development, financial sector reform, state enterprises reform, including their equitization,
and public financial management


1.5 Revised Policy Areas

        Subsequent PRSCs widened the coverage of policy areas in line with the three
pillars of the CPRGS. In Pillar I, policy actions were included in the infrastructure sector
in addition to the sectors covered under PRSC 1. Pillar II actions covered human
development (education, health, social protection), and natural resources management
(land, forest, water, and environment). Pillar III actions went beyond public financial
management to include, modernization of planning, public administration reform, legal
development, and anticorruption efforts.

1.6 Other significant changes

        In addition to providing resources to the budget, PRSC operations have served as
an effective coordination device between the government and a large number of donors,
which marked the most significant change in the PRSC series. PRSC operations have
been co-financed by several bilateral and multilateral agencies, either through grants or
through parallel lending. More importantly, the process saw a transition in the role of co-
financiers, from providers of finance to partners substantially engaged in the preparation
of the operations and the policy dialogue with government. This dialogue is organized by
policy areas, in which donors engage selectively, based on their interests and technical
capacity on the ground. The number of donors participating in this process has increased
from four in PRSC 1 to seven in PRSC 3 to 11 in PRSC 5. All donors who seriously
consider the possibility to partner up in this process are invited to participate in the
preparation of PRSC operations, even if they cannot commit to co-finance them in the
short term. Nineteen of them have actively contributed to the preparation of the five
operations.

        The implementation of Vietnam's ambitious reform agenda was initially
supported by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as well, through a Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) credit approved at the same time as PRSC 1.
However, PRGF disbursements were suspended at the end of 2002 due to a disagreement
between the IMF and the government on the auditing of the SBV. The PRGF credit
expired in April, 2004. The IMF has remained engaged in several policy areas, and
especially in the monitoring of macroeconomic policies. In the absence of an active
PRGF, the IMF has provided an assessment of the macroeconomic framework as part of
the preparation of each of the PRSC operations.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Program Performance

        The policy actions supported under the PRSC series were predominantly "prior
actions" in the sense that they were successfully accomplished prior to the Board date.
As such, they were included in the matrix of policy actions presented to the Board only
after their satisfactory completion. PRSC 1 was the only operation in the series where
tranche release conditions were specified. A waiver for tranche release was required for
only one of 12 actions. Effectiveness conditions were specified in the case of PRSC 2
and these were accomplished on time. No effectiveness conditions were specified for any
of the other operations. The list of actions completed under the series is presented in
Annex 2.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

        The reform program supported by the PRSC series sought to maintain the
momentum built up by the government's own blueprint for reform, the CPRGS. Most of
the measures supported by the PRSC series were within the government control and
directly monitored by the PRSC Steering Committee under the Prime Minister's direction.
As the program was strongly owned by the government and widely supported by the
stakeholders with increasingly strong participation by all ministries and agencies
concerned, fulfillment of the committed actions was effectively carried out.

        The identification, design, and implementation of policy actions, was smoother in
areas where a strong body of analytical work was available. Areas where problems were
encountered included those where there were institutional conflicts or overlaps among
government ministries or agencies (e.g., water). On the donors' side, the existence of
multiple "partnership groups" in certain areas was a factor that tended to fragment the
policy dialogue.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

        The SBV was the principal implementing agency for the PRSC series, chairing
the Secretariat which oversaw the day-to-day implementation of the program. Its
experience was built up gradually with each successfully completed PRSC. SBV's
`learning by doing' led to improved coordination with the key ministries and agencies,
especially the ministries of Finance, Planning and Investment, and Trade.
Progress under the PRSC process can be measured against the specific development
objectives spelled out in the CPRGS and other plans and strategies of the government.
Unfortunately, a comprehensive system of indicators to monitor and evaluate the impact
of economic reforms was not yet in place at the beginning of the PRSC process. The
focus varied across government plans and strategies, and the definition of goals and
targets was not always precise, or totally pertinent. This is not surprising as at that time
the "command and control" view of the economy was more entrenched, and the statistical
system was only starting to develop. In spite of these limitations, based on the CPRGS
and other planning documents of the government it was possible to assemble a set of


                                              5

development objectives covering the three main areas of the reform program. In practice,
these indicators were compiled gradually, as the scope of PRSCs expanded to cover an
ever-increasing number of policy areas. Because of the five-year planning cycle of
Vietnam, most of those objectives were spelled out for end-2006. Progress against each
outcome is given one of the following ratings: Highly Satisfactory (HS), Satisfactory (S),
Partially Satisfactory (PS) or Unsatisfactory (U). The rating utilizes the latest available
data to assess the progress to date. And based on recent trends, it also includes a
judgment as to the outcome expected by end-2006. For those development outcomes
where a quantitative target had been specified, a rating of HS reflects meeting or
surpassing the target. On the other hand no improvement or backsliding would have
resulted in a U rating. The intermediate ratings of PS and S do reflect a level of judgment
about associated policies, exogenous constraints, and sustainability of the progress
achieved.

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation:

        The Bank has already initiated the next phase of the PRSC series, beginning with
the Sixth PRSC which was presented to the Board on June 21, 2007. It is anticipated that
the new series will also span five operations (PRSC 6-10). These will, in line with the
CPS, be designed to support Vietnam's new SEDP (2006-10). The new SEDP embodies
the CPRGS principles: unlike earlier five year plans it is based on broad based
consultations, and also includes a monitoring framework.

        In the SEDP, the government sets out intended actions that fall broadly into four
main areas: (a) the promotion of growth and transition to a market economy; (b) reducing
poverty and ensuring social inclusion; (c) managing the environment and natural
resources in a sustainable manner; and, (d) building institutions that can support the
strategy. The first three pillars are explicitly listed in the SEDP, whereas the fourth one is
viewed as the foundation to make progress on the other three. The fourth pillar is
discussed in the SEDP in terms of the institutions needed to support a modern market
economy with a socialist orientation, and it also forms part of the monitoring and
evaluation framework. Taken together, intended actions under these four pillars can pave
the way for Vietnam to become a middle-income country by the end of the period.

        It is anticipated that the next cycle of PRSCs will support actions to complete the
transition to a market economy. Vietnam has made a large number of commitments in
the context of WTO membership which will have to be carried out in the next several
years: These areas include the ambitious banking reform road map; the management of
the SOE sector in a global context; the enormous infrastructure needs with demands for
an effective regulation of access to networks and pricing of services; incentives for the
private sector participation through transparent rules and regulations. On the social front,
the country will require support to address the needs for targeted poverty reduction,
especially for the ethnic monitories in remote areas; to better manage migration (urban-
rural); and build a modern social protection system.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

        The CAS for the period 2003-06 was built around the three pillars of the CPRGS.
The PRSC series was identified by the CAS as a key financing instrument for the period
and was designed to be a series of one tranche operations to support the CPRGS. With
the expansion of the CPRGS to incorporate infrastructure development, the CAS update
included support for this sector as well. As noted, the PRSCs were also broadened to
support policy actions in the infrastructure sector. The objectives supported by the CAS
and the PRSC series continued to be highly relevant to the country's priorities.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

        Progress under the PRSC 1-5 series has been strong with firm commitments to
reforms from the country's leadership, though with different implementation speeds and
somewhat uneven achievements of the program development objectives across policy
areas. Annex presents the details on the achievements by policy area. Given the
comprehensive nature of Vietnam's reform agenda some areas are bound to register faster
progress than others. The assessment is also affected by differences in the quality and
frequency of the available indicators. However, substantive progress has occurred in the
structural, the social and the governance pillars of the reform agenda, making it difficult
to identify any of them as a systematic laggard. The speed at which progress is made
towards the attainment development outcomes within each of these pillars crucially
depends on the political will to implement the reforms and the government's
implementation capacity in terms of human resources through learning by doing.

        The solid performance of Vietnam in terms of economic growth, poverty
reduction and the attainment of other development objectives, suggests that the policy
actions supported through the PRSC process so far have been effective. Rapid economic
development is taking place, and is accompanied by reforms which will contribute to
sustain it over time. The annual growth rate of GDP increased by almost two percentage
points between the beginning and the end of the five-year period covered by this PRSC
cycle. Growth is leading to higher government revenues, which are in turn being used to
provide social services and assist laggard areas. Poverty reduction could have been
expected to slow down after the easier gains had been made, but it actually accelerated in
the second half of this period. Moreover, these impressive gains appear to be sustainable.
A current account deficit emerged, but it was financed mainly through ODA and FDI.
Inequality in expenditures has increased only modestly. While environmental degradation
is a concern, sound policies are being put in place to manage natural resources and
control pollution. The fiduciary environment is improving and a program is in place to
bring it up to international standards. A strong governance agenda is leading to better
planning processes, more transparent public financial management, a simplification of
administrative procedures and, for the first time, a clear strategy in the fight against
corruption. In most of these areas, important challenges remain. But it is difficult to claim
that Vietnam's progress is "borrowed" on its future.



                                              7

        While it is difficult to attribute success in the attainment of specific development
outcomes to particular policy actions under the PRSC process, the latter is likely making
an important contribution. A truly rigorous impact evaluation analysis cannot be
conducted in circumstances where no obvious counter-factual exists. While it is possible
to describe what happened in Vietnam during this period, assessments of what would
have happened in the absence of the policy actions supported through the PRSC process
are to some extent hypothetical. However, an independent evaluation of budget support
operations in seven countries, conducted by a team at the University of Birmingham, was
very positive in Vietnam's case. And a closer look at the mechanisms through which
economic growth and poverty reduction took place during this period suggests that those
actions did play an important role in practice. The evidence is especially compelling in
relation to poverty reduction.

        Policy actions under the PRSC process contributed to the generalization of market
mechanisms, a massive creation of wage employment and a strengthened delivery of
public services. These have been identified as the main drivers of poverty reduction in
Vietnam. Most of the poor live in rural areas. The distribution of farm land to rural
households, in the early 1990s, combined with stronger incentives for the
commercialization of agricultural products, rapidly raised incomes among the poor.
While only 48 percent of the output by household farms was sold to the market in 1998,
the fraction had increased to 70 percent in 2002. Integration with the world economy, the
development of banking credit, and the declining role of SOEs contributed to this trend.
The move from farming and self-employment to wage employment represented another
major contribution to household incomes. Wage employment increased from 21 percent
of total employment in 1998 to 32 percent in 2004. A more conducive environment for
the creation and formalization of domestic private enterprises and the attraction of
massive FDI inflows have made it possible to create jobs in a large scale and absorb large
number of entrants into the labor market. Service delivery has also contributed to better
health and education outcomes, while local infrastructure has developed rapidly. By 2004,
93 percent of the population had access to electricity, compared to 77 percent in 1998.
These outcomes have been made possible through sustained investment programs and
increasingly effective inter-government transfer mechanisms favoring the poorest
provinces.

        The PRSC process has had a direct influence on the adoption of policy actions
conducive to higher economic growth and poverty reduction, rather than simply
rewarding policies that would have been adopted anyway. While PRSCs have involved
little conditionality, and only in the initial stages, it can be argued that the process
followed to support their preparation has contributed to the quality of economic policies.
There has been agreement among donors that this dialogue should focus on government
actions meeting four criteria: they have to be part of nationally-owned strategies and
plans, including CPRGS; they have to be grounded on solid economic analysis; they have
to be strategic in importance; and they have to be defined in an unambiguous way. This
focus has allowed to prioritize and to sequence the wide range of policy initiatives
considered in Vietnamese development strategies and plans. The tight deadlines resulting
from the annual cycle for the delivery of PRSCs have also established an incentive to
complete the key policy actions in time. The discussion of those actions with the relevant


                                                 8

line ministries and government agencies has also nurtured a more systematic exchange of
draft documents for consultation and comments, and fostered a increased openness in the
policy making process.

3.3 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Ratings: Satisfactory

          As Annex 3 shows, progress on the bulk of the individual development outcomes
is rated satisfactory. Of the fifty indicators assessed, 7 are highly satisfactory, 34 are
satisfactory, and 9 are partially satisfactory. There was no indicator against which
progress was unsatisfactory.

3.4 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

 (a) Poverty Impacts

          Broad-based growth has been accompanied by a continuation of Vietnam's
remarkable record in poverty reduction. Data collected through the Vietnam Household
Living Standard Survey (VHLSS) shows that general poverty rate has fallen from 58.1
percent in 1993 to 19.5 percent in 2004, implying an average decline of 3.5 percentage
points per year (Table 2). The proportion of poor people now is just above one-third of
what it was 11 years ago. Measures used to track inequality suggest that there has been
only a modest increase in inequality over time. The Gini index stands now at 0.37,
compared to 0.34 in 1993, 0.35 in 1998 and 0.37 in 2002. Admittedly, the Gini index is
not very sensitive to substantive increases in income or expenditures at the very top of the
distribution, and this is a relatively visible trend in Vietnam. However, the ratio of per
capita expenditures between the richest and the poorest quintile has not increased
dramatically. This ratio stands at 6.27 in 2004, compared to 4.97 in 1993, 5.49 in 1998
and 6.03 in 2002. This inclusive growth pattern explains the unusual speed at which
Vietnam has managed to reduce poverty.

          Vietnam recorded significant achievements in poverty reduction, with no other
country registering faster progress.             1  Based on the one-PPP-dollar per-day measure,
between 1990 and 2004 the percentage of the population living in poverty fell by roughly
3 percentage points per year, twice the rate of China. Moreover, in Vietnam's case the
trend is confirmed when using a comparable poverty line, related to the consumption
bundle (including food and non-food items) necessary to secure a daily food intake of
2,100 calories per person per day.              2




1         Admittedly, poverty comparisons across countries raise important methodological difficulties, stemming
from the fact that both the structure of consumption bundles and the prices of goods and services differ considerably
from one place to another. One usual shortcut is to set the poverty line at some intuitively appealing level, such as one
PPP dollar per day.
2         While the rapid decrease in poverty is considered a hallmark in the Vietnam's development experience, it
should be noted that this decline was initially a result of the correction of inappropriate policies in the 1970s and 1980s,
including agricultural collectivization, industrial nationalization, and bans in commerce, leading to famine and drastic
drops in the standard of living nation-wide.



                                                              9

         As the poverty rate declines, reducing it further becomes more difficult, so that a
gradual deceleration of the process could be expected. However, after a slowdown
between 1998 and 2002, the pace at which Vietnam is reducing poverty picked up again.

     Note: GSO and World Bank staff estimates. The poverty headcount indicates the percentage of the
    population with expenditures below the food and non-food consumption bundle needed to sustain an
    intake of 2100 calories per person per day. The food poverty rate refers to expenditures below the value
    of the food component of that bundle.



         This acceleration could to some extent have been amplified by a quirk of the data.
The 2002 household expenditure survey was much larger in scale than previous ones, and
was conducted with less supervision and training of enumerators. And in any event, the   3

apparent acceleration in poverty reduction is consistent with other developments during
the period. Output grew faster, the prices of commodities which are essential to sustain
farmers' livelihoods (such as coffee and rice) increased, and the volume of resources
transferred to poorer provinces in the context of decentralization expanded.




3        While the 2004 survey was already of a better quality, there is a possibility that poverty was over-estimated
in 2002. However, it could have been under-estimated as well.

        However, progress in poverty reduction has been slower for Vietnam's ethnic
minorities. Using a domestic poverty line that reflects basic calorie and non-food needs,
poverty among ethnic minorities in Vietnam was still 61 percent in 2004, compared to 14
percent of the Kinh and Chinese majority. In some parts of the country, such as the
South Central Coast, poverty rates among ethnic minorities are above 90 percent. In
2004, more than one third of all ethnic minorities in Vietnam lived in hunger and was
unable to meet basic calorie needs.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

        The PRSC process has contributed substantially to the capacity of the government
to conduct cross-sectoral policy dialogue. The annual preparation of a wide ranging
PRSC program under tight deadlines has strengthened institutional capacity and
discipline for delivering results in a timely fashion. In addition, the discussion of PRSC-
related policy actions with a wide range of stakeholders has demonstrated to the
government the benefits of conducting an open dialogue on key policies. As a result, the
government has become more receptive to sharing policy drafts at an early stage and
eliciting feedback from relevant stakeholders.


3.5 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

Box 1 highlights some findings of an independent evaluation of the PRSC process. The
evaluation was based on consultations with donors and key government counterparts, as
well as with Bank staff.




                                                      11

                        Box 1: An Independent Evaluation of PRSCs in Vietnam


         There are clear benefits of PRSC support to the government's reform program. The policy
dialogue is highlighted as one of them by both government and co-financiers. The government clearly
values the ideas provided by donors on policy content and implementation mechanisms, while donors gain
a broader understanding of the direction of the reform process and government thinking. Other PRSC
benefits stem not only from improving the quality of policies, but also from locking-in government's
commitment to specific reforms, speeding up the implementation of policies, and providing additional
resources to support policy actions.

         PRSCs have been most effective in supporting the development of policy, legal and institutional
frameworks, with implementation left to government. Institutional strengthening specifically through
supporting the development of systems has been an important element and can be seen for example through
the strong effects of the PRSC in strengthening public financial management systems. There have been
similar systemic effects through linking policy, planning and budgeting.         Institutional and regulatory
frameworks have been particularly important in providing the enabling environment for other donor and
government activities. The PRSC process itself has provided a mechanism for encouraging harmonization
between donors and alignment with government systems

         PRSCs have been less good at influencing the two "extreme ends" of reform: strategic
breakthroughs and grassroots level reform. PRSCs have also had difficulty in addressing sectors that are by
their nature complex and fragmented, such as public administration reform, legal reform and governance.
This applies particularly where there is no clear focus for the reform agenda or consensus on an underlying
strategy or where this has taken time to emerge and needs a consensus on an implementing framework.

         PRSC funds are obviously welcomed by government, but funds are often seen as less important
than the policy and institutional changes supported by the process. However, funding is still clearly
important, particularly in sectors such as health, education and social protection where the government is a
provider of services or where the innovations supported by the PRSC have considerable costs.

         Strong national ownership of the reform agenda underpins the PRSC, with government
participation in negotiations increasing over time, particularly from line ministries. The inclusiveness of
the process has been one of its strengths, as there has been participation in the policy dialogue by non-
financiers of the PRSC. The recent process to produce the Vietnam Development Report, which has
included the majority of the donor community, international NGOs, technical departments of government
and local research institutions, indicates the value of further opening up of consultations to more
stakeholders.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Ratings: Low

         The progress achieved on development outcomes is expected to be sustained. The
reforms that underpin the achievement of the development outcomes are on track, and the
government is fully committed to their continued deepening. This commitment of the
government is expressed in the SEDP 2006-10. In addition, the SEDP also foresees
second generation reforms that will be required as Vietnam enters the rank of middle
income countries.




                                                     12

        The government is cognizant that one of the risks of rapid growth is the
deterioration of the environment and natural resources. It is for this reason that the
sustainable use of natural resources has been introduced as a separate pillar of the SEDP.
Building the capacity to better evaluate and mitigate the trade-off between higher growth
and environmental protection will be an important challenge.

        The rapid pace of development, and the movement into second generation issues,
is posing regulatory challenges in areas such finance and infrastructure. For instance,
Vietnam is becoming increasingly exposed to external shocks, including to the vagaries
of capital flows. At the same time, Vietnam has seen a very rapid growth in its stock
market, which has likely outpaced regulatory capacity. Thus the potential for
macroeconomic turbulence is becoming very real. However, the government has planned
to modernize and strengthen the supervisory capacity of the central bank as well as the
capital markets regulator. Their timely implementation will thus be critical.


5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

        The Sixth Quality at Entry Assessment (QEA6) Panel assessed PRSC 2. The
Panel rated the quality at entry of the PRSC 2 overall as "Satisfactory." Two of the
quality dimensions, Strategic Relevance and Approach and Poverty and Social Aspects
are rated as "Highly Satisfactory."

(b) Quality of Supervision

Ratings: Satisfactory

        The use of reliable information and analysis in policy making has improved
steadily over the PRSC process. Over the first three PRSCs, the government made efforts
to improve the quality of data that can be used for monitoring PRSC outcomes. The
fourth and fifth PRSC continued to build on this experience. Key sources of monitoring
information for poverty and program outcomes include the biennial VHLSS, periodic
participatory poverty assessments and local consultations, enterprise surveys, public
expenditure tracking surveys, as well as the progress reports from the relevant sector
ministries and committees implementing the reform program. In addition, the
strengthening of management information systems for SOEs and for all public spending,
both led by MOF, was an integral part of the PRSC program.


(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Ratings: Satisfactory

        The Bank and its country office led by the Country Director, the Lead Economist
and sector specialists in the field have maintained an effective dialogue with the


                                             13

government's senior counterparts on the progress of reforms supported by the PRSC
series. As co-chairman (with the government) of the Consultative Group, the Bank helps
coordinate development activities closely with other development partners and minimize
overlap and competing demands from straining the authorities' administrative capacity.
This form of effective cooperation was supported and reflected in the cofinancing of
PRSC series by an increasing number of cofinanciers.

       The identification of the policy actions needed to attain the development
outcomes spelled out in the CPRGS has been strongly influenced by the Bank's AAA
program. The annual Vietnam Development Reports (VDRs) have played a very
important role in this respect. These reports are prepared in partnership between the
Bank and other donors, including many of those involved in the PRSC process. They
also involve substantial inputs from Vietnamese academics and policy makers. VDRs
serve to coordinate views on what the reform challenges are and how to address them,
and have a considerable impact on the policy debate and the research agenda at the
country level. The VDR 2003 aimed to "translate" the CPRGS into a strategic direction
for each of the policy areas covered by the PRSC process. Subsequent VDRs, on Poverty,
Governance, and Business address in more depth the challenges faced by Vietnam to
keep development inclusive, build modern institutions, and complete its transition to a
market economy.

       There is also a strong synergy between PRSC operations and investment credits
which are processed in parallel. While PRSCs support the adoption of significant policy
reforms, investment credits focus on their implementation, across a range of sectors.
Some of those credits, such as those for public financial management, payments system
or customs modernization, aim at strengthening the systems through which government
operates, thus making reforms effective in practice. Other credits, like those for primary
education for disadvantaged children or forest sector development, provide the resources
needed to deliver on policy measures which could otherwise amount to declarations of
intent. More generally, project lending and policy lending are complementary in this
process.

       The Bank has played the role of coordinator for organizing the policy dialogue
among donors, as well as between the donor group and the government. As the number of
donors participating in the PRSC process increased from four under the first operation to
nine under PRSC 4, this task became more complex. The PRSC process is aligned with
the budget cycle, with operations taking place annually and Bank disbursements
occurring towards the middle of the Vietnamese fiscal year. Delivering the large PRSC
program, both in terms of reform areas as well as the number of donors, within a fiscal
year has required the task team to adhere to a very tight and demanding schedule.


5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance

        The government's strong ownership of its reform program has been backed up
with an empowered implementing mechanism. The National Steering Committee (NSC)
for the implementation of the CPRGS and PRSCs was established in 2002. It is chaired
by the first Deputy Prime Minister, and brings together the heads of all the relevant line
ministries and government agencies. SBV is assigned as the agency responsible, in close
collaboration with the World Bank, for preparation and implementation of PRSCs. A
Deputy Governor of SBV acts as Standing Vice Chairman of the NSC. This quasi-
advisory body has several representatives from key economic ministries and agencies.
Members of the NSC thus have authority over the entire range of policy areas covered by
the PRSC process. The participation of the Office of the Government (OOG) and the
Party's Economic Commission (PEC) in the NSC also allow for a better coordination of
policy decisions, and to elicit sufficient support for the most critical reforms.
Representatives from a total of 24 lines ministries and government agencies participated
in the preparation of the credit.

        On a different front, the government's strengthened resolve to accede to the WTO
has acted as a catalyst for speeding up reforms across nearly all sectors covered under the
PRSCs.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Ratings: Satisfactory

        The PRSC Steering Committee maintained a continuing and effective economic
dialogue with Bank staff, coordinated and monitored the program under the direction of
the First Deputy Prime Minister, and helped carry out the policy actions called for in the
PRSCs series, meeting conditions for Board presentation and effectiveness.

        The PRSC Secretariat, under the chairmanship of the SBV played a key and
effective role in the day-to-day coordination, cooperation and trouble-shooting between
an increasing number of ministries and agencies in the government and the Bank and an
equally increasing number of donors as the PRSCs expanded in coverage to other sectors
under the three pillars of development

        Given the intensive and complex coordination that is required to manage this very
comprehensive reform program, SBV has created a Program Coordination Unit (PCU)
with dedicated staff from SBV as well as external consultants. The PCU has helped
facilitate the policy dialogue of the Bank and donors with line ministries. The PCU has
been financially supported by PRSC co-financiers.


(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

        The most significant factor responsible for the success of the PRSC operations has
been the government's strong ownership of the reform program. Building consensus
among key stakeholders on the various components of the reform agenda has been a
distinguishing characteristic of the policymaking process. While consensus building has



                                              15

at times been lengthy, it has considerably improved the chances of successful
implementation of the reforms.

        In addition to the NSC noted above, an inter-ministerial working group and a
secretariat to implement and monitor the CPRGS was established at MPI. Three Annual
Progress Reports on the implementation of the CPRGS were prepared by the CPRGS
secretariat under the guidance of the inter-ministerial working group. Among the goals of
the inter-ministerial working group was the implementation of CPRGS at sub-national
levels. The CPRGS Secretariat at MPI supported provincial governments in adapting the
CPRGS to their own context, and reformulating plans and budgets accordingly.

        Also, as noted earlier, the use of reliable information and analysis in policy
making has improved steadily over the PRSC process.

6. Lessons Learned

        A stable macroeconomic and political environment contributed greatly to the
successful implementation of difficult structural reforms in Vietnam. The building of a
broad consensus among key stakeholders coupled with strong government commitment
to implement the reforms minimized the risk of policy reversals.

        Overall, progress was slower in policy areas characterized by limited political will,
conflicting institutional responsibilities or insufficient analytical work. The speed at
which progress was made across policy areas within each of these pillars depended on the
political will to implement the reforms. The contrast between rapid progress in the
integration with the world economy and slow reform in the banking sector is revealing in
this respect. To some extent, this contrast may reflect a deliberate choice, whereby
rapidly moving towards WTO accession would be a way to "lock-in" the need for
subsequent reforms in the banking sector. In other cases, as in water, limited progress
reflects institutional overlap and unclear delimitation of competencies across several
ministries or agencies. In the case of corruption, the commitment to fight it is undeniable
but it is more recent. This is one area where progress on inputs (such as laws, or
coordinating bodies) may take quite some time to translate intro progress on outputs and
outcomes.

        An effective coordination mechanism is essential to overcome the logistical
challenges posed by a wide ranging and cross-cutting policy dialogue. One of the
potential strengths of direct budget support is to provide a predictable flow of aid
resources to the government. But the predictability would be lost if operations were to
slip as a result of their administrative complexity. The institutional arrangement
established at the onset of the process, whereby PRSCs fall under the direct responsibility
of the first Deputy Prime Minister, proved effective in this respect. In practice, the PRSC
secretariat operating in the SBV, has been instrumental in translating this empowerment
into a workable schedule of meetings and exchanges of documents between line
ministries and government agencies on the one hand, and donors on the other.




                                               16

        The Vietnam experience demonstrates that PRSCs, with very low conditionality,
are a well-suited aid instrument in countries with strong government ownership of the
reform agenda and its capacity to deliver in practice. The Vietnam experience also
reflects a transition from a conditionality based policy dialogue to a fully cooperative
policy dialogue. Conditionality has not been a central feature of PRSCs in Vietnam,
except at their inception. PRSC 1 included a series of conditions for the release of the
second tranche (one of them had to be waived) and PRSC 2 had a limited number of
effectiveness conditions. As the policy dialogue around PRSCs matured, incentive
mechanisms were softened, with the assessment of a set of forward-looking triggers
being used to launch the preparation of the next operation in the series. It was agreed that
progress towards meeting all triggers would lead to a higher volume of lending (high-
case scenario), progress towards most and no backtracking in any to the stability of
lending (base case) and serious backtracking to the halting of the process (low case).
Since the introduction of triggers, all the operations in the series actually fell in the base-
case scenario. On the other hand, each of the operations was backward-looking, in the
sense of reckoning the actual progress accomplished in the implementation of the reform
agenda up to that point.

        The programmatic nature of PRSCs also provided the flexibility to move a policy
action to subsequent operations if sufficient progress had not been achieved. This allowed
greater dialogue with the government and stakeholders on the reasons why progress was
slower than anticipated. Such dialogue, sometimes accompanied by greater analytical
work or TA, made the government more comfortable with the policy action and
eventually led to its adoption.

        PRSCs have also become an important donor coordination mechanism, in the
spirit of the harmonization agenda. Discussions with government in each of the policy
areas are jointly conducted with all the co-financiers or potential co-financiers. From the
government's perspective, this arrangement reduces transaction costs. From the donor's
perspective, it increases the coherence of the support to economic reforms. Effective
donor coordination avoids duplication in donor programs that could greatly stretch the
government's capacity. At the same time, there is a scale effect, allowing each the
participating donors to be involved in the policy dialogue to a larger extent than they
could individually. While transaction costs are significantly reduced for the government
and donors, the Bank has had to devote considerable staff time and resources to this effort.
These costs need to be recognized as essential for increasing the effectiveness of total
donor support.

        The experience with the first series of PRSCs in Vietnam highlights the
importance and advantages of consulting with NGOs and the private business sector to
obtain inputs and feedback for the policy dialogue. The task team sought the views of the
private business sector on major legislative and regulatory changes affecting the
investment climate, while NGOs provided valuable inputs on social, environmental, and
governance actions. While their perspectives "from the ground" often tended to focus on
micro or case specific considerations, this detail provided a balance to the "higher level"
policy discussions under the PRSCs. These details have also proved helpful for the



                                              17

government in drafting implementing guidelines for laws, thereby improving the
probability of successful implementation.

        Complementary investment credits or technical assistance are key tools for the
strategic reforms supported by the PRSCs to bear fruit on the ground i.e., PRSCs carry
through high-level policy reforms, whereas investment credits and technical assistance
focus on their implementation. There is also a clear complementarity between PRSCs
and the analytical program. The annual Vietnam Development Reports (VDRs) update
government and donors on the assessment of the development challenges faced by
Vietnam. This in turn enables an articulation of policy actions to meet the development
outcomes specified in strategic documents. The availability of analytical work helped
greatly in the design of policy actions and allowed a higher quality policy dialogue with
the counterparts.


7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
(a) Borrower/Implementing agencies

        The PRSC operations has helped promote the strong ownership of the government
of Viet Nam in designs and implementation thereof and strengthened the partnership
between the government and the donor community. This process has delivered overall
impacts and enabled a more developed and sustainable socio-economic environment,
eventually aiming at poverty reduction as the final goal. The government has also
provided valuable recommendations in their assessment (Annex 4) that will be taken into
account for the preparation of the next series of PRSCs in Vietnam.

(b) Cofinanciers

        The number of co-financiers increased from four at the time of PRSC 1 to 11 for
PRSC 5. The co-financing amount increased from around $40 million to over $150
million (see Annex 5). Bilateral and multilateral donors have played an important role
through their involvement in the policy dialogue with the government through the PRSC
vehicle. Strong donor commitment and participation provided the common ground on
sectoral priorities and broad timetables for the PRSC series and helped to ensure
coherence across donors' programs of support, and to mobilize funding for high priority
tasks in each policy area. .

Annex 3. Assessment of Development Outcomes

Macroeconomic Framework and Performance

        The 2001-2006 period was marked with strong economic growth with GDP
increasing on an annual average of 7.6 percent in real terms. In per capita terms, the
GDP grew at an annual growth rate of 6.1 percent during 2001-2006. GDP per capita
measured in dollar terms, increased from $415 in 2001 to $720 in 2006. If this pace is
sustained over time, the GDP per capita will pass the $1000 per capita milestone by 2010.
Economic growth rates have been built on firm economic fundamentals and Vietnam has
achieved a sound macroeconomic performance and consolidated greatly the likelihood
for sustainable growth in the long run. Inflation increased during the period, but mainly
on account of supply side shocks. The economy has proven to be both resilient and
robust, despite the shock from avian influenza, oil price increases, SARS, and the Asian
financial crisis, in addition to frequent adverse weather.

         Pillar I: Transition to a Market Economy

         Progress in integrating with the world economy has been faster than in other
reform areas. But to a certain extent, this reflects a strategy, whereby political effort was
initially directed at gaining a consensus on WTO accession. Integration with the world
economy is being used as a mechanism to "lock-in" the reforms, and gradually create the
incentive for changes in areas where the inertia is stronger. Accordingly, as WTO
accession neared the final stage, a much bolder approach to reform the banking sector
was finally adopted, and a new approach to SOE emerged.




                                                30

        Exports grew at 22 per annum percent during 2001-06 and the ratio of exports to
GDP rose from 46 to 65 percent over the period. The trade and current account deficits
initially widened, reflecting the investment needs of a growing economy, but narrowed in
subsequent years. The current account deficit was financed mainly through FDI and
ODA inflows. Commitments of FDI soared from 3.4 billion dollars in 2001 to a record
level of 10.2 billion dollars in 2006. External reserves increased from 3.4 billion dollars
in 2001 to 11.5 billion by end-2006. External debt to GDP stood at 30 percent at the end
of 2006 with debt service ratio at a very manageable 5.4 percent. A joint Bank-Fund
DSA put Vietnam at a low risk of external debt distress.

        The number of SOEs has declined steadily over the period, from 5,600 in 2001 to
around 3,000 at the end of 2005, guided by master plans for each line ministry and
province, approved by the Prime Minister. From an initially slow start, transformations
picked up in the second half of 2003 and through 2004. The reduction in SOEs has been
mainly through equitization, whereby the SOE after a sale of shares is converted to a joint
stock company that operates under the Enterprise Law, rather than the SOE Law. Other
forms of SOE transformation have been mergers, conversions to limited liability
companies, outright sales, and liquidation. Initially, the focus of equitization had been on
smaller SOEs, but in 2004 the list of sectors where 100 percent state ownership is to be
retained was substantially shortened.        Since then, the average size of the SOEs
transformed has been rising.       The equitization process has itself undergone major
improvements with appraisals being conducted by outside evaluators, and the share sales
taking place at market values through auctions at the securities trading centers. The
percentage of shares sold to non-employees or to outsiders (including foreigners) has also
been increasing. The percentage of SOEs that did not sell any shares to outsiders has
come down from 52 percent in 2003 to 29 percent in 2005. In 2004, the proportion of
equity sold to outsiders amounted to no more than 9 percent of the total equity in these
enterprises, but it rose to 14 percent in 2005.

        The other aspect of SOE reform, and a key feature in the transition to a market
economy, has been the rising role of the private sector. Between 2000 and 2005, the
share of the private sector in non-oil exports rose from about 50 percent to over 70
percent, while its share in manufacturing production rose from 57 to 65 percent. Over the
same period private investment increased from 14 percent of GDP to over 18 percent,
with the domestic private sector being especially buoyant in recent years. In the last five
years about 144 thousand new domestic enterprises were registered, with the number
being more than 38 thousand alone in 2005. The average capital of these enterprises, at
around 170 thousand dollars in 2005, remains small by international standards. But it has
doubled in comparison with 2001. Private enterprises, excluding farmers and non-farm
self-employment, now account for about 22 percent of the employed labor force,
compared with 13 percent in 1998.

        Progress along all areas of banking reform has been significant, especially in the
last two years. In 2001, the banking reform program aimed at restructuring joint-stock
banks (JSBs) and making them comply with regulatory standards. As for SOCBs, it
involved phasing out their policy lending, resolving their existing non-performing loans
(NPLs), conducting International Accounting Standard (IAS) audits of all of them, and


                                             31

re-capitalizing them. The pace of reform along all these areas has picked up after an
initially slow start. The NPLs identified as of end-2000 were resolved, but mainly
through write-offs.    SOCBs received phased recapitalization payments totaling 10.8
trillion dongs. By 2006, at least six IAS audits have been conducted for each large SOCB.
Audit quality, though initially weak, has improved considerably over time. Policy lending
was separated from the commercial banking system but it initially continued to expand
rapidly through the DAF. However, the introduction of sounder regulation of DAF in
2004 has led to a slow down in such lending. The share of credit to the private sector has
risen to 68 percent in 2006, from 58 percent in 2001.

         SOCBs compliance with banking regulations, though having improved since 2001,
is still short of requirements.     But the regulations for prudential ratios and asset
classification were strengthened, and are to be complied with in a phased manner over the
next three years. There has already been measurable progress towards their attainment.
An important benchmark was the production of a first estimate of NPLs based on criteria
which are close to international standards, in early 2006. This estimate, which after large
write-offs is in the range of 8 to 10 percent of total credit, is lower than many observers
expected.    But it is more than twice as high as previous estimates based on local
accounting standards.     While questions still surround the accuracy of the new loan
classification, the public announcement of more credible figures on a regular basis should
mark a change from the past. In addition, as part of their equitization plans the SOCBs
are taking steps to help market participants obtain a better picture of their worth.
Vietcombank and Mekong Housing Bank (MHB) have hired external consultants to value
the banks, while the Bank for Investment and Development of Vietnam (BIDV) has
obtained a rating from Moodys.

Pillar II: Socially equitable and environmentally sustainable development

         Vietnam has outperformed many other countries in terms of progress towards
achieving the MDGs. Five of the ten main MDG targets set for 2015 have already been
attained, and another four could be reached ahead of time. However, Vietnam might
only partially achieve the target on reversing the loss of environmental resources. It
should be noted that alongside a remarkable performance on nearly all of the MDGs,
important disparities in achievement remain between the Kinh majority and ethnic
minority groups. For example, fewer ethnic minority children are enrolled in school,
especially girls. Also maternal mortality and child mortality rates are much higher in
mountainous areas where many ethnic minorities live than in the rest of Vietnam.

         Vietnam has made impressive improvements in access to education at all levels,
while improving the quality of its primary schools. Net enrolment rates reached 94
percent for primary, 80 percent for lower secondary and 45 percent for upper secondary
in the school year ending in 2004. More importantly, the gap between the rich and the
poor continues to narrow. Between the school years finishing in 1993 and in 2004, the
net primary enrollment rate for the poorest income quintile increased from 70.5 percent to
90.7 percent. For children from ethnic minorities, it increased from 61.8 percent to 87.7
percent. Fundamental School Quality Level (FSQL) standards have been adopted as a
key tool for monitor the performance of the education sector and link resources to needs.


                                             32

FSQL standards combine indicators related to the management of a school, the training of
its teachers, the quality of its infrastructure and the availability of classroom material,
among others. An annual audit of primary schools nationwide was launched in 2004 to
assess progress in the quality of education. By 2005 the average FSQL index had
increased substantially, especially in poorer districts.

        Considerable gains have also been made towards achieving the MDGs on health,
especially in relation to infant and child mortality. The Vietnam Demographic and
Health Survey for 2002 reports infant mortality to have declined to 18 per thousand live
births, compared with 30 at the time of the 1997 survey. The corresponding numbers for
under-five child mortality are 40 per thousand and 24 per thousand.             While these
estimates are subject to large measurement errors, the hypothesis of rapid declines cannot
be rejected. Gains have also occurred in relation to communicable diseases. There has
been progress with regard to malaria, and successes in diagnosing and curing a high
proportion of new TB cases.

        The setting up of Health Care Funds for the Poor (HCFPs) in all provinces
significantly increased the level of funding provided by the central government to support
the health care expenditures of the poor. A survey conducted in two provinces found an
increase in the utilization of health services after the implementation of the HCFPs,
especially for inpatient care. A significant increase in health services sought at the
commune health stations was reported as well.            Although average out-of-pocket
expenditures on outpatient and inpatient care were still substantial, they fell considerably
among the poor.

        Land tenure is being made secure through a rapid increase in the allocation of
Land-Use Right Certificates (LUCs). For agricultural land, LUCs had been issued for
nearly 76 percent of all plots as of 2004, compared with 42 percent in 1998. For urban
land, the corresponding figures were 68 percent and 34 percent respectively. As of 2004,
18 of agricultural land titles were in the name of women, and an additional 12 percent
had the names of both spouses on them. In spite of these developments, the role of land
rental markets in agriculture remains relatively minor. In 2004, 10.7 percent of rural
households had rented-in land, compared with 7.9 percent in 1998. The development of
land sales is limited too, with only 2.7 percent of households reporting that they had sold
land in 2004. While interpreting the above numbers it is important to note that 2004 was
the first year of the new land law, so it is unlikely that the above numbers reflect its
impact.

        Forest cover, including both natural forest and plantations, has risen from about
35 percent of the total land area of the country in 2001 to 37 percent in 2005, but is
quality has been problematic. About 18 percent of the total area is plantations. Of the
natural forests, over two-thirds are considered low quality or regenerating. While the
share of rich and closed-canopy forests was only about 4.6 percent in 2004, it did record
an increase from 3.4 percent in 2000. Efforts to stabilize the area under mangrove forests
appear to be bearing results. The last comprehensive national inventory of mangroves
was conducted in 1999, but a range of site-specific data suggests that combined control




                                             33

and replanting programs have slowed their decline. The prevention of degradation of
wetlands and coral reefs has not been equally successful.

        Pillar III: Building modern governance

        The planning process itself has been substantially improved during the CPRGS
period, moving away from a "command and control" approach towards a more strategic
approach, involving strengthened policy analysis and broader consultation. Both at the
national and subnational levels, participatory workshops for the preparation of the SEDP
for 2006-2010 drew stakeholders from inside and outside the government. Over a period
of several months, consultations were conducted with officials from local governments,
the domestic private sector, local associations, international non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) and development partners, researchers and representatives of the
overseas Vietnamese. There was a particular effort to solicit the views of women. And
teams of local researchers gathered feedback at the grassroots level.

        The implementation of the revised Law on the State Budget, which became
effective in 2004, is one of the cornerstones of the public financial management reform
program.    The law clearly delineates the roles of the National Assembly and the
Provincial People's Councils in budget approval and streamlines budget execution. It
also assigns the Treasury Department as the lead agency responsible for budget execution
and for financial management information. In 2005 the entire State Budget Plan was
disclosed for the first time, including an aggregate amount for defense expenditures. In
November 2004, the trend towards disclosure was reinforced by the Prime Minister's
Decision 192, which mandates that details of budgets at all levels of government be
published within a stipulated time period. Importantly, the Decision introduces financial
transparency in capital projects that use state budget resources. Allocation of funds to
such projects must be based on approved investment plans, and details of the bidding
process need to be made publicly available. Decision 192 also covers the disclosure of
information on the financial situation of SOEs. The norms for allocating expenditures to
provinces were made more transparent and pro-poor. Another development was the
transformation of the State Audit of Vietnam (SAV) into an independent institution
reporting the National Assembly, rather than to the government. The Auditor General
will be appointed and dismissed by the National Assembly and audit reports will be made
public. The SBV will also be subject to annual auditing and the disclosure of the audit
reports.

        To help strengthen medium-term expenditure planning, the government has
piloted the development of MTEFs in four sectors and four provinces. The first MTEFs,
covering the ministries of education, health, transport, and agriculture and rural
development, have been submitted. These contain scenarios for sectoral spending and its
allocation over a period of three years. Estimates for the capital and recurrent sides of the
budget have been prepared in an integrated way, with reference to the development goals
of the sectors. These MTEFs have been developed within the context of a sustainable
medium-term fiscal envelope.

        A diagnostic study of corruption and its modalities was completed in 2005 and its
results were presented publicly.      The independently conducted Investment Climate
Assessment (ICA) survey corroborates the results of the study. Both sources identify the
same set of agencies as being the most corrupt ones; land administration, customs, traffic
police and tax offices come at the top of the list. But it also appears that some of the key
agencies businesses need to deal with (in particular, district level people's committees)
tend to be relatively "clean". Average bribes to each of the most corrupt agencies are in
the order on 100 dollars. Given that this is close to an average salary in manufacturing,
this finding is not comforting from a social and moral point of view. It makes it clear
why the Vietnamese society is so outraged at corruption. At the same time, the cost of
corruption for the conduct of business, estimated at 0.4 percent of sales, is low by
international standards. The ICA also suggests that corruption is a less severe constraint
for businesses in Vietnam than in most other countries in the region, bar Malaysia. The
implementing decrees for the anti-corruption law drew on the results of the diagnostic
studies. The main initiatives for fighting and controlling corruption include increased
public disclosure and transparency in areas such as public procurement, civil works,
management and equitization of SOEs, auditing of the state budget, management and use
of land, and personnel management.

        The adoption of the One Stop Shop (OSS) model nationwide has been an
important step towards simplifying administrative procedures and enhancing their
transparency. In general, the OSSs have provided an accessible and recognizable entry
point for people in need of administrative services. Procedures have been published and
fees have been made more transparent. By now, 63 out of 64 provinces have established
OSSs in the four compulsory departments, namely Labor and Social Affairs, Natural
Resources and Environment, Planning and Investment, and Construction. Overall, 98
percent of all districts and 65 percent of all communes have set up their OSS.

        Legal transparency has improved with the issuance of a Decree stipulating that the
sanction for non-publication of legal normative documents in the Official Gazette is non-
effectiveness. While the requirement to publish in the Official Gazette had been made in
the Law on the Promulgation of Legal Documents, the implications of non-publication
were not explicit until now. Moreover, this new Decree, passed in 2005, sets clear
guidelines for the collection of comments from stakeholders directly affected by legal
normative documents. A minimum period of 20 working days is stipulated for
consultation. The latter can take place through mass media or through the internet.

Annex 4. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

              INPUTS OF THE GOVERMENT TO ICR OF PRSCs 1-5

As a comprehensive process, PRSC operations embrace increasing numbers of areas
while promoting the ownership of the government of Viet Nam in designs and
implementation thereof and strengthening the partnership between the government and
the donor community. This process has delivered overall impacts and enabled a more
developed and sustainable socio-economic environment, eventually aiming at poverty
reduction as the final goal.


1. The PRSC operations have delivered significant effects on Vietnam.

PRSC operations 1-5 undertaken over the period of 2001-06 were prepared and
implemented quite successfully, creating an effective platform of policy dialogue for the
government and the donor community, contributing to the acceleration of the reforms in
Vietnam, and mobilizing substantial financial support to the state budget for attainment
of the set socio-economic development goals and poverty reduction targets over the past
few years.

Actively supporting the implementation of the reform agenda and development program
of the government.

Closely aligned to CPRGS, PRSC operations have contributed recommendations of
policy priorities in a broad range of areas and creation of specific course of actions for
each year. Established through the PRSCs, the regular policy dialogue between the
government and WB and co-financiers took place in a platform where valuable
knowledge and expertise of both sides in various areas are brought into full play. This
support is of great importance, especially in the global integration of Viet Nam, including
the efforts to accelerate the WTO accession. In addition, while PRSC implementation
was on an annual basis, the PRSC process still featured great strategic importance given
that the contents for discussion were closely aligned to strategic orientation of the
government and the donor side also actively linked their support strategies to its reform
agenda.

Channeling financial support to the state budget

The credit proceeds of PRSCs are substantial while the disbursements thereof are very
rapid, often only after 3 months of signing. The procedures to ensure the effectiveness of
the Financing Agreement are reasonable and in line with the relevant rules and
regulations of Vietnam on international treaties. This budget support is highly predictable
and synchronized with the state budget preparation and execution.




                                            44

Strengthening cooperation

As an initiative of direct budget support by WB, PRSC process has drawn increasing
attention of other bilateral and multilateral donors over the last operations. A high spirit
of cooperation and harmonization has been reflected in the use of the same policy matrix
for their financing agreement and the participation of many donors in discussion with
representatives of various ministries and government agencies. The coordination across
the ministries and government agencies, between WB and donors, and between the
government and the donor community has been increasingly strengthened and developed.

Providing effective channel of information

The PRSC process has created a platform for regular sharing of information in a wide-
range of areas. Information collected during the PRSC process underlies many of the
assessments and analysis of WB and other donors, namely the PRSC Program
Documents and the Vietnam Development Report (VDA), usefully providing reference
for Vietnamese officials in terms of policy inputs and helps update the international
community with the current status and development trend in Vietnam.

2. Recommendations on improving the effectiveness of the cooperation in PRSC
preparation and implementation.

- Contents: It is recommended to further align to action plans of the government to
implement the Resolution of the 10th Party Congress and the SEDP 2006-2010 and the
roadmap to implement Vietnam's WTO membership commitments. Three key pillars are
proposed to focus on: (i) transition to a socialist-oriented market economy; (ii)
improvement of the effectiveness of governance towards modernity, transparency,
efficiency, and fighting corruption; (iii) sustainable development to achieve the MDGs of
Vietnam, making efforts to halve the number of the poor households by 2010 while
focusing on social issues and strengthening environmental protection.

- Financial support: The government of Viet Nam proposes WB and the other donors to
further support the policy of the government to attract ODA and facilitate increased
budget financing for the implementation of the ambitious reform agenda of the
government and its commitments in various areas, especially in poverty reduction and
attainment of the MDGs. At the same time, for improvement of financing effectiveness,
both sides need to seek further harmonization, especially in planning and budgeting
processes. Early and concrete co-financing commitments are of great assistance to the
government because this enables more activeness of the government in budgeting and
balancing resources across priorities, resulting in more effective use of resources and
avoidance of delays in use of resources unaccounted into the state budget. It is reasonable
to schedule PRSC technical discussion and negotiation in April and May, and co-
financing commitments should be announced to the relevant government agencies in
about July or September, when state budgeting is underway.




                                              45

In financial perspective, donors should make medium-term and long-term specific
commitments for PRSCs and further improve the appraisal procedures of financing to
shorten time for preparation and approval of financing documents, facilitating the
Government in prediction of annual finances and proactive budget preparation and
allocation. It is suggested that WB and other donors streamline the procedures of
receiving co-finances and co-financing agreements be produced by simply referring to
the Financing Agreement between the Government and WB. Conditions under co-
financing agreements should only be based on the policy actions agreed upon during
PRSC negotiation. Another suggestion is that upon determination of the channel of
financing donors should promptly notify the Government whether it will be direct
financing or through the trust fund of WB so that the Government can be proactive in
working out formalities to receive resources.

WB and other donors are also proposed to further support the co-ordination by continuing
to fund the operations of the PRSC Coordination Unit of SBV to ensure success for the
coming PRSCs.

Providing technical assistance in parallel with PRSC operations:

During the implementation of the comprehensive PRSC process, in addition to direct
budget support, in case of complicated policy actions, WB and other donors would be
highly appreciated for providing technical assistance for the relevant ministries and
agencies to overcome obstacles and improve the substantive quality of policy actions.
This modality of support should be reflected as the direct results of the commitments
under PRSCs.

Annex 5. Donor Support to the PRSC Process

        The number of co-financiers increased from four at the time of PRSC 1 to 11 for
PRSC 5. The co-financing amount increased from around $ 40 million to over $ 150
million (see Table below). Apart from co-financing PRSC operations, bilateral and
multilateral donors have played an important role through their involvement in the policy
dialogue with the government. Donors participating in the process contributed human
and financial resources to assess the policy challenges, coordinate their approaches, and
discuss the options with government, across a range of policy areas. These were chosen
in accordance with their priorities and comparative strengths. The preparation of the
PRSC operations was conducted in a joint manner, with regular donor meetings taking
place to reach consensus on how to proceed. Bilateral meetings between the World Bank
and specific donors have also proved useful to share information and put to good use the
combined insights and knowledge of all the parties involved. These meetings provided
the common ground on sectoral priorities and broad timetables for the present operation.

        Strong donor commitment to Vietnam is reflected in the intense meeting
frequency of the different working groups that were established to coordinate the views
of co-financiers and share information pertaining to the PRSC process. Joint working
groups of donors, government and international NGOs that meet on a regular basis have
helped carry the discussions on government's plans for reforms to a wide group of
stakeholders. With the formation of working groups organized by policy area, donors
have had the opportunity to engage in discussions on reform with government
counterparts on an ongoing basis. Such an arrangement also helped to ensure coherence
across donors' programs of support, and to mobilize funding for high priority tasks in
each policy area.
