                                   WEST BANK AND GAZA

                        PALESTINIAN NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN
                             DEVELOPMENT POLICY GRANT IV


Borrower                    Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) (for the benefit of the
                            Palestinian Authority (PA))

Implementing Agency         Ministry of Finance (MOF) of the Palestinian Authority

Financing Data              Terms: Grant from the Trust Fund for Gaza and West Bank (TFGWB)
                            Amount: US$40 million

Operation Type              The proposed operation is for budget support and is a follow-up to three
                            previous Palestinian Reform and Development Plan Development
                            Policy Grant (PRDP DPGs) approved by the Board on June 5, 2008,
                            April 28, 2009 and September 14, 2010. The proposed grant would be
                            disbursed in a single tranche upon satisfactory completion of the prior
                            actions.

Main Policy Areas           The PNDP DPG IV will support the PA as it implements the National
                            Development Plan (NDP) 2011-2013. The PNDP DPG IV continues to
                            focus support on two areas: (i) strengthening the PA’s fiscal position;
                            and (ii) improving public financial management.

KeyResults Indicators       The PNDP DPG IV is designed to help the PA strengthen its fiscal
                            position by increasing domestic revenues to about 24 percent of Gross
                            Domestic Product (GDP) by 2012 and managing the share of the public
                            sector wage bill to keep it in line at about 20 percent of GDP. The
                            PNDP DPG IV also supports the PA’s efforts to improve public
                            financial management. Key indicators for this are greater transparency
                            in budget reporting of development and transfer spending, stronger
                            oversight for public procurement through new and better-trained
                            institutions, and publicly available audited accounts.
Program Development         The proposed operation will help the PA to implement the new National
Objectives and              Development Plan. Like the PRDP DPGs I-III, the PNDP DPG- IV will
Contribution to CAS         specifically support efforts to improve the fiscal position and increase
                            government transparency and accountability.

Risks and Risk Mitigation   The NDP’s success depends on parallel actions by the PA, the
                            Government of Israel (GOI) and the donor community.
                            The key risks are:

                            (i) The highly volatile political situation could deteriorate, with the
                                consequence of stalled reforms. If the security situation deteriorates,
                                private sector confidence and investment will decline, public
                                revenues will fall and government reforms may stall. What is
                                    2
                   critical at this juncture is that the PA has continued to implement
                   structural reforms despite the highly difficult economic
                   environment and fiscal pressures, and remains committed to
                   continued reforms. The PA has successfully mobilized popular
                   support for its actions in the West Bank through its extensive
                   consultations on the development of the NDP.
               (ii) The PA is striving to improve its fiscal position, but for the
                    foreseeable future they will remain dependent upon high levels of
                    aid. While the PA has charted a course toward lesser dependence
                    on external aid and is actively undertaking the relevant reforms, it
                    will take many years for the PA to achieve fiscal sustainability and
                    that will only be possible if there is a political settlement that allows
                    the economy to flourish.
               (iii) The PA will not be able to meet its fiscal goals without substantial
                     economic growth.          However, under the recent political
                     uncertainties, the relaxation of movement restrictions slowed down
                     – whereas this relaxation had proved vital to fostering new
                     economic growth in 2010 – as did disbursements of donor
                     commitments. The international donor community is continuing to
                     monitor the closure system and its economic impact. The Bank and
                     other development partners will continue to monitor progress in the
                     reform agenda, and the transparency of public expenditures.
               This proposed fourth DPG sends a strong signal to donors that the
               World Bank places great importance on progress on the NDP and that
               donors should continue to support it.

                              DEVELOPMENT POLICY GRANT IV

                                 THE WEST BANK AND GAZA



                                         I.      INTRODUCTION

1.      This document proposes the fourth Development Policy Grant (DPG) to the Palestinian Authority
(PA) in support of the new National Development Plan 2011-2013. After a successful episode of
implementing the Palestinian Recovery and Development Plan (PRDP 2008-2010), the caretaker
government put forward the new National Development Plan (NDP 2011-2013). Under the earlier PRDP
2008-2010, the caretaker government set out towards restoring the basic operating systems of the PA while
reforming and creating stronger public institutions that will form the basis of a future Palestinian state. The
current NDP 2011-2013 aims to move the PA fiscal and institutional performance beyond recovery and
towards sustainability, by gradually reducing dependence on foreign assistance while continuing to improve
the welfare of citizens.

2.      In February 2011 the PA cabinet resigned with the expectation of formation of a new cabinet within
five weeks. This did not happen and the existing cabinet has continued in an acting capacity. On May 4,
2011, the PA in the West Bank signed a reconciliation agreement with the leadership in Gaza, calling for
the formation of an interim unity government and announcing a plan to hold national elections by 2012.
The interim unity government was expected to be composed primarily of politically independent
professionals and technocrats and to continue to implement the NDP. However, since this announcement
no progress has been made on forming a new cabinet, and the current cabinet continues to operate. This
highlights the uncertainty and fluidity in the broader environment. Until an agreement is reached regarding
the composition of a new cabinet, the current Caretaker Government will continue to perform its tasks.

3.       Since 2008, the PA has maintained a momentum of reform and streamlining both on the fiscal and
institutional aspects of governance. Economic growth in 2010 closely matched projections of the
development plan, while fiscal performance was as planned in the 2010 budget, with a reduction in the
recurrent deficit as a percentage of GDP to 16 percent from 26 percent the year before. However, in 2011,
delays and shortfalls in disbursements of foreign aid led to a liquidity crisis and severe fiscal pressure. The
consequent fiscal retrenchment along with the slower easing of GOI restrictions in 2011 have caused
economic growth to slow to an estimated 7 percent for the year.

4.      Providing a DPG in WB&G continues to be a risky prospect. Success for DPG IV in assisting the
PA to achieve the goals set forth by the new National Development Plan 2011-2013 will depend on the PA,
GOI and donors all continuing to play their parts. While public sector reform, along with donor aid has
underpinned growth and recovery, this momentum will be unsustainable unless private sector growth rises
to the level needed to support basic services for the Palestinian population. And while this is partly
dependent on the PA improving business environment and lowering risk, private sector growth also hinges
on the GOI continuing to relax economic and movement restrictions.

5.      With numerous developments in the region rendering the political circumstances in West Bank and
Gaza ever more complex, the easing of restrictions from the closure regime has not been sustained.
Nevertheless, the NDP and ongoing caretaker government reforms present a credible agenda worthy of
continued budget support. Given the Bank’s role in encouraging donor funding of the Government’s
                                                              4

recurrent budget, the Bank’s endorsement of the new NDP and the PA’s reform efforts will have a
significant impact.

                                       II. WEST BANK & GAZA CONTEXT

A.       POLITICAL CONTEXT

6.       Since the collapse of the power-sharing government in 2007, the Caretaker government has been
administered by the Palestinian Authority. In May 2011, the PA and the leadership in Gaza began
discussing a unity cabinet composed of politically independent technocrats. However, since this
announcement no progress has been made on forming a new cabinet, and the current cabinet continues to
operate. Until an agreement is reached regarding the composition of a new cabinet, the current Caretaker
Government will continue to perform its tasks. Under the Israeli restrictions on the West Bank, a number of
controls have been imposed limiting internal and external mobility. These controls include barriers at all
international borders and numerous check points and barriers hindering internal transport of goods and
people. The controls also block access to some 60 percent of land in the West Bank and most natural
sources of water. The Government of Israel (GOI) prevents movement between Gaza and the West Bank
and strictly controls the population registry. These controls and barriers have a major impact on cost of
production and cost of living in WB&G, on economic growth and investment, and on employment, wages
and poverty.1 The easing of restrictions by the Government of Israel in 2009 probably had a positive impact
on the Palestinian economy as well, but there has been little further easing since2.

7.       At present, the lack of engagement under a specific peace negotiations calendar, coupled with the
broader Arab Spring revolutions in the region, has substantially increased political tensions and uncertainty.
The Ministries of Finance of Israel and the Palestinian Authority have held technical discussions on linking
PA and Israeli authorities on VAT, customs, release of clearance revenues, and sharing of fees from the
Allenby Bridge. A political decision to implement agreed steps that could enhance revenue mobilization
and budget execution in WB&G is awaited. Clearance revenues collected by GOI on behalf of the PA were
delayed in May 2011, though were ultimately transferred, and again in October 2011. If the security
situation deteriorates and hostilities resume, private sector confidence and investment will decline, public
revenues will fall and government reforms may stall. Equally, stability can continue to strengthen
Palestinian public institutions and revive the private sector to enable positive economic growth.

B.       RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

8.      Output, Prices and Labor: In 2010 WB&G experienced a third consecutive year of real economic
growth. Exceeding the projected 8 percent growth, the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS)
estimates real GDP growth in WB&G to have reached 9.3 percent. The Gaza economy rebounded sharply
during 2010 seemingly due to the partial opening of the crossings to more goods, achieving real growth
exceeding 15 percent, twice the growth experienced in the West Bank, which experienced approximately
7.6 percent according to PCBS estimates. With per capita GDP growth at 6.2 percent, 2010 is the fourth
consecutive year of per capita GDP growth, signalling that the WB&G economy is beginning to recover
after years of decline. However the extent of this recovery remains unknown, as early macroeconomic
estimates suggest a slowdown in real GDP growth to an estimated 7 percent during 2011.

9.       While growth is decelerating on the West Bank, Gaza is exhibiting signs of a sharp recovery, albeit
from a very low base. However, the territory’s economy remains precarious. The main drivers of growth
are a combination of PA government reforms that have increased investor confidence, the loosening of
some Israeli security restrictions, but more importantly, the substantial and sustained inflows of donor
assistance supporting the recurrent PA budget and financing various development projects. In 2010, the PA
received approximately US$1.243 billion in budget support coming on top of US$1.355 billion in 2009,
US$1.8 billion in 2008 and almost US$1 billion in 2007. In addition to these aforementioned sums,
hundreds of millions more in aid entered the economy over the past few years through the UN and from
bilateral assistance programs for development projects. The large amounts of budget support have allowed
the PA to maintain expansionary fiscal policies to support growth. In 2010, total PA commitments were
equivalent to around 43 percent of GDP, with wage expenditures alone at around 21 percent of GDP.

10.     Recovery in the private sector continues to lag behind the public sector. Between 1999 and 2009,
manufacturing output was flat and its share in GDP fell from 12.5 percent to 11 percent. Output in
agriculture fell by 47 percent during the same period and its GDP share declined from 10.4 percent to
4.8 percent. The PA’s reforms that have improved security and provided more efficient service delivery
along with the GOI’s loosening of its security restrictions have no doubt increased investor confidence, but
there is not yet any sign of a large scale revival of private investment in the productive sectors of the
economy. As of 2010, among the fastest growing sectors in the WB&G were hotels and restaurants, which
grew by 46.3 percent, followed by construction at 35 percent. Finally, as a part of the reform agenda since
2007, public administration and defence continued to expand by 6.4 percent in 2010. On the other hand,
estimates of manufacturing output show a drop in output by 6 percent, which leaves current output levels
more than 10 percent below their 1999 level.

11.     The PA is making efforts to help revive the private sector, but sustained private sector growth will
require a takeoff in investment, which will only happen when Palestinian enterprises have better access to
markets in Israel, East Jerusalem, and elsewhere, as well as have access to land and resources in Area C, the
area restricted from Palestinian use for reasons of GOI security concerns. The GoI still prevents all
exports from Gaza except for a limited amount of agricultural goods. These goods are not allowed
to be shipped to the West Bank or Israel but must be directly exported beyond.

12.     The PCBS estimates that growth in Gaza was 15 percent in 2010, a sharp improvement compared
to 2009 with an estimated growth rate of 1 percent. While growth in Gaza may appear impressive, much of
                                                           7

it represents a “catch up? of real GDP following a sharp contraction by a cumulative 30 percent during 2006
– 2009. Even when taking into account the sharp rise of output in 2010, Gaza’s real GDP remains 20
percent below its 2005 level.

13.      Positive growth alone does not signal that the Gaza economy is on the road to recovery. Since the
GOI’s decision in July 2010 to allow more imports into Gaza, early signs point to an aid driven recovery.
The private sector may take longer to pull out of its state of near total collapse. Given Gaza’s economic
isolation from the West Bank, maintaining Gaza’s recovery momentum will require the lifting of the ban on
exports as well as imports of private investment inputs. As it currently stands, the vast majority of Gaza’s
private sector remains moribund and the economy is sustained by government spending and humanitarian
assistance. While the opening of the Rafah crossing will help ease movement restrictions on people, the
crossing does not serve as a port for goods, therefore its effects on trade and the private sector will be
minor.

14.      Prices in WB&G were relatively stable in 2010 and inflation continued to decline partly due to the
relaxation of some movement restrictions. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased on average by
3.75 percent in 2010, primarily driven by prices in East Jerusalem and the West Bank, where percentage
CPI change was 5.25 and 4.24 respectively. CPI in Gaza grew by a mere 1.72 percent, most likely due to
falling prices from the loosening of movement restrictions on consumer goods.

15.     While economic growth figures signal a recovery in WB&G economy, unemployment rates remain
high and are not declining as fast as expected given the high growth in the both the West Bank and Gaza.
Unemployment rate remains particularly high among Gaza’s youth3. The muted response of unemployment
to high growth suggests that recovery has taken place through a more efficient utilization of previously
employed resources, with little rise in business investment and hiring. In order for unemployment rate to
decline faster, the private sector needs a lower risk environment and stable access to outside markets.
During the period of 2008-2010, unemployment in the West Bank and Gaza dropped from 19 percent to 17
percent and from 41 percent to 38 percent respectively. Among Gaza’s youth, unemployment rate remains
disturbingly high at 53 percent, even with an economic growth rate of 15 percent.

16.      Labor participation rate tells a similar story regarding the recovery. The labor participation rate
remains low at 44.5 percent in West Bank and 36.3 percent in Gaza. Both employment and participation
rates are significantly lower among youth under the age of 30, which is the largest demographic segment of
the Palestinian population. Though work opportunities for West Bank residents in Israel have risen slightly
from an average of 10 percent of the labor force (2001-2006) to 12 percent (2010), it is far from the
19 percent experienced prior to the second intifada (2000). In Gaza, the share of the labor force working in
Israel dropped from 13 percent before 2000 to a negligible segment in the past few years.

17.     Fiscal Developments. The 2010 recurrent deficit on a commitment basis was budgeted at
16.8 percent of GDP, but the actual deficit was lower at 15.6 percent of GDP, or US$1.14 billion. On the
revenue side, Gaza clearance revenues were less than budgeted due to lower energy imports4. This decrease
was offset by better tax compliance as well as repayment of tax arrears owed since 2007 in the West Bank5.
Despite increased tax revenues, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) faced deficits in both recurrent spending
and development projects. To counteract this, the MOF kept ministries’ non-wage expenditures lower than
the pro-rata budgeted amounts. As a result, non-wage recurrent expenditure commitments were US$143
million dollars less than budgeted in 2010. In the first three quarters of 2011, wage expenditures have
exceeded the budget by about 1 percent, mostly due to adjustment of allowances to certain employees.
Authorities were on track to limit new public sector employees to less than 3,000.

18.      The PA is plagued by delays in disbursement of donor aid, including those for development
projects, and usually resorts to borrowing from domestic banks to close the financing gap. The amount of
donor aid that was projected to fund the 2010 recurrent budget was of US$1.243 billion, but the disbursed
amount was US$1.147 billion. Moreover, actual disbursed aid for development projects was US$130
million against a total commitment of $299 million. Recurrent spending budget were compressed below
commitment levels in order to balance the shortfalls in aid. Despite a lower deficit and due to shortfalls in
aid, there was an increase in net domestic bank financing of US$84 million, bringing stock of debt to banks
at the end of 2010 to US$0.84 billion. Development expenditures were lower than budgeted, which partly
reflects the restrictions on import of investment inputs in Gaza but mostly the shortfall in donor aid.

19.      Trade. Israel remains WB&Gs largest trading partner. Despite a slight climb in exports to Israel
during 2010, the overall trade figures in WB&G since 2008 have been declining. International Monetary
Fund (IMF) estimates a 5 percent uptick in the exports of goods and services from West Bank to Israel
during 2010; however, this slight rise followed a contraction between 2008 and 2009 by approximately 15
percent due to the construction of the separation barrier. When comparing the drop in exports from WB&G
to Israel, to the drop in imports from Israel to WB&G, it is clear that the impact of the separation barrier on
trade was asymmetric: imports from Israel dropped by 10 percent between 2008 and 2009, reflecting the
much tighter Israel restrictions in WB&G on exports than on imports.

20.     Naturally trade restrictions created a distortion among Palestinian sectors, favoring services and
non-tradable goods such as construction over tradable sectors such as agriculture and manufacturing, which
have shrunk considerably since the establishment of trade restrictions, which continue to impact the
competition and access to the procurement market. According to the IMF, 6 having patterns of production
in the WB&G economy driven by trade restrictions rather than comparative advantage, especially in the
absence of a local seaport or airport, continues to have a substantial impact on economic growth since 1994.

21.      Banking/Financial regulation. The Palestinian banking sector remains strong and liquid, though
highly conservative. Banks in the WB&G are regulated by the Palestinian Monetary Authority (PMA), one
of the strongest and most capable institutions in WB&G and among the best managed monetary institutions
in the region. Relying on technical assistance from the IMF and the World Bank Group including IFC, the
PMA is moving steadily to improve its systems and build the capabilities required by a central bank for a
future Palestinian state.

22.      Following steady institutional reforms since 2007, the PMA developed the capacity to supervise a
rigorous regulatory framework applicable to all banks in the West Bank and Gaza. Due to strides on the
institutional reform agenda, the banking sector experienced a rise in private bank credit in 2010, mainly
stemming from reforms in the financial market infrastructure implemented during 2009. Credit to the
private sector rose by 29 percent in the West Bank, and 17 percent in Gaza. This rise in domestic credit
was also fuelled by increase in the minimum share of assets that Palestinian Banks must keep in WB&G to
45 percent.

23.      Currently, the PMA carries on in advancing its regulatory framework towards full implementation
of Basel II standards, which are expected to be achieved by mid-2012. In the interest of raising transaction
efficiency and reducing liquidity risk, the World Bank is assisting the PMA in developing a bank deposit
insurance scheme, which is expected to be ready in early 2012. Furthermore, the PMA is in the final stages
of installing an electronic payment system, which should further raise transaction efficiency. On the legal
front, a banking law was enacted in November of 2010 to strengthen the financial sector’s legal framework,



6
 According to the IMF, manufacturing and agriculture sectors shrunk from 33 percent of trade in 1994 when trade
with Israel was unrestricted, to 19 percent in 2010 with trade restrictions in place
                                                          9

and a new Central Bank Law guaranteeing the independence of the PMA is expected to be approved later
this year.

24.      One of the most pressing issues facing the Palestinian banking system is maintaining its
relationship with Israeli banks. Israeli banks have broken all relations with banks in Gaza and have quit
accepting cash deposits from most counterparts in the West Bank. They had indicated their desire to also
end relations with West Bank banks. This led to a build-up of cash in Palestinian Banks in the West Bank,
which significantly raised their insurance expenses, and resulted in significant losses due to forgone
interest. In July 2010 a special arrangement to address this problem was achieved through cooperation
between the PMA and the Bank of Israel (BoI), which resulted in an agreement to have excess NIS cash
being regularly deposited at Israeli banks; however this arrangement is no longer practiced. WB&G uses
the New Israeli Shekel, US Dollar, Euro and Jordanian Dinar (JD) as its currencies, though most
transactions are conducted in Shekels. Thus the PMA does not control monetary policy or exchange rate
policy.

25.      Poverty. According to a recent World Bank poverty assessment report, 7 as of 2009, approximately
22 percent of the Palestinian population lived under the poverty line. Over the past 8 years, there was an
overall improvement in poverty by 4 percent. However, improvement in poverty incidence was limited to
the West Bank. Since 2004, poverty in the West Bank steadily declined from 23 percent to 16 percent in
2009, which stands in contrast with poverty in Gaza rising from 30 to 33 percent during the same time
period (spiking at 50 percent in 2007).

26.      Improvement in poverty incidence in the West Bank can primarily be attributed to recent
institutional reforms and increased donor aid. While poverty incidence in Gaza shows a net increase since
2004, the most recent data for the years 2007-2009 showed a slight reduction in poverty, primarily due to
increased donor funded assistance. The aforementioned Poverty Assessment states that as of 2009,
approximately 71 percent of Gaza’s population reported receiving at least one form of social assistance,
compared to only 12 percent of households in the West Bank.

27.      Corruption. As is documented in the World Bank’s recent report on corruption in WB&G,8 during
much of the first decade of the PA, government systems were fragmented, informal and gave considerable
discretion to the office of the president and political leaders. This resulted in wasteful expenditure and
leakages of public funds. From this starting point, the PA has worked to strengthen economic governance
and combat corruption, both essential to sustained economic growth and improved delivery of public
services. The report finds the PA has made significant progress in its public institutions, establishing a
strong governance environment in many critical areas. But it also identifies areas where reforms are
underway but incomplete or, in some areas, not yet under consideration.

28.      Consistent with the improvements in Palestinian government institutions are the report’s survey
results, showing that public sector corruption is not viewed as among the most serious problems facing
Palestinians; very few Palestinians experienced corruption when accessing public services.

C.         MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

29.     Real economic growth was originally projected to reach 9 percent in 2011 with even higher growth
rates expected in 2012-2013. However, the latest estimates indicate a slowdown in economic growth in
2011 in part due to a slowdown in external assistance and consequently in fiscal spending. The
macroeconomic outlook remains precarious due to restrictions on movement of people and goods and
access to resources in both Gaza and the West Bank. Since July 2010, the easing of Gaza’s blockade as

well as the easing of the restrictions in the West Bank has facilitated the resumption of economic growth.
The June 2011 opening of the Rafa crossing of the Gaza border with Egypt for people but not yet for goods
will have some positive economic impact over time. The growth in the West Bank has continued to reap
the benefits from higher private sector confidence which has been possible through good management and
reforms by the Palestinian Authority (PA). Growth in Gaza has benefited from the consumer goods and
humanitarian assistance that has been able to enter the territory; although goods, especially production
inputs, are still constricted. However, Gaza output levels still remain 20 percent lower than those of 2005.

30.     The original growth projections assumed the continued relaxation of restrictions on West Bank and
Gaza and continued political stability; however these assumptions have not been realized. With
uncertainties remaining from the announced reconciliation agreement, easing of restrictions has halted;
economic growth has also slowed with consequent fiscal impact. Current estimates suggest a slowdown in
economic recovery, with the estimated growth rate dropping to 7 percent in 2011. Inflation fell to about 3
percent in 2010 but is estimated to have risen to 4 percent in 2011 due to the increase in world food and fuel
prices.

31.      The 2011 budget approved by the cabinet at end-March provided for a decline of recurrent budget
deficit on a commitment basis to 13 percent of GDP in 2011 (compared to 17.5 percent of GDP the
previous year), allowing the PA to meet its target of no net domestic bank borrowing, except for short-term
loans, and no net arrears accumulation. Net lending was projected to decline by 1.3 percent of GDP. The
budget also called for the PA to slightly reduce non-wage expenditures after they increased in the last three
years, including by 35 percent in 2009. The wage bill was budgeted to reflect the adjustment of 3.5 percent
in the wage rate to offset 2010 inflation, as well as the automatic 1.25 percent yearly increase and the
increase of net employment by 3,000 employees.

32.    Furthermore, the authorities continued to pursue the expenditure reform agenda defined in their
National Development Plan, including:

    (a) Full implementation of reforms associated with the creation of the Palestinian National Social
        Safety Net Program (PNSSP);
    (b) Complete transfer of responsibility for electricity distribution from municipalities to commercial
        utility companies. Such a transfer was implemented in the northern West Bank in 2010 and
        continues with the regions of Qalquiya and Tulkarm.
    (c) Implementation of the adopted 2010 action plan to reduce pension liabilities and ensure long-term
        fiscal sustainability of the Unified Pensions Scheme;
    (d) Development of a medium-term plan for civil service reform, including a review of the Law of
        Civil Service.
33.      The fiscal outturn for 2011 is now estimated to have been less favourable than originally expected.
First, with slower growth, revenues have fallen short, causing the overall deficit to shrink only to an
estimated 16 percent of GDP for the year. At the same time, total donor contributions, including
disbursements from the Palestinian Reform and Development Multi-Donor Trust Fund (PRDP-TF),
amounted to just over $1 billion in 2011, as compared to $1.3 billion in 2010. Contingency plans involving
more contractionary measures and increased domestic financing were activated to compensate for the
shortfall in donor contributions.

34.      Projections for economic growth in 2012 are similar that of 2011, with 5 percent growth expected
in West Bank and 7 percent overall for West Bank and Gaza. The broad outlines of the 2012 budget project
faster growth for revenues than recurrent expenditures, allowing for a continued decline in the recurrent
                                                    11

fiscal deficit. With slower growth for the public wage bill and lower levels of net lending, more resources
will be available for reducing domestic arrears, and allow for development expenditures to rebound.

35.     The macroeconomic framework, though difficult, is deemed appropriate for the purpose of this
operation. In the future, improved donor coordination framework and revenue transfer arrangements
would help the PA better to plan its cash position.

                       III.    THE GOVERNMENT’S PROGRAM FOR 2011-2013

36.      The PA’s new National Development Plan (NDP) for 2011-2013, approved and published in April
2011, builds upon and the Palestinian Reform and Development Plan (PRDP) of 2008-2010. The NDP
outlines the government’s 2011-2013 policy agenda, macroeconomic and accountability framework. The
PA is looking forward to future statehood and forging ahead with improving institutions, and with 23 new
sector strategies that were developed through numerous consultations with many stakeholders such as the
Non Governmental Organizations (NGO), civil society organization, international organizations as well as
the private sector and local government actors. The government’s program is complete with targets and
sector objectives in order to guide implementation and allow monitoring.

37.     The NDP has been written with the purpose of establishing a solid foundation for the future
creation of a State of Palestine in the 2011-2013 periods. Authorities’ goal is to provide a framework that is
able to rise to the challenge of providing its citizens with adequate service delivery. In line with the
recommendations of the 2011 World Development Report titled Conflict, Security, and Development, the
NDP maintains the PA’s commitment to developing public institutions and local communities towards
dampening the ramifications of the ongoing conflict on the economies of the West Bank and Gaza. The
NDP also strives to improve upon the social disparities among its citizens that have been adversely affected
by the closure regime. Authorities hope that this policy agenda will consolidate institutions which will spur
investment and a vibrant private sector. This NDP has four major sector strategies which include:
governance, social development, economy and infrastructure.

A.        GOVERNANCE

38.      The authorities have been improving their institutional capacity since the 1990’s. The authorities,
through consultations with relevant ministries and non-governmental agencies and stakeholders, have laid
plans to continue to build institutions for the public expenditure and governance component of the NDP.
Governance policy has been broken down by sectors: justice and rule of law, security, international
relations, administrative development, local governance & administration, public financial management,
public information, statistics and research, and land management.

39.       The NDP has outlined several strategic objectives for the governance sector:

      (a) To provide national security and public safety throughout the country – This objective builds upon
          the successes of the PRDP 2008-2010 in imposing public order and rule of law and building
          infrastructure for the security sector. For the 2011-2013 NDP, authorities have outlined priority
          policies to provide that all citizens are ensured the fundamental right to safety and security.
      (b) To deliver justice and the rule of law for all citizens – This strategy envisions improving the
          institutional capacity of the justice sector over the next three years. The justice sector objectives
          build upon the reforms outlined for the PRPD of 2008-2010.
      (c) To modernize and streamline public administration – This objective has been developed around a
          framework which outlines a unified approach to upgrading the organizational structure of ministries
          and agencies, as well as strengthening institutional capacity.
      (d) To empower local government and bring public services closer to citizens – In order to tackle the
          fragmentation of service delivery, authorities have put in place a strategy to build local government
          units (LGUs) capacity to provide adequate service delivery to local municipalities.
      (e) To attain financial independence and economic stability – The PA is committed to continuing the
          prudent fiscal policy measures such as were outlined in the PRDP 2008-2010, with the goal of
          increasing growth and in due course, sustainable financial self-sufficiency.
                                                      14

40.    The objectives have all been developed with quantifiable goals in order to measure the
improvement or deterioration of specific reforms. This will ensure authorities have a clear framework to
monitor and evaluate progress of the proposed programs.

B.       SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT

41.      The PA’s aim with the social sector is to improve service delivery among its citizens and to reduce
disparities that are occurring in service delivery to certain groups. The authorities intend to work with
private sector and non-governmental organization to guarantee more effective and higher quality service
delivery. The PA is also striving to preserve its cultural heritage and creating new employment
opportunities for all citizens. Specifically, these objectives include:

     (a) To support and empower the poor and other vulnerable citizens and their families – This objective
         outlines a continuation to the refinement and implementation of the Palestinian National Social
         Safety Net Program (PNSSP). The authorities plan to offer more development assistance to the
         poor as well as implement appropriate legislation for the protection of vulnerable populations;
     (b) To prepare children and youth for a fulfilling life and productive work – This commitment to
         shaping and molding human capital by preparing them for work with either the private or public
         sector will ensure quality education is provided to citizens;
     (c) To restore excellence in higher education and academic research – In order to meet the demands of
         the labor market, the PA is committed to provide education that will prepare its students to be able
         to have up-to date skills – including the existing vocational educational curriculum. This will
         ensure the progression into a knowledge-based economy as well as create prosperity;
     (d) To promote and sustain a healthy society – Public investment in the health sector has allowed better
         service delivery in the sector. Thanks to external financing the health sector has been able to
         improve many facilities. The authorities aim to establish an affordable healthcare system for its
         citizens;
     (e) To safeguard and renew Palestinian heritage and culture – The PA has established a Culture Fund
         in order to support and develop cultural centers across the WB&G as well as support events
         throughout the year;
     (f) To promote the full participation and empowerment of women in society – The authorities strive to
         create an equitable society for all citizens, including women, to participate fully in the job market.
         As of now, female participation is rising but not quickly enough. The PA is committed to enforce
         laws that abolish discrimination based on gender and laws that punish violence against women;
     (g) To invest in youth to enable them to reach their full potential in their homeland – The authorities
         are aware that with 30% of their population being aged between age 15 and 29, they must pay
         special attention to ensure youth’s participation in the workforce by providing education that will
         develop their skills. The authorities also wish to ensure that the youth will participate in their
         political institutions.
C.       ECONOMY

42.      The PA considers the economy and its development a high priority and would like to foster a
vibrant, competitive economy. Given the logistical and political challenges that both the public and private
sector face daily, it is paramount to have a sound economic policy that will foster growth. The authorities
would like to counteract the constraints in order to be able to have a sustainable growth path. The
authorities have outlined the following strategic objectives:
                                                      15

     (a) To ensure a positive investment environment – The authorities are aware of the importance of the
         private sector as a driver of growth and will continue to partner with them. The authorities are also
         aware of the legal and regulatory framework reforms that must be implemented;
     (b) To enhance the competiveness of Palestinian products and services – The authorities strive to
         encourage investment in sectors that already enjoy a competitive advantage. This will not exclude
         other sectors that have high growth potential, which the authorities look to expand. These new
         sectors will not be ignored and will be supported;
     (c) To promote economic integration and access to external markets – The authorities are
         consolidating the economic institutions that will be needed to manage the rapid economic growth
         that will ensue once Statehood is achieved. Authorities remain committed to pursue economic
         policies to promote investment and increase productivity and quality across sectors;
     (d) To ensure a vibrant labor market and combat unemployment – The authorities are cognizant that
         skills are important for employment. They are determined to foster a capable, qualified workforce
         that can compete with outside labor markets as well as attract foreign investors to invest in WB&G.
         Authorities plan to integrate the education sector as an integral part of building a competent
         workforce;
     (e) To strengthen consumer protection institutions – The goal of this strategy is to ensure public safety
         and the assurance of high quality goods to citizens. The authorities plan to ensure quality standards
         and enforce penalties on non-compliant parties.
D.       INFRASTRUCTURE

43.     The authorities continue to build on the previous goals of connecting marginalized areas to the
public infrastructure networks. The current program relies on community-based initiatives to provide
service delivery. Due to the stalled political situation this sector has known setbacks as restrictions have
long-delayed major public infrastructure projects. The authorities plan to continue the dialogue and
consultation with international partners in order to achieve its strategic objectives. These include:

     (a) To develop integrated and sustainable national infrastructure networks;
     (b) To secure an adequate supply of energy and natural resources;
     (c) To protect the environment;
     (d) To maintain the long-term quality, affordability and safety of infrastructure systems;
     (e) To ensure adequate, safe and affordable housing.
E.       PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY

44.     The authorities are committed to ensure adequate allocation of resources for quality public services,
positive socio-economic outcomes and good governance for citizens. In order to improve accountability for
the public interest, the NDP outlines four main elements: (i) transparency, (ii) performance, (iii)
partnership; and (iv) oversight. These four elements are part of an institutional reform agenda which will
allow the PA to build upon its recent achievements as well as improve on areas that still need attention.

45.      The PA is looking forward to building and consolidating its capacity for governing its citizens in
the wake of their independence and statehood. The NDP is a clear framework complete with tangible goals
and objectives in order to keep the authorities accountable for their progress. This NDP has been conceived
through dialogue and consultation with a multitude of stakeholders, both domestically and internationally.
The document builds upon the previous PRDP and envisions more reforms to establish a good foundation
for statehood in the near future.
                                                     16

F.      CONSULTATIONS

46.      The NDP is based on 23 new sector strategies that were developed through numerous consultations
with many stakeholders such as NGOs, civil society organizations, international organizations as well as the
private sector and local government actors. Then the NDP as a whole was the subject of further
consultations. In sum, more than 240 consultation events have been conducted with over 2,000 participants
representing various stakeholders. The government has also built partnerships with local communities
through its program of Community-Based Projects which integrate community participation in to the
identification of priorities and needs. Over the course of the plan’s implementation, the government plans
to use public consultation as a means to help with monitoring and evaluation.

47.     One of the more sensitive reforms drawn from the NDP and included in the current operation is
public procurement. The new procurement law was developed in a highly transparent and participatory
process. Professional Associations such as the Palestinian Contractors Union, Engineers Association and
the Lawyers Association have been involved in the dialogue with the PA for the reform of the country’s
procurement system and are supporting the enactment process of the new procurement laws and
regulations.

48.     In February and in June 2011, the Bank held consultations with PRDP-TF donors, specifically on
the program to be supported by the DPG.

                 IV.      BANK SUPPORT TO THE GOVERNMENT’S PROGRAM

A.      LINK TO INTERIM STRATEGY

49.     Since WB&G is not a member country of the World Bank, there is no formal Country Assistance
Strategy. Instead, the Bank relies on strategy notes to guide its work and keep the Executive Directors
informed on activities. The latest Interim Strategy was developed simultaneously with the preparation of
the PRDP DPG I. The strategy was presented to the Bank Board on April 22, 2008 and is designed to
remain valid through 2010. A new interim strategy is planned for FY12.

50.     The proposed DPG IV is a key component of the WB&G ISN (2008-10). The current strategy
emphasizes the Bank’s desire to carefully target its limited resources to areas where the Bank can be most
effective or can leverage additional donor funds. In addition to supporting the implementation of the 2008-
2010 PRDP through untied budget support, under the most recent replenishment, the Bank will devote
additional resources to education, solid waste, municipal finance, community development and the NGO
sector. The 2011 replenishment which went to the Board in March 2011 remains aligned with the 2008-
2011 strategy and the new strategy will build upon the NDP which is a marked evolution from the PRDP.

51.      Along with grants, the strategy calls for the Bank to use its analytical ability and technical
assistance to leverage other donor funds. The Bank is continuing its work monitoring restrictions on
movement and access to resources and their impact on the economy. The Bank has completed major
studies on access to water and poverty and governance issues in WB&G. The Bank continues to provide
technical assistance to the Palestinian Pension Agency (PPA), the PCBS and PMA where it is helping the
PMA team design, acquire and implement an electronic payments system as well as design a deposit
insurance scheme. While the Bank will not be able to devote significant resources to all areas treated in its
studies, this analytical work has mobilized support from other donors. In addition, the Bank has a dedicated
advisor on public financial management and governance assigned to the Jerusalem field office.

52.     The main effort of the Bank’s strategy is to continue supporting the PA’s implementation of the
NDP as the successor to the PRDP through the proposed PNDP DPG IV as well as other complementary
operations. The NDP’s success depends upon three critical factors: (i) the PA effectively carrying out
                                                     17

promised reforms; (ii) GOI relaxing the closure regime to allow private sector growth; and (iii) the
international donor community providing full support for the PA’s recurrent budget. There is little the
Bank can do on the second factor, which is a purely political problem. Consequently, the Bank is focusing
its efforts on the first and third factors. The Bank continues to provide significant amounts of technical
assistance to help the PA implement its reforms. Through its ongoing policy dialogue, it is providing the
government with advice and encouragement to remain on track. But the Bank’s most effective efforts are
directed at encouraging donor funding of the recurrent budget. The Bank, in consultation with the (IMF),
produces quarterly reports on reform progress that provide donors comfort to increase their support through
the Central Treasury Account (CTA). This has been a successful effort as the PA received nearly US$1.15
billion in budget support in 2010, over US$220 million of which was provided through the Bank managed
PRDP-TF. The PRDP-TF has provided US$635 million in support to the PA in its less than four years of
existence. This proposed fourth DPG is designed to both help the PA close its fiscal gap and to encourage
donors to continue to provide untied budget support through the CTA.

B.      COLLABORATION WITH THE IMF AND OTHER DONORS

53.      The Bank works closely with the IMF and other donors to support the PA’s implementation of the
NDP. As mentioned above, the Bank consults with the IMF when it issues quarterly reports assessing the
PA’s progress on implementing the NDP. To enable this, the IMF team was closely involved in the
development of the policy matrices for the Bank’s DPGs including DPG IV. In WB&G, the IMF and
World Bank have a complementary division of labor and constantly share information and consult on policy
advice to the PA. The IMF monitors the macro framework and helps the PA produce accurate and timely
accounts. The Bank also monitors the overall macro environment, but it concentrates on helping the PA
address the underlying structural issues such as what is driving net lending, transfer payments or pension
arrears.

54.       The IMF has resumed full contact with the PA following the establishment of the Caretaker
Government in June 2007 and is providing technical assistance on a variety of issues. The IMF helped the
PA produce the macroeconomic framework used in the NDP and continues to work with them to regularly
update the macro-economic projections. The IMF also provides technical assistance to strengthen public
financial management and in doing so works closely with the Bank’s resident Public Financial Management
(PFM) expert and draws on analytical work done for the Bank’s Public Expenditure Review (PER). The
IMF is providing technical assistance to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) to help them
develop better basic statistics. Here again, the Bank and the IMF collaborate closely. Good basic economic
data is essential to monitor progress of the PRDP reforms. Therefore, the Bank has provided funding to
support building the capacity of the PCBS. In this effort, the Bank is coordinating closely with the IMF
statistics team to identify exactly how the funds are best utilized.

55.       The aid coordination structure in the West Bank and Gaza was set up following a decision made at
the December 14, 2005 meeting in London of the Ad Hoc Liaison Committee (AHLC) with the aim of
improving the effectiveness of aid coordination structures in providing coherent technical assistance and
financial support based on national priorities to the Palestinian people in line with the OECD-DAC Paris
Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. The AHLC is chaired by Norway and brings together in a meeting on a
semi-annual basis several donors as well as the PA and the Government of Israel. The Bank acts as
Secretariat to the AHLC, submitting a report prior to every meeting that updates on recent economic and
fiscal trends, in addition to providing timely analysis on current economic and institutional developments in
WB&G. The Bank’s report has often helped to set the agenda and frame the discussion at the AHLC
meeting.

56.    At the local level, the donor coordination structure comprises the Local Development Forum
(LDF), four strategy groups (SGs), each one supported by roughly five sector working groups (SWGs).
                                                     18

The LDF includes representation from the PA as well as all donor and aid agencies. The four SGs cover the
clusters of economic policy, governance, infrastructure, and social development, and are intended to focus
on overarching issues such as policy formulation and programmatic coordination. Each of the SGs and
SWGs is co-chaired by a PA agency and a donor agency, and the Bank acts as co-chair of the Economic SG
(together with the PA’s Ministry of Finance) as well as the Private Sector Development and Trade SWG
(together with the PA’s Ministry of National Economy).

C.       RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS

57.     The Bank’s ongoing portfolio consists of 14 projects which include education, social and urban
development as well as water management and electricity, with commitments in the amount of
$213 million. In addition to this proposed PNDP DPG IV, there are seven other operations in the pipeline,
including:

        Education to Work Transition Project - (US$5 million). This operation will provide funding to
         the education program, especially in developing and implementing education-to-work proposals in
         partnership with the private sector.
        West Bank Waste Water Management (US$10 million). This operation has the objective to
         finance the construction of a regional waste water plant and associated trunk sewerage to manage
         the wastewater of Hebron City and neighboring municipalities. In addition it will aid in the
         management of both industrial and human waste water.
        Municipal Development Project - Additional Financing (US$2 million). This Municipal
         Development Project has been conceived to improve municipal management practices for better
         transparency. Furthermore, the additional funding will ensure improved service delivery in the
         subsequent phases of this project.

58.    Another project in preparation is focused on private market development through promotion of
small and medium scale enterprises, innovation and capacity building to support private sector
development. While the proposed DPG-IV does not specifically target the private sector, it includes one
measure – the new procurement law, which improves the regulatory regime for private suppliers, and a
second measure aimed at improving the efficiency of infrastructure services in the energy sector.

59.      The proposed DPG IV’s policy matrix complements the other Bank projects which are ongoing in
WB&G. For example, the provisions on net lending are in line with the proposals of the Electric Utility
Management Project (EUMP), and measures in municipal development likewise support the program in the
new Municipal Development Project. The Capacity Building Project directly supports the PPA and will
assist the Palestinian Authority in implementing its pension reform plan. It also helps develop the PA’s
ability to monitor its economic performance.

60.      The Bank’s analytical and policy work has from the outset laid the basis for its role in WB&G.
Without large resources of its own, the Bank seeks to leverage other donors’ funds and one of the primary
ways of doing so is by producing high quality analytical work and technical assistance. In the past, this has
been particularly important for generating budget support. The Bank’s support to the PMA has helped give
donors confidence to use the banking system and consequently the CTA. Technical assistance to the
Palestinian Pension Agency has assisted the PPA in producing an action plan of reforms that was endorsed
by the Council of Ministers. More importantly, the Bank’s robust technical assistance program on
municipal finance has been instrumental in helping the PA solve complicated issues around transferring
electricity distribution from local governments to the distributions companies. In addition, the Bank
projects such as the Social Safety Net Reform Project (SSNRP) and Electric Utility Management Project
have helped improve internal PA capabilities thereby increasing donor’s confidence to use PA systems.
                                                      19

D.      LESSONS LEARNED

61.     The PNDP DPG IV draws on lessons from the Bank’s extensive experience of providing budget
support to the PA. The most recent experience comes from the PRDP DPGs I-III, which were disbursed in
June 2008, July 2009 and October 2010, respectively. The Bank continues to manage the PRDP-TF,
through which donors provide budget support based on the Bank’s monitoring of the PA’s progress in
implementing first the PRDP and now the NDP reform program.

62.      The positive experience of broad consultations for development of the PRDP and the NDP has been
reflected in the development of the new procurement law. The law was developed in a transparent way
over several years with broad consultations. The lesson for the Bank was that working closely with the
client over several years and providing appropriate technical assistance with broad-based consultations was
a successful pathway to the adoption of a substantial reform with significant impact on the private sector
and on public financial management.

63.     A second lesson comes through the experience of donor coordination in working with the multi-
donor Trust Fund in support of implementing the NDP. Collaboration with other donors, especially through
the Trust Fund, helps focus the dialogue with the authorities on key issues considered critical for reform.
This collaboration provides significant weight to common points in the reform agenda and therefore should
be maintained and enhanced.

64.      The highly volatile political situation makes it difficult to hold the PA to specific benchmarks set
years in advance. If the political situation deteriorates and violence resumes, government reforms may stall,
the private sector will again fall into decline and the PA will not be able to meet its fiscal targets no matter
how committed to reform. For example, under the uncertainties related to the reconciliation agreement, the
reduction of movement restrictions may slow down. Since the announcement of the reconciliation
agreement, passing legislation has become even more difficult, and the pace of presidential decrees has
slowed. Given these challenges, recent experience suggests that the best approach is to select a mix of
measures to deepen reform and to remain engaged in major reform areas. While quantitative goals should
be set, the PA should be assessed on its progress towards achieving overall reform goals in view of the
current political situation and not be tied to specific quantitative benchmarks that it may fail to meet due to
circumstances beyond its control.

E.      ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

65.    The World Bank’s commitment to a better understanding of the West Bank and Gaza’s context has
been evidenced by numerous studies done in recent years. These studies cover many facets, including an
investment climate study, a public expenditure review as well as a study of the fiscal management of local
government.

66.     In September 2011, a comprehensive poverty assessment report titled Coping with Conflict:
Poverty and Inclusion in the West Bank and Gaza was released. The report concluded that the labor market
outcome is one of the strongest drivers of poverty in the WB&G, with the unemployed facing the highest
risk of poverty. The report also notes that public sector employment is increasingly playing the role of a
safety net in combating poverty, especially in Gaza.

67.      In May 2011, the WB&G Improving Governance and Reducing Corruption study was issued. This
report is the first to assess governance reforms, measure corruption in the delivery of public services as well
as shed light on weaknesses that need to be addressed in order for the WB&G to further reduce corruption
as well as build sound institutions for good economic governance and a favourable investment climate for
businesses.

68.     This study shed light on experiences with corruption in the territory as well as on perceptions of
corruption. The report concluded that Palestinian perceptions of corruption were much higher than actual
experience in the access of public services. It also found that WB&G ranks well compared with other
countries in the region in the forms of corruption affecting business activity. The report identifies a range of
major improvements to the way that the PA manages resources and oversees private sector activity.
However, it also cites a number of reform areas, most notably: management of state land assets,
transparency in licensing and business rights, and public access to government information. Some of the
areas identified in the report for further attention are covered by the current operation – including
procurement reform.

69.      In April 2011, the draft Forward-looking Priorities for Investment Climate Reform in the West
Bank & Gaza built upon the results of the earlier 2007 Investment Climate Assessment (ICA), analyzing the
main constraints that impede the private sector in the WB&G. Given the lack of political certainty as well
as limited trading partners, the private sector in WB&G remains fragmented and not very dynamic. Many
businesses lack adequate access to land, water which restricts growth and investment opportunities. The
report recommends that the PA remain forward looking by instituting reforms that could stimulate
investment in WB&G. These reform areas include: access to water, electricity, telecommunications;
improvement of infrastructure; and creation of a legal framework that will spur investment. According to
the study, the highest priority for the PA should be access to land for both public and private purposes. The
authorities should ensure transparency in the land acquisition process as well as completing the registry of
public and private land in WB&G. These reforms will ensure that when the restrictions are lifted, WB&G
can catch up on growth as well as fulfil its export potential.

70.      Building upon the recommendations of the 2007 PER of controlling the wage bill, the World Bank
produced, in September 2010, a report on Governance and the Wage Bill. This report was produced in
order to assess the effectiveness of the existing systems for controlling the payroll. This report also
identifies future measures to support aggregate fiscal control and more effective human resource
management.

71.      The World Bank issued the Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) Accounting
and Auditing in September 2010, which analyzed the corporate sector accounting and auditing practices in
WB&G using the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). This study was limited by the
blockade in Gaza and therefore focused more on the West Bank and its practices. In spite of the difficult
political environment, the authorities have been able to offer a financial sector with most services available:
banking, securities, and insurance. The Palestinian Monetary Authority (PMA) has acted as the Central
Bank of WB&G, and due to its high level of technical competence it has been making great strides with
improving the financial sector. The recommendations of this ROSC were for authorities to improve ethics,
quality control and professional standards to be consistent with international practice. The World Bank also
recommends that the accounting and auditing professionals have adequate training and capacity to carry out
their functions and that a properly funded system of monitoring and enforcement should be established.

72.      February 2010’s report Checkpoints and Barriers: Searching for Livelihoods in the West Bank and
Gaza Gender Dimensions of Economic Collapse highlighted the economic strains that the restrictions have
placed on both men and women in matters of employment. This study surveyed women and posed
questions on their changing roles because of high male unemployment. Women have been able to secure
jobs in both the formal and the informal sector in order to prevent poverty as well as to prevent aid
dependence. Unfortunately, women have had to take low-status, unprotected jobs. This has led to changed
roles in gender relations, which has led to tensions in the household due to women’s increased role in public
life. The World Bank made certain recommendations to the PA in order to provide better economic
opportunities for both men and women. These include: (i) create and support enabling environments for
safe and decent work; (ii) support quality youth employment, (iii) facilitate social cohesion, especially in
                                                          21

Area C and others isolated by movement and access restrictions; and (iv) collect better data on gender-
disaggregated economic participation.

73.      In February 2010, the World Bank produced the report Rationalizing Pensions for Government
Workers in West Bank and Gaza, a first systemic quantitative analysis of the main obstacles to long term
sustainability of the current pension schemes. The report includes recommendations of short, medium, and
longer term pension reform options to ensure fiscal sustainability of the new pension scheme during the
transition period until its maturity and the phase out of old schemes. Parametric reforms recommended
included increasing retirement age, reducing accrual rates, adjusting indexation mechanisms and
eliminating early retirement. While the report did not include an assessment of the old (transitional)
schemes, it suggested some actions to be included in the preparation of the short term “pension reform
action plan?. It was also suggested that a second study should include the quantitative analysis of the
transitional schemes.

74.     In January 2010, the World Bank conducted a study on the Municipal Finance and Service
Provision in order to better understand the challenges of local government and municipal finance in West
Bank and Gaza. This study showed how the PA and its local governments could improve service provision.
The main conclusion was to impose and enforce user fees and tax levies for roads, water, solid waste
disposal and electricity. The report does point out that certain local governments lack basic local taxes and
therefore should consider the implementation of a property tax. Finally, it recommends that municipalities
implement a Municipal Fiscal Restructuring Program (MFRP). This program would allow municipalities to
address numerous financial and fiscal issues.

75.      The World Bank’s Public Expenditure Review (PER) was completed in early 2007. It takes a
strategic view of Palestinian public finances and addresses two fundamental issues that confront the PA and
its partners. The first is the challenge of bringing aggregate expenditure closer to likely revenues and
available financing. Second is the issue of the composition of expenditure and its overall efficiency. In
addition, the PER provides an in-depth analysis of the public financial management system and provides
specific policy recommendations, many of which have been incorporated in the 2008-2010 PRDP. While it
may seem somewhat dated, it remains highly relevant. There has been a large amount of follow up work by
both the Bank and the IMF and the main findings of the PER still serve as a good guide to policy.

V.         THE PROPOSED PALESTINIAN NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN DEVELOPMENT
                                 POLICY GRANT IV

A.         OPERATION DESCRIPTION

The proposed operation will help the PA continue to implement the NDP. Following on the DPGs I, II and
III, PNDP DPG-IV will also support efforts to improve the fiscal position and increase government
transparency and accountability.

76.     The proposed operation is designed to support the PA as it builds on the successful implementation
of the PRDP and implements the reform program detailed in the NDP, by supporting actions in two policy
areas: (i) strengthening the fiscal position, and (ii) improving public financial management. The PA
implemented the PRDP throughout 2008-2010 and largely met the targets set in the plan. As detailed in
World Bank monitoring reports, the PA is making adequate progress.9 To have the largest impact, the
proposed PNDP DPG IV maintains the focus on the same two policy areas supported by the previous
operations. These are critical building blocks for the government of a future independent Palestinian state
and are also crucial for attracting continued international donor support. The Bank’s involvement in
monitoring and providing technical assistance for the reform agenda described in previous operations’

9
    See Box 1. Progress on the PFM agenda is discussed in section VI below and in Annex 5.
                                                           22

policy matrices has helped strengthen the PA’s capacity to achieve its desired reforms and to also build the
required support among donors. This fourth operation is expected to have a similar impact.

77.      The Bank supports the NDP process in two complementary ways. First, it administers the PRDP-
TF, as requested by the trust fund donors. Second, it will provide additional budget support with its own
funds through the proposed PNDP DPG IV. The PRDP-TF is operating successfully and since its inception
has disbursed over US$635 million in untied budget support to the PA Central Treasury Account (CTA).
The PNDP DPG IV is a single tranche operation for which the related funds will be released on completion
of the prior actions discussed below. Releases from the PRDP-TF are made on a quarterly basis, provided
the Bank is satisfied with the PA’s progress towards the NDP’s reform goals, which are evaluated by the
Bank in consultation with the IMF – currently on the basis of indicators of progress for the PRDP DPG III
and on the associated Letter of Development Policy (LDP), and going forward, on the basis of indicators set
out in the policy matrix for the PNDP DPG IV attached as Annex 2 to this report, as well as the respective
LDP.10 Additional disbursements from the PRDP-TF may be made on the written request of the PA in
extraordinary situations which, in the opinion of the Bank, would justify additional disbursements. It is
envisioned that if the PA continues to make progress on their reform agenda and there is available funding,
then the Bank may be asked to provide additional DPGs. However, given the unstable nature of the
political environment and the uncertain size of future Trust Fund for Gaza and West Bank (TFGWB)
replenishments, this remains a single tranche operation.

78.      At the request of the PA, the Bank, in consultation with the IMF, will continue to provide reports
detailing the status of the reform process, based on its assessment of PA reports. These reports are used not
only by the Bank to determine whether to release the funds from the PRDP-TF, but also by a variety of
other donors to inform their decisions on support to the PA. The PA has also committed to strengthening
the PFM system by improving the standard accounting system used across all ministries, producing
budgets in a transparent manner, improving commitment controls, and continuing to publish accounts that
are subject to external audit.




10
     Regarding fiduciary standards for the PRDP-TF, it is subject to two types of audits:
     1. The main PRDP-TF is audited by external auditors following normal World Bank TF management practice.

     2.   External auditors also examine the following:
          a) The amounts disbursed by the Bank are paid into a designated Deposit Account of the PA kept exclusively
              for this purpose.
          b) No amounts are kept in or paid into the Deposit Account other than those disbursed by the Bank for the
              purposes of this particular operation.
          c) All withdrawals from the Deposit Account for payments are for eligible expenditures, following procedures
              established by the PA Ministry of Finance.
          d) The Ministry of Finance follows adequate disbursement procedures as per PA and governmental standards
              including accuracy of exchange rate conversion.

In order to satisfy the Bank that the PRDP Trust Fund has been used to finance eligible expenditures, the Ministry of
Finance must demonstrate – and the auditor to certify – that the sum of eligible expenditures is greater than or equal
to the amount withdrawn from the Deposit Account.
                                                    23

                   Box1: PRDP Macroeconomic Program Implementation and Results


 Overall, the macroeconomic performance of the WB&G through 2010 matches projections made by the
 PA at the early stages of the PRDP implementation. Preliminary 2011 indicators suggest a decline in
 revenue and expenditure below projected estimates. In terms of economic growth, the WB&G exceeded
 projected growth estimates during 2008, 2009, and 2010 – though the gap between projected and actual
 growth rate is shrinking. The PA’s recurrent budget deficit peaked at over 25 percent in 2009
 (7 percentage points greater than the projected 18 percent deficit), followed by a drop to 15.5 percent in
 2010. Under the current National Development Plan, projections point to a decline in the recurrent deficit
 to approximately 4 percent of the GDP by 2013. Net lending as a percentage of GDP has been steadily
 declining since 2008, reaching 3.2 percent in 2010, two percentage points lower than projected by the
 PRDP. Further details on the full scope of PRDP implementation can be found in the Monitoring Report
 of the Palestinian Reform and Development Plan (PRDP) issued by the Ministry of Planning and
 International Cooperation in April 2010.

B.        POLICY AREAS

i) Strengthening the Fiscal Position

Prior Action 1. A separate macro-fiscal unit with a composition and terms of reference satisfactory to
the Bank has been established within the Ministry of Finance of the Palestinian Authority. (Status - Met)

Rationale

79.     The National Development Plan states the objective of maintaining sound macroeconomic and
fiscal policies aimed at economic growth, reducing fiscal deficits, containing the wage bill and public
pension liabilities, eliminating subsidies of energy consumption, and completing reforms of the social
safety net. The government also commits in the NDP to establish a more robust institutional framework to
                                                      24

develop and implement monetary and fiscal policy. In line with its public commitments, the PA expects to
continue to make significant strides towards controlling its budget deficit by controlling the wage bill and
improving the planning and reporting of development expenditures.

Policy

80.     In the interest of this latter objective, government has set up the macro-fiscal unit, housed in the
Ministry of Finance, for the purpose of improving fiscal planning and budgeting and evaluation of fiscal
policy. The unit has started planning for the 2012 budget and has prepared quarterly reports on budget
execution during 2011.

Prior Action 2. A new payroll system has been introduced in the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of
Detainees and is functioning in a satisfactory manner. (Status -Met)

Rationale

81.       The NDP fiscal objectives specifically target the wage bill, the largest expenditure in the PA budget
and until recently, its fastest growing component. To strengthen the fiscal position, it is essential to control
the public work force. The PA has made progress and has brought the share of the wage bill down from
more than 25 percent of GDP in 2007 to about 22 percent in 2010. The NDP targets further constraints in
the share to 20 percent in 2011 and to 17.4 percent by 2013. To maintain progress and to bring the wage
bill in line with the NDP plan, the PA must keep a tight lid on new hiring. In order to further strengthen the
control of the payroll, the PA has developed a new payroll system that will allow payroll data entry to be
carried out by the relevant line ministry – under MOF supervision. The initiative aims to eliminate the
delays and data entry errors associated with the current manual transfer of files for MOF updating.

Policy

82.     The new payroll system will eventually be integrated with a new human resource system to create a
comprehensive personnel management system for the PA. The Ministry of Finance has completed the
piloting of a new payroll system in two budget units, and it will be rolled out to other line ministries
progressively over the coming months.

83.     The 2011 budget maintains the commitment to hold new hires to 3,000 annually. The 2011 budget
also respects the Minister of Finance’s indication that the PA will continue to follow a policy of providing
small annual general salary increases.

Prior Action 3. The PPA has established and strictly followed the practice that all new categories of
workers joining the public pension system pursuant to agreements between the PPA and their employers
are allowed to retroactively pay pension contributions for up to five years, or for the entire term of their
service under the current employer, whichever is less. (Status-Met)

Rationale

84.     The PA public pension system is extremely generous and represents one of the PA’s largest and
most rapidly growing liabilities. Currently, it is unfunded and effectively operates as a pay-as-you go
system where current employees’ contributions are used to support payments to retirees. The obligations
building up under this regime were not considered sustainable, and consequently in July 2010, following
widespread consultations with all stakeholders, the Council of Ministers adopted a public pension reform
action plan that seeks to limit the growth of pension liabilities. To improve the sustainability of the pension
system, the Council of Ministers endorsed the action plan in 2010. However, most of these changes require
legal amendments to the civil service and pension law. Given the uncertainties arising from the May 4
                                                    25

reconciliation agreement, approvals of such legal amendments has come to a near halt. Nevertheless, the
authorities have the ability to implement the pension reform plan provisions regarding new entrants to the
pension system. Applying these provisions, and limiting the purchase of years of service by new entrants to
sustainable level need to be carefully monitored since they will help protect the Palestinian Pension Agency
from taking on an inappropriate level of financial obligations regarding prior years of service for new
entrants.

Policy

85.     Agreements signed with new entrant institutions from the private sector and local governments to
the public pension system will respect the provisions in the pension reform plan, particularly those
regarding new entrants. In addition, PPA should adopt a methodology to assess that the sustainability of the
scheme will not be compromised by any of the new agreements.

Expected results

86.      The PA expects to reduce its dependence on donor assistance by reducing the recurrent budget
deficit to 13 percent of GDP and by reducing the wage bill to 20 percent of GDP, and the institutional
measures above supported under this grant will contribute to helping the PA achieve that goal Given the
current political and economic uncertainties, the attainment of quantitative targets remains risky, although
such targets continue to serve a useful purpose. In addition, the PA aims to improve the sustainability of
the pension system and avoid adding unsustainable commitments by applying new provisions to new
entrants to the system.

87.     Agreements to extend the coverage of the Palestinian Pension Scheme to workers in the private
sector and local governments should not compromise the current or long term balance of the scheme. In
order to assess this, PPA will adopt a methodology to project costs and revenues associated with each new
agreement. PPA will pay particular attention to provisions regarding purchase of years of contribution at
the time of joining the system.

Net Lending

Prior Action 4. Financial and technical performance targets satisfactory to the Bank have been set by
the Palestinian Electricity Regulation Committee (PERC) for West Bank electricity distribution
companies. (Status - Met)

Rationale

88.      Net lending is an item in the budget, which refers to where the PA has made a payment on behalf of
another body and is expecting to be repaid by that body. Its largest component is the cost of electricity
delivered to the municipalities from the Israeli Electric Company (IEC) for distribution to consumers but
not paid for by the municipalities. This debt to IEC is deducted by the GOI from the tax revenues they
collect for the PA. In the interest of fiscal strengthening and as a part of the National Development Plan,
the PA has been making a concerted effort to control it. Because of the PA’s reforms, net lending has
declined from around US$535 million in 2007 to US$237 million by 2010. Net lending has also declined in
2011, largely due to the transfer of electricity distribution from municipalities in the north to NEDCO,
increased collection efforts in both the West Bank and Gaza and partly due to the PA stopping the payment
for fuel destined for Gaza.

Box 2: Prior Actions for the PNDP DPG IV
Prior Action 1. A separate macro-fiscal unit with a composition and terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank
has been established within the Ministry of Finance of the Palestinian Authority. (Status - Met)

Prior Action 2. A new payroll system has been introduced in the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of
Detainees and is functioning in a satisfactory manner. (Status -Met)

Prior Action 3. The PPA has established and strictly followed the practice that all new categories of workers
joining the public pension system pursuant to agreements between the PPA and their employers are allowed to
retroactively pay pension contributions for up to five years, or for the entire term of their service under the
current employer, whichever is less. (Status-Met)

Prior Action 4. Financial and technical performance targets satisfactory to the Bank have been set by the
Palestinian Electricity Regulation Committee (PERC) for West Bank electricity distribution companies. (Status -
Met)

Prior Action 5. The Customs Court of Appeal has been established in accordance with the provisions of the
Customs Law to handle disputes related to customs duties and the value added tax on imported goods. (Status -
Met)

Prior Action 6. The new policy of unification of the value added tax and income tax services for large taxpayers
has been implemented on a pilot basis for at least 200 companies for purposes of better cross-checking of records
and improving the efficiency of audit. (Status - Met)

Prior Action 7. The guidelines on how to improve revenue generation have been issued by the Municipal
Development and Lending Fund for amalgamated municipalities in West Bank and Gaza and the field testing of
these guidelines started in at least four such municipalities. (Status - Met)

Prior Action 8. The Ministry of Finance of the Palestinian Authority has started the practice of publishing of
improved monthly fiscal reports that (i) separate investment projects funded by other donors from the projects
initially financed by the Treasury; and (ii) include expenditure breakdown for major projects and major project
categories. (Status - Met)

Prior Action 9. A new Procurement Law has been adopted by the PA which includes provisions for setting up
the Higher Council for Public Procurement Policies. (Status - Met)

Prior Action 10. The Palestinian Authority’s financial statements for 2009 fiscal year have been audited by the
Palestinian Authority’s State Audit and Administrative Control Bureau (SAACB) and financial statements for
2010 fiscal year has been prepared and submitted for the Palestinian Authority’s State Audit Administrative
Control Bureau for an audit. (Status - met)
                                                      27

Policy

89.       PERC will set performance targets, developed by the Palestinian Energy Authority, for West Bank
electricity distribution companies on financial and technical performance. Such indicators will help guide
the PERC in its regulation of the sector and ensure efficiency of distributor operations. PERC indicated that
it is also planning an incentive program to encourage improvement in the performance of the utilities and
will also establish a monitoring system to improve the performance of the utilities as required under their
licenses. PERC will, for example, be setting allowable yearly benchmarks of losses and collection.
Revenues obtained from losses and collection better than their yearly benchmark values could be retained
by the utilities as incentives to improve their operations.

Expected results

90.    Net lending is expected to be reduced below $200 million in 2011 and electricity tariffs are
expected to reflect performance improvements according to the new targets.

Improve targeting of social safety net to ensure the most vulnerable populations are protected
91.      The PA is continuing to improve its ability to effectively target and deliver social assistance, and is
preparing relevant policy measures for the coming year. In 2010 the Social Safety Net Reform Project
(SSNRP) and Special Hardship Case (SHC) cash assistance programs were merged into the Palestinian
National Cash Transfer Program (PNCTP) using a single payment modality in the West Bank. The new
system uses a revised Proxy Means Test (PMT) formula that established new cut-off points based on
information from the 2007 Palestinian Expenditure and Consumption Survey (PECS). The new PMT
formula requires that Ministry of Social Affairs (MOSA) revisit households in the database and update their
data in the targeting database, while at the same time visiting new homes. Updating MOSA’s database will
enable better targeting of social assistance to the poorest households in Gaza. In 2010, over 50,000
households in the West Bank were visited for verification using the new PMT, and in the first three quarters
of 2011, over 30,000 additional households were visited and entered into the database. Those above the
absolute poverty line will be phased out of the system and replaced by households who fall below.
Ultimately, only households below the absolute poverty line will be receiving cash transfers while those
with higher incomes will receive assistance from other programs. The total number of households below
the deep poverty line and receiving benefits amounts to 32,400. Efforts are underway to increase the
number of household visits in Gaza so as to update the database there.

92.       The push to increase electricity collection rates raises the risk that the most vulnerable households
will not be able to afford electricity. However, the PA has committed to ensuring that all households will
have access to a basic level of service. Currently, no households are disconnected for non-payment and
households in refugee camps are still exempted from payment. PERC has now completed a new unified
tariff structure where a basic amount of domestic consumption is billed only at cost. This first block of the
new tariff structure was designed in consultation with the Ministry of Social Affair (MOSA), allowing for
basic electricity consumption at a lower price. Some of the local governments have already established
programs to assist the poor with electricity payments.

Improve Domestic Revenue Collection

Prior Action 5. The Customs Court of Appeal has been established in accordance with the provisions
of the Customs Law to handle disputes related to customs duties and the value added tax on imported
goods. (Status - Met)
Prior Action 6. The new policy of unification of the value added tax and income tax services for large
taxpayers has been implemented on a pilot basis for at least 200 companies for purposes of better
cross-checking of records and improving the efficiency of audit. (Status - Met)
                                                     28

Prior Action 7. The guidelines on how to improve revenue generation have been issued by the
Municipal Development and Lending Fund for amalgamated municipalities in West Bank and Gaza
and the field testing of these guidelines started in at least four such municipalities. (Status - Met)
Rationale

93.      The NDP commits the government to increase public revenues through broadening the tax base and
reforming tax administration. The NDP further targets specific reductions in the fiscal deficit, including
through increasing revenues, and targets a proportionate reduction in reliance on donor aid. At 26 percent
of GDP, tax revenues are already at a comparatively high level. However, analysis of the tax system
indicates that both the administration and the incidence of tax compliance measures could be made more
efficient.

94.    In the interest of these objectives, the government has taken three new measures to improve the tax
system. Analysis conducted by the MOF indicated that the customs service was missing customs and VAT
revenues from unrecorded imports. In order to handle these cases, the government has established a
customs court to handle disputes on payment of customs duty and VAT on imported goods.

95.     Analysis conducted by the IMF concluded that the share of tax revenues coming from the large
taxpayer unit was suboptimal and that administrative and enforcement efforts should focus on these large
taxpayers. The audit report for FY 2008 identified problems in the reliability and completeness of tax
information and the need to upgrade the tax systems to provide better accounting and reporting of tax
revenue. A large taxpayer unit was set up in 2009 and in 2011 MOF announced and initiated the policy of
unifying the VAT and income tax services for large taxpayers for the purpose of better cross-checking of
records and improving the efficiency of audits.

96.     Finally, at the local level, in order to support both local revenues and municipal amalgamation, the
Municipal Development and Lending Fund (MDLF) has provided manuals with guidelines to amalgamated
municipalities on how to improve revenue generation and has started field testing the guidelines in four
municipalities. Amalgamation of municipalities is an important initiative of the PA, intended to raise
efficiency in the provision of local services. 101 municipalities have populations of less than 25,000 and
therefore do not have the economies of scale to provide required services. Ensuring sufficient revenues for
the planned amalgamated services is a critical factor for success of this initiative.

97.     After a new Financial Management System was rolled out to all line ministries in 2009, an
integrated financial management system is now being installed at the local government level, with support
from a Bank project. The project is being piloted in five local government units and will eventually roll out
to 32 local governments in phase one. This system will be capable of interfacing with the central
government system through the Ministry of Local Government.

Policy

98.      In the interest of increasing domestic capacity to raise revenues and administer tax systems
efficiently, the authorities will undertake policies suggested by recent analysis of the tax system. They will
establish a customs court for handling tax obligations on unrecorded imports and raise the focus of audits
on large taxpayers. Further, in view of the critical role of municipalities in providing public services and
the efficiencies sought from amalgamating local services, a manual providing guidelines for financing
amalgamated services was produced and is now being piloted.
                                                       29

Expected results

99.     As a result of these measures, gross domestic revenue collection is expected to reach 26.5 percent
of GDP while the efficiency of tax administration and targeting of audits and compliance measures will
increase.

ii) Improving Public Financial Management

Prior Action 8. The Ministry of Finance of the Palestinian Authority has started the practice of
publishing of improved monthly fiscal reports that (i) separate investment projects funded by other
donors from the projects initially financed by the Treasury; and (ii) include expenditure breakdown for
major projects and major project categories. (Status - Met)

Rationale

100.     The PA publishes its annual budget on the website of the MOF in a manner accessible to the public.
The PA continues to place Public Financial Management reforms among the top priority of the government
reform agenda, and it remains one of the main pillars of the proposed PNDP DPG-IV. The NDP commits
the government to continue to implement the program of public financial management reforms, with
reforms expected in all elements of the budget cycle and capacity building of the public oversight
institutions.

101.    Producing annual budgets in a transparent manner is a key component of the reform program. The
MOF developed a new budget classification for the preparation of the 2011 budget that is aligned with the
economic classification based on the IMF’s Government Financial Statistics Manual 2001 structure.11 The
PA has also made progress with introducing a program focus to the budget. This initiative started in 2009
with a programmatic presentation of the budget but in 2011 it was extended to the execution phase of the
budget. The reform is still at an early stage and further improvements are expected in future budgets.

102.     One area where the PA is attempting to improve transparency is in development expenditures.
While the 2011 budget does not provide detailed financial information for all major development projects,
increased disclosure is occurring in budget reports. The improvements in the financial management system
and the chart of accounts have allowed the government to increase the transparency of development
expenditures in monthly reports to separately identify tied donor projects from projects financed initially by
the treasury; and including in fiscal reports the expenditures on major projects and major project categories.
In the first quarterly report of 2011, the MOF provided increased details on development expenditures, but
improved and regular reporting from donors of their development expenditures will be key to providing a
comprehensive report. For example, it reported a breakdown of cash development expenditures for
buildings, roads and maintenance, fixed assets and community projects, youth centers, parks and playing
fields. Beginning with the reports for June 2011, these and further details appeared in the monthly reports
and subsequently will be updated on a quarterly basis. In the coming year the MOF intends to further
improve budget transparency with an initial focus on increasing the information on transfer expenditures.

Policy

103.     The MOF will use detailed data provided by the new financial management information system to
publish details on development project expenditures in monthly reports on budget execution. The MOF
further plans to increase the level of detail on development projects in preparation of the 2012 budget as a
further step towards increasing budget transparency.

11
  While GFSM 2001 is an accrual methodology the economic classification will be based on the cash accounting
system used in West Bank and Gaza.
                                                       30

Expected results

104.    The clarity of budget expenditures and composition of fiscal balances will be improved.
Palestinians will have better information on the use of budget resources, and donors also will receive
information that is critical to their continued support of WB&G.

Upgrade institutions to support PFM reforms

Prior Action 9. A new Procurement Law has been adopted by the PA which includes provisions for
setting up the Higher Council for Public Procurement Policies. (Status - Met)

Rationale

105.     As was explicitly stated in the NDP, reforming and strengthening the PA’s public procurement
system remains to be a key policy commitment. Public Procurement in West Bank and Gaza accounts for
around 10% of the GDP. The public procurement system, which plays a cross-cutting role in achieving
good governance and sustainable development for the PA, has been regulated by two separate laws: The
first law governs procurement of goods and services, while the second one regulates procurement of
construction. The Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR), prepared by the Bank in 2004,
concluded that the existing procurement law and regulations were fragmented and incomplete and their
implementation by various PA units inconsistent. Furthermore, the CPAR highlighted other shortcomings
in the institutional setup, as well as in the capacity of the civil service procurement workforce, including:
(i) lack of a single agency or central authority to lay down uniform and consistent policy, rules and
procedures in public procurement, and ensure efficient oversight and clear and enforceable sanctions and
enforcement mechanisms; (ii) absence of specific rules governing the procurement of consulting services;
(iii) absence of rules and procedures providing access to the proper authority for bidders who want to lodge
complaints, request reviews of procurement decisions and seek relief, at any point during the procurement
process; (iv) lack of rules and procedures on dispute resolutions; and (v) lack of specific provisions on fraud
and corruption in public procurement in WB&G. The CPAR provided recommendations to assist the PA
develop its capacity to plan, manage and monitor public procurement effectively; improve accountability,
integrity, and transparency; prevent corruption; harmonize the national procurement law and regulations
with internationally accepted principles and practices; and increase opportunities for local suppliers,
contractors and consultants to grow and prosper.

106.     In response to the CPAR recommendations, the PA launched, with Bank support, the reform of the
public procurement system by the drafting of the new public procurement law and detailed implementing
regulations starting in early 2006. However, the changes in the Government since 2006 and the unstable
political situation have delayed the enactment of the law and regulations and prevented successful
completion of the other reform activities. In early 2010, the PA made another effort to proceed with the
revision of the procurement law, and an inter-ministerial group of procurement experts representing major
ministries of the PA was mobilized to revise the draft law. Analysis conducted by the Bank experts of the
final draft of the law, prepared in May 2011, concluded that it reflects a balance between the current
means of the country and the internationally recognized good practices as they were in particular
stated in the 1994 version of the UNCITRAL Model Law on Procurement.12 It lays down an
acceptable institutional and organizational set-up for public procurement; provides comprehensive
provisions on procedural matters and sets out provisions on transparency and accountability. The new law
establishes a procurement policy entity, the Higher Council for Public Procurement Policies that will
assume an oversight role of all public procurement activity and ensure compliance with public procurement
law and regulations. This entity would also be responsible for the development of procurement systems,

12
     United Nations Commission On International Trade Law, Model Law on Procurement (1994)
                                                    31

procurement documentation, guidelines and manuals, training and public awareness campaigns. The new
law also establishes a complaint mechanism and a dispute review body. To ensure transparency and
efficiency, the law provides for routine dissemination of information on public procurement, including
advance information on upcoming procurement, advertising specific procurement opportunities, and the
results of bidding processes.

107.     The synergies between public procurement reform, which is already underway, and other targets of
the NDP cannot be overstated. The new public procurement law creates new responsibilities and sanctions
for civil servants involved in procurement, which will contribute to improved public accountability. By
mandating the publication on a website of all documentation, legal text and data available, it promotes
transparency and access to information. It contributes to the improvement of the institutional framework by
creating new institutions, particularly the independent Higher Council for Public Procurement Policies.
Moreover, a new legal framework for procurement, and anti-corruption and conflict of interest measures
which are part of the new law will increase transparency and confidence in the system for private sector and
investors.

Policy

108.    In July 2011 the PA adopted the new procurement law and is now setting up the Higher Council for
Public Procurement Policies.

Expected results

109.    Once implemented, the new law will form the basis for a more effective and transparent public
procurement function. However, the enactment of a good procurement law is only a first step in the
development of a sound procurement system; other critical components of the procurement system need to
be put into place. The PA will need to proceed with further steps, including enacting the supporting
regulations for the new law, establishing an independent public procurement policy body, implementing
national standard bidding documents -- which have been recently initiated, instituting a training program of
the procurement workforce, and taking additional measures necessary to make the law effective.

Strengthen PFM auditing, reporting

Prior Action 10. The Palestinian Authority’s financial statements for 2009 fiscal year have been audited
by the Palestinian Authority’s State Audit and Administrative Control Bureau (SAACB) and financial
statements for 2010 fiscal year has been prepared and submitted for the Palestinian Authority’s State
Audit Administrative Control Bureau for an audit. (Status - met)

Rationale

110.     Auditing and reporting remains an important feature in the PA’s plan to strengthen accountability.
Benefiting from the new financial management system the MOF submitted the FY 2008 financial
statements for audit after a very difficult process to establish the opening account Administrative Auditor-
General issued his audit report on the FY 2008 financial statements in September 2010 in which he
identified a number of problems with the accounts but no audit opinion was provided on whether the
financial statements “present fairly? the financial condition of the government.

111.    The FY 2009 audit has moved at a faster pace due to the experience gained from conducting the FY
2008 audit. A Bank review found that the note disclosures for FY 2009 were very comprehensive and
complied with the IPSAS cash basis standard. The 2009 financial statements were presented to the SAACB
in January 2011. The SAACB has completed the audit of the FY 2009 financial statements and, following
the exchange of comments, has sent the final audit report to the Ministry of Finance. The IPSAS cash basis
                                                    32

was used for drafting the 2009 financial statements and will also be used for the 2010 financial statements.
The 2010 financial statements have been drafted and audit of those statements has begun.

Policy

112.     The MOF plans to maintain this pace of completing financial statements within six to eight months
after the end of the fiscal year and completing the audit within the following year, even though these time
periods are less than the current legal requirements.

Expected results

113.    A regular pace of central level audits should increase public accountability regarding the budget.
Adherence to international standards will improve communication and confidence in the statements for both
Palestinians and development partners.

Box 3: Good Practice Principles for Conditionality
 Principle 1: Reinforce ownership
 As with the PRDP, the NDP was developed through wide consultations both within the Caretaker
 Government and with elements of civil society and is therefore fully owned by the PA. The policy
 actions supported by the operation focus on key measures that the Caretaker Government believes are
 necessary and politically possible for the success of the NDP.
 Principle 2: Agree up front with the government and other financial partners on a coordinated and
 accountability framework
 The policy matrix attached to this document was discussed and coordinated between the PA, the IMF,
 the Bank and other key stakeholders. The matrix reflects the Government’s priorities, progress made in
 the last year and lesson learned from the DPGs I-III. Progress will continue to be monitored through
 quarterly reports detailing progress that the IMF and the Bank will review.
 Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country
 circumstances
 The reform program supported by the DPG IV focuses on strengthening the fiscal stance of the PA.
 This will require continued support from the donor community and political commitment on the part of
 the authorities. The Bank is supporting these efforts by maintaining the PRDP-TF and through the
 proposed PNDP DPG IV.
 Principle 4: Choose only actions that are critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement
 The NDP is wide ranging and covers many sectors. However, the PA has asked the Bank to maintain
 its focus on two critical areas: 1) strengthening the PA’s fiscal position and 2) improving public
 financial management. This focus allows the Bank’s efforts to be more effective and to determine
 specific conditions that are both critical to the success and can be effectively monitored.
 Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based
 financial support
 The PA has committed to providing quarterly progress reviews that will be reviewed by the Bank in
 consultation with the IMF. Tranche releases from the PRDP-TF will be based upon these reviews.
 However, in exceptional circumstances when the PA requests it and the Bank agrees, emergency
 release may be made. Other donor agencies will also use the quarterly reviews to inform their own
 funding decisions. An important component of the NDP is improving the PA’s budget process and
 establishing a monitoring and evaluation program linked to the budget. This will allow predictable and
 performance based financial support.
                                                          33

                                  VI.      OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

A.         POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS

114.     A recent poverty assessment report13 by the World Bank concluded that one of the strongest drivers
of poverty in the WB&G is labor market outcomes, with the unemployed facing the highest risk of poverty.
Furthermore, the report states that public sector employment is increasingly playing the role of a safety net,
especially in Gaza. The PA recognizes these risks and drivers of poverty, and as a part of the NDP 2011-
2012, it set a target of lowering poverty incidence from its current level of 22 percent to 13 percent by 2013.

115.     The World Bank, through DPG IV, will support the two main pillars of the PA’s National
Development Plan: First, while the operation does not specifically target the private sector, the program
should contribute to improving the environment for private sector development. A new and comprehensive
procurement law will result in a more open and equal distribution of business opportunities, allowing for
more small and medium firms to compete with the more established private sector actors. Ongoing banking
sector reforms with the goal of lowering transaction costs and raising lending by local banks are expected to
promote local investment. Second, the World Bank is working closely with the Ministry of Social Affairs
(MOSA) to improve the targeting and efficiency of social assistance programs, including integrating the
findings of the recent poverty analysis. Significant progress has been made in developing a transparent
targeting mechanism as part of MOSA’s Cash Transfer Program (CTP).

116.     More recently, discussions by the World Bank energy team with the MOSA resulted in the Ministry
agreeing to adjust its social transfers targeting formula, to include factors such as energy consumption
expenses as determinant for CTP eligibility. This will help direct aid to the most vulnerable households. A
new electricity tariff has been developed by PERC, taking into account the potential harms of collection
rates hike on vulnerable households. In cooperation with MOSA, PERC set the first block of this new tariff
to be billed at cost, thus providing poor households a basic amount of electricity consumption at a lower
price. To improve PERC’s regulatory capacity, new performance indicators are being instituted in
evaluating West Bank electricity distributors. These measures take into account both technical and
financial performance indicators and are designed to ensure the efficient provision of energy to customers.

117.    Moreover, DPG IV will facilitate a series of public financial management reforms aiming to raise
effectiveness of public resources. The recent poverty assessment, in combination with increased
transparency of development expenditures, monthly reporting of tied donor projects, and finalizing the 2009
audit and 2010 accounts by international standards and good practices will inevitably improve the
efficiency and effectiveness of public resources in the delivery of development services.

B.         ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

118.    The PNDP DPG IV operation will not have significant effects on the country's environment, forests
and other natural resources. The environmental and natural resource implications are driven to a large
extent by the nature of an operation. In the proposed operation, none of the prior actions as listed in the
policy matrix will have environmental impacts or risks.

C.         IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORING AND EVALUATION

119.    As discussed above, the PA has asked the Bank to monitor progress on the PRDP and the Bank will
continue to do so based on the reforms described in the attached policy matrix. The PA has been producing
quarterly reports, which the Bank reviews in consultation with the IMF. The Bank focuses on progress on
structural reforms while the IMF provides detailed input on fiscal and PFM issues. In the previous Reform

13
     Coping with Conflict? Poverty and Inclusion in the West Bank and Gaza,
                                                     34

Trust Fund, monitoring proved to be a major challenge. Many of the benchmarks had been developed
without input from the PA line ministries and the Bank team was located in Washington. However, in
PRDP DPG I - III, the policy matrix was taken directly from the PRDP, which was developed after wide
consultation throughout the PA and among other stake holders. The policy matrix reflected what all parties
not only thought important but also achievable and what could be monitored. The PNDP DPG IV continues
this approach. The matrix is drawn from the NDP and reflects lessons learned from the last operation.

120.    The Bank team managing the PNDP DPG IV is located in WB&G and is thus able to have daily
contact with their PA counterparts. The Bank team continues to include a Governance Advisor who is a
PFM expert to the Jerusalem office to work alongside the Country Economist monitoring the PNDP DPG
IV. The task team leaders for the social safety net reform and municipal finance assistance are also resident
in the WB&G office. The main ministries responsible for implementing the reforms supported by the
PNDP DPG IV are the MOF, PPA, MOSA and Palestinian Energy and National Resources Authority
(PENRA) with which the Bank has developed a strong relationship. The IMF has recently appointed a
resident advisor to the MOF’s macro-fiscal unit and the Bank team works closely with him and the rest of
the IMF mission to both provide assistance to the MOF and monitor progress on budget related and PFM
issues.

121.     The MOSA must report on its achievements in building the social safety net as a part of the SSNRP
and the Bank team managing that project closely monitors these activities. For the collection of utility fees,
data must be collected from the regional distribution companies and from PENRA. The Bank’s power team
works with these parties as part of the Electric Utility Management Project (EUMP) and will thus be able to
collect the required data and assess progress. The combination of close cooperation with the IMF and other
donors, the leveraging of other projects and careful consultation in the preparatory phase PA eliminated
many of the difficulties monitoring progress that are encountered in the previous budget operation. This
will be continued for the PNDP DPG IV.

D.      FIDUCIARY ASPECTS

Public Financial Management System

122.     The PA continues to have Public Financial Management (PFM) reforms at the top of the
government’s reform agenda. There has been considerable progress with several areas of strength, although
there remain weaker areas where the reforms are underway and need to be further developed and enhanced.
PFM reforms are pillars of the proposed DPG series. The DPG sets out to provide a development policy
grant to the PA which will be executed through the Government’s PFM systems.

123.     According to the Bank, IMF, and other donors’ reports on PFM, including the fiduciary report on
PFM assessment conducted during the appraisal of this operation, the Palestinian PFM system is deemed to
be adequate insofar as the Bank’s criteria and standards for approval of development policy operations are
concerned. The 2004 CFAA had concluded that the fiduciary risk level in the Palestinian PFM system was
significant due to weaknesses in the PFM systems. Recent IMF and Bank reports state that the PA’s PFM
system has improved considerably since then.

124.    Notable improvements in PFM include the following:

a. Launch of the new financial management information system that will help consolidate budget
   implementation processes, strengthen payment controls and improve fiscal reporting. This system has
   been rolled out to line ministries.
b. Transformation of line ministry and agency bank accounts into zero-balance accounts.
                                                      35

c. All PA revenues are now paid into the CTA.
d. An orderly system of budgetary appropriation is now in force.
e. MOF is exercising firm control over budget expenditures, has imposed strict limits on non-wage
   expenditures and makes adjustments as needed, with funds often being released by MOF on a daily
   basis.
f.   Since the MOF established its financial controllers in each ministry, the controllers have gained
     considerable experience and credibility within the line ministries.
g. MOF established a central internal audit function, which initially compensated for the weakness in
   external audit. With the creation of the State Audit and Administrative Control Bureau (SAACB) in
   2007, the internal audit department’s role has evolved in line with international standards and is now in
   the process of being decentralized from MOF to the line ministries.
h. The SAACB is also receiving substantial technical support to develop its capacity as an external audit
   agency.
i.   Control over the civil service payroll has improved significantly. MOF has taken charge of the central
     payroll system from the General Personnel Council (GPC, the PA’s central personnel agency), and is
     now in a position to monitor new recruitment and pay all public sector salaries, and thereby to contain
     civil service hiring.
j.   Since 2005 the salaries of the PA’s civil and security servants have been paid through direct deposit
     into personal employee bank accounts.
k. The establishment of the Palestine Investment Fund (PIF) has brought all PA equity holdings, including
   virtually all state-owned enterprises (SOEs), within a centralized and commercially-oriented
   management framework. PIF has annually been publishing its annual report and audited financial
   statements (for 2003 and after), and these are available on its website.
125.     However, more remains to be done to further consolidate progress and address the challenges
facing the PFM. As part of the NDP process a PFM strategy was developed by the PA. Key elements of
the strategy with respect to fiduciary control include:

        Further developing cash management by strengthening cash forecasting and improving the link
         with the commitment control system.
        Building capacity for financial management at both MOF and the line ministries. The development
         at line ministries is particularly important given the objective of devolving more financial
         management responsibility from MOF.
        Further enhancing the internal audit function and continuing the decentralization of the function to
         line ministries
        Strengthening accounting and reporting by fully adopting international public sector accountings
         standards and increasing budget transparency.
        Continuing to build the capacity of the SAACB audit capacity and legislative framework.
        Ensure better integration of donor programming into the annual development budget.


126.    In light of the above, the fiduciary risks related to this operation are considered to be significant.
In view of the fact that the fiduciary risk is assessed as significant and that reform is ongoing, the Bank will
require an audit of deposit account, which is consistent with the standard requirements for such level of
fiduciary risks.
                                                      36

E.       DISBURSEMENT AND AUDITING

127.    The Bank would sign a Grant Agreement with the PLO for the benefit of the PA, which would
include the prior actions listed in the attached policy matrix for tranche release.

128.    The PNDP DPG IV is a single tranche operation. The amount of the PNDP DPG IV will be
disbursed in one tranche comprising the full amount of the grant, against satisfactory implementation of the
development policy program.

129.    Flow of Funds. Upon effectiveness of the grant and provided the World Bank is satisfied with the
program being carried out by the Recipient and with the appropriateness of the Recipient’s macroeconomic
policy framework, the World Bank would disburse funds into a US Dollar Deposit Account maintained
under the Central Treasury Account (CTA) of the MOF. As the Palestinian Monetary Authority does not
yet function as a full-fledged central bank, the Deposit Account would be held with a commercial bank (i.e.
Bank of Palestine), as is currently the case with the CTA. Within one week of the receipt of funds in the
deposit account the MOF will convert the US$ amount into New Israeli Shekels (NIS) at the going
exchange rate and transfer them to the MOF treasury account. The PA will provide confirmation to the
World Bank that an amount equivalent to the grant proceeds has been credited to the CTA and the exchange
rate applied and the date of the transfer. This confirmation will be provided within 30 days of the funds
being received in their account. If the proceeds of the grant are used for ineligible purposes as defined in the
Grant Agreement, the World Bank will require the Recipient to refund an amount equal to the amount of
said payment to the World Bank.

Auditing

130.     As discussed before, the concluded fiduciary risk level in the Palestinian PFM system is considered
significant. Accordingly, beyond the auditing arrangements for the PRDP-TF already described (see
footnote 10 on page 22), the PA will hire an independent external auditor acceptable to the Bank to perform
an audit of the PNDP DPG IV Deposit Account at the MOF. As was the practice with previous DPGs, this
audit will be conducted in accordance with terms of reference acceptable to the Bank. The auditor will be
selected from a short list of qualified auditors established by MOF and acceptable to the Bank. When the
audit is completed, it will be reviewed by the Government and then shared with the Bank. The audit will
comply with international standards and be completed and submitted to the Bank within six months from
the release of the single tranche payment. The audit will be financed by the PA. The audit would cover and
ensure the following:

        Validate and certify the transfer and deposit transactions relating to the grant and confirmed by PA
         MOF mentioned above;
        Verify the extent to which the Bank’s requirements under the grant agreement are being met, and
         whether the PA’s procedures are adequate to achieve this result;
                                                      37

        No funds are kept in or paid into the relevant Deposit Account other than those disbursed by the
         Bank for this particular operation;
        All withdrawals from the relevant Deposit Account for payments are for legitimate budgetary
         purposes, following procedures established by the PA's MOF;
        The MOF follows adequate disbursement procedures as per PA and governmental standards
         including accuracy of exchange rate conversion.

F.       RISKS AND RISK MITIGATION

The NDP’s success depends on parallel actions by the PA, GOI and the donor community.

131.      The NDP continues the path set out in the PRDP towards greater fiscal stability, higher investment
and domestic revenues and a lower share of contribution from external support by 2013. While the PA has
charted a course toward lesser dependence on external aid and is actively undertaking the relevant reforms,
it will take many years for the PA to achieve fiscal sustainability and that will only be possible if there is a
political settlement that allows the economy to flourish. To maintain the support it needs, the PA must
make rapid and steady progress on the announced reforms.

132.     The highly volatile political situation could deteriorate and violence could resume, with the
consequence of stalled reforms. The two instances of withheld clearance revenues in 2011 illustrate one
type of risk from the political situation. Political uncertainty has led to a slowdown in the removal of
restrictions on movement in 2011, removals that were so vital in fostering new economic growth in 2010.
The uncertainty may also lead to delays in donors fulfilling commitments, which could hamper government
activities and increase domestic banks exposure to short term public debt. In addition, depending upon the
nature of any interim government, some donors could reduce funding, which would make it difficult for the
PA to continue implementing its ambitious reform plan. However, reconciliation might also attract
donations from sources that have been less willing to give due to the split.

133.    The announcement of the reconciliation agreement in early May has introduced new uncertainties.
The current PA administration retains its political authority during the reconciliation process, which process
is expected to eventually generate a technocratic cabinet of political independents until elections can be
held. This government will govern with the same legal authority as the current Caretaker Government. The
reopening of the Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC) after elections will require that all legislation that
was passed by presidential decree in the previous years, be revisited and passed by the PLC. This could
lead to a slowdown in passing new legislation and possibly the undoing of some previous legislation.
However, given the wide spread support for the current reform process it is not expected that there will be
major changes to the NDP that this operation supports.

134.     The prospect of reconciliation may also raise questions about maintaining transparency and
progress in public financial management reforms. The PA continues to increase the transparency and detail
in its budget reporting in a number of ways. For example, the PA has placed some categories of public
expenditures into projects, such as putting social safety net payments into the Social Safety Net Reform
Project. This will ensure the full safeguards of donor-funded projects are applied to these transfers and help
attract donor project funding for recurrent public expenditures within the framework of a project. The
proposed PNDP DPG-IV also supports a measure that would provide further reporting details on all major
investment projects.

135.    The PA is striving to improve its fiscal position, but for the foreseeable future they will remain
dependent upon high levels of aid. Specifically, it will require large amounts of untied budget support that
will enable it to pay wages and the other basic operational costs. Without such support the PA will not be
                                                       38

able to deliver basic services let alone achieve the popular support required to undertake the most politically
difficult actions.

136.     The issues of movement and access and economic restrictions are fundamentally political issues
that the Bank has little influence over. However, the Bank has taken a number of steps to mitigate the risks
associated with the donors not providing enough timely support or the PA not following through with its
reform plan. These actions include:

137.   The PRDP-TF provides donors a convenient mechanism to provide such untied budget support
where they can be assured that their funds will be closely monitored. The PNDP DPG IV, by risking the
Bank’s own money, signals the Bank’s continued trust in the PA’s financial controls and will also increase
donor willingness to participate;

138.   The quarterly monitoring by the Bank in consultation with the IMF will quickly detect if the
reforms are off track or if funds are being improperly allocated. This frequent monitoring gives donors
comfort to increase their disbursement and use the CTA;

139.    The Bank has established a website to keep donors, NGOs and the public apprised of reform
progress.

140.    Finally, the Bank and the IMF are providing significant technical assistance to help the PA
implement its planned reforms. The IMF is active in the PFM areas while the Bank is providing assistance
in a wide variety of areas including: PFM, power sector, payments system, municipal finance, public
pensions and social sectors, and continues to monitor developments in the telecoms sector. As mentioned
above, the Bank maintains its field-based staff to improve its monitoring and delivery of assistance.

141.     WB&G is an unstable and high risk environment. But this country risk affects all projects in the
portfolio and is not unique to the proposed PNDP DPG IV. Because the PNDP DPG IV provides untied
budget support, the Bank engages in quarterly monitoring and continuous policy dialogue between the PA,
the Bank and the IMF. The success of the previous DPGs and the continued development of the PA’s
internal capabilities indicate that these risks are declining. Despite the risks associated with this project, it
is a high value operation that the Bank should support. The Caretaker Government has demonstrated its
deep commitment to reform and has been able to galvanize international support. The GOI has reduced
some of the movement and access constraints and is willing to do more within the parameters of their
security requirements. These factors create an important opportunity for the Bank to make progress on its
agenda in WB&G. Continuing support of the Caretaker Government and its reform program will help the
PA to strengthen institutions that will be needed by a future Palestinian State. Any withdrawal of budget
support would send a strong negative signal to other donors and could imperil the years of successful
reforms carried out by the PA.

ANNEX 4: IMF Relations Note

7550

Economic Conditions and Outlook

The Palestinian economy is facing increased risks, with a significant slowdown of growth in the
West Bank. The West Bank’s strong performance from 2008 to 2010 has been enabled by sound
economic management and reforms supported by donor aid, and the easing of Israeli internal barriers.
However, the West Bank’s real GDP growth declined from 8 percent in 2010 to 4 percent in the first half
of 2011, with an unemployment rate unchanged at 16 percent since mid-2010. The slowdown is due to
continued fiscal retrenchment, declining aid from regional donors and a consequent liquidity crisis, as
well as no significant easing of Israeli restrictions over the past year. Gaza’s output continued to recover
from a highly repressed level following the easing of some import controls in mid-2010, with real GDP
estimated to have risen by 28 percent in the first half of 2011 and unemployment declining to 28 percent
in the first half of 2011 from 37 percent last year. Gaza’s recovery is also bound to wane without an
easing of import controls on private investment inputs.

The unemployment rate has declined very slowly in the West Bank, and remains high in Gaza,
especially among the young (below the age of 30). In the West Bank, unemployment declined
sluggishly from 19 percent in 2008 to 16 percent in the first half of 2011 which is about the same level as
in the first half of 2010. Similarly, youth unemployment in the West Bank remains high at about 26
percent in the first half of 2011, about the same level as the same period last year. In Gaza, unemployment
remains very high, although it declined in the first half of 2011 from 37 percent to 28 percent reflecting
the marked recovery, and from 51 percent 43 percent for the young.

Persistent shortfalls in donor aid during 2011 have led to a liquidity crisis. Aid disbursements thus far
in 2011 have been far below the expected amounts ($0.4 billion disbursed as of end-August compared to
$0.7 billion envisaged for that period). The impact of the aid shortfalls on liquidity has been compounded
by the appreciation of the shekel, and budgetary revenue has been lower-than-expected. This has led to
the accumulation of substantial domestic payment arrears, including on wages for the first time since
2007, and borrowing up to the commercial banks’ limits.

Inflation has remained low so far in 2011. The WB&G’s CPI inflation rate (in NIS) was 3.1 percent in
June 2011, compared to 3.6 percent in mid-2010. Inflation was significantly lower in Gaza (0.1 percent)
than in the West Bank (4.4 percent), reflecting the relaxation of the blockade on imports of consumer
goods and foodstuffs, as well as food’s higher weight in Gaza’s consumption basket compared to the
West Bank. The impact of the rise in the West Bank’s inflation, reflecting rising world food and fuel
prices, has been tempered by its decline in Gaza following the easing of Gaza’s import restrictions. While
Gaza’s inflation had risen sharply above that of the West Bank during the blockade, it has been on a
declining trend since 2009 following the end of the Gaza war.

The commercial banking system continues to perform well, with very limited exposure to global
markets and conservative practices in private sector lending. The share of non-performing loans in
total loans continued its downward trend, from 4 percent at end-2009 to just below 3 percent at end-June,
                                                    55


2011. The banking sector continues to have adequate liquidity and is well capitalized. In the West Bank,
private deposits in U.S. dollar terms rose 14 percent in the year to June 2011, reflecting private income
growth. In Gaza, private deposits in U.S. dollar terms declined by 7 percent, as cash was withdrawn to
satisfy pent up demand for consumer goods following the relaxation of import controls. Gaza banks’
prospects have improved due to the easing of restrictions by the GoI on the entry of consumer goods and
bank-notes. While the restrictions on the entry of Jordanian dinars and U.S. dollars are still formally in
place, their impact has been limited since mid-2010 with the inflows of these currencies through crossings
at which controls have been eased, as well as the facilitation by the GoI of their entry for the purpose of
payments by international organizations.

Risks and Challenges
To stem the risks of a major slowdown of economic growth and a deepening liquidity crisis,
concerted actions are needed by the PA, the GoI, and donors:

     The PA has established a solid track record during 2007-10 in reforms and institution-building in
      the public finance and financial areas, which enables to conduct the sound economic policies
      expected of a future well-functioning Palestinian state. In the context of shortfall in donor aid, it
      is essential for the PA to fully deploy that institutional capacity to prudently manage the current
      liquidity crisis and step up the implementation of structural measures as set out above.
     To maintain the growth momentum, rebalance the composition of output, and accelerate the state-
      building process, it is essential for the GoI to phase out all economic restrictions as soon as
      possible. In Gaza, where living standards still lag far behind those in the West Bank, a lasting
      recovery in private sector investment and employment will require a removal of the ban on
      exports and private sector imports of investment inputs. Fully tapping the West Bank’s potential
      and sustaining its growth will require a broad-based removal of barriers on exports to Israel, of
      imports of machinery and equipment, as well as allowing Palestinian economic activity in “Area
      C?.
     The shortfalls and delays in disbursements have imposed a significant cost on the PA in terms of
      interest payments and additional premia required by private suppliers of goods and services. They
      also risk, even with prioritization efforts by the PA, to curtail much needed social or other
      essential spending. Sustained donor aid during 2008-10 supported the successful implementation
      of the Palestinian Reform and Development Plan for 2008–10, presented at the Paris Donors’
      Conference in December 2007, was essential is essential to sustain orderly reforms and fiscal
      adjustment. The latter in turn enabled the PA to reduce the aid needed to finance the recurrent
      budget deficit, from $1.8 billion in 2008 to $1.2 billion in 2010. In the same vein, timely and
      adequate aid in support of the NDP for 2011–13 will allow sustained reforms and adjustment
      which in turn will enable early self-reliance by the PA for its recurrent spending, with donor aid
      increasingly focused on growth-enhancing development projects.
Status of IMF Relations

WB&G is not a member of the IMF and therefore not eligible for financial assistance. Since the 1993
Oslo Accord, the Fund has been providing policy advice and technical assistance in the macroeconomic,
fiscal, and financial areas. IMF staff is producing regular reports on implementation of the PA’s PRDP
fiscal plan and public finance reforms. Together with World Bank reports focused on structural reforms,
the assessment of overall reform progress will be taken into consideration by donors in their disbursement
decisions.
                                                                      56


ANNEX 5: Public Financial Management and Fiduciary Arrangements
                                                               (July 2011)

1.      The proposed DPL series operation sets out to provide general budget support to the PA and will
be executed through the Government’s public financial management (PFM) systems. In order to assess
the attendant fiduciary risks with respect to the proceeds of this operation, this annex summarizes the
current state of certain aspects of these systems as well as ongoing reform efforts to further enhance them.
This annex builds upon current analyses and previous reports, including the IMF and several PFM related
assessments reports, and particularly the fiduciary assessment which was conducted by the World Bank in
January 2011.
2.      The PA continues to have the PFM reforms as the top priority of the government reform agenda.
There has been considerable progress in the PFM reforms in the PA, though challenges remain. Efforts
are underway to further develop and enhance the PFM system. Public Financial Management reforms are
one of the pillars of the proposed DPG series.
3.      According to the Bank, IMF, and other donors’ reports on PFM, including the fiduciary report on
PFM assessment conducted during the appraisal of this operation, the Palestinian PFM system is
considered to be reasonably adequate as far as the Bank’s criteria and standards for approval of a general
budget support operations are concerned.
4.       The following description of ongoing reform activities provides a more detailed assessment of the
certain aspects of PFM reform in West Bank and Gaza.
EXTERNAL AUDIT

5.       The State Audit and Administrative Control Bureau (SAACB) is the supreme institution for
oversight and external audit over actions of all entities receiving funding from the Palestinian National
Authority.15 The SAACB is in the process of adopting the international auditing standards issued by the
International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI) and the International Federation of
Accountants (IFAC). Over the past few years, Norway has provided technical assistance to build audit
capacity within the SAACB. Last year, SAACB received a grant from GTZ to support the audit of 2008
financial statements, through advisory contract with Deloitte who helped the SAACB during the audit
process and on the job training for the SAACB staff.
6.      With respect to the audit standards, Deloitte helped draft a Palestinian version of external audit
standards, these standards are tailored to the Palestinian specifications, and they are based on the
INTOSAI standards with supplement from IFAC standards. The draft standards were reviewed by the
Norwegian SAI and cleared for publication. Standards were issued in Nov 2010.
7.       FY 2009 financial statements have been drafted by the MOF and submitted to the SAACB for
audit. SAACB has completed the FY 2009 audit and currently (June 2011) waiting for MOF comments
on the draft audit report. Though according to the law, MOF has 1 year after year end to draft the FS, and
in turn the SAACB would have also another year to conduct the audit (a total of two years). There is a
concern with the slow process regarding the timeliness of issuing the draft FS and audited FS, and that the
benchmark standards need to be shortened to the 9 Months in total for drafting FS and auditing them.



15
  The SAACB is the responsible party for the external audit of the public institutions including NGOs and local government entities including
Municipalities. A total of more than a 1000 institutions fall under the SAACB mandate. SAACB is responsible for three area of audits;
operational, financial, and compliance.
                                                    57


8.      Currently, the EC is providing funding for an audit advisor which is the firm of PKF. The PKF
audit advisors have started their three year contract which will require them to achieve the following
objectives (a) build audit capacity, (b) improve the management structure of SAACB, (c) conduct a legal
review of laws and regulations to identify areas for improvement, and (d) address the shortage of IT skills
within SAACB. In addition they will provide technical advice for the FY 2009 and 2010 financial audits.
9.      Going forward, there are several major challenges that need to be addressed by the SAACB to be
fully operational in accordance with international standards. These are as follows:
       Independence. There is a lack of independence by SAACB which is critical if the organization
        wants to comply with international standards and also if they want to be seen as a creditable audit
        organization. They currently report to Parliament and the PA President, although only to the
        President while Parliament is suspended. The SAACB also lacks financial independence,
        although the SAACB budget has expanded substantially in recent years and there is no indication
        that their operations are specifically compromised by being part of the budget process. Still, both
        financial and administrative independence could be strengthened.

       Staffing and administrative issues. SAACB has approximately 150 staff. SAACB staff are part
        of the civil service and thus their salaries are paid centrally from MOF. SAACB is working on
        hiring and capacity building efforts to enhance the staff capacity and conduct the required audit as
        per their mandate. EC is providing considerable support in this area. They are starting to have a
        shortage of auditors. As auditors leave for other agencies, they take their positions with them.
        Therefore, SAACB cannot hire someone to replace the person who left since there is no longer a
        position authorized in SAACB. Also, in Gaza there are 50 auditors who cannot perform their
        duties since the government in Gaza will not allow them to conduct audits. They are paid but
        have to stay home. SAACB personnel are under the civil service regulations and their budgets
        are under the MOF. This creates problems with staffing and also having sufficient budget to
        perform their mandated responsibilities. These human resources and administrative issues are
        being addressed through a review of the civil service law and work on position structures for all
        PA institutions.

       Mandate and scope of work. This issue deals with the scope of their authority. The current
        mandate requires them to audit all organizations that receive funding from the PA and NGOs.
        They do not have the staffing to conduct all those required audits, therefore, they need to develop
        alternative ways to meet their mandate and start to modify the audit law to narrow the scope of
        their responsibilities.

       Membership of INTOSAI. The SAACB currently is not a member of INTOSAI. The Bank
        needs to facilitate the process for membership so that SAACB can benefit from INTOSAI in
        areas such as knowledge sharing, peer review, etc.

10.      During the past few years, several donors have been involved with SAACB which has resulted in
not providing assistance in the most efficient way. Now with the EC program in place for the SAACB
this issue should be addressed appropriately. In addition, the World Bank plans to start to consider the
SAACB as a potential external auditor for Bank-financed project. A plan should be developed that would
provide the SAACB an opportunity to start auditing small Bank projects in order to evaluate their work.
At the same time, a peer review should be conducted to evaluate the operations and capacity of the
                                                                      58


SAACB. This would be a start to adopting a country system which is consistent with the Bank’s
objectives.
FINANCIAL CONTROLLERS

11.     A key component in the MOF internal control framework is the function of the Financial
Controller. This is the traditional ex-ante model (pre-audit) used by governments.16
12.      They are appointed by the Accountant General and are employees of the MOF. There are
currently 90 Controllers assigned to the various line ministries. Their primary duty is to review a
payment transaction to ensure that there is available budget, it complies with laws and regulations and all
source documents have been submitted. Once this review is completed, the Financial Controller will
approve the payment transaction for payment. As the Financial Management System has been rolled out
to the line ministries, it is timely to consider that the Financial Controller function also be decentralized.
13.     EC has been providing support to the Financial Controllers function with E&Y as the consultant.
In March E&Y submitted a five year implementation plan for the Financial Controller function. MOF has
delayed the implementation of the plan at this time because they believe that the capacity in the line
ministries is not adequate at this time. A key element in the E&Y plan is that within five years the
Financial Controllers will report to the line ministries minister and not to MOF. This recommendation
will need more discussion within the government as well as the donor community.
14.    Going forward, it is important to have a strategic framework and design for the internal control
framework at the MOF and line ministries, of which the internal audit and financial controller will be
important components. This framework should include the elements of a modern internal audit function,
and how and to which extent various elements of a modern internal controls framework interact with and
complement each other.

INTERNAL AUDIT

15.     The Internal Audit Department (IAD) was created in 2004 in MOF and the manager reports to the
Deputy Minister, while the unit sends its reports to the Minister of Finance. Currently there are 22 staff
members in IAD. During the past year IAD issued 26 audit reports and will share their reports with
SAACB on a request basis. In addition to the audits, they have conducted risk assessments on the various
ministries which will be used in planning their audits. IAD was recently established at the MOF level. It
is meant to perform internal audit function centrally at MOF and other line ministries.
16.     EC has been providing support to the internal audit with E&Y as the consultant. E&Y is now in
the third stage of the project and their work included theory training and on the job training. E&Y
provided training to the internal audit staff in the areas of financial regulations, commitment control, and
computerized accounting system. The capacity building for internal audit staff is top priority of the
government at this stage.
17.    IAD adopted the international internal auditing standards published by the Institute of Internal
Auditors (IIA). Further training on the IIA standards will be required.
18.     E&Y has supported drafting of an internal audit manual for IAD and also has been providing
training to the staff on the manual. The IAD structure and the audit manual are largely consistent with

16
 As per the discussion with Deputy Prime Minister in early 2011, a review of the financial controllers’ scope and coverage is underway; and
E&Y has been asked to provide insight on this area and to provide training to the financial controllers.
                                                     59


IIA concepts and standards. The audit manual was revised due to the decentralization of the internal audit
from MOF to line ministries. This revised manual should be available in the near future. The
decentralization of the internal audit function will create a need for a harmonization unit to be established
within the MOF that will coordinate the internal audit activities. Although the line ministries currently
have internal audit units, they do not perform the duties and responsibilities that would meet international
standards. The E&Y project will upgrade these units to meet international standards. The internal audit
function in the line ministries will report to the Minister in the line ministry.
19.      The Internal Audit Charter was drafted with the help from E&Y and is now at the Cabinet of
Ministers for approval. The Charter was revised to include the decentralization arrangements of the
internal audit function into line ministries and includes the appropriate sections for a modern IAD.
20.      To fully implement the decentralization process, some regulatory changes seems necessary. For
example, Financial Regulations Law and Budget Law will need to be revised to reflect the
decentralization. Decentralization is expected be rolled out as a pilot stage to 3 line ministries. Following
up on the status and progress will be critical. IAD already existing at line ministries will be reactivated,
and trained on the MOF internal audit methodology and manuals, it will include as well on the job
training by MOF internal audit staff.

ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING

21.      The Accounting Department submitted the FY 2008 financial statements for audit after a very
difficult process to be able to establish the various account balances. The Auditor-General issued his
audit report on the FY 2008 financial statements in September 2010 in which numerous problems with
the accounts were reported. In fact, no audit opinion was really provided on whether the financial
statements “present fairly? the financial condition of the government. The FY 2008 financial statements
followed the IPSAS cash basis format but the auditors found transactions on the accrual basis recorded in
the accounts. Therefore, the statements were not compliant with the IPSAS cash basis. The notes to the
statements were very brief and generally not in full compliance with the IPSAS requirements. As noted
below, the notes for FY 2009 were much improved.
22.     An IPSAS Cash Basis Financial Statement Guideline was prepared to facilitate the presentation
of the FY 2009 financial statements. Templates were prepared for the cash basis statements, mandatory
note disclosures and voluntary disclosures. The FY 2009 financial statements have been submitted to the
Auditor-General for audit, and the draft audit report has been prepared. The Auditor-General expects
MOF comments on the draft audit report in order to finalize the audit within the next few months.
23.     Per MOF request, the World Bank reviewed the FY 2009 financial statements for compliance
with the IPSAS cash basis with respect to the note disclosures. The Bank provided comments by March,
2011. The review found that the note disclosures for FY 2009 were fairly comprehensive and complied
with the IPSAS cash basis standard. The notes covered both the required notes and the optional notes.
The reporting unit in MOF stated that there is a need for IPSAS training at the line ministry level since
they will be required to prepare financial statements at that level.
24.     The multi-currency issue that has been a problem for the accounting staff is now resolved. The
problem was that that the budget was prepared in Shekel and the financial reporting was in dollars. MOF
has adopted the concept of a functional currency and a reporting currency, in which they made the Shekel
the functional currency and the dollar or any other currency the reporting currency. This will now enable
them to issue a budget to actual report on the same currency basis.
                                                     60


25.      The Chart of Accounts (COA) is now compliant with the GFS requirements. The COA is an
integrated chart of accounts reflecting the concept of a uniform account code structure. This incorporates
both the budget structure and accounting structure. As the government moves towards program
budgeting, this will require some modification to the COA. MOF is executing the budget on a program
basis in FY 2011.
26.     At the present, the basic weakness in the financial system is on the revenue side. In the audit
report for FY 2008, the auditors cited this as a significant problem that the government needs to address
in the very near future. The auditors stated that the problem was the reliability and completeness of tax
information. There is a need to upgrade the tax systems to provide better accounting and reporting of tax
revenue and also provide the ability to be able to accrue tax revenues as the government moves towards
accrual accounting in 2012.
27.      MOF has implemented a fixed asset register which reflects the government assets and their
valuation. A policy was to be developed by the Fixed Asset Committee but that was not completed. It is
essential that MOF completes this policy statement along with the manuals since they are in the process
of rolling out the accounting system to the line ministries.
28.     The MOF has implemented commitment control/accounting to provide additional controls over
the budget as well as provide information for cash management. The government has implemented a
policy that will fund outstanding commitments at year-end in the following year budget. This is an
acceptable international practice. Therefore, the commitments will roll over to the next fiscal year.
However, there is another issue that will need to be addressed by the budget department in the use of
commitments. Allotments are provided quarterly, and commitments sometimes go beyond the current
quarter. Therefore, there needs to be flexibility in the issuing of allotments by the Ministry of Finance to
allow for longer term commitments.
29.      There is a need to develop a road map to move to accrual accounting. It has been recommended
that MOF should prepare a work sheet that would list all 31 standards and identify the requirements in
those standards. This would provide the MOF with a work plan to move forward to accrual accounting.
This is an activity that needs to be completed soon if the government expects to adopt accrual accounting
in 2012 or 2013.
30.      Fiscal Year 2011 is the first year program budgeting and program budget execution is fully
implemented in the system. The accounting system is now set up to handle program budgeting. Further
training is still needed on program budgeting.
31.     In the same context, line ministries are still in need for additional training on the program
budgeting, and program budget execution. Also, further training is required on commitments control and
accruals. MOF plans to have the FY 2010 financial statements ready by August 2011.
IMPLEMENTATION OF IFMIS

32.      The government is in the process of developing an Integrated Financial Management System
(IFMIS). This system was based on a system developed for the Ministry of Education by Bisan, a local
software firm. The system is evolving as new requirements are identified. This is due to the fact that
there was never a blue print (system architecture) developed for the system. The IFMIS has been rolled
out to all line ministries. Transaction will be entered by the line ministries with approval for the
transaction by Financial Controllers who also have decentralized to line ministries.
33.     The system is a data-based system that uses a uniform account code structure, which is a single
coding structure for all financial information. This is the brains of the system, and as a result, the quality
of management reporting has improved. This system in the near future has the potential to be used by all
                                                     61


Bank projects which will meet the Bank’s objective of using country systems. However, there is a need
for a system audit to be conducted that would address the controls within the system and the integrity of
information provided by the system. Such a review was conducted by an accounting firm a few years ago
and reported many findings regarding control weaknesses. The government has stated that corrective
actions to address those weaknesses have been taken. There is a need to independently confirm this.
34.     At the local government level, there is a Bank financed project that is supporting implementation
of the FreeBalance software package. It is also a database system that uses a uniform account code
structure. The project will roll out this system to 32 local governments in phase one with five local
governments being pilots. This system will be capable of interfacing with the PA accounting system at
the Ministry of Local Government.
USE OF COUNTRY SYSTEMSFOR BANK FINANCED PROJECTS

35.     At the present, all Bank financed projects are being audited by private external auditors due to the
capacity concerns of the state audit.
36.      The Bank fully relies on the Financial Controllers (FC) review before disbursement work for
Bank financed projects related disbursements. For Bank financed projects, the Bank uses these aspects of
country systems: Financial Controllers and Central Treasury System (opened bank account by MOF
under the central system). External audit and internal audit are still aspects to be considered for future
utilization for Bank financed projects.
37.     It seems that the SAACB is willing to audit Bank financed project. They have conducted an audit
of the Russian grant last year. The SAACB is willing to start auditing donor funded projects specifically
the World Bank funded projects. The SAACB capacity constraints and the lack of experience in this area
remain as a constraint. It is suggested that a few number of projects be selected as a pilot for now, to build
capacity and gain more expertise in this area. In the long run, SAACB’s target is to audit all Donors’
funded projects. The World Bank in partnership with other donors needs to support this effort.
SINGLE (CENTRAL) TREASURY SYSTEM & BANK FUNDED PROJECTS

38.     Due to the fact there is no central bank yet for West Bank and Gaza, MOF created a single
treasury account for revenues at the Bank of Palestine, and also created a single treasury account for all
disbursements at the Bank of Palestine, with sub accounts for every ministry and disbursing unit, and in
different currencies upon need: A total of main and sub accounts of more than 200 bank accounts.
39.     As a means for decentralization and cash management of the MOF to the line ministries, the zero
balance account concept was introduced. A sub account was created for every disbursing line ministry
with a disbursement ceiling based on their operational budget, and whatever the ministry disburses is
deducted from their ceiling, until the next allotment is made. By the end of the day, the ceiling is closed in
the main account of the MOF. Bank reconciliations and consolidations are done every day at the
ministries level and at the MOF cash management level.
40.     At the present, World Bank funded projects as well as all donor funded projects use the separate
designated account mechanism. A special account is opened under the MOF central treasury system
specifically for the designated project funds receipts and disbursements. This donors’ practice needs to
change when PA fully implements the STA.
41.     MOF uses a central treasury system rather than single treasury systems per se. Bank funded
projects’ related designated accounts are opened by MOF under the central treasury system. Each
implementing Ministry has the management responsibility of the account for disbursements on project-
                                                      62


related disbursements. Withdrawal applications are reviewed and signed by MOF before submitting to the
Bank.
42.     The MOF has requested that the Bank funds be treated the same way and concept of the zero
balance account be followed. The purpose is to fully utilize the central treasury system at the MOF and
enhance cash management even at the project levels. This was agreed to be discussed further.
43.     In relation to other Projects, the Bank opens separate designated accounts for each project, to
which the advance payment and replenishment are made. Due to the cash management concerns at the
MOF and the dependency on donor funds to cover their operational budgetary needs, it will be worth
consideration not to separate the Bank funds from the government funds to enable better cash
management, and to have the funds for projects when needed.
CORRUPTION OVERVIEW

44.     The 2010 Global Integrity Report indicates that there has been little improvement in addressing
corruption in the West Bank over the past two years and reconfirms the West Bank’s low ranking on its
Grand Corruption Watch List among all countries surveyed.17 The Report states cites a poor regulatory
framework and enforcement environment that undermine the accountability and transparency mechanisms
in government. The ratings on access to government information, conflict of interest safeguards and
checks and balances across government were quite low.
45.     However, the report indicates some positive actions that have been implemented recently. There
is now an anti-corruption law and a fairly new Anti-Corruption agency. These two events will need some
time to have an impact on the corruption perception. Another positive note is that CSOs and media play a
very important role. This is critical in addressing corruption issues.
46.     A recent World Bank study summarizes the progress made and challenges ahead in this areas as
follows: First, the PA has made significant strides to improve economic governance over the past decade.
Second, reform efforts have achieved varying degrees of success and the PA needs to prioritize and
address the ongoing challenges. Finally, the PA should take a more proactive approach to investigating
and prosecuting corruption, as well as communicating its anti-corruption activities to build public
confidence in government accountability.18
MANAGEMENT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE

47.     There is no fully functioning Central Bank for West Bank and Gaza yet. The Palestinian
Monetary Authority (PMA) act as and has the mandate of a central bank with the exception of issuing
currency. PMA regulates the banking system in West Bank & Gaza, in terms of capital adequacy,
reporting, etc. IMF and the World Bank are providing extensive support and capacity building and
technical assistance for the PMA. Banking system in West Bank and Gaza are considered efficient and
well regulated through the PMA according to well accepted international standards and benchmarks. All
of the Banks operating in West Bank and Gaza have to submit regulatory reports to the PMA, including
the annual report and annual audited financial statements.
48.      Due to the fact that there is no Central Bank for Palestine, the foreign currency management is
carried out through the Ministry of Finance. The funds from this DPG will be deposited in a bank account
held at commercial bank (i.e. Bank of Palestine), which is regulated by the PMA.

49.     Bank of Palestine audited financial statements and semi-annual reports are published on their
website. The annual report for the year 2010 included audited financial statements and auditor’s report
audited by Ernest & Young, who provided an unqualified opinion on the financial statements.

SELECTED KEY AREAS FOR FUTURE ACTIONS

50.      More remains to be done to further improve the PFM system. This includes the following key
actions:
       Complete the process for full implementation of the Single Treasury Account (STA), and the
        transformation from the CTA system to the STA.
       Ensure better integration of donor programming into the annual development budget. A clear
        action plan with commitments by all parties should be developed by the Ministries of Planning
        and Finance as part of the ongoing effort to develop a medium-term planning process.
       Roll out the Integrated Accounting System to line ministries already conducted will require
        parallel capacity building at both MOF and at line ministries level to train the designated staff on
        the new financial system.
       Fully implement internal audit function. Significant effort is already underway, but it will need
        considerable effort and support from the donor community and continued ownership and
        commitment from the PA to enhance the internal audit function in the WB&G and continue the
        decentralization plan into line ministries
       Although external audit development has started, building the capacity of the institution to a
        satisfactory level will require more extensive and well-monitored capacity development.
       Improve cash management and forecasting, while recognizing the fact that it is challenging under
        current emergency conditions.
It should be noted that these measures have already been identified by the PA as PFM reform objectives
in the PRDP and are being supported by this proposed DPG IV.

CONCLUSION

51.     In recent years WB&G has made significant progress in reforming PFM. This progress includes
the partial implementation of the TSA Concept, the development and implementation of GFMIS,
implementation of initial steps toward program budgeting. While the effectiveness of SAACB is being
strengthened with donor support, this effort is a work in progress. There is significant effort underway to
improve internal controls and implement modern internal audit, but much remains to be done in terms of
implementation. While these reforms are underway, the tangible benefits of these reforms are not yet fully
realized, particularly with respect to weak capacity at both the MOF and line ministries and the internal
control framework not being fully implemented. Also, SAACB needs much additional work to carry out
external audits of government’s programs according to international standards.
52.     In light of the fact that the fiduciary risk is assessed as significant and that reform is ongoing, the
Bank does not propose putting in place any additional fiduciary measures beyond standard requirements
for such level of fiduciary risks.
