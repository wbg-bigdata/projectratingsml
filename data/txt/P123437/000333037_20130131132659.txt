1.1 Context at Appraisal

Background and macroeconomic environment
With the advent of the Oslo Peace Process and the establishment of the Palestinian
Authority (PA) in 1994, the economy experienced rapid growth as a result of the return of
Palestinian refugees, restoration of livelihoods, and large inflows of public and private
capital. Real GDP growth between 1994 and 1999 averaged 8.4 percent and
unemployment fell below 9 percent from around 18 percent.

However, after the break of the second intifada in 2000, this trend was quickly reversed.
The peace process stalled, violence increased and the Government of Israel (GoI)
imposed a multi-layered system of physical, institutional, and administrative restrictions
that have fragmented the territory into small enclaves lacking most forms of economic
cohesion. 1 This exacted a significant toll on the economy and constrained private
investment and productivity. The real rate of growth quickly deteriorated to -9 percent,
and unemployment increased to 282 percent by the end of 2000.

In mid 2007, after Hamas took control of government and security positions in Gaza, a
new PA caretaker government was sworn in. Israel and the international community
endorsed this caretaker government which enabled fiscal stabilization. The caretaker
government formulated the Palestinian Reform and Development Plan (PRDP) 2008-10
as a road map to rebuild the PA’s operating systems, revive the economy, and to
strengthen the institutions necessary for a future Palestinian state. A major donor
conference that took place in Paris in late 2007 endorsed the plan and pledged almost
US$1.8 billion in donor funding to support it. In 2011, the PA published the Palestinian
National Development Plan (PNDP) 2011-13 which aimed to consolidate gains in
institution building activities emphasized in the previous national plan and to focus on
additional priorities including: reinforcing the role of the private sector, modernizing the
education system and investing in infrastructure.

  Israeli Defense Forces have barriers throughout the West Bank for the purpose of
enhancing the security of Israel and Israeli Settlements. Furthermore, the territory of the
West Bank is subdivided into Areas A,B,C. In Area C, which is the only continuous
territory in the West Bank and makes up about 61 percent of the West Bank’s territory,
the Palestinian Authority does not exercise administrative or security control.

 The unemployment rate during the fourth quarter of 2000 and after the second intifada
was 28 percent; however, the full year unemployment rate for 2000 was 14 percent.

PA-led reforms supported by donor aid and the easing of Israeli restrictions enabled the
Palestinian economy to recover. During 2008-2011, the average GDP growth for WB&G
increased to about 9 percent: 8 percent in the West Bank and 11 percent in Gaza. GDP
per capita also grew by an average of 5 percent during the same period from US$1356 in
2008 to US$1610 in 2011. Most of the growth was in the public sector and non-tradables
and was driven by donor supported PA expenditures. Public administration and defense
and other public services such as health, education, electricity and water grew from less
than 20 percent of GDP in 1994 to more than 27 percent in 2011. Meanwhile, the
manufacturing and agriculture sectors declined from 13 to 10 percent and 9 to 5 percent
respectively. The pattern was similar in both the West Bank and Gaza. Despite the high
levels of growth, unemployment remained high at 21 percent. The persistence of high
unemployment reflects the skewed nature of growth with the expansion of the labor
intensive sectors constrained by the Israeli trade restrictions and with investment highly
restricted in Area C 3 . Notably, by the end of 2011, one quarter of the Palestinian
population continued to live in poverty.

In 2012, the lower than expected aid flows compounded with the lack of significant new
easing of Israeli constraints had an immediate impact on the Palestinian economy. In the
first six months of 2012, real GDP growth rate is estimated to have decreased to 6.7
percent: 5.7 percent in the West Bank and 9 percent in Gaza. The slowdown in economic
growth was also reflected in higher unemployment levels. Overall unemployment in
WB&G grew to 22 percent in the first half of 2012 – 19 percent in the West Bank and 30
percent in Gaza. Strikingly, youth unemployment in Gaza amounted to 45 percent during
the same period. In addition to severe trade restrictions, the current ban on the movement
of Gazans into Israel remains an important constraint on the expansion of employment,
especially since prior to 2000, Israel accounted for about 13 percent of Gaza’s
employment.

In parallel to slower economic growth, exacerbated by a substantial reduction in foreign
aid inflows from 2008 to 2011, the PA’s fiscal situation has worsened during the first six
months of 2012. Donor aid for recurrent spending and development projects has been
lower than needed to finance the already tight budgets. This has been compounded by
shortfalls in revenue in the context of a declining economic growth and slow
implementation of clearance and domestic tax administration reform, in addition to
higher than expected expenditures - particularly pension payments4. Despite having taken
measures to constrain expenditures, the lower than expected level of donor aid created a
financing shortfall which caused a substantial rise in arrears to the private sector and
public pension fund as well as more borrowing from local commercial banks. The stock
of government debt to domestic banks has increased to US$1.2 billion or 12 percent of
GDP at end-June 2012 up from 10 percent in 2010. Estimates suggest that the value of
the accumulated pension arrears exceeds US$1 billion5 and the sum of the PA’s private
sector arrears accumulated since 2009 stands at about US$500 million.

Rationale for Bank assistance
The fourth development policy operation directly supports the objectives targeted by the
Bank’s Interim Strategy for the West Bank and Gaza, which focuses on the importance of
strengthening PA institutions to efficiently manage public finances. Despite the
commendable progress that the PA has been making in institution building, the lower
than expected donor funding has had a substantial negative impact on the PA’s finances,
causing threats that can potentially jeopardize previously made gains. The PA has no
access to international capital markets and its domestic borrowing is close to the
borrowing limit set by the Palestinian monetary authority. Therefore, the financial
support of the international community is vital for the PA to move forward with the
reform agenda and consolidate previous gains.

The PNDP DPG IV operation provided much needed financial support to the PA’s
budget. At the same time, it granted the World Bank and the PA an opportunity to
promote useful policy measures deemed necessary to preserve previous accomplishments
and achieve further progress in strengthening the PA’s fiscal position and improving its

  The PA reports that the majority of the higher than target pensions are payments to retirees from
the security sector. These pension payments were not accounted for in the 2012 budget, however,
the PA has continued to make them.

 This figure refers to partial information as there are some pension schemes for which there are no
exact data, funds or reconciliations. So, actual arrears to the entire pension system are likely to be
higher.



                                                     3
public finance management systems – two of the main priorities established by the
national development plan. Furthermore, DPG IV was preceded by three similar grants;
and the PA’s performance on achieving reforms supported by those operations was
considered satisfactory, meriting additional financial and technical support. The operation
was prepared against this backdrop, which strengthened the rationale for continued Bank
assistance. Finally, the Bank’s budget support through the DPG operations has continued
to mobilize funding from other donors, especially through the PRDP multi-donor trust
fund, which the Bank established in 2008 as a vehicle to support the implementation of
the PRDP. To illustrate, the Bank’s US$160 million contribution through DPG I, II, III,
and IV was complemented by over US$830 million in donor support through the PRDP-
TF since its inception.

The Bank’s decision to proceed with the fourth development policy operation was
appropriate, in particular given the PA’s achievements in implementing its development
plan and given the dire fiscal situation that posed a threat to preserving those
achievements.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The Program Appraisal Document (PAD), defined the PDOs as follows: The proposed
operation will help the PA to implement the new National Development Plan. Like the
PRDP DPGs I-III, the PNDP DPG- IV will specifically support efforts to improve the
fiscal position and increase government transparency and accountability.?

Key indicators were described as follows: “The PNDP DPG IV is designed to help the
PA strengthen its fiscal position by increasing domestic revenues to about 24 percent of
GDP by 2012 and managing the share of the public sector wage bill to keep it in line at
about 20 percent of GDP. The PNDP DPG IV also supports the PA’s efforts to improve
public financial management. Key indicators for this are greater transparency in budget
reporting of development and transfer spending, stronger oversight for public
procurement through new and better-trained institutions, and publicly available audited
accounts.?

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
Reasons/Justification

There have been no revisions.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved)

The PNDP DPG IV was designed to support the PA as it implements the National
Development Plan (NDP) 2011-2013. It focused on two broad policy areas, which were
also identified as priorities in the PA’s program: (i) strengthening the PA’s fiscal
position; and (ii) improving public financial management.

Strengthening the PA’s fiscal position rightly continues to be one of the top priorities for
the PA. Declining and unpredictable aid flows, some identified inefficiencies in public


                                             4
expenditure programs, and lower-than-expected growth, resulted in a financing gap for
the PA budget. The program supported a number of measures aimed at both bolstering
public revenue performance, but also enhancing the efficiency of public expenditures.

DPG IV also continued supporting reforms to improve public finance management, as
those reforms featured prominently in the NDP and as they are essential for building the
economic foundations for the Palestinians to independently manage the economy of a
future state. Furthermore, the development of sound PFM systems is of interest to all
donors who provide financial assistance to the PA.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Program Performance

A detailed account of program performance is given in the table below. In sum, out of ten
prior actions, eight were implemented, one was subsequently reversed, and the
implementation of one of them is temporarily stalled, but the authorities are working on
an alternative and likely better solution to the issue it was designed to address. The
reasons for the reversal of one prior action and stalling in the implementation of the other
are discussed later in the Assessment of Outcomes chapter and key lessons have been
summarized in the Lessons Learned section.

Aside from the implementation of the prior actions, it ought to be noted that the PA’s
performance on the macro-fiscal policy front, the main objective under Pillar I, has been
quite strong. A few months after the Board approved DPG IV, responding to more
unfavorable performance of the economy than had been earlier predicted, the authorities
introduced new measures in order to control public expenditures, such as hiring and
promotions freeze in the public sector. They managed to reduce public spending by 0.7
percentage points and to reduce the fiscal deficit (before external grants) from 15.8
percent of GDP in 2011 to 14.5 percent in 2012. All prior actions under Pillar II
(Increase Government Transparency and Accountability through Improved Public
Financial Management) have been implemented and substantial progress has been made
building on these achievements.

                                        plan, the PA initiated the development of a
                                        new payroll system to enable the payroll data
                                        entry to be carried out by line ministries and
                                        the General Personnel Council (GPC)
                                        through electronic links with the MoF’s
                                        central payroll system and under the
                                        supervision of the latter. The new system was
                                        expected to upgrade the existing manual
                                        procedures of exchange of data, which
                                        generate processing delays. Such reform was
                                        planned to be implemented gradually,
                                        starting on a pilot basis with two ministries
                                        (MoF and Ministry of detainees) prior to its
                                        further roll out to most institutions.
                                        Subsequently, a new IT payroll system (in-
                                        house basis) has been developed and begun
                                        to be implemented in the two pilot ministries.
                                        However, despite good intentions, the pilots
                                        revealed a range of problems due to
                                        conceptual difficulties inherent to any in-
                                        house system’s development and inadequate
                                        training of the payroll staff to implement the
                                        new system. As a result, the implementation
                                        of the pilots was discontinued. However, the
                                        PA remains committed to this reform and has

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

Thanks to PA’s commitment to implementing the NDP reforms, the operation achieved
notable progress, despite a challenging implementation environment. Several factors,
however, have had a negative impact on the implementation of this operation. Perhaps
the most noteworthy is that the authorities continued to operate against the backdrop of
unexpected reduction in donor assistance, sustained restrictions imposed on the
economies of both the West Bank and Gaza by the Israeli government, and political
division between the West Bank and Gaza.

The combination of the above factors has had a significant and rapidly evolving impact
on the political economy and consequently the feasibility of certain reforms the PA was
pursuing and which were supported by this operation. These factors led to popular
discontent and protests and increased the prospect of serious unrest. A weaker than
expected growth and dwindling financial assistance have in particular had a substantial
impact on political support for more sensitive reforms, such as that aimed at reforming
the retirement criteria. Consequently, for instance, despite the fact that the pension
system is fiscally unsustainable in the current form, the authorities reversed the decision
to allow employers to purchase maximum of up to five years of service for employees
seeking retirement. Current PA agreements with the private sector and local
governments include the possibility of purchasing up to ten years of service, which is in
conflict with the principles of insurance and inconsistent with the maximum of five years
agreed upon with the PA as part of the 2010 pension action plan.

There were also technical challenges that affected the implementation of the operation.
The introduction of the payroll in two ministries on a pilot basis proved more technically
challenging than had been anticipated. The authorities, however, have not given up on
the idea of further improving the payroll system to avoid delays, which the current
system may sometimes cause and to minimize the likelihood of error. Since the new
payroll system introduced on a pilot basis in two ministries did not provide a solution to
the problems it was designed to resolve, its use has been temporarily abandoned, but
work is under way to design a systematic and feasible solution.

The factors discussed above that have had a negative impact on the implementation of the
operation have been taken into account when the operation was prepared. There was a
clear government program focused on addressing the immediate fiscal challenges, but
also creating the institutional underpinnings for effective macro-fiscal and public finance
management. The constraints imposed on the economy, which were largely beyond the
control of the PA, warranted external budget support to enable the provision of essential
public services, promote stability and development.

The operation was designed to support the authorities in implementing their program and
provide essential budget support. It was firmly embedded in the Bank’s Interim Strategy
and its design was underpinned by recent and highly relevant analytical work in all policy
areas supported by the operation. Finally, the factors which have negatively affected the
implementation of the operation have been identified by the team, as potential risks.


                                              9
While many of the identified risks were beyond the Bank’s or the government’s control,
they were mitigated by focusing on reforms that were part of the government’s own
reform program and for the most part not susceptible to exogenous risks.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

The broad design of the M&E arrangements did not change substantially compared to
those of DPG I-III. The results framework of the DPG has been agreed with the
authorities and developed in consultation with other development partners. As has been
the practice, the results framework was developed not only to monitor progress under the
DPG, but also to monitor the implementation of the Multi-Donor Trust Fund that
supports the implementation of the Palestinian Recovery and Development Program
(PRDP), and as of 2011 the implementation of the Palestinian National Development
Plan (NDP). Since both the DPG and the PRDP TF support the implementation of some
key objectives of the PA’s strategy and aim to provide stable and predictable financial
support to the PA budget, a shared results framework for the two operations has provided
additional leverage to reform implementation.

The monitoring arrangements have been institutionalized in the Ministry of Finance.
Based on the inputs from line ministries and other government agencies, the PA prepares
quarterly reports on a regular basis to monitor the performance under both the DPG and
the PRDP/NDP MDTF. The same arrangement is utilized to monitor progress against the
PA’s medium term program.

The result indicators, which were developed in the context of DPG IV, are closely linked
to the objectives of the World Bank’s 2008-2011 Interim Strategy Note, which was
designed to support the achievement of specific PRDP program objectives. The
operation’s PDOs were directly targeted to support PRDP’s objectives of enhancing
fiscal sustainability and strengthening public sector governance (the latter specifically
through PFM reforms).

The specific objectives laid out in the results framework are closely related to the broader
PDOs, but the choice of some objectives and result indicators could, perhaps, have been
improved. For instance, not all objectives are of the same order. The objective 1.1
“strengthen the macro/fiscal framework? is of higher order than the objectives 1.2-1.4,
which also serve the purpose of strengthening fiscal sustainability. Then, since earlier
DPGs supported reforms of the social safety net system, for the sake of continuity, it was
decided to include an objective (1.3) in the results matrix, which is not supported by any
prior actions embedded in the operation.6




6
 This is not consistent with the advice by the Operations Policy and Country Services’ (OPCS)
“Good Practice Note for Development Policy Lending,? which recommends Bank teams not to
“include results that are not directly influenced by actions that are part of the operation…?



                                              10
Furthermore, the design of some result indicators (see Section 3.2 for details) could,
perhaps, have been strengthened to ensure closer attribution and causality between the
actions supported by the operation and expected results. For instance, the indicator
established to monitor the strengthening of macro-fiscal framework, which is supported
through the establishment of a separate macro-fiscal unit in MoF, measures recurrent
balance on a commitment basis as a percentage of GDP. In this case the indicator is not
restricted enough to establish a direct causal link between the action supported by the
operation and the fulfillment of the indicator targets. For several indicators, a baseline
was not established, which creates ambiguity in performance measurement. Finally,
although an admirable institutional setup for results monitoring has been put in place and
the process is conducted regularly on a quarterly basis, adequate arrangements have not
been developed to produce some of the data necessary to measure performance against
one of the result indicators, (see objective 1.2 in the Results Matrix).

2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):

In response to a request from the PA to continue supporting the implementation of the
NDP as well as to continue providing budget support in time when donor assistance is
rapidly shrinking, the Bank is preparing a follow up budget support operation (DPG V).

The new operation will again focus on assisting the PA in (i) strengthening its fiscal
position and (ii) improving governance and transparency in the public sector, primarily
through measures to strengthen public finance management and other measures to further
enhance governance in the public sector. Both of these policy areas remain of essential
strategic importance to the development of economic foundations for a future Palestinian
state. The new operation will also support the PA in addressing some immediate fiscal
priorities that recently emerged.

3. Assessment of Outcomes


3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The objectives of the DPG remain highly relevant. The operation was designed to
directly support the implementation of some of the key elements of PA’s NDP 2011-2013
in areas closely linked to the Bank’s mandate and competencies. The operation’s
objectives are directly linked to the objectives of the ISN 2008-2010: to support the PA in
implementing specific aspects of its medium term strategy, provide predictable and
sustained financial support, while promoting PA’s fiscal sustainability, and finally to
encourage other donors to provide financial assistance to PA budget. Furthermore, the
operation’s objectives remain fully relevant in the context of the ISN 2012-2014, whose
first pillar aims to: “strengthen the institutions of a future state to efficiently manage
public finances and ensure services to citizens.? Given the context of decreasing donor
assistance to the PA’s budget, binding constraints to economic growth in the form of
sustained restrictions on economic activity imposed by the GoI, the development
objectives and activities supported by DPG IV undoubtedly remain highly relevant.



                                            11
With the benefit of hindsight, one could possibly argue that some important measures that
could have potentially better served the operation’s objectives than the measures which
were actually chosen have been left out at the design stage. For instance, the operation
did not include any substantial policy measures to reform civil service and reduce what
by international standards is a very high wage bill. However, while the importance of
implementing those reforms is shared between the Bank and PA, the authorities were not
prepared to implement such measures within the time frame of DPG IV, but the policy
dialogue around them continued. Instead, the operation focused on those reforms that the
authorities were pursuing at the time and those where they showed willingness to pursue.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives

Specific evidence on the achievement of the PDO’s and the related outcome indicators is
provided in the table below. The table also assesses the quality of causal linkages
between the individual policy actions and the outcome indicators, as defined in the
Program Document. In short, the PDO achievement success can be rated as moderately
satisfactory. Only one of eight result indicators was outright not achieved, despite
prominently unfavorable implementation environment, bleak prospects for a stable
political solution, lower economic growth and reduced donor aid. All results pertaining to
the second objective of the operation aimed at improving governance and transparency in
the public sector have been met. The operation facilitated the creation of a modern public
procurement system, improvements in the quality and transparency of public finance
reporting, and the auditing function. On the negative side, as indicated in section 2.3, a
couple of indicators have some weaknesses pertaining to direct attribution and causality
and this has been taken into account in the evaluation of the operation’s achievement of
its objectives

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

In sum, there is no doubt that the actions supported by the operation have contributed and
are expected to continue contributing to the Program Development Objectives,
“specifically to support efforts to improve the fiscal position and increase government
transparency and accountability.? The program’s objectives remain highly relevant,
despite an extraordinarily turbulent political environment, hardly conducive to a multi-
annual reform process. Nevertheless, moderate shortcomings in the quality of the
program design were identified. Out of eight result indicators in the results matrix, four
were fully achieved, one was mainly achieved, one was partially achieved, one was not
achieved, and one was defined too imprecisely to be evaluated and was not linked to a
specific action supported by the operation. Taking into account (i) the Relevance of
Objectives, Design, and Implementation, as well as (ii) the Achievement of Program
Development Objectives, the operation is rated as Moderately Satisfactory.




                                              18
3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

It is worth noting that while DPG V was designed as a standalone operation, it has de
facto been prepared as a programmatic series, where the same broad objectives of (i)
strengthening the PA’s fiscal position and (ii) increasing government transparency and
accountability have been pursued by DPG I-IV. While this ICR has been designed to
evaluate the achievements of DPG IV alone, it is worth noting that notable progress has
been made against both of these broad development objectives as a result of a de facto
programmatic, yet flexible form of engagement through DPGs I-IV. A clear indicator of
fiscal strengthening is the fact that recurrent expenditures were reduced from a very large
share in GDP of 48 percent in 2009 to 33 percent in 2011, while at the same time the
quality of social and other services provided by the PA has not deteriorated, but has
improved significantly in a number of areas.7 While the PA continues to substantially
rely on external financing for recurrent expenditures—predominantly because of the
unresolved political status, which stifles economic activity in the private sector, it has
succeeded impressively in improving the efficiency of public spending.

The fiscal consolidation and efficiency improvements have benefited from efforts aimed
at improving government transparency and accountability, in particular in the area of
public finance management reforms, which have been supported by the series of four
DPGs. While a Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability assessment has not
been carried out yet (planned for 2013), and there isn’t a single benchmarking tool to
measure progress in this area, the ICR’s for the earlier three DPG’s, in addition to this
one, provide evidence of solid progress across several aspects of public finance
management: budget preparation, budget execution, transparency of the budget process
and reporting, auditing functions.

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The operation addresses poverty and social development indirectly. It provides
indispensible financial support to the budget, which enables the provision of essential
public services, such as education, health, and the provision of social assistance through
one of the most advanced Proxy Means Targeting (PMT) systems in the region. The
development objectives of the operation, through specific policy actions, also indirectly
address both poverty and welfare through the strengthening of public revenues,
improving the efficiency of public finance management systems and public expenditures.
These reforms are important prerequisites for sustainable economic growth, which is
arguably the most important tool for poverty alleviation and broader social development.




7
  For instance, the PA now operates a sophisticated and one of the best targeted cash
transfer programs globally, whose coverage of the poor population has been increasing.



                                            19
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

Institutional strengthening is at the core of this operation. This is not surprising, provided
that the objectives the operation sets to achieve depend to a large degree on the strength
of specific PA institutions. Specifically, the strengthening of the macro-fiscal framework
and fiscal management were supported through the establishment of a separate macro-
fiscal unit within the MoF, which will be in charge of producing macroeconomic and
fiscal forecasts to serve as the basis for medium term fiscal framework design and annual
budget preparation. The unit has been established and the capacity building efforts are
underway to enable the fulfillment of its mandatory tasks. Then, the operation supported
the establishment of the Customs Court of Appeals, which was established with the
objective of more efficient handling of disputes related to customs duties and VAT. In
addition, the operation supported the adoption of a new Procurement Law, which will set
up a completely new institutional structure (e.g. establish Higher Council for Public
Procurement Policies) to modernize procurement policies and practices in line with
international best practice. While other actions supported by this operation did not aim to
establish new institutional structures, the majority will contribute to institutional
strengthening indirectly by supporting transparency, promoting institutional efficiency
and accountability.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
Not applicable.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
   Rating: Substantial

The operation was implemented in an environment of high overall risk. As the ISN
2012-2014 notes: “In West Bank and Gaza the Bank operates in an environment of high
political and security ambiguity. The uncertainty of the peace process and the isolation
of Gaza in particular have a direct negative impact on the Bank Group’s agenda and
program implementation.? These risks are not specific to DPG IV, but could affect the
entire Bank portfolio.

Risks to the development outcomes of DPG IV are primarily of political, financial and
economic nature and many cannot be directly mitigated. The fiscal position of the PA,
which DPG IV was designed to support, depends remarkably on the peace process, and in
particular the restrictions on economic activity imposed by GoI in both the West Bank
and Gaza, the levels of donor assistance, as well as the reconciliation process between the
political authorities in West Bank and Gaza. As the Program Document correctly notes,
full fiscal sustainability of West Bank and Gaza cannot be achieved without a drastic
relaxation of sanctions, which currently stifle economic activity in the private sector. The
objective of strengthening governance and transparency in the public sector is arguably
less exposed to the above risks, as the outcomes do not directly depend on the level of
economic activity and foreign financial assistance, but if the political situation were to
deteriorate, the achievements on that front would also be jeopardized.



                                             20
The key risks have been taken into account in the operation’s design and mitigation
mechanisms were put in place. Due to significant risks, the operation has a relatively
simple design and was aligned with the PA’s own strategy to strengthen ownership. The
operation itself addresses one of the main risks to fiscal stability at the moment—that of
predictability of indispensible donor financial assistance. The operation also supports the
reduction of dependence on donor financing of the PA budget through measures to boost
domestic revenues and increase efficiency of public expenditures. In addition, the
measures supported by the operation to strengthen public finance management are also
intended to increase the efficiency of public expenditures, and could also contribute to
internal stability by enhancing governance and transparency in the public sector.

Finally, it ought to be noted that there is strong PA ownership for the large majority of
reforms supported by the operation. Despite all the constraints, thanks to its commitment
to reform, the PA has managed to develop economic management and public finance
management on par with or even exceeding the performance level of some middle
income countries that do not face similar risks and challenges.


5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

    Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

DPG IV was designed to address some of the key reform priorities, whose relevance
remains equally high today as it was when the operation was prepared. The reforms were
prepared in close consultation with the PA and were based on the government’s own
reform program (NDP). Other donors were consulted in the process not only to avoid
overlaps, but to create synergies among different programs. The operation also leveraged
other donor financing, in particular through the PRDP MDTF, which shares the same
results framework with the DPG. The main risks were appropriately assessed and taken
into account in the operation’s design.
As noted earlier, the operation was mostly but not entirely implemented as intended;
there were moderate shortcomings in the design of the operation, which may have had a
negative impact on the implementation success. One cannot convincingly argue,
however, that the team could have conducted a more thorough political economy analysis
and concluded that the prior action on pension reform may not be feasible. This was a
reform that was important for the program’s success and was supported by the
counterparts at the time of design. Therefore, there was a solid justification for including
it in the program based on the information available at that time.8 However, as explained


8
 The quality of a decision should be evaluated based on the information that was
available at the time when the decision was taken.



                                            21
earlier, circumstances changed rapidly and affected the government’s readiness to pursue
this particular reform and it subsequently introduced other feasible measures to improve
its fiscal position. As opposed to this case where the Bank made the right decision, a
more rigorous assessment of what was required to implement the pilot payroll systems
could have probably concluded that the reform, although desirable, was not feasible at the
time and not critical for the program’s success. This case is a lesson learned for the Bank.


While the results framework has not been entirely based on best practice, as discussed in
Section 2.3 above, the monitoring arrangements that the Bank helped put in place
however, are appropriate. The Ministry of Finance produces regular monitoring reports
on a quarterly basis, which are synchronized with and are a part of the broader M&E
system designed to monitor NDP implementation progress. MoF coordinates the
collection of inputs among different government agencies. The reports were sufficient to
monitor implementation progress, with the exception of two numerical values (on share
of electricity provided by the power utilities), which have never been provided.

(b) Quality of Supervision

    Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Supervision was facilitated by strong M&E and regular reporting arrangements that the
borrower had put in place.9 The implementation progress was not only monitored by the
Task Team Leader (TTL), but also the Bank team based in the Bank’s West Bank and
Gaza Office in Jerusalem, who carried out regular dialogue with the authorities aimed at
supporting reforms supported through DPG IV, but also with a medium-term view with a
new budget support operation in mind. Finally, the shortcomings in the program’s
implementation, which are highlighted in the ICR, could have, perhaps, been formally
addressed to the client in the context of the DPG IV supervision missions. Importantly,
however, this issue has been formally raised with the PA in the mission Aide Memoire of
the Technical Assistance: Reforming Pensions in the West Bank and Gaza project, which
complemented the policy reform effort pursued by DPG IV through the provision
technical assistance to support reform implementation. Thus, the main problem with
program implementation has been effectively communicated to the client.


(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
    Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Quality at entry and quality of supervision are both rated moderately satisfactory,
resulting in the overall rating of Bank performance of moderately satisfactory.


9
 The only weakness in the M&E arrangement was that two quantitative indicators in the
energy sector were not monitored on a regular basis. All other indicators were regularly
monitored and published in MoF reports.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance

   Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

The evaluation of borrower performance must take into account the environment in
which it operated while implementing the operation. Earlier expectations that the
restrictions imposed by GoI on the economy would be eased, that a reconciliation process
would result in a unified government for both West Bank and Gaza, did not materialize.
Consequently, economic growth has been significantly below expectations. At the same
time, inflows of donor aid were reduced significantly and unexpectedly. Under these
circumstances, the political economy became less conducive for the implementation of
some reforms, in particular the reform of the pension system and reforms in the power
sector.

While there were moderate shortcomings in the implementation of reforms, which were
assessed in earlier sections, the government has made substantial progress in reform
implementation, despite the challenges it faced. The measures taken by the government
to control expenditures, bolster revenues, and strengthen public finance management
systems were particularly successful. The success achieved by the PA in reducing the size
of recurrent expenditures as a share of GDP is particularly remarkable. In addition, the
measures aimed at institutional strengthening are also noteworthy; for instance, the
institutional strengthening in the area of macro-economic management, public
procurement and revenue administration, all supported by the operation, are expected to
reduce the risks to the achievement of the desired development outcomes.

Taking the factors discussed above into account, a rating of Moderately Satisfactory for
the Borrower is justified.

6. Lessons Learned


The following five significant lessons from this operation can be drawn:

1. Even in an environment of high risk, DPG’s can be successful if the design
   adequately takes the risks into account and ensures government ownership of the
   reform program. Client commitment to the program is key to success under difficult
   circumstances. DPG IV was firmly embedded in the government’s own medium-


                                           23
   term economic program, which is the main reason the operation was relatively
   successful in achieving its intended development objectives, despite a highly difficult
   operating environment. Furthermore, the operation was designed with another
   important objective in mind: to provide indispensible financial assistance to ensure
   the provision of essential public services. The operation also leveraged support from
   other donors resulting in a level of assistance that could make a difference for the
   budget and cushion the negative impact of overall drop in donor aid.
2. Single tranche operations can and should be designed with a medium-term agenda in
   mind whenever possible. While it would probably not be appropriate to design a
   programmatic DPG, given the high level of uncertainty in West Bank and Gaza, this
   operation was designed with some medium term objectives in mind and has been
   successfully used as a platform to support the dialogue with the authorities on the
   medium term program, even when the implementation of some of its actions had to
   be postponed. Finally, the medium term outlook has been a useful tool in the
   preparation of a follow up operation.
3. The M&E design should in line with good practice criteria, following for instance
   “Good Practice Note for Development Policy Lending.? For instance, some of the
   result indicators utilized by DPG IV are not specific and as such suffer from weak
   attribution of causality between the measures taken and the result indicators.
   Provided that the same results framework is used to monitor progress for the Multi
   Donor Trust Fund, it is particularly important to strengthen the results framework for
   the next operation.
4. Program design needs to be realistic, taking into account the political economy, the
   context of fragility, technical and other relevant challenges and risks. Specifically the
   technical challenges of implementing specific reforms ought to be taken into account
   in operation design. The reform aimed at introducing a payroll system in two
   ministries on pilot basis was not implemented as intended. This was evidently not
   due to inadequate ownership on the government’s side, but rather because of the
   technical challenge of implementing the reform within a given timeframe turned
   insurmountable. Future operations should assess not only the readiness to implement
   particular reforms, but also the technical feasibility, when proposed reforms have to
   undergo an implementation process that may be technically challenging.
