MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN IN AN AMOUNT EQUIVALENT TO $100 MILLION
TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA FOR THE
SULAWESI - IRIAN JAYA URBAN DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        The following report atid recommendation on a proposed loan to the
Republic of Indonesia for $100 million equivalent is submitted for approval.
The loan would have a term of 20 years including five years of grace, at the
Bank's standard variable interest rate, and would assist in financing the
Government's efforts to improve urban infrastructure in nine local governments
in Sulawesi and to provide better water supply services in eight cities in
Irian Jaya. Part of the proceeds ($27.2 million equivalent) would be onlent
to the participating local governments and their water enterprises for 20
years including five years of grace at 10.5 percent interest per annum. A
Japanese grant of $0.7 million equivalent would cover part of the costs of
technical assistance. Central government would bear the foreign exchange
risk.
2.        Background.  The urban population in Indonesia exceeds 50 million
and is growing at about 52 per year, more than twice the national rate. About
2O0 live below the official poverty line. Sulawesi has an urban population of
about 2.5 million. almost half of them are living in two large cities, Ujung
Pandang and Manado at opposite ends of the island. The total population of
the island is about 12.5 m:llion, growing at an annual rate of about 2
percent. Sulawesi is less developed than the Inner Islands (Java, Madura and
Bali) and the incidence of urban poverty was substantially higher in 1987 than
the nationwide average. Irian Jaya has an urban population of about 350,000
people out of a total population of 1.6 million. The urban areas are the
centers of public services and also increasingly important centers of trade,
transportation and secondary industries. The urban incidence of poverty,
although increasing, was still lower than the nationwide average in 1987.
Fast population growth in the cities is primarily due to migration from other
provinces but rural Irianese have also been moving into the urban areas. Many
of the newcomers settle in low-income areas where high population density puts
increasing pressure on infrastructure services.
3.        The key issues in the urban sector in Sulawesi and Irian Jaya are
reflections of national level problems: (a) substantial backlogs in the
provision of urban infrastructure services; (b) weak urban planning and
programming capabilities of local governments; (c) imbalances in the urban
expenditure patterns and inadequate maintenance of existing infrastructure;
(d) low level of local resource mobilization (in Sulawesi and Irian Jaya
substantially below the nationwide average); (e) dependence of water
enterprises, with the exception of the ones in the largest cities, on
continuing subsidies from the central government (the poor cost recovery
performance is a reflection of low quality of service provided and low
efficiency of operations).
4.        Government Strategy.  The Government of Indonesia (GOI) has
recognized these shortcomings and aims at implementing integrated urban
infrastructure programs which include improvements of water supply, drainage,



2
human and solid waste management, kampungs (low income settlements) and urban
roads. Local government institutional strengthening and local revenue
mobilization are important elements of the government strategy, reinforced
through the program of administrative decentralization. Poverty reduction and
regional balance in development are prominent objectives of the current
national medium-term development plan (Repelita V). High levels of poverty
exist in East Indonesia (especially in South-East Sulawesi, Maluku, Nusa
Tenggara and Irian Jaya) and the strong emphasis given in Repelita V to
infrastructure development in the outer islands is a natural consequence of
GOI's recognition of the problem.
5.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  Having contributed to the
formulation of GOI's sector strategy through the 1984 Urban Services Sector
Report (4800-IND) and subsequent studies supported under the Urban IV (1702-
IND) and Urban V (2408-IND) loans, the Bank supports the integrated
infrastructure programming/decentralization approach adopted by GOI as the
best way to address urban sector issues in Indonesia in a coordinated and
planned manner. Based on experience gained under the six completed and eight
ongoing urban and water supply projects in Indonesia, the Bank strategy
recognizes that implementation of this approach depends on the degree of
institutional capacity of local governments and water enterprises. Bank
strategy also recognizes that regionally balanced development is a legitimate
concern of GOI and development of the urban areas in East Indonesia is a
necessary condition to achieve that. The Water Supply II (1709-IND), Urban
Development III (1653-IND) and V (2408-IND) projects, which included cities in
Sulawesi, demonstrated that institutional development is a slow process in
East Indonesia and cost recovery is difficult to achieve. However, it was
also demonstrated that well prepared, traditonal project type interventions
restricted to a few urban a-eas would help GOI improve delivery of urban
infrastructure services in these areas. The rationale for the proposed
project is based on this experience.
6.        Project Objectives.  Objectives of the project would be to: (a)
provide urban infrastructure in selected cities in Sulawesi and Irian Jaya
with emphasis on increased access of households to water supply, solid waste
and sanitation services; (b) develop improved infrastructure expenditure
programing and financial planning in these cities, especially to support the
development of local government capacity to prepare and execute annual
operation and maintenance (OEM) programs; and (c) encourage local governments
and water enterprises to increase revenue generation and improve financial
management.
7.        Proiect Description.  To achieve these objectives, the project would
finance: (a) investment and O&M of urban roads, drains, water supply, human
and solid waste management systems, kampung and market infrastructure in nine
local governments in Sulawesi (70.02 of project costs); (b) water supply
investments in eight towns in Irian Jaya (16.62); (c) project implementation
support and engineering services (9.2S); (d) municipal management and water
enterprise institutional strengthening (2.5X); and (e) repayment of the PPF
advance and preparation of a future urban project in Sulawesi (1.7X). The
project would be implemented over a five year period. The Loan would be made
to the central government. Part of the proceeds of the loan ($27.2 million



3
equivalent) would be onlent to local governments and their water enterprises
under Domestic Lending Arrangements (DLAs). DLAs will carry an interest rate
of 10.5 percent per annum and would be repaid in 20 years including 5 years of
grace. Interest and commitment charges would be payable during the grace
period. GOI would bear the foreign exchange risk. Central government would
provide overall guidance and technical assistance to lower level governments
and would also implement certain sub-projects (e.g. national roads, water
supply in case the water enterprises are still under the central government).
Local governments would be responsible for implementation of all other sub-
projects.
8.        The total project cost and financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
Procurement and disbursement arrangements are summarized in Schedule B.
Retroactive financing of up to $1 million is recommended for civil works,
goods and consultancy services expenditures incurred after March 31, 1991. A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank operations
in Indonesia are given in Schedules C and D respectively. A map showing the
project towns is also attached. A Staff Appraisal Report No. 9155-IND dated
May 20, 1991 is being distributed separately.
9.        Environmental Impact.  The project is expected to have a positive
overall impact on the urban environment. It will reduce the non-sanitary
disposal of human and solid waste and decrease flooding. Environmental
screening and preliminary environmental assessment have been carried out in
accordance with GOI procedures which are satisfactory to the Bank. The
possible negative impacts are pollution at the final solid and human waste
disposal sites, over-abstraction of river water for the water supply systems
and small scale resettlement due to widening of roads. Environmental
management and monitoring plans have been prepared which prescribe adequate
strategies and measures to minimize negative environmental impact during
implementation.
10.       ImDact on Women.  Large numbers of women will benefit from the
project. Particularly improved access to and quality of water supply and
better environmental sanitation resulting from solid waste management, low-
cost sanitation and drainage programs will provide important benefits to
several thousands of women and children. Women play an important role in
those community groups and organizations which will participate in the
implementation of low-cost sanitation and neighborhood improvement programs
and other investments directly affecting their neighborhoods.
11.       Actions Agreed.  Assurances and confirmations were obtained from GOl
on the following: (a) the onlending terms; (b) financial performance criteria
for water enterprises; tc) project accounting and auditing arrangements; and
(d) project management arrangements. Condition of disbursement for each local
government is the signing of a Project Implementation Agreement for
disbursement against central government funded contracts and the signing of a
DLA for disbursement against DLA funded expenditures.
12.       Benefits and Risks.  In general, benefits would flow from more
efficient use of resources in the urban infrastructure sector through improved
delivery of services by increasingly capable and responsible local governments



4
and their enterprises. The water supply, drainage and road investments would
provide important economic and social benefits while the solid and human waste
management components will substantially improve the living environment in the
urban areas covered by the project. Provision of public water taps and
improvement of kampungs will help the urban poor.
13.       Because of the low absorptive capacity of local governments in East
Indonesia, the institutional capacity building effort under the project has to
be modest and is designed to proceed in small increments. The chief risk is,
therefore, that the project may achieve only limited institutional
development. However, the priority given to implementation assistance and O&M
capacity building activities should ensure that the flow of benefits from the
implemented physical investments would be sustained.
14.         Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and I recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
