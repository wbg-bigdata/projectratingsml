                  a guarantee agreement, on the date the agreement

                  into;
          (iii)   the term "debt service requirement" means the
                  aggregate amount of repayments (including sinking

                  prepared by a Participating Local Government in

                  Participating Local Government accept as rea-
                  sonable and as to which the Bank has notified the
                  Participating Local Government of its accept-
                  ability, provided that no event has occurred
                  since such notification which has, or may
                  reasonably be expected in the future to have, a
                  material adverse effect on the financial
                  condition or operating results of such
                  Participating Local Government;
            (v)   whenever for the purposes of this Section it
                  shall be necessary to value, in terms of currency
                  of the Borrower, debt payable in another
                  currency, such valuation shall be made on the
                  basis of the prevailing lawful rate of exchange
                  at which such other currency is, at the time of
                  such valuation, obtainable for the purposes of
                  servicing such debt, or, with the absence of such
                  rate on the basis of a rate of exchange

                   withdraw from the Loan Account and deposit into

special commitment entered into by the Bank pursuant to Section 5.02
of the General Conditions, shall equal the equivalent of twice the
amount of the Authorized Allocation.
Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the remaining
unwithdrawn amount of the Loan allocated to the eligible Categories
shall follow such procedures as the Bank shall specify by notice to
the Borrower. Such further withdrawals shall be made only after and
to the extent that the Bank shall have been satisfied that all such
amounts remaining on deposit in the Special Account as of the date
of such notice will be utilized in making payments for eligible
expenditures.

Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank: (A)
provide such additional evidence as the Bank may request; or (B)
deposit into the Special Account (or, if the Bank shall so request,
refund to the Bank) an amount equal to the amount of such payment or
the portion thereof not so eligible or justified. Unless the Bank
shall otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Bank into the
Special Account shall be made until the Borrower has provided such
evidence or made such deposit or refund, as the case may be.
      (b)   If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any
amount outstanding in the Special Account will not be required to
cover further payments for eligible expenditures, the Borrower
shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to the Bank such
outstanding amount.

Bank all or any portion of the funds on deposit in the Special
Page  18
Account.
