                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Since the October 2011 Midterm review of the project, implementation has picked up substantially. The majority of planned water supply schemes (483 of 620) have been completed.
                         In addition, the construction of seven (of the projected ten) water quality laboratories have already been completed. All goods (communication facilities including V-Sat, computers,

                         Disbursement under the project has reached 68%. The MDTF-SS is closing by June 30, 2013 while all the projects under its financing (including WSSP) will close earlier than that by
                         Dec. 31, 2012. The period in between is for finalizing payments, preparation of ICR and other closing activities. While all activities are expected to be completed under the project, the
                         two consultancy contracts are lagging behind and might not be completed by the project closing date. This may lead to the return of about US $ 1 – 2 Million as unutilized. The client
