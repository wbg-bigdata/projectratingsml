                         systems rehabilitated and extended; 1 Hafir- (Water Harvesting structures)) have been completed providing access to improved water supply for about 416500 beneficiaries
                         (approximately 4.93% of the total population of South Sudan). In addition, all the planned nine water quality laboratories have been completed and equipped. All goods (including V-
                         Sat communication facilities, computers, printers, scanners, office furniture, laboratory equipment, and 11 field vehicles) were delivered to the Ministry of Water Resources and

                         While no financial and economic analysis was conducted during project appraisal, comparison of implementation cost of the schemes with African average has revealed that the
                         project has utilized its resource efficiently. The project spent about US$ 14.44 million for the construction and rehabilitation of about 586 schemes providing access to 416500 people
                         with safe drinking water. The average unit cost per beneficiary is about US$ 40, which is well below the average per capita cost for Africa that ranges from US$ 20 to US$ 90. The
                         choice of low cost technology (largely point sources suitable for the rural settlement pattern in South Sudan) and the competitive award of contracts is believed to have contributed for
                         this low unit cost per beneficiary.
