HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN
FIFTH POWER PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:                        The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan
Beneficiary:                     Jordan Electricity Authority (JEA)
Amount:                          US$35.0 million equivalent
Terms:                           17 years, including four years of grace at an
interest rate of 11.6 percent per annum.
Relending Terms:                 17 years, including five years of grace, at the
same interest rate as the proposed loan. JEA
would bear the foreign exchange risk.
Project
Description:                   The project would meet the growing power demand
at least cost to the economy. In addition, the
project would help improve the quality of power
supply and accelerate the country's regional
electrification. It would also contribute to
the institution building efforts to strengthen
JEA, and help improve energy sector planning
and coordination. The project, which is a part
of JEA's power system development program for
1982-1986, has the following components: (i) a
seawater-cooled steam power station at Aqaba
comprising two 130 MW oil-fueled generating
units and accessories; (ii) a 320-km long
transmission line from Aqaba to Amman; and
(iii) consultant services for engineering,
erection, supervision, and initial operation.
The principal benefits of the proposed project
would accrue to the industry and to the
hitherto unserved population. The project
faces no special risks.

'N EERNA-i-ONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE IBRD
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE HASHEMITE KINGDOM OF JORDAN FOR A
FIFTH POWER PROJECT
I.       I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed Bank
loan to the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan of US$35 million equivalent to help
finance a Fifth Power Project. The loan would have a term of 17 years,
including 4 years of grace, with interest at 11.6 percent per annum.  The
Government would onlend the proceeds of the loan to the Jordan Electricity
Authority (JEA) with the same repayment period and interest rate as the
proposed loan, except that it would grant a five year grace period. Official
bilateral and multilateral sources would provide about $115 million equivalent
towards the financing of the project. The balance would be provided by JEA
and export development and suppliers credit.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.       A report entitled "Country Economic Memorandum on Jordan"
(No. 3135-JO, dated December 24, 1980) was distributed to the Executive
Directors in January 1981. An economic mission visited the country in
October 1981. Country data sheets are attached as Annex 1.
3.       Jordan is a country of 2.2 million people (East Bank) with limited
natural resources and a traditionally service and trade-oriented economy.
It has enjoyed a high rate of growth and made good progress in diversifying
commodity production, increasing investment, and promoting exports. This
economic performance has taken place in the context of increasing trade with
neighboring countries and expanding inflow of remittances from Jordanians
working abroad, foreign aid and capital. As a result, employment is high
and foreign exchange reserves have been steadily rising.
Recent Economic Developments
4.       Renewed stability following the disruptions of 1967-71 created a
climate conducive to sustained economic growth during 1975-80, resulting in an
average annual growth of GDP of about 12 percent in real terms. This growth
was in sharp contrast with that during 1971-75, which was slightly negative.
In 1980, GNP per capita reached $1,420. The upsurge of the economy was due
to: (a) the rapid growth of the mining and manufacturing sectors; (b) the
sharp increase in construction, particularly in housing and large public
works; and (c) favorable external factors including influx of Lebanese
business activity and booming conditions in the Gulf countries. In
agriculture, rainfed production was sharply reduced by a severe four-year
drought, but vegetable and fruit production in the irrigated areas increased
significantly. Agricultural output recovered sharply in 1980. The private
sector showed growing strength especially in promoting export-oriented
ventures.
5.       The overall balance of payments remains strong despite a chronic
deficit in merchandise trade. Exports of goods and non-factor services



-2-
increased by 30 percent annually from 1975 to 1980 (about 24 percent in 1975
prices). This growth was due to high demand and prices for fruits and
vegetables in neighboring countries, booming exports of manufactured goods and
a sharp increase in receipts from tourism and other non-factor services.
Jordanian goods have been able to compete successfully in Middle East markets
because of the advantages of Arab Common Market and bilateral agreements,
relatively good quality of the products, enterprising marketing and the
favorable geographical location.  Although the growth in the volume of imports
was slower than that of exports, the resource gap increased in current terms
from $560 million in 1975 to about $1,650 million in 1980. These trade
deficits, however, were fully compensated by factor income and transfers from
abroad. As a result, the Government-guaranteed external borrowing remained
within reasonable limits and borrowing on commercial terms was reduced to a
modest level (para. 15).
6.       Expenditure and domestic revenue of the Government both increased at
a rate of about 20 percent per annum through lq75-80.  The widening of the
overall budget deficit, however, was tempered by a sharp increase in grants
from Arab countries following the Baghdad Summit Conference in 1978.  As a
result, the relative size of the deficit increased from six percent of GNP in
1975 to seven percent in 1980. The expansion of domestic Government revenue
during that period was significantly below the overall rate of growth in
national income.  As a result, the ratio of Government domestic revenue to GNP
declined from 24 percent in 1975 to 21 percent in 1980. Current expenditures,
excluding defense, were covered by domestic revenues. Defense expenditures
were largely financed by foreign assistance. During 1976-80, about 36 percent
of capital expenditures were financed from the current budget surplus, 33
percent by foreign loans, and the rest by other domestic resources.
7.       The main concerns of monetary policy have been mobilizing savings and
controlling domestic liquidity. While the savings performance has improved,
gross domestic savings have continued to be negative because of the high level
of defense expenditures.  Although the share of foreign grants used for
military imports is not clearly delineated, assuming that at least 60 percent
of net foreign transfers were used for military imports and were therefore
excluded, gross domestic savings would be positive. To promote domestic
savings, greater discretion is being allowed to the Central Bank in adjusting
interest rates and banking commissions. Increases in deposit rates were
effected and have resulted in savings deposits increasing faster than money
supply. Between 1975 and 1980, domestic inflation, measured by the cost of
living index, increased by 11.5 percent annually.
8.       A diversified banking system capable of meeting the financial
requirements of fast economic growth was developed during the last decade.
The banking system now includes 15 commercial banks and eight specialized
credit and investment institutions. The Amman Stock Exchange, established in
1978, has become an active institution, and the Securities Corporation,
created with IFC assistance, is growing in strength. The liberal transfer
policy recently followed by the Central Bank has encouraged growth of the
financial system, and Amman has started to emerge as an international
financial center.



-3-
Medium-Term Prospects
9.       The new Five-Year Plan (1981-85) aims at maintaining the rate of
growth of the economy close to that achieved during the previous plan. In
terms of the investment program, the plan is ambitious--total investment would
amount to JD 3.3 billion ($11 billion), 53 percent of which is by the
Government. The announced strategy is to pursue the objectives of the last
decade of economic planning in Jordan, namely to: (a) reduce the heavy
dependence on external assistance; (b) diversify the economy by increasing
commodity production; (c) reduce the budget deficit; and (d) improve the
distribution of the benefits of growth.
10.      Medium-term economic projections indicate that rapid GDP growth,
about 10 percent annually, can be maintained during the current Plan period.
Because of an expected slowdown in factor income from abroad, GNP is projected
to grow at a slightly lower rate of 8.5 percent per year. However, full
implementation of the Plan's investment program is a key assumption underlying
these growth rates.  The Program would maintain the rate of fixed investment
at its high current level of 33-35 percent of GNP (in 1980 prices) and would
seriously tax available technical and managerial skills in the country.
Industrial growth will benefit from the completion of the major projects now
under implementation (phosphate mining, cement, potash, and fertilizer) and
would maintain an overall average annual rate of about 17 percent, peaking in
1983 and 1984. Barring serious disruptions in agricultural output through
unfavorable weather conditions, Jordan would realize a significant increase in
the share of commodity producing sectors in total domestic output and thus
correspondingly reduce its traditional dependence on the services sector.
11.      The medium-term prospects for increasing exports are promising.  The
completion of the major export-oriented industrial projects now under
implementation, together with the enterprise displayed by the private sector,
should result in significant increases in foreign exchange earnings after
1982. In agriculture, the expected increase in vegetable and fruit exports
will, however, be more than offset by growing imports of food, and the
agricultural trade deficit would probably increase. Even thougl total exports
are projected to maintain a high rate of increase (16 percent p.a. at constant
prices) while imports would grow at a significantly lower rate, the trade
deficit could continue to increase and could exceed the two billion dollar
mark by 1985. In relation to GNP, however, the resource gap is expected to
show a significant further decline (from 46% to 40%). Unlike the recent
experience, net workers' remittances and foreign grants may not be sufficient
to meet the growing trade deficit.  Jordan would therefore have to rely more
heavily on external borrowing (para. 16).
12.      Savings from private sources, particularly from workers abroad,
should continue to increase, helped by the expanding banking network. A
reduction of the budget deficit could also be expected. A working group is at
present preparing recommendations on the fiscal system, but a radical
structural reform can only be expected in the medium term. Although current
expenditure, excluding defense, is expected to grow at a slower pace than the
economy, the demands for increased social expenditure and the need to raise



-4-
wages to retain valuable public servants will not permit significant cuts in
current expenditure, except for subsidies for energy and food products.
Social Issues
13.      Due to the continuing migration of Jordanians to neighboring
countries and the rapid economic growth, selective manpower shortages have
emerged. In 1980, out of the approximately 800,000 Jordanians (including
Palestinians from the West Bank) residing abroad, a little over 200,000 were
estimated to be workers, compared to a total domestic employment of about
440,000. Domestic employment includes a rapidly growing number of foreign
workers currently estimated at about 80,000 about half of whom are unskilled.
The country has expanded its education and training system rapidly but still
needs a comprehensive manpower and training plan to help ensure that: (a) the
economy does not suffer from shortages of crucial skills, while meeting
prospective demand for skilled workers abroad as far as possible; and (b) the
potential labor force is utilized more fully--especially the seasonally idle
workers in rainfed areas and women, whose participation, although growing
fast, is still low.
14.      Social issues are now an acknowledged concern of the Government and
this new emphasis is to some extent reflected in the new National Plan
(1981-85). Although the social indicators provide a relatively favorable
reading in most sectors, the social services are unevenly distributed across
income groups and across provinces. Thus, while health infrastructure is
adequate and life expectancy is relatively high (61 years), medical doctors
are concentrated in urban centers. Housing remains a problem despite the boom
in 1978-80, mainly because housing costs have far exceeded the means of the
lower income groups. The Government's concern about these issues has led to
the setting up of the new Ministry of Social Affairs in November 1979 to
define a coherent social development program.
External Assistance
15.      Due to large foreign inflows of remittances and transfers, the
current account of the balance of payments was on average in equilibrium
through 1975-80, and the government-guaranteed external debt has remained
within reasonable limits. Net workers' remittances increased from
$166 million in 1975 to $638 million in 1980. Foreign grants exceeded
$500 million in 1977 and fell to $335 million in 1978. Following the Baghdad
Arab Summit Conference in November 1978, which pledged assistance of about
$1.2 billion per year until 1983, net foreign aid rose again to a record high
of about one billion dollars in 1979 and $1.3 billion in 1980. The external
public debt outstanding and disbursed reached $1.3 billion at the end of 1980;
the outstanding debt to IDA was $76 million, to IBRD, $26 million, and, to
IFC, $15 million ($85 million, $100 million and $20 million, respectively,
when including undisbursed commitments). In 1977 and 1978, Jordan borrowed
$224 million and $100 million respectively on the Eurodollar market, but in
1979, higher foreign aid allowed the borrowing to be further reduced to
$28 million. External debt service payments amounted to $134 million in 1980
or 5.4 percent of total exports of goods and services.



-5-
16.      Jordan's relative stability, pragmatic economic and social policies
and efficient economic management have helped to attract large foreign
assistance. The continuation of foreign economic assistance at the relatively
high levels of recent years obviously depends on international and regional
developments. Except for aid related to defense expenditures, the grant
component of this foreign assistance is, however, expected to decline over the
next few years. The projections indicate a need for external commitments
close to $1 billion each year over the 1981-85 period, compared to an annual
average of $420 million for 1976-80. About one-third of this borrowing is
expected to be on concessional terms, significantly below the ratio in recent
years. While bilateral and multilateral sources can be expected to provide
the bulk of external resources, Jordan is likely to resort increasingly to the
financial markets, and this would result in a hardening of loan terms. On
these assumptions, the debt service ratio as a percentage of exports of goods
and services is projected not to exceed 10 percent by 1985. Beyond the
current Plan period, sustaining the rise in debt and debt service at a prudent
rate would require a slowdown in both the rate of investment and growth,
particularly if foreign grants are gradually phased out. Given its record of
prudent management, Jordan remains creditworthy for Bank lending.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS 1/
17.      Jordan has received seven Bank loans totalling $150 million and
fifteen IDA credits totalling $86.1 million (net of cancellations) of which
twelve have been fully disbursed. Project implementation and disbursement
performance are generally satisfactory. As of December 31, 1981,
disbursements amounted to 83 percent of appraisal estimates. The difference
is essentially due to problems encountered with local contractors and the
construction industry.  The Bank is helping to tackle these problems through
special technical assistance. The IDA credits have mainly financed physical
and social infrastructure projects, such as education, highways, water supply
and sewerage, power, irrigation and tourism. By mid-1978, Jordan had attained
a stage of economic development where it could be considered creditworthy for
Bank lending, and had reached a CNP per capita level that exceeded IDA
limits.  IDA lending was thus discontinued after March 1978.  IFC has made six
investments in Jordan with total commitments of $95.3 million.  Annex II
contains a summary statement of Bank loans and IDA credits, and IFC
investments as of March 31, 1982, and notes on the execution of ongoing
projects.
18.      Recent and proposed Bank Group assistance to Jordan has largely been
directed toward export-oriented projects for which the Bank Group has closely
cooperated with the Government in project preparation and in mobilizing large
external financial assistance. In addition, the Bank Group has been assisting
1/ Substantially unchanged from Part II of the President's Report for the
Fourth Education Loan which was distributed to the Executive Directors on
November 24, 1981.



-6-
the Government in implementing its social objectives of improving the incolih
and living standards of the rural and urban poor, as well as manpower training
as enunciated in the first Five-Year Plan (1976-80) and which is being given
an even greater emphasis in the second Five-Year Plan (1981-85).
19.      In line with these objectives, the Bank Group has provided technical
assistance for developing and implementing a plan for expanding phosphate rock
production, and preparing a comprehensive program for a second phase of
development of the agricultural potential of the Jordan Valley and for water
supply based on the Maqarin Dam. An engineering credit was made in FY1975 to
help prepare a large project for potash production from the Dead Sea via solar
evaporation, for which a loan was approved by the Executive Directors in
September 1978; the project has been successfully completed. In addition,
further support for the Government's social objectives was provided in recent
years by loans for the Third and Fourth Education projects approved in
December 1979 and December 1981, the Cities and Villages Development Bank
(CVDB) project approved in March 1980, and the Urban Development project
approved in July 1980.
20.      The Government has requested assistance from the Bank to achieve the
second Plan objectives with respect to vocational and technical training.
Projects are being considered to this end for future years. Projects are also
under preparation in the water supply, industry, urban and agricultural
sectors for consideration in the next and subsequent fiscal years.
21.      At the end of 1980, the Bank Group's share in Jordan's total external
public debt was estimated at 8 percent, and its share in debt service was
2 percent. By 1985 the Bank Group's shares in debt outstanding and in debt
service are expected to be about 10 percent and 7 percent respectively.
PART III - THE ENERGY AND POWER SECTOR
A. ENERGY SECTOR
22.      Resources.  With limited indigenous energy resources, Jordan is
largely dependent on imported oil for its energy needs. The oil is imported
via off-take from the Trans-Arabian Pipeline and processed in the local
refinery at Zarqa. The use of imported oil as the primary energy source is
expected to continue in the foreseeable future. Nevertheless, some indigenous
resources have development potential and could alleviate, if their
exploitation proved to be economically feasible, the almost complete
dependence on imported energy. These are oil shale, tar sands, a small
hydropower potential, geothermal, and solar energy. Studies are currently
underway for the utilization of the estimated one billion tons of shale rocks
for either direct burning for power generation or oil extraction. No program
has been formulated yet for developing the tar sands. The hydropower
potential is confined to 2 MW at the King Talal Dam and 20 MW at the proposed
Maqarin Dam. The assessment of the geothermal potential is still incomplete.
While efforts to develop solar energy have attained initial success with
limited manufacturing of solar components, its usage is expected to be limited
to water heating. Efforts are also underway to revitalize oil and gas
exploration activities which had nearly been abandoned for lack of success.



-7-
23.      Consumption.  Energy consumption (per capita) during the last two
decades has increased on the average by about 6 percent per annum and is now
close to half the average energy consumption for middle income countries.
Output of petroleum products produced in the local refinery increased at an
average annual rate of 16 percent between 1975 and 1980, closely reflecting
the energy demand. Total consumption was about 2 million t.o.e. in 1980.
Fuel oil and gas oil/diesel are the largest consumption items, together
accouniting for half of the total energy consumption; the demand for these
products is growing at an annual rate of 20 percent and 16 percent
respectively, and by 1990 they are expected to account for about 150 percent of
the total energy consumption. Gasoline accounts for 14 percent of energy
consumption and its share is expected to decline to 10 percent within the next
decade. The overall demand for petroleum products in the 1980s is expected to
rise at an annual rate of 8 percent. This estimate is based on an expected
slow-down in the consumption of all products except fuel oil whiclh will remain
high due to power sector demand.
24.      Pricing Policy.  The prices of petroleum products are set by the
Government and revised periodically to reflect higher import costs. The
Governiment taxes gasoline, and LPG as well as the jet fuel sold to foreign
airlines; all other petroleum products are subsidized in various degrees. It
is estimated that the net total subsidy amounted to about $70 million in
1981. Following two increases in petroleum product prices in 1981 gas
oil/diesel is sold at about 70 percent of the border price and fuel oil, the
least subsidized product, is sold at about 90 percent of the border price.
The (weighted) average domestic price of petroleum products is at 95 percent
of the border price. The subsidy on gas oil/diesel mainly benefits commercial
road transport and that on fuel oil benefits industry and utilities. It is
the Government's intention to further reduce general subsidies. The
Government has constructed an input/output model to simulate price increases
and commissioned studies to determine the impact of price increases on the
principal sectors of the economy; methods of energy conservation are also
under study to determine the industries where retrofitting with energy saving
equipment would allow absorption of higher energy prices without significant
impact on output prices. These studies are expected to be completed within
two years and to lead to a review of the overall price policy. Meanwhile, the
Government and the Bank have established a dialogue on energy sector issues
and a joint review of these issues, including price policy, would take place
in December 1982. Similar reviews are expected to take place in the following
years.
25.      Institutional Framework.  In 1977, the Government set upo the National
Energy Council (NEC) consisting of the representatives of all the
organizations in the energy sector.  The council is responsible for
recommending energy sector policies for commissioning studies, and monitoring
their implementation. However, NEC lacks the staff and financial resources to
carry out its mandate effectively. The Government has taken steps in the
right direction with the establishment in late 1979 of the Energy Department
in the Ministry of Industry and Trade to assist in coordination of energy
related institutions and monitor the implementation of the resolutions of the
NEC. This Department needs to be strengthened if it is to meet the challenge



-8-
of planning and coordinating sector institutions, particularly with respect to
the development of indigenous resources. The development of domestic primary
resources is entrusted in the Natural Resources Authority (Mineral) and the
Jordan Valley Authority (Hydro). The production and delivery of secondary
energy is the responsibility of the Jordan Petroleum Refinery Company and the
power companies, namely the Jordan Electricity Authority (JEA), Jordanian
Electric Power Company (JEPCO) and Irbid District Electricity Company (IDECO)
(para. 30). Energy research is carried out by the Royal Scientific Society,
the Jordanian Atomic Energy Committee and the universities. Jordan does not
have a long term plan for the development of its energy sector and the five
year plans are essentially an aggregation of the plans of the individual
entities. The plethora of private and public organizations in the sector does
not provide a suitable framework for a better approach; duplication of
responsibilities as well as the thin spread of resources among institutions
are the principal weaknesses. The Government acknowledges the need for
streamlining the institutional framework, and better deploying human and
financial resources. Under the previous power loan (1986-JO) the Government
has agreed to formulate a plan, by June 30, 1982, for strengthening the
planning and management of the energy sector and improving the coordination
among energy related institutions. The Government reviewed with the Bank the
outline of this plan. The Bank recommended that further ground work should be
undertaken before the plan is finalized. This work, involving further
studies, is expected to take about one year. The Government would complete
the plan, including institutional arrangements for the sector, and review it
with the Bank by end June 1983 (Loan Agreement, Section 3.02).
B. POWER SUBSECTOR
26.      Power Consumption.  Jordan reached approximately 500 kWh per capita
electricity consumption in 1980. Total consumption increased by an average
annual rate just under 20 percent between 1975 and 1980. Households and small
commercial establishments represent 50 percent and industry 35 percent of
total consumption. They are the largest consumers and account for most of the
demand growth. In 1980, more than 60 percent of the population had access to
public electricity supply; the remaining inhabitants, mainly in remote rural
areas, would be connected to public supply as implementation of the national
electrification plan progresses (para. 28).
27.      Power Pricing Policy. The prevailing tariffs convey to consumers the
real cost of the resources used in meeting their demand. From a resource
allocation point of view, there is no significant distortion in power
pricing. Uniform rates are charged to low voltage consumers; however the
Government and JEA are considering to introduce increasing block rates which
would yield higher revenues. They have agreed to assess the potential gains
associated with the change and to review with the Bank the results of the
assessment by end 1982 (Project Agreement, Section 3.04).
28.      Planning and Development.  The principal subsector objectives of the
Government are to ensure adequate and least cost power supply for a growing
industry and to provide electricity to the unserved population. Planning is
generally satisfactory and load forecasts and investment programs are prepared



-9-
by JEA's planning department with the help of consultants. Electricity
generation is expected to almost quadruple by 1990, reflecting an amnual
growth rate of 12 percent. The consumption and generation forecasts are
reasonable in relation to the country's present stage of development. Apart
from generation, the investment plans reflect the development needs of the
transmission and distribution systems. The planned transmission network would
link Northern, Central and Southern regions and enable efficient power system
operation. Distribution systems are to be expanded both in urban and rural
areas. A national plan has been prepared for electrifying all villages by
1993 except small and isolated settlements amounting to 10 percent of about
1000 villages. It is estimated that by the mid 1980s about half of the
villages, encompassing most of the rural population, would receive electricity.
29.      Development Program Costs and Financing.  Development of the power
subsector is based on the investment plans of the three power companies, JEA,
JEPCO and IDECO.  Over the medium term JEA is expected to implement a program
of about: $540 million, JEPCO about $120 million and IDECO about $30 million.
The Government regularly reviews the investment needs for the programs and
assists in securing the required internal and external financing. The
subsector is expected to continue receiving official bilateral and
multilateral assistance as well as Government loans, and achieve substantial
internaL cash generation.
30.      Subsector Institutions.  The power subsector is controlled by the
Ministry of Industry and Trade. The General Electricity Law of 1976 defines
the principles and basic regulations for the power subsector including
procedures for tariff approvals and licensing of new power facilities.
Responsibility for electricity generation, transmission, and distribution is
divided mainly among the Jordan Electricity Authority, the Jordanian Electric
Power Company and the Irbid District Electricity Company. JEA, the
beneficiary of the proposed Loan, is a government-owned utility established in
1967 to coordinate the development of the country's power subsector, and is
entrusted with responsibility under the General Electricity Law for power
generation, transmission and distribution and for regulating power consumption
in the country (para. 37). JEA is also authorized to manufacture electrical
and other equipment needed by the power system. JEPCO distributes power in
the Amman area under the 1962 Concession Agreement which is valid for a
period of 50 years. In 1980, the ownership of JEPCO was distributed among
individuals (68 percent), municipalities, industrial enterprises, JEA, and
various; other institutions. IDECO, the third utility, generates and
distributes power in the City of Irbid, and extends distribution to some
surrournding villages and part of the Jordan Valley. It meets about 10 percent
of total power consumption in Jordan. JEA owns about 47 percent and the
Municipality of Irbid about 43 percent of IDECO, with private investors
holding the rest of the shares.
31.      Role of IDA/Bank.  The Bank Group operations in the subsector have
supported the development of a rapidly expanding and modern power system. The
objectives of these operations are the institutional development of power
companies, development of planning capabilities, the introduction of a tariff
structure based on marginal costs and the progressive interconnection of the



-10-
power system to provide reliable and economic power supply. The IDA/Bank
lending has also helped Jordan attract other external financing for the power
sector.
32.      The proposed loan would be the fifth Bank Group lending operation for
power in Jordan. The first IDA Credit (386-JO) of $10.2 million together with
a loan from the Kuwait Fund was used to finance new power generating
capacity. The second IDA Credit (570-JO) of $5.0 million cofinanced with the
Arab Fund also assisted in capacity increases, as well as a power sector
development study which provided the basis for the third and fourth power
projects. The first and second projects have been completed and are operating
satisfactorily. A project completion report and a project performance audit
report covering both projects have been circulated to the Executive Directors
on March 29, 1982 (SecM82-264). The reports conclude that, in fulfilling the
principal project objectives, the beneficiary (JEA) has exceeded the
expectations of the appraisal reports and that both institutional and
financial performance have been satisfactory. The reports recommend that the
Bank maintain its focus on JEA's degree of autonomy and its ability to retain
competent staff. The third project, assisted by a $15 million Bank loan
(1688-JO), aims at an expansion of JEA's transmission network and the
electrification of 39 villages in Central Jordan. Implementation has been on
schedule and without problems, and the project is nearing completion. The
fourth project, assisted by a $25 million Bank loan (1986-JO) and a loan from
the Kuwait Fund, is designed to improve transmission and distribution in urban
and rural (50 villages) areas. Implementation by JEA and JEPCO has started
and procurement is proceeding satisfactorily. The proposed fifth project
would further contribute to institutional objectives and needs of JEA
identified under previous operations, in particular its ability to attract and
retain qualified staff and certain aspects of financial autonomy. In addition
it would strengthen the dialogue with the country in energy planning, demand
management, and fuel pricing policies.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
33.      Background.  The proposed project was prepared by Jordan Electricity
Authority (JEA) with the assistance of consultants and the Bank. It was
identified in 1979, prepared during 1980-1981 and appraised in September,
1981. Negotiations were held in Washington, D.C. during April 5 - 8, 1982.
The Jordanian delegation was led by Dr. Hanna Odeh, President of the National
Planning Council and included officials from JEA and the Council. A Staff
Appraisal Report entitled "Jordan - Fifth Power Project" dated April 14, 1982,
(No. 3683-JO) is being distributed separately to the Executive Directors. The
main features of the Loan and Project are given in the Loan and Project
Summary at the beginning of this Report and in Annex III.
34.      Project Objectives.  The main objective of the proposed project is to
meet the growing power demand at least cost to the economy. In meeting this
objective, the project would also help improve power supply services,
accelerate regional electrification, strengthen JEA and enhance planning and
coordination in the energy sector.



-11-
35.      Project Description.  The proposed project, a part of JEA's 1982-1986
power system development program, includes: (i) a seawater-cooled steam power
station at Aqaba (see map) with its first stage to be commissioned in 1986
consisting of two 130-MW oil-fueled generating units and accessories; (ii) a
400-kV transmission line from Aqaba to Amman, about 320-km long, to be
initially, operated at 132-kV; and (iii) consultants' services for detailed
engineering, procurement, supervision of erection and initial operation of
plant. I]n designing the project, the consultants have paid particular
attention to the selection of fuel and recommended heavy distillate fuel oil
(a necessary by-product of diesel and gasoline production at the Zarqa
refinery) for reasons of availability and cost.  Furthermore, the timetable
based on expected power demand requires operation of the Aqaba power station
in early 1986 and precludes development by that date of infrastructure for
coal supply with its attendant problems of long term contracts with remote
suppliers, of unloading, storage and handling of coal, ash and scrubber sludge
disposal, and pollution abatement requirements to protect the water and air
quality in the area. Adequate arrangements have been planned to secure fuel
supply to project facilities. The Government has approved the feasibility
study for a pipeline between Aqaba and the Zarqa refinery to serve the
industries in central and southern Jordan and to establish an alternative
supply route for the refinery. In addition, this pipeline would provide fuel
to the power plant through an offtake arrangement.  The Government has agreed
to complete the pipeline by March 1986 (Loan Agreement, Section 3.03). As a
standby supply source, JEA would make arrangements by end 1983 to use the
Aqaba fuel oil unloading facilities (Project Agreement, Section 3.05).
36.      Implementation.  Jordan Electricity Authority (JEA) would be
responsible for implementing the Project and would use consultant services to
handle the engineering, supervision, quality control, and inspection and
testing of works and equipment. JEA's generation and transmission departments
are properly staffed and are experienced in this kind of work as evident from
the implementation of previous Bank projects. The Project would be!
implemented during 1982-1986; no problems are expected in acquiring sites and
right-of--way for the Project facilities.
37.      The Beneficiary.  JEA, the beneficiary of the proposed loan is
governe(d by a board of eight directors appointed by the Government, with the
Minister of Industry and Trade as the Chairman of the Board. JEA is well
organized and properly managed and has already proven its competence in
carrying out its responsibilities. The Authority has a total staff of
about 1400 of whom about 800 are technical staff and over 100 are graduate
engineers. All managerial staff have several years of experience in power
operations in Jordan and abroad. JEA's salaries for the technical staff are
appropriate with respect to Jordanian comparators. JEA's financial and
accounting department, however, needs better staffing. By end March 1983 JEA
would adopt appropriate measures to strengthen its financial and accounting
department (Project Agreement, Section 3.06 (b)). JEA pays due attention to
the training of its staff. Under the Third Power Project (Loan 1688-JO), JEA
has prepared a detailed and satisfactory staff training program covering all
its training needs. This program, to be implemented by end 1983, will enable
JEA to improve its technical, financial and administrative services.



-12-
38.      JEA's financial position is satisfactory.  Its debt/equity ratio cf
41/59 for 1979 and 1980, and 49/51 for 1981 reflects a good equity base. Its
debt service coverage ratio has been 2.1 in 1979 and above 2.5 in 1980 and
1981. The current ratio has been 3.7 in 1979, 3.9 in 1980 and 3.4 in 1981
reflecting a comfortable liquidity position. Internal cash generation during
1979-81 was satisfactory and on average covered 28 percent of the construction
expenditures. The rate of return on assets reached the covenanted level in
1980.    Under the previous power loan (1986-JO) the financial covenant was
changed into a cash generation requirement. Under that loan JEA was required
to achieve annual cash generation levels of at least 25 percent during the
yeirs 1981 - 1983 and 35 percent thereafter. Prompt tariff adjustments to
pass on fuel price increases to consumers is important to JEA for maintaining
a sound financial position. As required under Loan 1688-JO, JEA introduced
revised tariffs on February 6, 1980. The new tariff structure included an
automatic fuel adjustment clause. However, in view of the already high tariff
level and the substantial increase in 1980, the Government decided not to let
JEA pass on to the consumers the large fuel price increases (amounting to
66 percent) of 1981. It compensated JEA for part of the additional fuel
expenses. With this compensation JEA achieved the covenanted cash generation
in 1981; without such compensation its cash generation would have been reduced
by half. For 1982, the Government would reimburse JEA for the cost of street
lighting (hitherto provided free) and rural electrification (hitherto provided
below cost). With these revenues JEA is expected to achieve its cash
generation objective without a tariff increase. To ensure that electricity
tariffs are maintained at levels that convey to consumers the proper signals
and to enable JEA to adjust its tariffs under the prevailing guidelines, the
Government has agreed to charge JEA the domestic price of fuel oil (Loan
Agreement, Section, 4.02) and to authorize it to adjust its tariffs to recover
further fuel cost increases from consumers (Loan Agreement, Section 4.03).
JEA has agreed to take the measures needed to achieve the cash generation
levels mentioned above and would maintain a debt service coverage of at least
1.5 (Project Agreement, Sections 4.03 and 4.05). By end 1982 the Bank and JEA
would review the tariff and other measures required to enable JEA to meet its
financial objectives (Project Agreement, Section 3.04 (b)). The Government
would implement the tariff and other measures thus agreed (Loan Agreement,
Section 3.04 (a)). Projections for JEA's yearly cash generation are given in
paragraph 40 below. JEA is expected to maintain sound ratios and debt service
coverage in the future. Financial planning is carried out by the planning
department which is not adequately staffed. As agreed under the previous
loans, JEA has made progress towards strengthening its planning department
through better staffing and training abroad. However, further improvements in
planning activities, in particular better coordination with the financial
department, would be required. Also, the planning department still needs at
least one qualified accountant/financial analyst with experience in long term
financial planning. Furthermore, JEA would take appropriate measures by end
1982 to further improve its financial planning (Project Agreement, Section
3.06 (a)).
39.      Accounts and Audit.  The accounts of JEA are audited annually by
auditors appointed by the Board in accordance with the General Electricity
Law. As covenanted under previous loans, JEA submits its audited financial



-13-
statemenits anu Lhe audit reports for a fiscal year within four months of the
close of the year. The auditing arrangements are satisfactory.
40.      Investment Program and Financing Arrangements.  JEA's investment
program for 1982-87 will require about $540 million financing; 48 percent of
this is expected to be financed from internal sources, and 52 percent from
borrowings. The borrowings would consist of: (i) the loans already
committed - 8 percent; (ii) the proposed Bank loan for the Project and the
loans expected from cofinanciers - 41 percent; and (iii) the future loans for
other projects - 3 percent.  The sources of financing for the program have
been substantially identified. JEA would generate internally about 27 percent
of construction funding requirements in 1982, 25 percent in 1983, 35 percent
in 1984, and higher portions thereafter. The planned investments would cover
almost aLl the additional power generation and transmission requiremnents up to
1990.
41.      Project Cost and Financing Plan.  The project cost (excluding
interest during construction) is estimated at about $324 million wilth a
foreign exchange component of about $258 million. Cost estimates exclude
import duties and taxes as JEA is exempt from these. Physical contingencies
have been estimated at about 8 percent for civil works and 5 percent for
equipment and materials. Price contingencies are about 23 percent of the base
cost increased by physical contingencies. Price contingencies have been
calculated at the annual rates of 8.7 percent in 1982, 7.7 percent during
1983-1985 and 6.5 percent in 1986. A breakdown of cost by principal
components is provided in the Loan and Project Summary. The cost of
consultants' services (930 man-months) is estimated at $11,500 per man-month
including fees, overhead and other expenses.
42.      JEA would contribute about $82 million equivalent to the project
financing plan out of its own cash generation. Of this about $15 nmillion
would finance foreign exchange expenditures. The proposed Bank loan of
$35 million would be made to the Government, which coordinates all foreign
financirng for public sector projects, on standard Bank terms applicable to
Jordan: 17 years repayment period, including a 4 year grace period. The
Government would onlend the Bank loan to JEA under a subsidiary loan agreement
with the same repayment period and interest rate as the proposed loan.
However, it would grant a five year grace period to cover the estimnated
construction period. The onlending rate would be positive in real terms. JEA
would bear the foreign exchange risk on the loan. The Bank loan would cover
14 percent of the foreign exchange cost and 11 percent of total cost. The
remainder of the project cost would be cofinanced by multilateral agencies
($39 million), official bilateral assistance ($76 million) and, exlport
development and commercial credits ($92 million). The breakdown of
co-financing by source is given in the Loan and Project Summary. As
conditions of loan effectiveness, the subsidiary loan agreement between the
Government and JEA would be executed, and loan agreements between the
Government and other co-financiers providing at least $85 million in foreign
exchange financing would be signed and final commitment for an additional
$30 million would be obtained (Loan Agreement, Section 6.01).



-14-
43.      Procurement and Disbursement.  The proceeds from the Bank loan, to be
disbursed over the period 1982-1987, would finance 50 percent of total
expenditures (corresponding to 69 percent of the foreign exchange cost) for
civil works for the power station to be procured through international
competitive bidding. JEA would finance the remaining costs of this
component. JEA has arranged suitable bid packages to ensure effective
international competition. Other than civil works, the packages for the power
station would be boiler island, turbine/ generator island and switchyard
island; tenders on these packages have been called under international
competitive bidding. The packages for the transmission line would be
conductors, insulators, towers, fittings and erection also to be procured
under international competitive bidding. Local participation is expected only
in construction and erection works. The loan closing date would be December
31, 1987.
44.      Benefits and Risks.  At this important stage of its economic
development, Jordan must meet the power demand of its burgeoning industrial
sector as well as the domestic demand associated with improving standards of
living. The principal benefit of the proposed project, which is expected to
meet power demand up to 1992, would accrue to the industry and to the hitherto
unserved population. The internal economic rate of return on investment is
estimated to be at least 10.4 percent based on measurable benefits and costs
over the life of the Project. Although this return is comparable to the
opportunity cost of capital (about 10 percent), it nevertheless understates
the real return on the project since the prices of fuel have been escalated by
3 percent per annum to reflect the Bank's projections (currently under
revision) of the expected change in the real price of imported oil, while the
revenues associated with the Project have been expressed in 1981 prices. If
the fuel prices are also expressed in 1981 prices, the return on investment
would increase to 13.2 percent. Under each assumption, the rate of return
reflects the adequacy of the prevailing tariffs in conveying to consumers the
cost incurred in meeting their demand for electricity. The rate of return
does not take account of the nonquantifiable benefits of the project.  The
project is an integral part of the least cost program for the power subsector
development prepared by JEA and consultants and reviewed by the Bank. The
need for additional capacity to be provided by the project was determined by
demand forecasts and the configuration of the existing system. Two
alternative fuels for power generation were examined in detail: fuel oil and
coal. The fuel oil alternative was found to be the least cost alternative.
The project faces no special risks. Geological soil investigations of the
station site for load bearing structures on land and on the offshore reef for
the intake and discharge structure have shown satisfactory results. No
significant seismic or other related problems are evident at the site.
45.      The project impact on environment has been studied by consultants
using United States air quality and emission limitation standards. It has
been found that even without emission controls discharge concentrations in
sensitive areas would be at acceptable levels. Therefore, emission control
equipment would not be required. Thermal impact of the project was found to
be safe for the protection of the coral reef in Aqaba. In view of the above,
the power station is not expected to create environmental problems. The



-15-
transmission line will cross desert and mountain areas with few inhabitants
and little agriculture and is not expected to create environmental problems.
JEA is paying due attention to the aesthetic aspects of the transmission line.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
46.      The draft Loan Agreement between the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and
the Bank, the draft Project Agreement between the Bank and the Jordan
Electricity Authority (JEA) and the Report of the Committee provided for in
Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank are
being distributed separately. Special conditions of the project are listed in
Section III of Annex III. The execution of a subsidiary loan agreement
between the Government and JEA, the signing of co-financing loan agreements
for an amount not less than $85 million between the Government and other
co-financiers and securing of final commitments on loans of about $30 million
would be special conditions of effectiveness (Loan Agreement, Section 6.01).
47.      I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
48.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

archaeological preservation works at Jerash, and technical assistance.
Schematic plans and cost estimates for the Petra Entrance Facilities,
including staff housing are under preparation. Procurement of equipment is
proceeding on schedule and bids for the Bedouin resettlement housing have been
reviewed by the Association and implementation is underway by the Jordan
Housing Corporation. The civil works contract has been awarded and
archaeological work on both sites is proceeding satisfactorily with assistance
from UNESCO. Construction activity is behind schedule due to poor weather and
slow implementation by the contractor, to the discovery of several tombs at
Jerash, and to the necessity for deeper excavations than originally
anticipated at Petra. Extension of the closing date is under consideration.
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution and, in particular, to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense and with the understanding that
they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and
weaknesses in project execution.

Cr. No. 780: Third Amman Water Supply and Sewerage Project: US$14.0 Million
Credit of May 19, 1978; Date of Effectiveness: October 17,
1978; Closing Date: June 30, 1982.
The project is part of the on-going 1978-81 program of the Amman
Water and Sewerage Authority (AWSA), to expand water supply and sewlerage
services in Amman, including those areas where the urban poor reside. The
project consists of the construction of approximately 207 km of water and 225
km of sewerage mains, laterals and house connections, a 4,000 m3 reservoir,
15,000 meters and related equipment, and training. The improved sewerage
services resulting from the project would help to improve sanitation
conditions in the city and protect groundwater resources in the Amman area
from pollution. Overall physical implementation of the project is proceeding
satisfactorily, with four of the five project contracts completed and the last
one expected to be finished in mid-1982. AWSA, with technical assistance from
USAID, has prepared a program for strengthening its financial activities.
Extension of the closing date is under consideration.
Loan 1617:    The Arab Potash Project; US$35 Million Loan of October 21, 1978;
Date of Effectiveness: May 30, 1979; Closing Date:
December 31, 1984.
The project is the largest industrial project ($428 million total
cost) ever undertaken in Jordan and is aimed at producing 1.2 million tons of
potash from Dead Sea brine via solar evaporation. The project consists of a
solar evaporation and brine transfer system, a harvesting system, a refinery,
infrastructure facilities and an associated township. The project was
inaugurated in March 1982 and plant start-up is on schedule. The loan is
fully disbursed except allocations for two letters of credit.
Loan 1688:    Third Power Project; US$15 Million Loan of May 4, 1979; Date of
Effectiveness: October 11, 1979; Closing Date: June 30, 1983.
The Third Power Project is an integral part of Jordan's 1979-82 Power
Development Program whose long range objective is to progressively
interconnect the Northern, Central and Southern regions of Jordan into an
economic and reliable national power system. Specifically, the project would
supply the power needs of the potash complex at Ghor Safi, the phosphate rock
mining works at El Hassa, the cement plant at Rashadiya and rural distribution
loads in Central Jordan. All contracts have been awarded, and physical
implementation of the project is proceeding in accordance with the agreed
Project Implementation Schedule. No significant problems have been observed
in the project's execution.

Loan 1781:    Third Education Project; US$19.0 Million Loan of January 21,
1980; Date of Effectiveness: March 12, 1980; Closing Date:
December 31, 1983.
The project is designed to assist the Government in training skilled
manpower required in implementing the economic development plan, improving the
quality of education and enhancing the Ministry of Education's management
capabilities. The project would expand technician and vocational training,
increase the supply of teachers, improve agricultural education, expand adult
education, upgrade school building maintenance and establish a computerized
management information system in the Ministry of Education. Construction has
started on five project schools and bids have been called on the remaining
three schools. A contract has been signed for the hardware and software for
the management information system. Procurement of furniture and equipment is
proceeding on schedule, as is the technical assistance program. Although
project implementation is proceeding satisfactorily, disbursements have lagged
behind appraisal estimates because of a delay in the start-up of a management
information system which was programmed as the first item to disburse under
the project. This problem has since been solved and disbursements are
expected to accelerate.
Loan 1826:    Cities and Villages Development Bank (CVDB) Project; US$10
Million Loan of September 8, 1980; Date of Effectiveness:
March 31, 1981; Closing Date: December 31, 1984.
The project would help establish CVDB as a development bank for
municipalities and villages, and provides a line of credit to finance eligible
subprojects over a two year period. It also includes a technical assistance
component to Ci) train CVDB staff; (ii) undertake a study of the ways and
means of increasing productive projects in local communities; and (iii)
provide an advisor to assist CVDB's management. CVDB has encountered problems
in staffing its appraisal department. This has delayed CVDB in appraising and
proposing subprojects for financing under the loan. The first subprojects
were recently received and approved. About 10 percent of the loan is thus
committed. Staffing problems and possible remedial measures are under
review. With further alleviation of these problems, project implementation
should accelerate.

Amman; (c) small business assistance and manpower training; (d) consultancy
services for project management, design and supervision and studies; and (e)
provision for maintenance services and purchase of equipment. There has been
good progress in acquisition of sites and staffing of the project executing
entity. Response to bids called in 1981 was unsatisfactory. The bidding was
recently repeated and bid evaluation is underway.
Loan 1986:    Fourth Power Project; US$25 Million Loan of June 22, 1981; Date
of Effectiveness: March 17, 1981; Closing Date:
December 31, 1985.

transmission lines; (b) construction of five existing substations, with a
total transformer capacity of 619 MVA; (c) extension of the urban distribution
network, including power supply to three low-cost housing developments; and
(d) electrification of about 20 villages around Amman and 30 villages in the
Central and Southern regions. Procurement has begun and is proceeding
satisfactorily.
Loan 20,68:    Fourth Education Project; US$25 Million Loan of January
20, 1982; Date of Effectiveness: Not yet effective; Closing
Date: December 31, 1987.

vocational secondary schools, one trade training center and one
nursing/paramedical training institute; (b) extension to an existing
polytechnic and conversion of two teacher training institutes to community
colleges; and (c) technical assistance for above schools and for development
of comprehensive secondary school curricula and programs. Architectural
designs, and action on effectiveness conditions are underway. Bids; for the
construction of the trade training center are being evaluated.
