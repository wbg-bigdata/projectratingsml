I. THE ENERGY AND PO'WER SECTOR
A.  Energy Sec:or
Energy Resources
1.01     Overview:  Jordan's presently known indigenous energy resources
consist of relatively large deposits of oil shale, some tar sands, a small
hydro potential, and a few geothermal sources of low surface temperatures. No
commercially exploitable coal, lignite, oil, or gas are known to exist.
Jordan's endowment of noncommercial and renewable energy, with the exception
of solar energy, is modest.
1.02     Oil Shale and Tar Sands:  Several oil shale deposits have been
discovered in Jordan. The largest deposit is about 1,200 million tons with an
oil content of about 115 million tons. As for the other deposits, their size
and geological characteristics are currently being determined. Recently, tar
sands were discovered; however, at this point: in time very little is known
about this new discovery.
1.03     Hydropower; The hydropower potential. is only about 22 MW (54 GWh
p.a.), of which 2 MW (4 GWh p.a.) could be developed at the existing King
Talal Dam on the River Zarqa, and the remaining 20 MW (50 GWh p.a.) would be
exploited when the multipurpose Maqarin Dam on the Yarmouk River is built.
1.04     Other Sources of Energy:  Geothermal resources are known to exist in
the form of hot springs near the Dead Sea wii:h surface temperatures ranging
between 450 and 630 centigrade. At present, the information on the
geophysical and geochemical characteristics of these springs is incomplete.
There are no immediate plans by the Government to undertake further
exploratory work to determine whether the geothermal resources could be used
for power generation. Jordan has a good solar regime averaging annually about
3,000 hours of sunshine. The Government is actively promoting the use of
solar energy for water heating by supporting research studies and
demonstration projects aimed at fostering the domestic production and
marketing of solar water heaters. Other sources of renewable energy such as
biomass and firewood are modest, and their contribution to the overall energy
needs of the rural population is almost insignificant.
Sector Organization
1.05     Several entities are involved in the operation and development of
Jordan's energy sector. The development of domestic sources of primary energy
is entrusted to the Natural Resources Authority (NRA) and the Jordan Valley
Authority (JVA). The production and delivery of secondary energy is the
responsibility of the Jordan Petroleum Refinery Company (JPRC), the Jordan
Electricity Authority (JEA), the Jordanian Electric Power Company (JEPCO), and



- 2 -
the Irbid District Electricity Company (IDECO). The planning and coordination
of the sector is shared among four bodies; the National Planning Council
(NPC), the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MIT), the Council of Ministers (CM)
and the Jordanian National Energy Committee (NEC). Energy research involves
the Royal Scientific Society (RSS), the Universities of Jordan and Yarmouk,
and the Jordanian Atomic Energy Committee (JAEC).
1.06     NRA, a Government agency headed by the Prime Minister, is responsible
for all exploration activities in Jordan. Exploration for oil and gas and the
assessment of potential uses of oil shale and tar sands are entrusted to NRA's
departments of energy and geology. The energy department undertakes oil
related geological surveys, negotiates concessional contracts for exploration
with foreign companies, and more recently, it has undertaken exploration
drilling for oil. The geology department is entrusted with the exploration
for all minerals other than those relating to oil and gas. JVA, an autonomous
public enterprise, is responsible for the development of the Jordan Valley
including the power components at the multipurpose dams of King Talal and
Maqarin, and the electrification of the villages in the Valley. However,
recently all responsibilities relating to the supply of electricity in the
Valley have been contracted to JEA.
1.07     JPRC, a private organization with 6% Government ownership, is
responsible for importing and refining oil, and distributing and marketing
petroleum products throughout Jordan. Its supply of crude oil is taken from
the Trans-Arabian pipeline (Tapline) which was constructed to transport Saudi
Arabian crude oil across Jordan into Lebanon for export.
1.08     JEA, a Government-owned utility established in 1967, is mainly
responsible for the regulation of the power subsector. These responsibilities
involve; the formulation of plans for the overall development of the power
subsector; the construction of generation and transmission facilities; the
generation and transmission of virtually all the publicly supplied
electricity; and the distribution of electricity in the areas under its
jurisdiction. JEPCO, a company owned by the public (77%), JEA (13%) and the
municipalities (10%), purchases power from JEA and distributes it in an area
of about 2,000 km2 covering the city of Amman and its environs. In 1980
JEPCO accounted for about 80% of total electricity sold in Jordan. IDECO, a
distribution utility owned by JEA (46.5%), private investors (11%), and some
municipalities of the Governorate of Irbid (42.5%), buys power from JEA for
distribution in the city of Irbid and the surrounding areas. IDECO's sales in
1980 were about 10% of the electricity sold in Jordan.
1.09     NPC is an autonomous Government agency, created in 1971 to formulate,
in collaboration with other agencies, long-term plans for the economic
development of Jordan. Recently, the NPC started paying greater attention to
the energy sector by undertaking several studies to assist the Government in
formulating plans for the optimal'use, development and pricing of Jordan's
energy resources (para 1.19). The council has filled an existing gap in the
institutional setting of Jordan's energy sector by taking the incentive in
commissioning and supervising studies relating to the development of energy.
However, since the council does not have the mandate to implement the
recommendations of these studies, its effectiveness as an energy planning
agency is hampered.



- 3 -
1.10     The department of energy in MIT, created in 1977, is responsible for
all energy matters including special studies and coordination of energy
development plans. The CM approves all plans relating to the development of
the economy, including energy, and the poLicies for the pricing of electricity
and petroleum products.
1.11     NEC was formed in 1977 to review all issues relating to the supply
and development of energy in Jordan and t'o make recommendations to the CM on
energy policy which are based on technical reports and studies prepared by the
energy department in MIT. NEC is composed of representatives from all the
agencies dealing with energy.
1.12     Solar energy research is entrusted to the RSS and the Universities of
Jordan and Yarmouk. RSS is at present involved in commercialization of
equipment to use solar energy for meeting the residential demand for hot
water. JAEC advises the Government on the use and development of atomic
energy.
1.13     The main feature of the organizational structure of Jordan's energy
sector is the duplication of responsibilities among the entities in the
sector.  Although several entities are prasently responsible for the
coordination of energy planning, to date, Jordan has no long-term plan for
energy that would provide an overall set of consistent national objectives.
The five-year plans are essentially an aggregation of the plans formulated
independently by enterprises and agencies (JEA, JPRC, NRA, etc.). The
responsibilities for managing, operating and developing the energy sector need
delineation, and the staffing of the entities entrusted with the formulation
and implementation of plans requires strengthening. This would involve the
streamlin;-g of the institutional structure of the energy sector and the
concentration of human and financial resources in an institution with a
definite mandate for developing the sector. In recognizing this need, the
1981-1985 plan calls for the creation of an energy planning agency. However,
before such an agency is created, the Government should undertake a detailed
review to outline its structure, responsibilities, staffing and budgetary
needs. The review should also identify the laws to be altered to consolidate
the desired responsibilities and expertise in the proposed agency and
eliminate the prevailing duplication of responsibilities and manpower. The
Government has agreed to review with the Bank, by not later than June 30,
1983, a plan for strengthening the planning and management of the energy
sector and for improving the coordination among the energy-related
institutions in Jordan.
Historical Trend in the Supply and Consumption of Energy
1.14     Per Capita Consumption of Energy;  Jordan's per capita consumption of
energy has increased at an average annual rate of about 5.6% between 1960 and
1979; from 197 kce in 1960 to 552 kce in 1979 (average for middle income
countries about 1,225 kce). In 1980, 64% of Jordan's population had access to
public supply of electricity. The per capita consumption of electricity in
1975 was about 202 kWh compared to 482 kWh for 1980. Thus, by 1980 Jordan had
achieved about the same level of per capita consumption of electricity as
Egypt had in 1979 or Portugal in 1952.  The increase in the consumption of



- 4 -
electricity has been largely due to the increased demand by industry, and
domestic and small commercial consumers which accounted respectively for 35%
and 50% of total sales in 1980.
1.15     Supply of Petroleum Products;  Jordan is totally dependent on
imported crude oil for its conventional energy requirements. Virtually all
the petroleum products consumed are produced domestically at the JPRC refinery
at Zarqa. The refinery started its operations in 1960 with a throughput
capacity of 1,000 t/day crude oil. The capacity has now reached 12,300 t/day
after three expansions in 1970, 1973 and 1981. Jordan's output of petroleum
products increased at an average annual rate of about 16% between 1975 and
1980 with the mix of products produced remaining relatively unchanged over
that period. In 1980, Jordan imported 1.9 million tons of crude oil and small
quantities of LPG and lubricants amounting to 13,000 tons and 5,000 tons
respectively. A summary of the energy balance for 1975, 1980, 1985 and 1990
is presented in Table 1.

1.16     Consumption of Petroleum Products;  The average annual rate of growth
in the consumption of petroleum products between 1975 and 1980 was about
16.8%, increasing from 876,000 to about 1.9 million tons. Jet fuel had the
highest growth rate (23.8%), followed by fuel oil (20.6%), LPG (17.5%), gas
oil/diesel (16%), gasoline (11.7%), and kerosene (6.3%). These relatively
high growth rates were mainly due to the increased demand for petroleum
products by the power subsector and the transportation sector. In 1980, gas
oil/diesel had the highest share (26.7%) of all the petroleum products



- 5 -
consumed, followed by fuel oil (24.6%), gasoline (14.2%), jet fuel (11.0%) and
LPG (2.9%). In 1980, transportation accounted for about 50% of the total
petroleum products consumed, industries for 15%, power generation for 17% and
households for 13%, leaving about 5% for all mi;cellaneous consumers.
1.17     Consumption of Electricity;  Total con;umption of electricity in
Jor(ian increased at an average annual rate of about 19.8% from 355.5 GWh in
1975 to about 877 GWh in 1980.  Non-coincident maximum demand increased at
about 17.4% p.a. from 87.8 MW in 1975 to 196 MW in 1980. Over the same
period, the most significant change in sales was the increased share of the
sales to domestic and small commiercial consumers, which increased from 37% of
total sales in 1975 to about 50% in 1980. The increased share of the low
voltage consumers is principally attributed to the extension of public
electricity service to the rural areas, and the overall higher consumption by
the residential consumers stimulated by the increased remittances from the
Gulf after 1973.
Forecast of Supply and Consumption of Energy
1.18     Future Consumption of Petroleum Products:  The forecast of the
consumption of petroleum products between 1980-1990 shows a slowdown in the
rate of growth of energy consumption compared to the period 1975-1980.
Overall consumption of energy is expected to increase at an average annual
rate of about 8.3% between 1980 and 1985 and 7.6% between 1985 and 1990.
Growth in demand for fuel oil is projected to remain high (14.1% over
1980-1985 and 10.7% over 1985-1990) due mainly to planned commissioning of new
power generation capacities (Aqaba Power Station). Consumption of all other
products is expected to grow more slowly than in the past, resulting in an
increased share of fuel oil in total demand from 27% in 1980 to 40% in 1990.
(Future consumption of electricity is presented in para. 1.35.)
Energy Pricing
1.19     Petroleum Products:  The prices of petroleum products are set by the
Government and revised periodically to reflect higher import costs. The
Government taxes motor gasoline, LPG and jet fuel sold to foreign airlines.
All other petroleum products are subsidized. The policy of subsidizing the
prices of petroleum products used by the transportation, agriculture and
industrial sectors is aimed at dampening the effects of the increasing prices
paid for imported crude oil from being reflected in the general price level.
The subsidy for kerosene, which is used by the residential consumers for
lighting, cooking, and water and space heating, stems from the Government's
desire to provide these fuels to the low-income consumers at reasonable prices.
1.20     Since 1973, when crude oil prices first rose significantly, the
burden on the national budget of the net subsidy for petroleum products
continued to increase because of the Government's reluctance to pass on to the
consumers the increases in the import bill for oil. By 1978, the subsidy for
petroleum products had reached JD 22 million (US$65.0 million). In 1979, the
Government decided to reduce the subsidy by gradually closing the gap between
the domestic and border prices. The domestic frices were since increased five
times; in March and July of 1979, February of 1980, and February and November



- 6 -
of 1981.  Since 1979, the imported price of oil has increased by about 150%
compared to increases in the prices of petroleum products that amounted to
103% for gasoline, 200% for gas oil and 400% for fuel oil. As a result, the
net subsidy for petroleum products in 1981 was about US$66.7 million which in
relative terms is not much higher than the level of the subsidy in 1978.
Table 2 below summarizes the domestic and border prices of petroleum products
after the last increase.

1.21     Ths  bS''i for gas oil/diesel accrues mainly to the owners of the
commercial transport vehicles transporting goods and materials within
Jordan and from the port of Aqaba to Lebanon, Iraq and Syria. The subsidy
for jet fuel benefits the national airline, while the subsidy for fuel oil
affects the industry and utilities such as JEA, the cement plant, the Zarqa
refinery, etc. These subsidies are implicitly passed on to the consumers
through the relatively lower prices paid for goods and services produced by
the transport, industrial and agriculture sectors. On the other hand, the
subsidy for kerosene accrues explicitly to the consumers who use it for
domestic purposes.
1.22     The subsidies for gas oil/diesel, fuel oil and jet fuel are not
justified on economic grounds. The optimal policy for pricing energy
resources would dictate that domestic prices be set at levels that reflect
their real cost to the economy. The Government is aware of the
shortcomings of its present pricing policy, but is concerned that by
closing the gap between the world and domestic prices for the subsidized
petroleum products, large increases in the general price level would be
triggered. Therefore, before eliminating the subsidy for these products,
the Government is constructing an input/output model to simulate the impact
of higher prices for energy on the various sectors of the economy including
the prices of intermediate and final products. An energy conservation
study by foreign consultants is also expected to start shortly with a view



- 7 -
to determining the industries where investment in more energy efficient
equipment and processes would enable these indlstries to absorb the higher
prices of energy without significantly altering the prices of their
output. In addition, the Government is initiating a third study, whose
terms of reference have been reviewed by the Bank, for optimally planning
and organizing the transportation sector (freight transport, air and sea
transport, highway and road network design, et-.). Among the tasks
outlined in the terms of reference for this stidy is the assessment of the
impact of eliminating the subsidies for gas oil/diesel and jet fuel on the
freight road transport subsector and the commercial aviation subsector.
The conservation and transportation studies ara expected to be completed
within two years. As an interim measure, however, and until the
recommendations of the studies are reviewed by the Government and the Bank,
an understanding has been reached that the Government will continue its
efforts in closing the gap between world and domestic prices for petroleum
products.
Electricity Pricing:
1.23     JEA sets its own tariffs for sales to bulk consumers (large
industries, JEPCO and IDECO) and the low voltage consumers in its
jurisdiction. In the areas served by JEPCO and IDECO, tariffs are
determined by each utility in consultation with JEA. However, the
introduction of new tariffs by JEA, JEPCO or IDECO require Government
approval.
1.24     Bulk Tariffs:  The bulk tariffs apply only to JEA's sales to the
large industrial consumers and the electricity distribution utilities
(JEPCO and IDECO). These are based on a time of day structure (peak and
off-peak) with no seasonal variation. They also differentiate between
consumers in the district of Irbid and those in the other districts. The
peak tariff involves a capacity charge of JD 2.41kW for all districts, and
an energy charge of 17.5 fils/kWh for Irbid and 18.5 fils/kWh for the other
districts. The off-peak tariff involves an erergy charge of 12.5 fils/kWh
for Irbid and 13.5 fils/kWh for the other districts. In January 1982, the
average economic cost of electricity (based on LRAIC) for bulk sales was
about 26.2 fils/kWh compared to an average revenue for sales to JEPCO,
IDECO and the large industrial consumers of about 26 fils/kWh.
1.25     Retail Tariffs:  The tariff structure for electricity sales to the
low voltage consumers is identical for all three utilities (JEA, IDECO and
JEPCO). It is based on a uniform block rate i-or each customer category
classified according to the end use of electr:-city (domestic, commercial,
small industries, water pumping, etc.).  However, the tariff level for each
category differs slightly among the three uti.ities (Annex 1.1) to reflect
tlhe cost incurred by each in providing electr:city service.  In January
1982, the average tariff for sale to the low voltage consumer was about
35.6 fils/kWh which was below the average economic cost of supply (based on
LRAIC) of about 37.6 fils/kWh.



- 8 -
1.26      Electricity tariffs were at levels that conveyed to consumers the
real cost of the resources used in meeting their electricity demand
(LRAIC). The tariff have been high enough to enable JEA to cover its costs
and provide 25% internal contribution towards the cost of its development
program between 1977 and 1980. However, following the increases in the
domestic prices of petroleum products, JEA's level of internal cash
generation deteriorated because of the Government's reluctance to allow the
utility to fully recover the increases in its fuel bill from the consumers
of electricity (para. 3.05). In order for JEA to maintain its internal
cash generation at the level agreed with the Bank, increases in the average
tariff level of 20% for 1983 and 13% in 1984 would be necessary
(para. 3.12).
1.27      The uniform block rates for the low voltage consumers are
inconsistent with the Government's policy of encouraging conservation and
restraining the growth of demand for energy.  There are indications that
the low voltage consumers' demand for electricity is relatively insensitive
to increasing tariffs primarily because the remittances from the Gulf and
Saudi Arabia which accrue principally to the households rather than the
Government. 1/ As a result, the household's demand for electricity is
determined by levels of disposable income that are higher than would
otherwise prevail. Therefore, by maintaining uniform block rates for sales
to the low voltage consumers, the Government is foregoing revenues which
the utilities could mobilize to finance their development program. In
addition, by introducing increasing block rates in the structure of
electricity tariffs, large domestic and small commercial consumers could be
induced to conserve in their use of electricity. The Government and JEA
have agreed to complete, by December 31, 1982, an assessment of the effects
on the resources mobilized by the power subsector of introducing increasing
block rates in the tariff structure '- electricity sales to the
low-voltage consumers, to review with the Bank, by December 31, 1982, the
recommendations emanating from that assessment, and to implement tariffs
and other measures thus determined.
B. Power Subsector
Beneficiary
1.28      The General Electricity Law provides that JEA should be both
financially and administratively independent. JEA has a board of eight
directors appointed by the Government, with the Minister of Industry and
Trade as the Chairman of the Board. JEA is well organized and properly
managed and has already proven its competence in carrying out its
responsibilities. Its present organization structure is based on the
1/ After increasing the tariffs by about 50% in 1980, the household
consumption of electricity dropped for two months and then resumed its
historically high rate of growth.

recommendations of the management consultants appointed under Credit
386-JO. Details of the organization are shown in Annex 1.2
(Chart WB 22339). All managerial staff have a university education and
several years of experience in power operations3 in Jordan and abroad.
1.29      The Authority has a total staff of 1,387 (September 1981) of which
115 are graduate engineers and 808 are other t'echnical staff . Although
JEiA's salaries for the technical staff are appropriate for Jordanian
circumstances, the salaries of the financial aid administrative staff need
to be reviewed (see para. 3.02). There is a continuous movement of
qualified technical staff to the Gulf countries, where salaries are much
higher, but the majority of the staff return tD Jordan after two-three
years abroad to join JEA or JEPCO, the major employers of the technical
staff with power utility experience. JEA pays due attention to the
training of its staff. Under the Third Power Project (Loan 1688-JO) JEA
prepared a detailed and satisfactory staff training program covering all
its training needs. This program, to be implemented by end-1983, will
enable JEA to improve its technical, financial and administrative services.
Historical Development of the Power Subsector
1.30      National power subsector statistical data for 1971-1980 and
details of JEPCO and IDECO data are shown in Annexes 1.3 and 1.4. From
1971 to 1980 total generation (including imports) increased from 230.4 GWh
to 1,070 GWh, while electricity consumption rose from 204 GWh to 877 GWh
(trend growth rate 19% p.a.). Electricity sales in 1980 are summarized
below by customer categories and administrative districts:

1/  Street lighting was provided free of charge at the Government's request.
1.31      Industrial consumption has been increasing rapidly in the last
several years.  The Government is trying to accelerate the development of the
relatively undeveloped Central and Southern regions of Jordan by locating
future industrial projects there and by electrifying towns and villages. The
total electricity losses are around 17% of generation because of still
underdeveloped transmission and distribution networks and small inefficient
generating units.



- 10 -
1.32     The public power system comprises at present three 33-MW steam units,
seven gas turbines and about twenty small diesel generating sets (details in
Annex 1.5). The national transmission network comprises 176 km of
transmission lines and eight transformer substations witb an installed
capacity of 550 MVA. Operation and maintenance of power plants and of the
network are satisfactory. JEA is responsible for power distribution in Aqaba,
Ma'an, Karak and part of the Jordan Valley and its distribution network
consists of 640 km of overhead lines and cables.
1.33     Only 138 of Jordan's 982 villages bave been electrified so far by
JEA, JEPCO and IDECO with funding from Government, foreign borrowings and the
Rural Electrification Fund established by the Government in 1980 for this
purpose. About 50% of the rural population has access to the public power
supply. The rural networks are well designed and constructed, and their
operation and maintenance are satisfactory. Villagers pay for services and
for electricity consumed by them.
Power System Planning
1.34     Power system planning in Jordan is, generally, satisfactory.  The
load forecasts and investment programs are prepared by JEA's planning
department with the help of consultants.  JEA still depends largely on
external consultants' services for its power system planning and analyses.
Under the Fourth Power Project (June 1981), JEA has agreed to take appropriate
actions to strengthen its planning department to further develop power
subsector planning capabilities and inform the Bank of the proposed actions.
Development Program
1.35     Load Forecast;  The national load forecast for 1981-1990 (Annex 1.6)
shows total electricity generation increasing from 1,064 GWh in 1981 to
2,881 GWh in 1987 and 3,812 GWh in 1990, with a growth rate of 12% p.a. The
power system is expected to be fully interconnected in 1984. The bigh rate of
load growth is mainly due to a rapid increase expected in JEA's direct sales
to large industries and otber consumers. Details of the interconnected
system's development are given in Annex 1.7. The maximum demand would
increase from 194 MW in 1981 to 574 MW in 1987 and 736 MW in 1990, and the
available generation capacity from 310 MW in 1981 to 697 MW in 1987 and
1,184 MW in 1990. Except in 1985 when the available capacity margin drops to
zero because of no addition of capacity in that year, the capacity margin is
reasonable. The system's load factor is expected to remain unchanged at about
57%. The forecast of sales by consumer categories is given in Annex 1.8. The
sale to large industries will increase from 12% of total JEA sales in 1981 to
30% in 1987 on account of the establishment of several large industries in
Central and Southern Jordan. The load forecast assumes a per capita
consumption of some 1,010 kWb in 1987. The forecast is reasonable in relation
to Jordan's present stage of development and its general economic prospects.
However, some of the new projected industrial loads (Annex 1.8) may be delayed
and deviations in respect of other consumers are also possible.  These
uncertainties are reasonably covered in the load forecast, which includes in
addition to the most probable forecast, botb low and higb forecasts.



- 11 -
1.36     Generation:  The Hussein steam power station near Amman is being
extended by three 66-MW units to be in commercial operation in 1982. When the
fourth 66-MW unit is commissioned in 1984, the final extension of this station
would be completed. The proposed Project with two 130-MW steam units would be
brought into service in 1986.
1.37     Transmission Network:  About 300 km of transmission lines and 284 MVA
in substation transformer capacities are unde: construction for completion by
1982. During 1983-87, about 500 km of transmission lines and substations with
a capacity of 699 MVA are planned to be const:ucted. The 132-kV transmission
line from Ma'an to Aqaba will complete the transmission link between the
Northern, Central and Southern regions to enable integrated operation of the
power system in Jordan. The Jordanian and Sy:ian power systems are connected
through a 66-kV transmission line and Jordan has been importing electricity
from Syria. A 230-kV line from Irbid to Damascus with a 100-MVA transformer
substation at Irbid has been constructed, whi-h would enable synchronous
operation of the two power systems. This interconnection would enable better
utilization of power system generating facilities in both countries through
coordinated operation and maintenance, and also improve reliability of power
supply by giving the Jordanian system access to the much larger generation
reserve of the Syrian power system. Reserve sharing would allow JEA to reduce
its generating capacity by about 50 MW. However, the interconnection has not
been brought into operation due to the current political situation. There are
no immediate plans for other interconnections between the Jordanian power
system and the neighboring systems.
1.38     Distribution;  JEA's distribution network expansion, to be
implemented in the period 1981-87, includes about 1,497 km of overhead lines
and 165 MVA in substation transformer capacity. In the same period, JEPCO
plans to construct 24 transformer substations with an installed capacity of
121 MVA and to install 74 km of cables and 36 km of overhead lines as well as
to reinforce the existing 33-kV network by adling 130 MVA in power transformer
capacity, 25.5 km of 33-kV cables and 9 km of 33-kV overhead lines. JEPCO
will also build about 350 new distribution substations in its concession
area. Furthermore, JEPCO has started reinforcing the Amman urban distribution
system by changing from 6.6 kV to 11 kV. Similarly, IDECO is also reinforcing
the distribution network in the city of Irbid. The distribution networks in
Jordan are designed by experienced foreign consultants and follow the Western
pattern and standards.
1.39     Rural Electrification:  JEA has prepared a national plan for
electrifying all villages except 100 small and isolated settlements (882 of
the total 982) in 1981-1993. At present, 284 villages with a total population
of 290,000 are being electrified, and when the work is completed, 422 villages
would be electrified or about 43% of the total number of villages having 91%
of the total rural population in Jordan. The remaining villages would be
electrified in three stages;
Stage                    Number of Villages                  Period
& Housing Schemes
1                              140                       1984-1986
2                              160                       1987-1990
3                              160                       1991-1993



- 12 -
With the completion of the third stage, almost all the rural population in
Jordan would have access to the public power supply. The Government plays
a very active role in rural electrification and assists in its financing by
arranging foreign loans. The Governments of Denmark, the UK, the USA and
the USSR have provided financial assistance for rural electrification in
Jordan. The Government has relent the foreign loans to JEPCO and IDECO
through JEA.
1.40     Development Program Costs:  JEA's total investment in 1982-1987,
excluding interest during construction, is estimated to be about JD 180
million (US$540 million) at late-1981 prices (Annex 1.9). The investment
program is reasonable in relation to the forecast demand to be met. In the
past, JEA had no major problems in securing financing for its investment
programs mainly from Government contributions and foreign borrowings. It
is expected that JEA would be able to finance internally about 48% of its
investment program. JEPCO's total investment program in 1982-1987 is
estimated to cost about JD 40 million (US$120 million), of which about 40%
is expected to be financed by internal cash generation, issue of shares and
customers' contributions. The Government has secured loans for JEPCO from
the European Investment Bank (JD 1.7 million), the USA (JD 2.7 million) and
the USSR (JD 1.06 million). Other foreign borrowings and local loans,
including Bank Loan 1986-JO, would complete the financing plan for JEPCO's
capital investment. IDECO's development program in 1982-1987 is estimated
to cost about JD 10 million (US$30 million). Its complete financing has
been arranged through self-financing and shares (33%), Government loans
(22%), and loans from the UK (JD 2.3 million) and the USSR
(JD 2.4 million). The Government regularly reviews the investment
requirements for the construction programs of power utilities and arranges
to secure the necessary financing from external and internal sources.
Role of IDA/Bank
1.41     The World Bank Group has made two credits and two loans to the
Government of Jordan for power development. IDA Credit 386-JO (1973) for
US$10.2 million together with an equal amount from the Kuwait Fund was used
to finance two 33-MW steam power units and one 13-MW gas turbine at the
Hussein power station. The power facilities have been completed and are
operating satisfactorily. IDA Credit 570-JO (1975) for US$5 million with
co-financing from the Arab Fund (US$13.4 million) was used to finance a
third 33-MW unit at the Hussein power station, reconditioning of the Marqa
diesel power station, and the Southern Jordan Power Development Study. The
third unit has been put into commercial operation and Marqa diesel station
reconditioned to reach 40-MW output. The combined project completion
report for the two credits (June 1981) states that the projects, in
fulfilling their roles, have exceeded the appraisal expectations and that
the Bank needs to maintain its focus on JEA's autonomy and ability to
retain competent professional staff. Loan 1688-JO of 1979 (US$15 million)
is being used to finance the transmission network and rural
electrification. This Project is nearing completion. Loan 1986-JO (US$25
million) was made in June 1981 for the Fourth Power Project comprising
parts of the network development programs of JEA and JEPCO to be
implemented in the period 1981-1984. This Project is progressing



- 13 -
satisfactorily. The Bank Group lending operations have been instrumental
in establishing JEA and in creating a modern power system in Jordan. These
operations have also played a catalytic role in attracting investments in
the power subsector by both Kuwait and Arab funds. The proposed fifth loan
would enable the Bank to continue and expand its efforts towards achieving
the institution-building objectives identified under the previous loans.
JEA needs to further improve its planning capabilities and strengthen its
staff training programs.
1.42      The Bank has assisted JEA and the Government in preparing the
Project in a manner that is financially and economically viable and would
attract financing from other institutions. Furthermore, the proposed
Project would enable the Bank to assist Jordan in connection with the
overall structural changes and improvements in the country's energy sector,
particularly in energy planning, demand management, fuel pricing policies,
strategy for development of indigenous energy resources and
institution-building aspects of the energy sector.
II. THE PROJECT
objectives
2.01      The primary objective of the physical facilities of the Project is
to meet the future power demand at least cost to the economy.  The
Project's further objectives are; the improvement of the quality of power
supply services; the acceleration of the country's regional
electrification; the continuation of the institution-building efforts to
develop JEA as a financially viable and technically efficient entity; and
the strengthening of energy sector planning ard coordination activities.
Description
2.02      The Project is a part of JEA's power system development program
for 1982-1986 and has the following components (details in Annex 2.1):
(i) a seawater cooled steam power statior, at Aqaba with its first
stage to be commissioned in 1986 consisting of two 130-MW
oil-fueled generating units and accessories;
(ii)  a 400-kV transmission line from Aqaba to Amman, about 320 km long,
to be initially operated at 132 kV; and
(iii)  consultant's services.
The Project is expected to be completed by December 31, 1986.
use of Alternative Fuels
2.03      The consultants (para. 2.06) have paid particular attention to the
selection of fuel(s) for all proposed stages cf the power station expansion
to an ultimate capacity of about 1,540 MW in two further stages of 640 MW

each and have recommended using heavy distillate fuel oil (a by-product of
diesel and gasoline production at the Zarqa refinery) for the initial
installation for reasons of availability and cost (although priced at
international levels for economic analyses). Development of the
infrastructure needed for an alternative coal supply was thoroughly
considered, together with its attendant problems of long term contracts
with remote suppliers, of unloading, storage and handling of coal, ash and
scrubber sludge disposal, and pollution abatement requirements to protect
the waters and air quality in the area.  The consultants have also studied
dual-fired generating units (both heavy fuel oil and coal capable) in the
first stage and possible future conversion to the use of coal. Their study
did not show economic advantages for these alternative solutions over the
heavy fuel oil fired units. However, the overall layout of the power
station is so designed as to enable the use of other fuels, particularly
coal, in the subsequent stages of expansion, if found appropriate.
Fuel Supply
2.04     Two fuel oil storage tanks would be constructed at the power
station to permit 60 days' continuous operation of the station at a 75%
capacity factor. The fuel oil would be delivered to the site via off-take
from a pipeline to be built between the Zarqa refinery and Aqaba. This
pipeline would be used for transferring refinery products to industrial
consumers in Central and Southern Jordan, and imported crude oil from Aqaba
back to the refinery. The power station would be the largest fuel oil
consumer to be supplied by the pipeline, both in the Aqaba area and along
the pipeline route. The pipeline feasibility study prepared by
Williams Bros. of the UK has been approved by the Government. Although not
a paz-_ of the Project, the pipeline needs to be brought into operation
before the power station is commissioned. The Government has agreed to
complete the pipeline between Zarqa and Aqaba not later than March 31, 1986.
2.05     JEA has started discussion with the Aqaba port authorities for the
possible utilization of fuel oil unloading facilities at their wharf for
unloading of heavy fuel oil by ocean-going tankers, as a stand-by fuel
supply arrangement in case of disruption of the supply through the
Zarqa-Aqaba pipeline. JEA has agreed to make, by December 31, 1983,
arrangements with the Government agency operating the Aqaba industrial port
facilities for the utilization of these facilities for the stand-by fuel
oil supply to the Aqaba power station.
Consultants' Services
2.06     JEA appointed Chas T. Main (USA) as consultants to prepare the
feasibility study and detailed designs of the Aqaba power station. JEA has
also participated actively in the preparation of the study and designs.
The document entitled "Aqaba Thermal Power Station (Feasibility Study and
Design Memorandum), Stage 1" demonstrates the Project's feasibility and its
economic justification. The study covers in detail the selection of
station fuel, unit sizes, steam systems and other major parameters to
ensure the most economic and reliable choices.



- 15 -
2.07     JEA has also appointed Preece, Cardew and Rider (PCR) of the UK as
consultants for the 400-kV Aqaba-Amman trarismission line. PCR has
recommended that JEA construct a 400-kV double circuit line (4 x 200mm2)
between Aqaba and Amman for completion in 1986 but to be operated initially
at 132 kV and to be upgraded to its rated voltage with the commissioning of
a third generating unit.
2.08     The consultants have prepared the basic design documents and have
started preparing the Project's bidding documents, which are planned to be
completed in early 1982. The consultants have also been actively involved
in all discussions with potential Project financiers. JEA needs
consultants' assistance in Project design, procurement, supervision of
construction and erection, inspection of works and equipment, and the
initial operation of the Project facilities. JEA has agreed to continue to
employ consultants, with qualifications, experience and conditions of
employment satisfactory to the Bank, for engineering services, procurement,
supervision of erection and initial operation of the Project.
Project Cost Estimate
2.09     The estimated cost of the Project, excluding interest during
construction, is JD 108.1 million (US$324.2 million equivalent), of which
JD 85.9 million (US$257.7 million) would be in foreign exchange based on
the exchange rate of JD 1 = US$3. Annex 2.2 shows in detail the estimated
costs of the Project, which are summarized as follows;

2.10     The base cost estimates are expressed in anticipated early-1982
prices.  These estimates were developed by the consultants on the basis of
current world and local prices and particularly the cost of the recently
signed contracts for similar works and equipment in Jordan and nearby
countries. The costs were reviewed by Bank staff and found appropriate. The
foreign costs quoted represent the total foreign exchange cost of works and
goods purchased both from abroad and locally and exclude import duties and
taxes since JEA is exempt from such duties and taxes. Physical contingencies
have been estimated at about 8% for civil works and 5% for equipment and
materials. These allowances are reasonable, considering the nature of the
Project and the advanced stage of its preparation. Price contingencies have



- 17 -
been calculated at the annual rates of 8.75% in 1982, 7.75% during 1983-85 and
6.50% in 1986, for both foreign and local costs, which are considered
reasonable for Jordan taking into account past and expected price increases
for goods and services. While a lump-sum contract has been agreed for the
power station engineering services, the contract for the transmission line
engineering services includes both physical and price contingencies. In
total, about 930 manmonths of consultants' services are required at an
estimated cost of US$11,500 per manmonth, including all expenses.

/1 JEA would provide funds in local currency and the Government would
allocate the equivalent foreign currencies.
2.12      Project financing arrangements are well advanced.  NPC has contacted
several international financing institutions to participate in Project
financing. At NPC's invitation, representatives of the Arab, Kuwait, Saudi,
OPEC and Iraqi funds, Islamic Bank, Kreditanstalt fUr Wiederaufbau (Germany),
the World Bank and the French, Italian, British and Japanese Governments held
two meetings in 1981 (the second meeting ia December), to review the Project
preparations and discuss its financing. A3out US$115 million financing is
expected from Arab sources and the OPEC Fund, of which US$64 million has been
already committed (Kuwait, Iraqi and Arab funds). The French, Italian,
British and German Governments have offered, in total, about US$80 million for
the Project financing in the form of export development and suppliers'
credits.



- 18 -
2.13     The proposed Bank loan of US$35 million would be made to the
Government, which coordinates all foreign financing for public sector projects
through NPC, for a term of 17 years, including 4 years' grace period. Under a
separate subsidiary loan agreement, the Government would onlend the Bank loan
to JEA for a term of 17 years with 5 years' grace, which corresponds to the
Project construction period, and cover all Project cost overruns. JEA would
bear the foreign exchange risk on the loan. The signing of loan agreements
with the co-financiers in the amount of at least US$85 million and final
commitments, in a form satisfactory to the Bank, for not less than
US$30 million (para. 2.12), and the execution of the subsidiary loan agreement
shall be conditions of loan effectiveness.
Implementation
2.14     JEA would be responsible for implementing the Project by contracts
and would use consultants' services to handle the engineering, supervision,
quality control, and inspection and testing of works and equipment. JEA's
generation and transmission departments are properly staffed and are
experienced in this kind of work as evident from the implementation of
previous Bank projects. The Project would be implemented during 1982-1986
according to the implementation schedules given in Annexes 2.3 and 2.4. The
site for the power station has been acquired and no specific problems are
expected in obtaining rights-of-way for the Project's transmission line.
Necessary preparations for Project implementation are already in hand.
Procurement
2.15     Procurement for works and goods to be financed by the proposed Bank
loan (other than consultants' services) would be through international
competititve bidding in accordance with the Bank Group Guidelines for
Procurement. Bidding documents for equipment and works are being prepared by
the consultants. JEA has grouped its procurement into the following contracts
to ensure effective international competition (for details, see Annexes 2.2
and 2.5):

- 19 -
International competitive bids for boiler, turbine/generator and switchyard
islands have been invited. Local participation is expected only in
construction and erection works.
Disbursements
2.16     The proceeds of the proposed loan would be disbursed to cover 50% of
the total costs of the civil works contract.  The expected disbursement
schedule (Annex 2.6) is based on the Project implementation schedule. In
general it follows the standard disbursement profile for Jordan. The loan
closing date would be December 31, 1987 to allow for payment of retention
money.
Environmental Aspects
2.17     The power station site is located in a wadi about 20 km south of
Aqaba, the nearest populated center. The wadi, which is bounded by rugged
sandstone mountains, is almost totally devoid of vegetation. The impact of
pollutants from the power station (stack ertissions, discharge of residuals,
thermal change in circulating water discharge to the Gulf of Aqaba and station
liquid wastes) on the environment has been carefully considered by the
consultants using the US Environmental Pro:ection Agency's Air Quality and
Emission Limitation Standards as a guide and assuming the use of heavy fuel
oil with an ash content of 0.01 to 0.1% andl a sulfur content of 3.7 to 4%.
One common chimney, 125 m high, would be p-ovided with two flues discharging
stack emissions into the atmosphere from the two boilers included in the
initial 260-MW installation. Peak ground Level concentrations of the station
emissions, both dust and sulfur dioxide, were determined, along with the
contributions of the adjoining fertilizer plant, for cases with and without
emission controls. It has been found that even without emission controls, the
maximum 24-hour concentrations of dust and sulfur dioxide in sensitive impact
areas, such as Project's housing areas and tourist beaches, would be up to
8jigr/m3 of the dust content (particulate matter) and 116pugr/m3 for sulfur
dioxide emissions. Therefore, the units in the 260-MW installation would not
utilize emission control equipment of any type. To reduce the amount of
chlorine residuals for controlling biofouling in the circulating water system,
a mechanical device has been included in the design of the condenser. The
effect of thermal impact on the coral reef in the Gulf of Aqaba has also been
thoroughly investigated by the consultants and it has been found that a
seawater temperature of 290C was allowable for the protection of the
particular coral reef in the Gulf. In view of the above, the power station is
not expected to cause any significant environmental problems. Necessary
trained personnel and equipment will be available at the power station to
observe and analyze all key pollutants, particularly the stack emissions and
the thermal impact on the marine life.
2.18     The Aqaba-Amman transmission line, which will cross desert and
mountainous areas with few permanent inhabitants and little agricultural
activity, will have no adverse effects on the environment. JEA is paying
appropriate attention to the aesthetic appearance of transmission facilities
and their compatibility with the environment. Possible adverse visual impact



- 20 -
will be reduced to a minimum by the careful selection of types of transmission
line towers, including an aesthetic tower design near the cities of Amman and
Aqaba, and by suitable routing of the transmission line.
Project Risks
2.19     No special project risks are expected.  Geological soil
investigations of the station site for load bearing structures on land and on
the offshore reef for the intake and discharge structure have shown
satisfactory results. No significant seismic and other related problems are
evident at the site. Based on historical records as well as the known
geological faulting in the Aqaba region, the power station structures are
designed for Zone 2 earthquake loading as defined in the USA's Uniform
Building Code.
III. FINANCE
Accounting
3.01     As required under Loan 1688-JO, JEA has implemented the accounting
system recommended by Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co., the consultants appointed
under the first IDA Credit of 1973. It has computerized its accounting work
and now prepares monthly profit and loss accounts, usually within 15 days
after the end of the month. The accounting department is equipped to handle
bookkeeping and other routine work, but not more sophisticated work such as
preparation of management reports. The existing staff need further training;
also, additional qualified accounting staff need to be recruited. With the
assistance of an accounting specialist provided by the Overseas Development
Association of the UK for one year to train JEA's accounting staff and to
improve JEPCO's and IDECO's accounting systems, JEA is now revising the format
of the monthly report to the management to include comparison of actuals with
budget, cash flow and balance sheets.
Staffing
3.02     Only about 10% of JEA's accounting staff are experienced accountants,
and most of them are working as section chiefs. Clerical staff have generally
only on-the-job training in JEA. JEA has not been able to significantly
improve the quality of the financial and accounting staff because of: (i)
dearth of qualified accountants/financial analysts in Jordan; and (ii)
inadequate salaries paid to such staff (see Annex 3.1 for a comparison of
salaries of engineers and accountants). During 1978-81, the average annual
turnover was 17.8% for accounting staff as against 10.3% for engineers
(Annex 3.2). Although JEA has been able to fill up the vacancies in the
accounting department, it has not been able to replace the qualified and
experienced accountants departing for the Gulf States with equally qualified
people. JEA has agreed to take appropriate remedial measures not later than
March 31, 1983, to strengthen its financial and accounting department.



- 21 -
Finiancial Planning
3.03     JEA's financial planning is the responsibility of the planning
department wbich does not include any qualified accountants/financial
analysts. Furtbermore, the planning activities are not adequately coordinated
between the financial and planning departments. JEA needs to strengthen its
planning department by adding to its planning staff at least one qualified
accountant/financial analyst with experience in long term financial planning.
JEA has agreed to take, not later than December 31, 1982, appropriate measures
to improve its financial planning activities.
Accounts Receivable
3.04     JEA's billing work is centralized except for some remote rural areas
where it is done locally. Its accounts receivable for electricity supply at
the end of 1980 came to about 7 weeks' billings; JEA expects to reduce it to
about 6 weeks, which is acceptable. JEA has adequate legal remedies to deal
witb defaulting customers including distribution entities, since the law
permits JEA to discontinue the supply of electricity to any defaulting
consumer, or to revoke the license of a distribution entity which is in breach
of its charter or of the law.
Fuel Price Adjustment
3.05     The Government introduced revised tariffs from February 6, 1980,
including an automatic fuel adjustment clause. Nevertheless, in view of the
already higb tariff level, the Government decided not to let JEA pass on to
the consumers the 50% fuel price increase of Eebruary 1981 and the further 11%
price increase of November 1981 but has provided JEA JD 3.1 million to
partially offset its additional expenses in 1981 from these price increases.
The Government has agreed to take all action required to enable JEA to
increase its electricity tariffs to reflect future increases in its fuel
cost. This would ensure that electricity tariffs are maintained at levels
that convey to consumers the proper signals about the economic cost of the
resources used in meeting their demand and enable JEA to adjust its tariffs
automatically under the Government guidelines.
Revenue Covenant
3.06     The first two Credits (1973 and 1975) and Loan 1688-JO of 1979
required JEA to earn a minimum 9% return on rEvalued assets.  The Bank,
bowever, agreed under Loan 1986-JO to the borrower's request to substitute for
the rate of return covenant a cash generation covenant having substantially
the same objective of adequate cost recovery and reasonable self-financing of
future investments. The new covenant requires JEA to achieve cash generation
levels of at least 25% in 1981, 1982 and 1983 and 35% in 1984 and thereafter,
computed on the average of the construction expenditures for the year in
question and the next preceding year. Also, the Government and JEA would
review at least three months before the end of eacb fiscal year the adequacy
of JEA's revenues to achieve, on the basis of a realistic forecast, the agreed
cash generation level for the following fiscal year. Based on this review,



- 22 -
the Government and JEA would determine the measures required to achieve the
agreed cash generation level, and consult with the Bank on these measures and
on the implementation schedule for the measures before the beginning of the
following fiscal year. The existing revenue covenant would be repeated in the
proposed loan. In addition JEA has agreed that after completion of the study
relating to the introduction of block rates, it will review with the Bank by
December 31, 1982, the tariff and other measures required for JEA to meet its
financial objectives (para. 1.27). Furthermore, the Government has agreed to
ensure that at all times JEA will be charged the domestic prices of fuel oil.
Until sucb time as the Government takes a decision on JEA's request for a
revision of tariffs to absorb the 1981 fuel price increases, it will
compensate JEA for the free street lighting and for the supplies to rural
consumers at less than JEA's economic cost of power provided under the
existing tariff structure.
Past Performance and Present Position
3.07     JEA's actual income statements, balance sheets, and funds statements
for the years 1978 through 1980, and the estimates for 1981 are given in
Annexes 3.3 through 3.5. JEA's net fixed assets have grown from a mere three
quarter million JD in 1975 to about JD 54 million in 1981. JEA has also
improved in efficiency of operation as evident from the improvement in the
ratio of kWh generated/employee from 420,000 in 1977 to 770,000 in 1981. It
achieved rates of return of 4.4% in 1978, 4.6% in 1979, 9.7% in 1980 and 8.6%
in 1981 on unrevalued assets. Internal cash generation during 1978-1980
averaged 27% of the construction requirements, which is satisfactory.l/
3.08     In 1981, JEA's net internal cash generation excluding the
comperasation for fuel price increases provided by the Government (para. 3.05)
was only 14.3% of the average construction requirements as against the
required 25%. However, with the JD 3.1 million compensation provided by the
Government to cover about 55% of JEA's additional expenses due to the two fuel
price increases in 1981 JEA's self-financing level was 27%.
3.09     JEA's financial condition has been satisfactory.  Its debt/equity
ratio of 44/56 for 1978, 41/59 for 1979 and 1980, and 49/51 for 1981 reflects
a good equity base. Its debt service coverage ratio has been 2.2 in 1978, 2.1
in 1979 and 2.6 in 1980 and 2.7 in 1981. The current ratio has been 2.0 in
1978, 3.7 in 1979, 3.9 in 1980 and 3.4 in 1981 reflecting a comfortable
liquidity position.
Financing Plan
3.10     The forecast sources and applications of funds statements of JEA for
the period 1982-1987, assuming necessary tariff increases to enable JEA to
reach the agreed levels of cash generation are given in Annex 3.5. A
summarized version is given below;
1/  Although in 1977 through 1979 JEA did not meet the 9% rate of return as
covenanted under the Third Power Project Agreement (1688-JO of 1979), its
net internal cash generation during this period was about 25% of the
construction requirements.  The Bank, therefore, accepted JE^A's financial
performance as meeting the intent of the covenant.

Future Financial Performance
3.11     JEA's ability to generate funds internally for expansion during
the years beginning with 1982 is dependent on a variety of factors such as
wages and salaries, fuel costs, efficiency of the use of electricity by
large industrial consumers, structure and level of tariffs, capitalization,
etc., many of which are outside JEA's control. The Government and JEA are
contemplating two specific measures to achieve operational economies in the
power subsector and to strengthen JEA's finances. JEA will review its
tariffs beyond 1982 with a view to restructuring tariffs. Another measure
envisaged by the Government is a study of the efficiency of use of
electricity by large industrial consumers such as cement, refineries and
new incoming industries including the possibility of co-generation so that
maximum economies in operation could be achieved.
3.12     The forecast income statements, balance sheets, and funds
statements for the years 1982-87 at current costs are given in Annexes 3.3
through 3.5 (assumptions relating to these are given in Annex 3.6).
Assuming that the Government would compensate JEA for supplies to certain
consumers (para. 3.08) at less than the economic cost under the existing
tariff structure, (i.e. free street lighting and rural supply at subsidized
prices) until such time a decision on tariff increase is taken and that it
would grant a tariff increase of about 20% not later than May 1, 1983 and
another increase of 13.0% from January 1984 to meet the revenue covenant
requirements, JEA would generate internally (including customer
contributions, etc.) 27% of its average construction requirements in 1982,
25% in 1983, 35% in 1984, 45% in 1985, 85% in 1986 and 107% in 1987. The
projected self-financing level is high in 1985, 1986 and 1987 because the
investments are not evenly distributed throughout 1982-1987. The
investments are highest in 1983 and 1984 because of coincident peak
investments in the Project, ongoing works, and the additional 66-MW unit at
the Hussein Power Station. Moreover, these investments would cover almost
all the additional power generation and transmission requirements up to
1990 (Annex 1.9). The net internal generation from all sources including
customer contributions, etc., (after meeting working capital needs) but
excluding amortization from relending operations would be about 44% of the
construction requirements in 1982-87, which is commendable. JEA's rate of
return on revalued assets would be 2.1% in 1982, 4.6% in 1983, 12.1% in
1984 and 13.4% in 1985, and would fall to 12.0% in 1986 and 8.7% in 1987
with the commissioning of the Project without full absorption of capacity.
The rates of return in 1982 (2.1%) and 1983 (4.6%) are low because of the
impact of the two fuel price increases in 1981 (50% in February and 11% in
November), which JEA has not been able to pass on to the consumers.
3.13     During the forecast period, JEA's debt/equity ratio of between
41/59 and 52/48 for its direct debt, and the ratio of between 42/58 and
55/45 for the total debt reflect an acceptable equity base.  During this
period, the current ratio would be between 1.1 and 3.1, which is
satisfactory.



- 25 -
Debt Service Coverage
3.14      Under the existing debt service covenant, JEA is required to
obtain the Bank's prior approval for any new 'Long-term borrowing unless the
net revenue for each year during the term of i:he debt (before depreciation
and interest) is at least equal to 1.5 times *:he projected debt service
requirement for such year on all its debt inc'Luding the debt to be
incurred. JEA's debt service coverage ratio (luring 1982-1987 is projected
to be between 2.0 and 2.8, which is satisfactory. The existing debt
service covenant in Loan 1986-JO would be repeated in the proposed loan.
Auditin
3.15     Under existing loans, JEA has agreed to submit its audited
financial statements and the audit reports fo:- a fiscal year within four
months of the close of the year. JEA has been in compliance with this
covenant. The accounts of JEA are audited annually by auditors appointed
by the Board in accordance with the General ELectricity Law.  Shair & Co.,
a local firm of chartered accountants, has been appointed by the Board for
this purpose.  The auditing arrangements are satisfactory.  The existing
covenant in Loan 1986-JO would be repeated in the proposed loan.
Insurance
3.16      JEA's purchases from abroad are insu::ed by the suppliers during
the construction period. Insurance coverage Eor its assets in operation is
provided through private local insurance companies to cover the usual
risks.  These insurance arrangements are acce table.  Also under the
existing loans, JEA has agreed to have qualified inspectors make annual
inspection of its boiler and generating equipmnent to comply witb sound
public utility practices.  These covenants would be repeated in the
proposed loan.
Jordanian Electric Power Company (JEPCO)
3.17     JEA and JEPCO are inter-dependent since about 70% of JEA's sales
are to JEPCO. Therefore, JEA's expansion plans have to be considered in
relation to those of JEPCO. For financing it;3 expansion, JEPCO has in the
past depended on its own internal cash generation, the proceeds from sale
of shares and loans onlent by JEA. However, since 1980 it has had access
to bilateral/international funds. Its borrowings during the last two years
include a US AID Loan of US$9 million, a Euro,ean Investment Bank Loan of
US$5.5 million and the Bank Loan (1986-JO of 1981) of US$20 million.
JEPCO's construction program for 1981-1985 is estimated to cost about
US$130 million, which is expected to be finan:ed through internal cash
generation (25%), borrowings (70%) and sale oE shares (5%).
3.18      JEPCO's past financial performance has been satisfactory.  During
1978-81, JEPCO had a sales growth of about 12't p.a. In this period its
pretax rate of return on assets valued at historical costs has been between
10.1% and 12.9% as compared to 4.6% to 9.7% a:hieved by JEA.  However, its



- 26 -
return after a 38.5% corporate tax has been between 5.0% and 7.6% and
average net internal cash generation, after debt service and dividend
payments, has been sufficient to meet about 32% of its construction
requirements. Its debt/equity ratio which has been between 22/78 and 29/71
during 1978-81 indicates a sound equity base, particularly since the assets
are being recorded at historical costs.
3.19     JEPCO's financial forecasts for 1982-85 indicate that its
financial position would be sound during this period provided that the
Government grants appropriate tariff increases as required under Loan
1986-JO to enable JEPCO to generate at least 25% of its construction
requirements in 1982 and 1983 and at least 35% in 1984 and thereafter.
IV. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
A. Load Forecast
4.01     A forecast of electricity sales for the period 1981-1995 was
prepared by the JEA (Annex 4.1). According to this forecast, demand for
power is expected to grow from 194 MW in 1981 to 1,145 MW in 1995. Demand
for energy, on the other hand, will reach 6,073 GWh in 1995 from its 1981
level of 1,064 GWh. The relatively high rate of growth in the overall
demand for electricity is primarily due to the expansion of existing load
centers and the addition of new industrial loads. The household demand for
electricity, which accounts for about a third of the total consumption, is
expected to continue its high growth rate, since it is largely a function
of the level of income, a large portion of which is determined by the
inflow of remittances from the Gulf countries. The fact that the
substantial tariff increases of 1980 led to only a very temporary drop in
the household consumption of electricity supports the view that higher
prices would be absorbed by the consumers. Introduction of increasing
block rates (see para. 1.27), however, could help restrain the growth of
demand in this sector.
B. The Least Cost Alternative
4.02     The Project is an integral part of the least cost program for the
development of the power subsector in Jordan. The program was formulated
by consultants and JEA. It was reviewed by the Bank and found to be
satisfactory. The need for the additional capacity to be provided by the
Project was dictated by the forecast demand for electricity and the
configuration of the existing system. Another critical issue was the
choice of the fuel to be used. Two alternative fuels were examined in
detail: fuel oil and coal. The fuel oil alternative was found to be the
least cost alternative because coal would require the construction of
receiving and handling facilities in an extremely congested port (Aqaba)
which would have delayed the commissioning of the power plant by about two
years. This would have necessitated the installation of gas turbines to



- 27 -
maintain adequate reserve and meet the growth in industrial demand for
electricity until the Project is commissioned. However, the operation of
the first phase by burning fuel oil does not preclude the use of coal in
subsequent stages, if such use is justified oa both technical and economic
grounds (para. 2.03).
C. Return on Investment
4.03     The return on the investment is 10.4Z based on the measurable
benefits and cost associated with the Project and defined over its expected
life (for details, see Annex 4.2). The measurable costs include the
capital cost of the Project (para. 2.09), the economic cost per kWh
distributed, the fuel cost, and the operation and maintenance cost. Since
the Project includes the cost of the 400-kV Aqaba-Amman transmission link,
this cost was taken as a proxy for the economic cost of transmission. The
measurable benefits include; the incremental revenue associated with the
Project based on the prevailing average tariff of 35 fils/kWh (USc10.5/kWh)
which is taken as a proxy for the consumers' willingness to pay, and the
net savings in fuel attributable to the displacement by the Project of the
output that would otherwise be produced by existing higher cost plants.
Both costs and benefits are expressed in end-1981 prices except for fuel
wbose price is escalated by 3% p.a. between 1981 and 1990 to accommodate
the expected increase in the real price of imported oil. Furthermore, only
the fuel prices and the foreign cost component of the capital cost of the
Project are expressed in their equivalent border prices. Other costs and
benefits are expressed in terms of their domestic prices because conversion
factors for expressing domestic prices in their equivalent border values
are not available.
4.04     Although the return on the investment in the Project compares
favorably with the opportunity cost of capital (about 10%), it nevertbeless
understates the real return on the Project since it was obtained under the
assumption that fuel prices would increase in real terms 3% p.a. while the
average tariff was assumed to remain unchanged. If the 1981 fuel prices
are used, the return on investment increases to 13.2%. Under either
assumption, the rate of return supports the statement made earlier about
the adequacy of the prevailing tariffs in conveying to consumers the cost
incurred in meeting their demand for electricity (para. 1.26).
V. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RESCOMMENDATIONS
5.01     The Government has agreed;
(a) to review witb the Bank, by not later than June 30, 1983, a
plan for strengthening the planning and management of the
energy sector and for improving the coordination among the
energy-related institutions in Jordan (para. 1.13);



- 28 -
(b)  to complete the pipeline between Zarqa and Aqaba not later
than March 31, 1986 (para. 2.04);
(c)  to take all actions required to enable JEA to increase its
electricity tariffs so as to reflect future increases in its
fuel cost (para. 3.05); and
(d)  to continue to ensure at all times that JEA will be charged
the domestic price of fuel oil (para. 3.06).
5.02     The Government and JEA have agreed:
(a)  to complete, by December 31, 1982, an assessment of the
effects on the resources mobilized by the power subsector of
introducing increasing the block rates in the tariff
structure for electricity sales to the low-voltage consumers,
to review with the Bank, by December 31, 1982, the
recommendations emanating from that assessment, and to
implement tariffs and other measures thus determined
(para. 1.27); and
(b)  to the revenue covenant in Section 4.03 of the JEA Project
Agreement under Loan 1986-JO being repeated in the proposed
loan (3.06).
5.04     JEA has agreed;
(a)  to make, by December 31, 1983, arrangements with the
Government agency operating the Aqaba industrial port
facilities for the utilization of these facilities for the
stand-by fuel oil supply to the Aqaba power station
(para. 2.05);
(b)  to continue to employ consultants, with qualifications,
experience and conditions of employment satisfactory to the
Bank, for engineering services, procurement, supervision of
erection and initial operation of the Project (para. 2.08);
(c)  to take not later than March 31, 1983, appropriate measures
to strengthen its financial and accounting department
(para. 3.02);
(d)  to take, not later than December 31, 1982, appropriate
measures to improve its financial planning activities
(para. 3.03);
(e)  to the existing covenants in the JEA Project Agreement under
Loan 1986-JO relating to debt service coverage (para. 3.14),
auditing (para. 3.15) and insurance (para. 3.16) being
repeated in the proposed loan.



- 29 -
5.04     With the assurances listed above, the Project would provide a
suitable basis for a Bank loan of US$35 miLlion to the Government for a
period fo 17 years, including 4 years' of grace. Under a separate
subsidiary loan agreement, the Government would onlend the Bank Loan to JEA
for a term of 17 years with 5 years' grace and cover all Project cost
overruns (para. 2.13). JEA would bear the foreign exchange risk on the
loan.
5.05     The signing of the loan agreements with the co-financiers for the
amount of at least US$85 million and the final commitment, in the form
satisfactory to the Bank, for not less than US$30 million, and the
execution of the subsidiary loan agreement shall be conditions of loan
effectiveness (para. 2.13).

Description of Pro.ect
A.  Aqaba Power Station
Steam Generators
1.       The steam generators will be of the balanced draft type with
superheater, reheater and economiser sections. The boiler will be of
welded wall construction and will be top supported from the steel
structure. It will be of the outdoor type; furnished with regenerative air
heaters. Each steam generator will have an approximate superheater outlet
flow of 107 kg/s (850,000 lb/hr,) and steam temperature of 540.50C
(1005 F) plus or minus 5.50C (100F). The boiler minimum stable load
will be equal to 20% of the maximum continuous rating (MCR). The furnace
will be fully water-cooled and gas tight using welded wall panels. The
superheater and its control system will maintain the final steam
termperature from 40% to the MCR with a tolerance of +(-) 5.50C. One
stage of reheating will be provided. The boiler will be equipped with
burners suitable for firing heavy fuel oil and designed to limit nitrogen
oxide emissions.
Turbines
2.       Turbine will be a tandem compound, double flow, condensing
exhaust, single reheat, extraction type operating at 170kg/cm2 abs
pressure and main/reheat temperatures of 5380C/d380C (1000OF/
10000F). Seven stages of feedwater heating will be used: two high
pressure, four low pressure and one deaerating feedwater heater. Each
unit's guaranteed gross output at the generator terminals will be 130 MW at
the preceding conditions.
Condensers
3.       Each condenser will be of the single pass, single-shell, single
pressure type with the surface area of 6,5(10 m2 (70,000 ft2) and so
designed to create the lowest economically feasible turbine operating back
pressure (6.4 cm Hg). The condenser will be capable of continuous
operation with one half of the surface area out of service. Steam jet
ejectors will be used for initial evacuation of air and noncondensibles
from the main condenser.

Water Treatment
4.       The demineralizer system will process well water to provide the
high purity demineralized water required for make-up to the high pressure
steam generators.  The system includes the service vessels, piping
arrangements, regeneration equipment and auxiliary components.
Fuel Oil Systems
5.       The fuel oil system will provide all fuel oil service requirements
of the steam generators, utilizing heavy oil for primary fuel and oil No. 2
for ignition and start-up. The system will include on-site delivery,
storage, transfer, conditioning and control. Heavy fuel oil will be
delivered to the site by the pipeline from the Zarqa refinery and pumped
into two 40,380n3 storage tanks. These tanks will permit 60 days
continuous operation of the power station at 75% capacity factor. JEA
plans to utilize the fuel unloading facilities of the nearby Jordan
Fertilizer Industries plant as a stand-by fuel supply. The facility is
suitable for handling 1,000 tons of oil per hour.
Electrical Equipment
6.       The generator power system will consist of two generators, main
power transformers and interconnecting equipment to deliver the plant
output to the 132-kV switchgear. The generators will be 160 MVA, 15-kV,
50 Hz, 0.85 power factor, short circuit rati.o not less than 0.58. The main
power transformers will be three-phase, self/forced air cooled, 15/132-kV,
capable of delivering the generator rated output. The 132-kV switchyard
will be located near the power station and connected to the JEA
transmission network.
B. Transmission Line Aqaba-Amman
7.       In the absence of statutary regulations for the construction of
overhead lines in Jordan, the design of the transmission line is made in
accordance with generally accepted international practices. The
consultants study concluded that 4 x 200 mm2 bundle conductor at 400 kV
is the optimum arrangement. The line between Aqaba and Amman passes
through several areas where phosphates are mined and in other areas where
aggressive salts occur in the soil which could be carried into the air by
wind. To avoid bimetallic corrosion it is recommended to use an aluminum
alloy conductor, which would also perform satisfactory in the marine
atmosphere near Aqaba.  The earthwire material should also be aluminum
alloy to provide acceptable screening factor.  The line support will be
lattice steel towers of galvanized construction designed for a factor of
safety of 2.5 throughout.  Insulators should be of anti-fog type in the
coastal zone and open profile type in desert area.

Notes and Assumptions for Financial Forecasts
I. General
1.       All financial forecasts are given for the fiscal years of JEA
beginning January 1 and ending December 31. In addition to its power
utility operations, JEA is engaged in pole manufacturing, in relending of
the foreign loans to the distribution companies, JEPCO and IDECO, and in a
staff housing program. JEA's pole operations are designed to break even.
The earnings from the relending operations are not to be used for JEA's
operating expenses and will have to be transferred to its expansion
reserve. All non-electric operations, such as the relending and pole
manufacturing operations, are summarized and indicated as long-term
investments in the financial statements (Annex 3.3 through 3.5).
II. Income Statements
2.       Sales of Electricity are based on information furnished by JEA as
modified in the Bank. The forecasts assume annual kWh sales growth of
21.7% in 1981, 21.9% in 1982, 15.2% in 1983, 30.0% in 1984, 20.5% in 1985,
10.4% in 1986 and 11.8% in 1987 and annual maximum demand (MW) growth of
18.1% in 1981, 21.0% in 1982, 18.8% in 1983, 31.6% in 1984, 20.7% in 1985,
10.9% in 1986 and 10.1% in 1987.
3.       Average Revenue per kWh for 1981 is based on the average revenue
per kWh after the tariff increase from February 6, 1980.  The following
tariff increases to comply with the cash generation covenant 1/ under Loan
1986-JO of June 1981 are assumed; 20% not later than May 1, 1983, and 13.0%
in January 1984.
4.       Maintenance Charges are assumed to increase by the same
percentages as annual kWh generation of electricity.
5.       Other Operating Revenues are assumed to increase 10% per annum.
6.       Fuel and Lubricants are based on estimates of generation from
steam units and combustion turbines using fuel prices, specific fuel
consumption and plant mix as follows:
1/ It is assumed that the Government would provide JD 2.5 million in 1982
and JD 0.8 million in 1983 to compensate for the supply of electricity
free of charge for street lighting and at less than the economic cost
for the rural consumers.
