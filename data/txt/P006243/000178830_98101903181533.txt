INT BNATIONAL BANK FOR RECGNSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMNT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATICN OF THE PRESIDENT TO
THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON THE PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE FEDERATIVE REPUBLIC OF BRAZIL FOR A
TECHNICAL AND AGRICULTURAL EDUCATICN PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan in an amount in various currencies equivalent to $8.4 million to
the Federative Republic of Brazil.
PART I - HISTCRICAL
2.        The proposed loan would constitute the Bank's first investment
in the education sector of Brazil.
3.        During the past decade Brazil has made a major effort to improve
and expand its educational system. Between 1960 and 1968 - while the school
age population grew by about 27 percent - the number of students enrolled
grew by 59 percent at the primary level, by 127 percent at the secondary
level and by 107 percent at the university level. In the same period,
public expenditure on education almost doubled in real terms, increasing
from 2 percent to 3 percent of GNP.
4.        Although this level of educational expenditures is not low in
comparison with other countries having similar "per capital! incomes, there
is undoubtedly need for substantial improvement at the primary and second-
ary levels. Such improvement requires, not only financial resources, but
also reforms relating to curricula and better coordination as between the
Federal, State and Municipal Governments. Federal financing and authority
over primary and lower secondary education is limited, while the capacity,
financial and technical, of many state and local governments is inadequate.
5.        Supported by technical and financial assistance from the USAID,
Brazil has begun to reorganize middle level schooling to give it a more
vocational orientation and make it more suitable as terminal training for
the majority of students who are not expected to go on to higher education.
Both the USAID and the UNDP are assisting in the development of teacher
training for the secondary school level. Under a UNDP - assisted program,
thirty experts from six international agencies will help coordinate and
upgrade the work of the national, regional and state organizations involved
in human resource planning.
6.        Pending further progress in planning and control of the education
system as a whole, we consider that the Bank's assistance, to be effective,
should concentrate on particular levels of the system adninistered by the
Federal Government and on the education systems of selected states.



2-
7.        The present Project, for higher secondary and post-secondary
technical education, was appraised by two missions which visited Brazil
in February/March 1970 and in October 1970, respectively. Negotiations
for the proposed loan were held from February 18 to February 23, 1971.
Brazil was represented by Professors Oscar Machado da Silva and Edmar
de Oliveira Goncalves of the Ministry of Education and Culture and by
Mr. Jaime Alipio de Barros, General Counsel of the Ministry of Finance.
8.        The proposed loan would be the 31st Bank loan to Brazil.   It
would increase the total of Bank loans to Brazil to $916.4 million (net
of cancellations). The following is a summary statement of Bank loans
to Brazil as at February 28, 1971.

9.        The status of loan disbursements as well as of projects suit-
able for future Bank lending in Brazil was discussed in my Report and
Recommendation on the Loan for the Salto Osorio Project also being
distributed today. It also provided a table on IFC investments in
Brazil as of January 1, 1971.
PART II - DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED LOAN
10.  BORRWER:             Brazil.
AYIOUNT:             Equivalent in various currencies of $8.4 million.
PURPOSE:             To help finance:
(a) Construction and equipment for one new
upper secondary agricultural school and
extensions to seven others;



-3 -
(b)  Construction and equipment for extensions
to two upper secondary industrial schools;
(c)  Construction and equipment for five new
operational engineers centers and exten-
sions to one center;
(d) Consultants' fees, technical assistance
and salaries of designated Project Unit
officers.
AMORTIZATION:        In thirty years, including a ten-year period
of grace, through forty semi-annual install-
ments beginning August 15, 1981 and ending
February 15, 2001.
INTEREST RATE:       7 1/4 percent
CWMMIMENT CHARGE:    3/4 of 1 percent.
PART III - THE PROJECT
11.       An appraisal report entitled "Appraisal of a Technical and Agri-
cultural Education Project in Brazil" (PE-26a) is. attached.
12.       The Project is designed to increase the quality and output of
technical (agricultural and industrial) education at the secondary and
post-secondary levels. Lack of practically oriented technicians, es-
pecially those capable of assuming supervisory positions, has constituted
a serious bottleneck in the improvement of agricultural and industrial
productivity. Half of the project locations would be in the North, North-
east and other less developed areas of Brazil where shortages of middle-
level technicians are particularly acute. The Project would provide for
technical assistance,including specialists' services,for a survey of the
educational systems of the States of Ceara and Pernambuco in the North-
east of Brazil. This survey could result in the identification of projects
suitable for further Bank lending.
13.       Total project cost is estimated at $21.0 million equivalent
and the foreign exchange component at $3.4 million. A Bank loan of $8.4
million, equivalent to 40 percent of total project cost would comprise
the following:
(a) Civil Works - $3.49 million for financing of up to 40
percent of the cost of construction and extension of
the educational institutions included in the Project.
(b)  Furniture and Equipment - $2.57 million for financing
of up to 40 percent of the procurement of furniture,
instructional equipment and books for the educational



- 4 -
institutions included in the Project and for 40 percent
of the procurement of furniture and office equipment for
the Project Unit within the Ministry of Education and
Culture.
(c) Consultants' Fees, Technical Assistance and Salaries of
Designated Project Units Officers - $0.78 million or up
to )40 percent of total expenditure under this category.
(d) Contingencies - $1.56 million.
14.       Total new enrollment in the educational institutions included
in the Project would be approximately 7,900 students. Except in one
agricultural school, all project items involve extensions to existing
buildings or sites or joint use of facilities and staff for which cost per
student place comparisons are not relevant. Estimated unit costs per
student place in the agricultural school in question are reasonable for
institutions of this type.
15.       Operation of the schools and centers upon completion of the
Project would entail an increase in recurrent expenlditure well within
the capacity of the federal education budget and could be met without
significant impact on outlays in other educational areas.
16.       The Loan would be made to the Government of Brazil, and the
overall execution of the Project would be the responsibility of a special
Project Unit to be established for the purpose within the Ministry of
Education and Culture. Of the sixteen institutions included in the
Project, one would be built and administered by the Sao Paulo State
Government and two by the Autonomous Federal University of Santa Maria.
The Loan Agreement would include a covenant requiring the Federal Govern-
ment to conclude with the State Government and the University arrangements
satisfactory to the Bank to implement the parts of the Project under their
jurisdiction before disbursements can be made for them.
17.       Contracts for civil works, equipment and furniture would be
awarded after international competitive bidding; a 15 percent margin of
preference for domestic producers would apply to procurement of furni-
ture and equipment.
18.       The foreign exchange component of the Project is only slightly
over 16 percent of the total cost and the proposed Bank loan of $8.4
million, representing 40 percent of project cost, would cover about $5.0
million of local expenditure. The 40 percent cost sharing is recommended
on general economic grounds and in the light of the typically low foreign
exchange content of projects in the education sector. The justification
for financing some local expenditure is provided in my Report and Recom-
mendation on the Loan for the Salto Osorio Project.



PART IV - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
19.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Federative
Republic of Brazil, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article
III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and a
draft Resolution approving the proposed loan are being distributed to
the Executive Directors separately. The draft Loan Agreement follows
the normal pattern of agreements for education projects financed by the
Bank.
PART V - THE ECONOMY
20.       An Economic Report on Brazil (WH203a) dated January 22, 1971
has been distributed (R71-39). Its findings were summarized in my
Report and Recommendation on the Loan for the Salto Osorio Project.
A basic data sheet is annexed.
PART VI- COMPLIANCE WITH ARTICLES OF AGREEMENT
21.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VII - RECaMEhNDATICN
22.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.
