Mr. Boyd served as a consultant on both missions. During negotiations
a mission headed by Mr. Bart of the Europe, Middle East and North Africa
Department and Mr. Coudol went to Morocco in June/July 1970 to make
final arrangements regarding the proposed loan and to update this report.



i4OROCCO
CREDIT IDfl,OBILIER ET HOTEIIER
SUTMiARY
i.        Credit Immobilier et HIotelier (CIH) is the chosen instrument
of the Moroccan Governnrpnt for financing hotels.  Recent increases in
receipts from tourism and the prospects for their continued grawth make
the tourism sector one of high priority for liorocco, to which the Govern-
ment is prepared to continue to provide both investment incentives and
financial resources. CIH has received some World Bank funds indirectly,
by borrowing from the Banque Nationale pour le DIeveloppement Economique,
which is the beneficiary of several World Bank loans. However, because
of the importance of tourism and the special position of CIH in that
sector, the Government has wished that CIH borrow directly from the Bank;
and, after some preliminary discussions, the proposed loan has been deve-
loped. A Bank mission studied the tourism sector in Horocco in 1968.
This was followed by missions to review the operations of CIH itself,
and a continuing dialogue between the Government, CIH and the Bank over
the past 18 months.
ii.       Created nearly 50 years ago to finance housing, CIH has deve-
loped considerable experience in this area, which constituted its main
field of activity until about 4 years ago. Since then the financing
of hotels has risen rapidly and now accounts for the bulk of CIHis annual
commitments and for about two-thirds of its present portfolio. An impor-
tant element in the growth of CIIIIs experience in the hotel financing
field has been technical assistance from the World Bank, transmitted
through BNDE in the process of BNDE's relending to CIIH the proceeds
of Bank loans.  Even more important have been the continuing discussions
of 1969 and 1970, which have already resulted in various measures to
strengthen CIHOs organization and staff, in the improvement of the collec-
tion of data relevant to the tourism sector, including the financial
results of new hotel construction, in the sharpening of project appraisal
techniques with particular regard to economic aspects of appraisal, and
in better follow-up of hotel investments. Better data collection, im-
proved economic appraisal and more systematic and meaningful follow-up
are particularly important because the Government's incentive system for
hotels, which includes rebates of interest on loans to hotels, may some-
times result in misdirection of investments. The Bank plans a thorough
discussion of the Government's incentive system in September, in the light
of the recently completed economic mission, with a view to determining
the best form of incentives which may be needed, if any, to assure the
sound development of tourism facilities in Mlorocco.



- ii -
iii.      Government institutions are CIH's principal shareholders,
and CIH is heavily dependant on official sources for its capital. More-
over, official institutions and agencies predominate in its Board and
Executive Committee, although private institutions have held a majority
of CIH's share capital since 1967. Government influence is therefore
an important factor in the determination of CIH's overall policy and
may have been effective from time to time in determining particular
investment decisions. Autonori,y in the conduct of its day-to-day affairs
is crucial in CIHts developing into a strc.ng hotel-financing institution.
There is reason to believe that greater autonomy may be expected as
CIHs experience in hotel financing graws. One such reason is that, in
the field of housing finances in which CIH is considered to be particularly
competent, it has virtually complete autonomy.  The association with
the World Bank, begun in a technical way some time ago and developed in
consequence of the proposed loan, should be of considerable help in
developing CIHIs experience and thereby assuring its greater autonomy.
CIH's management and staff are able and willing to improve their perfor-
mance; and the Government and its agencies which are CIH's principal share-
holders have given evidence, by the measures taken in the past year to
strengthen CIH, of their willingness to allow this to happen.
iv.       The Bank's first reviews of CIH's performance and position showed
important areas of weakness. In particular, the accounting system needed
improvement; CIHts financial position was weakened as a result of unpaid
claims on Government and arrears on the accounts of large hotels sponsored
by CIHIs principal shareholder; an imbalance existed between the terms
of CIH's obligations and the terms of its lendings.  Measures have been
taken in the past year and additional measures have been agreed during the
negotiations which should substantially improve the situation. The
accounting system has been revised and improved; agreement has been reached
for payment on the Government's debts in a reasonable period and on the
wiping out of arrears of the Government-sponsored hotels; and additional
long-term subordinated capital is being placed at the disposal of CIH.
As a result the present imbalance in CIHI's financial structure will be
corrected, and CIH should have a borrowing base sufficient to enable it
to borrow the additional capital needed to carry out its business forecasts
for the next several years.
v.        CIH forecasts substantial lending for hotels, involving commitments
from now until the end of 1971 of about DH 127 million, about two-thirds
of which would represent the estimated value of imports. It also expects
significant lending for housing. Its forecasts appear reasonable. To
finance its expected business in the next 18 months,CIH needs fresh
resources of about DH 175 million. The proposed Bank loan would provide
DH 50 million.  CIH would seek the rest from its normal, principally
official, sources. A larger Bank loan might have been considered, in view
of the size of prospective need and of its foreign exchange component.
However, as this is a first loan to an institution which is still relatively
inexperienced in its main field of operation and as important steps still
need to be taken to improve the quality of CIH's performance, prudence
suggests that Bank lending at this time be limited to the proposed $lo
million.



- iii -
vi.       In the circumstances, CIH appears to be a suitable borrower and
should be able to service the proposed debt to the Bank. The terms of
the loan would be those norrrial to developrient finance companies, including
the standard commitment charge.  The free limit would be $100,000 per
project, up to an aggregate of $2 million. Disbursementss which would
be completed by December 31, 1973,would be made for the cif cost of imported
equipment, 65% of the cost of imported equipment purchased from the shelf
in HIorocco and a percentage of the cost of construction, representing
its import component, which has been estimated at 11,P.



MOROCCO
APPRAISAL OF THE CREDIT IMMOBILIER ET HOTELIER
I. INTRODUCTION
1.        The Bank has been involved in financing hotels in Morocco since
1966. Financing occurred through loans made by the Bank to the Banque
Nationale pour le Developpement Economique (BNDE), which in turn relent
the proceeds to another institution, the Credit Immobilier et Hotelier (CIH).
The Moroccan authorities preferred CIH to be the prime source of the loans
for hotels in Morocco.   However, the Bank felt that CIH was not yet a
suitable borrower, considering its limited experience in hotel lending and
the fact that CIH's primary activity since its creation in 1920 was the
provision of mortgage and housing finance.
2.        After preparatory discussions in 1965-1966, a Convention was
established in September 1966 for the tri-partite arrangement referred to
in paragraph 1. It was not easy to operate since the two Moroccan institu-
tions, which had very different approaches and appraisal methods, had to
attune themselves to one another. With the passage of time, CIH
increasingly became a hotel financier and moved away from its mainly mortgage-
oriented outlook.It gave increased weight to the commercial prospects and
soundness of a hotel venture and achieved a measure of familiarity with
the methods and operating practices of the World Bank.   This process was
facilitated by several visits of Bank personnel.
3.        In view of this development and following discussions with
Moroccan Government representatives in the spring of 1968, the Bank decided
to explore the possibility of lending directly to CIH. In September/October
1968, a Bank mission ascertained the general prospects of tourism in the
country over the next few years, and two subsequent missions in May and
September 1969 examined CIH. The recommendations resulting from the
appraisal of CIH are set forth in this report.
II. TOURISM MARKET AND FACILITIES IN MOROCCO
Importance of Tourism and Recent Growth
4.        Situated within easy distance by air and ferry from Europe,
with an equable sunny climate, 1,200 miles of Atlantic and Mediterranean
coastline, and a wealth of topographical, historical and cultural assets
to attract international visitors, Morocco has many resources suitable
for the development of international tourist traffic.   Since tourism



development is one of the economic sectors in which a substantial accelera-
tion in growth rates could occur within a few years, the MIoroccan authori-
ties have accorded this sector a priority second only to agriculture, in
the current Five-Year Plan (1968-72). The implementation of this decisionb
according to balance of payments data, has contributed to rising tourism
earnings which by 1969 had become Morocco's leading source of foreign
exchange.
5.        The future expansion of tourism in llorocco depends essentially
on the maintenance of a stable political situation, the improvement of
access (especially the continued reduction of the cost of air travel and
the ability to receive the larger jet aircraft), and the increasing avail-
ability of well-located and reasonably priced hotels (especially at beach
resorts) to meet the probable main element of growth, the European mass
tourist traffic. The impact of this mass traffic in Morocco began to be
felt in the early 1960s. Up to 1966, the average annual rate of growth
in  stop-over visitor   traffic to Viorocco was about 15% a year.  In 1967,
due to the Middle East crisis, tourist traffic suffered a setback and
only 400,000 visitors came, compared to 420,000 in 1966. However, in
spite of the foreign exchange crisis in Great Britain and France, which
contribute great numbers of tourists to Morocco, stop-over traffic in
1968 showed a substantial revival to 481,000. In 1969, Morocco received
about 716,000 tourists of all kind (compared to 588,000 in 1968). It
included 621,000 stop-over visitors staying on the average 9 days and
95,000 cruise visitors. As in the past the bulk of the traffic was from
France (24%) and the UK (13%). However visitors from the US which ac-
counted for only 6% of the traffic in 1963 represented over 15% of the
total in 1969. The 1969 achievement has been remarkable considering
that prices in M-orocco are somewhat higher than in other M5editerranean
countries competing for the European tourist market, e.g. Spain, Tunisia,
Turkey and Yugoslavia.
6.        The Five-Year Plan forecasts 750,000 and one million stop-over
visitors in 1970 and 1972 respectively, staying about 10-12 days on
average. The net foreign exchange earnings accruing to the Morrocan
economy from tourism are expected to grow from DH 220 million in 1967
to DH 350-45o million in 1972. There are good reasons to believe that
the effect on Moroccots balance of payments will be favorable and that
the returns on tourism investments will turn out to be attractive. How-
ever, to quantify properly these benefits, including specific returns on
hotel investments, a substantial effort to collect data is needed.
Hotel Development
7.        At the beginning of 1968, Morocco had roughly 20,000 hotel beds
available.  Since then, additions through raid - 1970   amounted to another
9, 000 beds. One characteristic of recent hotel construction in Morocco
has been their relatively high cost, i.e. about $5,0.00 per bed as compared
to an average of roughly $4.,000 in both Tunisia and Turkey. A considerable



- 3 -
number of hotels constructed in the 1960s are of the luxury variety
appealing to the wealthy tourist, while the European mass iiiarket
which potentially  would grow faster,  prefers accommodation in
lower priced hotels and pensionsLY. In these classes, the pressure on
facilities is particularly heavy in the favored tourist spots along the
Mediterranean, in some places on the Atlantic coast and in Morocco's
historic cities, such as Fez and Marrakesh.
8.        Of the 9,000 beds  constructed fron; 1968 to date, 8,000 beds are
in projects finanlced by CIII, which thus helped (in terms of beds) to finance
almost 90Xo of Morocco's total hotel development in the period. CIH loan
disbursements represent about 52% of total hotel investment since January 1,
1968, or 64% of investments sponsored by private interests. Since 1968,
the categories of hotels pLaimed have incrpasinrly been for three- and
fo2r-starp rather than five-star facilities.
Incentives to Tourism Development
9.        Although a precise assessment is impossible, the spurt in Morocco's
hotel development in this decade has been5purred by Government assistance.
Such assistance has been given to hotel projects approved by the State's
Investment Commission. It has taken a variety of forms, including import
duty exemption and tax privileges, but the leading ones among them are:
a. an equipment grant (prime d'equipement) usually ranging from
10-15% of the fixed investment in a hotel project, in the
form of a one-time contribution to the needed financing;
b. a subsidy (4.25%) now amounting to close to one-half of the
8.75% p.a. interest payable by hotel sponsors on long-term
loans from CIH.
A further but indirect element of Government assistance to hotel financing
is the availability of substantial Government guarantees for the loans
from CIH.
10.       Though it has stimulated hotel investment,  the incentive system
has had some negative aspects. The provision of cheap or free resources to
the investor has frequently detracted from a careful assessment of invest-
ment costs in relation to expected benefits from tourist traffic; further-
more, traffic assumptions and occupancy ratios were pot checked out with
necessary care. It is, therefore, not surprising th'at these factors have
led to high per-bed investment costs and consequentl,y to high hotel rates
compared to nearby competitors. Also contributing go the tendency to-
wards aver-investment in hotels, are established attitudes on real estate
speculation by which hotel construction is at times riewed as a source of
short-term profit through over-invoicing, rather thaii as a basis Lor
gain frorn corFercial operation.
1/ Moroccan hotels are given five principal classifications expressed in
stars and reflected in tariffs. A 5-star hotel is in the luxury class,
3-star facilities offer comfortable accommodatioAs and 1-star appeals
to the hardy.



- 4 -
11.       The facts underlying these general observations on high investment
costs and laxity in occupancy estimates have been reflected in some of the
25 hotel projects presented by CIH to the Bank through BISTDE. Even with
the financial incentives given by the State, expected returns on share
capital were either too optimistic and had to be adjusted, or were barely
acceptable, i.e. in the range of 9-15% p.a. Indeed, four projects had to
be rejected by the Bank because of unattractive financial prospects due to
overly high investment costs.
III. CIH'S ORGANIZATION AND PROCEDURES
Background
12.       CIH, known until 1967 as Caisse des Prets Immobilier du Maroc,
was founded in 1920 by the Credit Fmncier d'Algerie et de Tunisie and
the Credit Foncier de France. It developed prof.table business in
financing housing for the Europeans in Morocco and later in farm purchases
and improvements for Europeans. The Protectorate Government subsidized
interest costs to the borrowers and CPIM became an effective instrument
for encouraging land settlement. CPIM also entered, as early as 1927,
into small-scale hotel financing, but total loans to hotel projects
aggregated only DH 12.4 million from 1927 to the end of 1962.
13.       In 1960, the Iloroccan Government assumed control of the
company through the Caisse de Depot et de Gestion (CDG) 1/s which
held 65% of share capital of DH 6.5 million.  Public ownership was subse-
quently reduced by placing CDG's shares on the Casablanca Stock Exchange.
In 1967, after a share capital increase to DH 20 million (on which there is
a statutory dividend of 5%), public sector ownership represented less than
50%; as of June 30, 1970, its share was 40.8%, virtually All of it held
by CDG and the Bank of Morocco as shown in Annex 1.    29.3 per cent
of CIH's shares were then held by private Moroccan banks and insurance
cor,panies and the balance of 29.9, by s-all investors.
14.       CIH's purpose and powers are governed by Royal Decrees
issued in 1962 and 1968, its statutes and the general laws of the country.
Under these, CIH has wide powers to lend, invest and guarantee as long as
these transactions are related to construction for housing, to hotel
investments and to other specifically authorized operations.
15.       The 1962 Decree appointed CIH as the main Mloroccan
institution for the financing of hotels; the 1968 Decree (and ordinance)
1/ Caisse de Depot et de Gestion is the depository and administrator of
several public funds, most notably savings and social security funds.
Through investment of these funds, CDG has a pervasive role throughout
Morocco's economy, especially in financing various infrastructure
activities and through participation in several affiliates including
CIH, the Societe Maroc Tourist and the Societe Nationale d'Investissement.

established the role of the Commissaire from the Ministry of Finance (see
paragraph 16), the terms of CIH's loans, the level of CIH's interest rates
including the related subsidies and the need for the Finance Minister's
approval for raising resources.
Board and Executive Committee
16.       CIH's statutes fix the power and function of the Board of
Directors which has extensive powers over CIH's organization, operations
and policies. Decisions on loans and on other current operations, pursuant
to Board directions, have been entrusted to an Executive Committee. The
composition of the Board and of the Committee is shown in Annex 2. The
statutes also regulate the appointment by the Board of CIH's Director
General.
a. CDG's Director General presides over CIH's Boardl/, which
meets twice a year and has currently 14 members. Despite
private sector majority in shareholdings (see paragraph 13),
eight Board members come from Government departments or
public sector institutions. The Board ratifies the
decisions of the Executive Committee, to which it can also
delegate its supervisory powers over CIHi's administration.
b. More continuous supervision over CIH is exercised by the
Executive Committee of five members headed by CDG's
General Secretary; two members represent the Societe
de Banque du Iiaghreb aul the Baanque du 'laroc;
another member is the Government Coamissaire from
the Finance Plinistry who has by law the right
to vato any of the Committee's decisions; CIi's
Director General is also a member of the Committee and
functions as a non-voting secretary. The Executive
Committee approves all loan proposals and other
financial transactions.
17.       Discussions in the Board and Committee, which meet in Rabat,
instead of Casablanca where CIE has its offices, are recorded only in their
most essential details, such as disposition of projects, without indicati-n
that varying opinions may have been expressed.
Management
18.       Since 1966, Mr. Mohamed Lazrak has been CIH's Director General.
A law graduate, his previous career was with the Government; he served in
the Finance Ministry and more recently he was the Secretary of the Invest-
ment Commission. (This Commission approves hotel and industrial projects
1/ CDG's Director General is normally Chairman of CIH$s Board.
However, the appointment of CDG's present Director General, Mr. Reghai,
has not yet been ratified by Royal Decree and pending it, Mr. Reghai
is only acting Chairman of the Board of CIH.



for their eligibility for Government incentives). M4r. Lazrak, now 33
years old, has had a rapidly rising career.
19.      1Mr. Lazrak is assisted by his deputy, Mr. Abdelhak Benkirane,
Assistant Manager, both an engineer and a law granduate, who has risen
since 1965 through the ranks of CIH and is particularly concerned with
the institution's internal administration, follow-up on housing operations
and legal matters. CIH has twTo senior foreign advisors, for legal and
financial matters. The Director General relies heavily on them, especially
on the financial advisor, who did much to unravel CIH0s accounts prior to
CIH's first audit in mid-1969.
20.       Given CIH's relatively recent exposure to large-scale hotel
financing, the management still has to gain experience in coping with
the growing complexity of financing the tourism sector. Therefore,
much depends on the continued presence of CIH0s advisors. But there is
no doubt that CIH's Director General is committed to doing a steadily
improving job.
Government Role
21.       CIH has an intimate relationship to Government: through its
management, through its source of finance and through Government policy.
CIH's Director General is a member of the small group of senior officials
who exercise considerable influence over economic activity in Morocco.
CIH could not step significantly out of line so far as general policy is
concerned, without hampering its own access to resources, for which it
depends heavily on CDG and the Banque du Maroc.  What is important for
CIH's future, therefore, is that the Government itself push CIH in the
appropriate direction by requiring it to support a high-priority sector
without undue losses to the economy, and that CIH develop into an ef-
ficient institution.
22.       CIH's experience in the hotel sector must grow if it is to
achieve independence in day-to-day operations. CIH's long experience
in housing has shown that autonomy is possible, if it operates efficiently.
CIH's direct association with an outside financial institution like the
World Bank can help it acquire the experience necessary to justify and to
establish its independence in day-to-day activity. However progress to-
wards substantial autonomy will take time and will require close watch.
Staff, Organization and Procedures
23.       CIH has 68 staff members, including 32 Moroccan and six foreign
professional staff members; two of them are available under technical
assistance programs. None of the M4oroccan staff is over 40 years of age
and its experience still has to broaden. This is developing, and some



- 7 -
capable officers have already emerged.  Until further progress is made,
key positions still need to be filled by experienced foreigners. Annex
3 contains an organization chart.
24.       Since 1967, when the present Financial Advisor joined CIH
(a cormpetent Belgianj who is responsible for all CIH's accounting and
financial procedures), considerable changes have been introduced in the
concepts and operations of CIHHs Finance Division, which includes the
Cashierls and Accounting Departments. These changes affected in particuLar
CIH0s accounting system which did not permit CIH to ascertain or follow
up the financial consequBnces, profitability or losses, of each of its
various financing activities. Since 1968, considerable progress in unra-
velling CIHHs accounts has been made, as detailed in paragraph 53. The
improvements introduced are being put into effect, including recacmendations
made recently by CIH's auditors, which called for separation of the
accounts of CIHIs hotel and housing operations.
25.       CIHi's major division is the Operations Division.  In it,
the Hotel Credit Department created in 1967, has still to become
a well-functioning group.  Hotel business has been growing rapidly
in recent years. The main workload in processing hotel projects had
been carried by the young director of this Department, assisted by a
French engineer and by two Mloroccan colleagues with little experience,
until last summer, when were they supplemented by two Moroccan financial
analysts and a Moroccan engineer.
26.       The procedures for hotel loans, from the first application
by the borrower until a loan is signed, take on the average 6 to 12
months.  The procedures involve the evaluation of financial, technical
and legal aspects by the Hotel Credit Department, for a fee.
Meanwhile, applicatioms are made for Government grants, interest rate
rebates, Government guarantee and the title documentation needed for legal
mortgages. An appraisal report is then prepared for the Executive Committee.
Following approval by the Committee, the client is notified and is charged
a 0.75% commitment fee levied on the undisbursed part of the loan from
four months after notification or the date the loan is signed, whichever
is earlier. The Disbursement Department finalizes all the legal and
documentary work and authority is then given to the Cashier's Department
for periodic disbursement as construction progresses. The progress of
projects is watched by the engineers of the Hotel Credit Department.
27.       The main weaknesses of CIH's appraisal work stem partly from
the dearth of detailed data on Moroccan hotel development in general,
and partly from the quality of the supporting data on projects which
clients furnish to CIH. The latter relates specifically to estimates
of expected traffic for a specific location or hotel project. Furthermore,



- 8 -
potential clients tend to exaggerate designs and inflate costs, which
CIH has had difficulty in checking, in the near absence of standards
for various classes of hotels and related ranges of investment costs.
Better points of reference for CIH should be available some time in 1970
due to work now being done in the Ministry of Tourism with German technical
assistance. As to the Hotel Credit Department itself, the staff is gaining
experience and has the potential to improve further; its director is
eager to improve his Department's and his personal performance.
28.       Supervision of hotel projects under construction has
been weak. It has been practically non-existent in regard to projects
already operating. In this area, new staff members are required. The
need to improve supervision is particularly striking because of the strong
tendency, already noted, to over-invest in hotels.
29.       CIH's disbursement procedures, based on its long experience
as a mortgage bank} are well developed. Architects, who are on a Government-
endorsed list, have to certify progress payments and CIH's borrowers have
to show invoices of local importers or suppliers. There is an established
system in CIH for assuring that disbursement is channelled to the intended
use. CIH0s Disbursement Department is acquainted with the World
Bank's disbursement procedures through CIH's use of IBRD loans lent to
it by BEDE.
30.       An aspect causing concern is CIHts laxity in following up
some of its arrears. The principal cases are important projects involving
CDG1, CIHs leading shareholder, and some foreign hotel chains. The
officer recently put in charge of delinquencies is able and should in
time do an effective job.
31.       Thanks to its long experience, CIH seems competent in financing
housing. The Housing Credit Department assisted by the Inspection Department,
which handles the technical work, is well staffed.  The Inspection Department
examines the designs, plans and the architect's reliability. The Housing
Credit Department evaluates the financial situation and prospects of
housing borrowers. To the extent that housing loans have gone sour
so far, they were easily recouped by sales of the properties concerned.
These sales have been facilitated by housing scarcities in Morocco.
32.       The procedure for housing loans is substantially similar to
that of hotel loans. However, the emphasis in evaluating a housing (or
an apartment) project is primarily on the mortgage guarantee. CIH has
developed considerable experience in the evaluation of security.
Needed Improvements in Processing Projects
33.       CIH has agreed during negotiations on criteria and procedures
to improve its appraisal technique and project supervision in three principal
areas:



(i) the estimates of the market for tourism, (ii) the economic and financial
return on hotel investments, and (iii) the supervision of projects under
execution and in operation.
34.       Assessment of Tourist Yiarket. Although tourism has grown rapidly
in the past few years, ]Ytoroccols authorities cannot tell yet with precision
how beneficial that development has been to the ccantry, particularly with
respect to the rate of return on hotel investment. Although the various
incentives provided by the State encourage investment, their economic
cost and benefit cannot be estimated with accuracy. It is difficult to
gauge whether hotel investment has taken place in the right place, in
the right category and at the right time. Therefore, a major point in
recent discussions between the Bank, the Nioroccan authorities and CIH has
been the need for collection of data on tourism in hforocco. To that end,
the Bank asked CIH to collect facts on the trend of tourist traffic in the
past two years (including occupancy ratios in various tourist centers
and seasons), expenditures made by tourists for various types of accomodation,
and the origin of, as well as arrangements for, specific national tourist
streams into hiorocco. CIH has taken preliminary steps to improve its
knowledge of the tourism market. Two analysts have started to visit
systematically the hotels owned by CIH1s borrowers and are collecting
data on occupancy rates, profitability and organization. This survey
covers only a very small sample of hotels (about 30) and a considerable
effort is needed both to broaden the scope of the survey and to analyze
the data. CIH undertook during negotiation to hire, before the end of
1970, two economists fcr this purpose.
35.       Return on Hotel Investment.  The prospects for return on share
capital of hotels have been attractive, in view of the available incentives,
even in a situation of low occupancy. It is questionable whether these
incentives have been the most economic means of stimulating hotel investment.
In the absence of a good basis to judge the merit of the incentives,
C(IH has made arrangements, during negotiation with the Bank ,to min-Unze
possible untoward effects of the system. In selecting projects for financing,
CIH is now applying stricter evaluation criteria than have hitherto been
applied in judging the return on investment.  In essence, these new criteria
require the return on the total investment in a hotel, whLether financed
by share capital, loans or Government grants, to approximate what might
be considered the economic cost of capital in hiorocco. A minimum internal
economic  rate of return of 10% per annurm was chosen for projects to be
financed with Bank funds, computed on the basis of the discounted cash
flow, built on well-founded estimates of hotel receipts after operating
expenses (but before interest charges and income tax), and discounted
over a period about equal to the estimated real life of hotels in a given
category. The application of this criterion would have eliminated a number
of hotel projects previously financed by CIH.



- 10 -
36.       Supervision of Hotel Projects.  Even with two new staff members
recently appointed to this task, CIH is not yet fully equipped to supervise
hotel projects under construction. During negotiation with the Bank,
CIH agreed to add personnel to its Operations Division. An engineer and
a quantity surveyor will be hired before the end of 1970; furthermore,
an experienced architect will be hired before June 1971. These additions
should allow CIH to improve the supervisian of its hotel projects.  In
addition, CIH has agreed to require the engagement of independent consultants,
at the expense of its borrowers, to assist in the supervision of large
hotel projects during construction.
IV. POLICIES, RESOJRCES AND OPERATIONS
37.       CIH follows different business policies on hotel loans and on
housing loans.  These policies are, essentially, regulated by the law
of December 17, 1968 (see paragraph 15) in which relevant Government policies
are also laid out.
Policies
38.       Hotel Loans. For hotel projects, a distinction is made between
financing construction and financing equipment for the same hotel. This
is a traditional pattern preferred by borrowers far tax reasons. By the
1968 law, the life of hotel loans is limited to (i) up to 20 years for
construction, with up to five years' grace, and (ii) up to 10 years for
equipment, with up to two years' grace. CIH applies these terms. By
the same law, CIH loans (for both hotels and housing) cannot exceed
75% of the value of properties as appraised by CIH. As a matter of policy,
however, CIH limits its financing to about 60% of that value.
39.       All CIH loans (both for hotels and for housing) carry an
interest rate of 8.75%  per annur. As indicated in paragraph 9, the
Government gives hotel borrowers rebates on the interest rate they
must pay. Until the law of Decenber 17, 1968, there was a range of
rebates, going up to 5.5% per annum. They are now uniforms and equivalent
to 4.25% per annumi to CIHIs hotel borrowers. Only nine old loans for
financing restaurants, out of CIH's 149 hotel loans signed up to December
1969, do not enjoy rebates. The importance of these rebates has increased
over the pastiwo years, as shown-in the following table (in DH thousand):
1967     1968     1969
Interest rebate                          1,045.7  4,415.2  5,57.7
Interest paid by CIH clients             3,598.9  2,564.2  5,517.3
Total interest received by CIH           4,644.6  6,979.4 11,375.0
(at 8.75S% per annum)



- 11 -
The considerable increase in the rebate from 1967 to 1968 is explained
by the 68% growth in hotel loans from 1967 to 1968, and by the incidence
of the higher rebates on loans made during the last part of 1967 and
during 1968; most of these rebates represented 5.5% per annum. Until
recently CIH did not always receive payments from the Finance -iiinistry
on time.  Arrears amounted in December 1969 to about DH 5 million.  This
matter has now been given consideration by the Government and it is re-
ported that since January 1, 1970 these arrears have been wiped out and
interest rabtes have been transferred to CIH on the due date.
40.       Under the law of 1968, the State may cover part of CIH's risk
on hotel loans, and since then all hotel loans have had a State guarantee.
In practice, State guarantees have usually amounted to about 50% of the
outstanding balance of CIH loans; and, in some special cases where no mort-
gage could be obtained on the land 1/, this guarantee was given up to 100%
of outstanding loans.
41.       With few exceptions CIH requires its borrower, before disbursing
any portion of a hotel loan, to disburse his portion of the investment,
usually about 40" of the total.  This portion includes the borrower's own
funds and the equipment grant.
4e2.      Housing Loans.  Until June 1969, CIHis evaluation of housing
projecus was made on the basis of property evaluations alone. The ap-
praised values of properties were usually less than 50% of their market
value.  In practice, housing loans did not go to the 75% of appraisal
value allowed by the 1968 law, as noted in paragraph 38. At CIH's Annual
General l4eeting in June 1969, policies on loans and mortgage evaluation
were revised, as regards both individual dwellings and apartment buildings.
The new policy permits greater flexibility in appraisal, which may take
accounts of (i) the market values of the properties, (ii) the personal
creditworthiness of the borrovers, and (iii), in the case of apartments,
expected return on investment and debt-service coverage. As a result of
this change, CIHis housing loans are expected to increase. Only loans
for housing properties worth up to DH 150,000 qualify for interest rebates,
which amount to 2.75%.
Resources
43.       As at December 31, 1969, CIH had at its disposal the following
resources invested or available for investment in its own lending pro-
grams (hotels, housing and the fishing fleet):
1/ MTainly due to difficulties in property registration in the former
Spanish Protectorate or in regard to lands held by religious endow-
ments.

Annex 4 gives details of the borrowings sunmmarized above. The major
feature of CII's resoures is that CIH is heavily dependent on Moroccan
Government institutions as providers of funds, i.e. for over 80% of
borrowed resources, for most long-term and medium-term bonds are held
by CDG. Furthermore, it has no foreign resources directly available to
it.  The BINDE loans it obtained are, however, provided by IBRD-
Recent Operations
44.       Until 1967, when CIH reorganized its accounting and management
information systems, it was impossible to obtain from the statistics a
record of lending activities in a consistent fcrmatp giving the volume
and phasing of important processing steps. Only a comparison of outstanding
commitments (amounts disbursed plus undisbursed balance minus repayments)
is available for a longer period of time.
45.       It is interesting to note that in 1962 hotel commitments represented
only 4% of CIHPs total commitments. They have grown at a compouncdd rate
of about 75% per annum since then.  In 1967, for the first time, hotel
commitments exceeded housing commitments. The trend, since then is
shown below (in DH million):

46.       As of December 19693 CIH had signed 149 hotel loans from which
about 80 hotel enterprises had benefitted. Only ten hotel projects have
been rejected by CIH over the years, but important changes have been brought
about by CIH's intervention, in part motivated by BNDE, either on its
own account or after a project review by IBRD.
47.       About 90 of CIHts 149 loan commitments were for hotel projects
in the five- and four-star categories, most of them made in the past three
years. Hotels financed by CIH are located mainly in Agadir (21 loans),
Tangier (20 loans) and Casablanca (12 loans), in addition to those in large
tourist resort areas, such as Al Hoceima, Restinga and hIohamedia. An
important development in CIH hotel financing has been the impact since 1967
of large loans in its portfolio. Fifteen loans of over DH 5 million out
of a total of 149 loans committed on December 31, 1969, represented more
than 50% of the volume of commitments and about 60% of outstanding hotel
loans at that time.

48.       In housing, over 900 loans for new units of accommodation were
signed between 1967 and June 30, 1970. Over one-half of the loans in
housing have been for amounts up to DH 100,000 and 30% of these loans
exceeded DH 200,000, including 14% for apartment buildings. Most of
CIH's housing loans have been in cities, 40% in Casablanca and 25% in
Rabat.
BNDE Loans to CIH
49.       Following the BNDE/CIH Convention of September 1966 (see para-
graph 1) and under rules established since, IBRD funds have been made
available for 17% to 40% of the cost of the project, depending on the
classification of the hotel. This range of percentage, representing the
imputed import component of the construction and equipment of a hotel,
was arrived at through a study made by SOCOTEC, the leading consulting
firm in Morocco in the construction field. The foreign exchange risk
for loans made by BNDE to CIH with IBRD funds has been borne by the
Bank of Morocco (which carries the risk for all BNDE foreign exchange
loans). CIH's clients can obtain foreign exchange licenses up to the
amount of the "BNDE element".
50.       As of June 15, 1970, 12 projects had been financed under the
arrangement with CIH, for an amount of DH 21.7 million.  CIH hopes to
submit 10 additional projects to BNDE for IBRD funds out of loans 660-MOR
equivalent to DH 9.6 million.
State Programs Managed by CIH
51.       In addition to its regular operations, CIH manages for the
State's account three loan programs of low-cost social housing; they are
financed by State advances on special terms for low-income borrowers. CIH
assumes no risk and earns a management commission of 3/4 of 1% on amounts
outstanding (earlier it amounted to over 2%); this commission is more
than sufficient to cover CIH's expenses for its work. Only one of these
programs is active; two are running down. The active one is OPRS (Opera-
tion des Prets - Regime Special) which provides cheap housing to specific
categories of borrowers. CIH's involvement is limited because the day-to-
day operations of this program are handled by the State-controlled Banques
Centrales Populaires, which has a wide regional network of branches. CIH
retains only a supervisory role and handles delinquencies. As of June 30,
1970, the OPES program represented 82% of the outstanding commitments of
the three State programs, and amounted to DH 92.7 million.
52.       CIH operates another State fund, which on June 30, 1970 amounted
to about DH 3 million and is used to guarantee commercial bank advances
for the modernization of the fishing fleet. CIH receives a fee of 3.5%
per annum. On June 30, 1970, Clii's guaranteesamounted to nearly DH 0.5
million.  The fund appears as a liability in CIH's balance sheet.

V. CIHIS FINJANCIAL POSITION
Balance Sheets
53.       CIHts accounts were audited for the first time in the sumwer of
1969. This was done on a suggestion by the Bank, and performed by Price
Waterhouse/Casablanca. The Price lWaterhouse audit covered only CIH0s
1968 accounts, with a "businessmants review" of the 1967 accounts.
CIH's accounts were accepted with only very minor exceptions. Comparative
balance sheets for 1967, 1968 and 1969 are shown in Annex 5. Accounts
prior to 1967 cannot be reconciled with the recent statements because
(i) CIH's own programs were commingled with those it managed for the account
of the State and (ii) the portfolio showed amounts contracted rather than
outstanding amounts disbursed. A summary follows of CIH's recent balance
sheets (in DH million):

Total assets of CIH have increased over the past two years by almost
75%, while hotel loans grew by more than 150%.
54.       Current assets as of December 31, 1969, contained relatively little
cash and liquid items. So far, however, CIHRs liquidity needs have been taken
care of by the Banque du Ilaroc where CIH can mobilize notes, when needed,
up to a ceiling of DH 85 million. As shown in Annex 5, current assets
also include "State debts" of over DH 19 million, resulting from the comming-
ling of the State's with CGH1s own funds. The result of this commingling
was that CIH was funding with its own resources a social housing program
that it was administering for the account of the State. The debt of DH 19
million was uncovered when CIH reorganized its accounting procedures in 1967
and has since been recognized by the State.  CIII now receives on this amount
interest at 6;i per annum.



- 16 -
55.       Another debt of the State, amounting to DH 2.9 million (in-
clduing interest of about DH 1 million), is reflected in the long-term
assets 1/. It represents loans made to former French landowners whose
properties were taken over by the State after Moroccan independence.  The
Goverrnment has also acknowledged this debt and has budgeted repayment in
1970.
56.       The foregoing balance sheets are net of provisions for delinquent
accounts which, in accordance with CIH' s practice, are established for
the full amount of delinquencies. (Paragraph 64 refers to the practice.)
As of December 31, 1969, these provisions amounted to DH 7.3 million, in-
cluding DH 2.3 million for arrears in housing loans and DH 4.1 million
for arrears in hotel loans, of which about DH 3 million is attributable
to projects sponsored by CDG (see paragraph 67). Also, as mentioned in
paragraph 39, the Ministry of Finance owed CIH interest rebates which
until the beginning of 1970 were usually paid late. On December 31, 1969,
rebates receivable amounted to DH 4.9 million, or 92% of the total amount
of interest rabates for 1969.
57.       The impact of the various debts owed by the State or by enter-
prises in which CDG is importantly involved, as noted in paragraphs 54
to 56 above, was the following situation at the end of 1969:
DH '000
State debt stemming from social housing
program                                   19,220
Arrears on farm loans                        2,954
Arrears on CDG-sponsored loans               2,782
Rebates receivable                           4,859
Total                                29,815
These debts represented more than 10% of ClIH's total assets as of
December 31, 1969 and were larger than CIHPs net worth of DH 23.7 mil-
lion. Arrangements have been made during negotiations for a satisfactory
plan for elimination of these debts, as noted in paragraph 67.
58.       Until now CIH has been able to borrow with ease the resources it
requires through CDG and the Banque du l4aroc. On December 31, 1969, medium-
and long-term borrowings covered nearly 100% ofCIH's outstanding long-
term loans, and the ratio of long-term debt to equity, which was only
5.5-1 at the end of 1967, exceeded 8:1 at the end of 1969. With consider-
able business in sight, CIH must borrow substantial additional amounts. The
pressure to borrow will be the greater because, as a result of the Decem-
ber 1968 law, the average duration of CIHi's loans has grcwn to roughly 12
years, whereas the average repayment periods on its own borrowings are only
about 9-10 years.
1/ The principal on this debt has been fully covered by provisions.

Income and Expense Statements
59.       CIH's income and expense statements for 1967, 1968 and 1969
is shown in Annex 6. CIH enjoys no tax privilege I/ and pays income tax
on net earnings ranging between 40% and 48%. At the end of 1969, gross
earnings before deduction of expenses amounted to 8.95% of average total
assets. Average cost of borrowed resources was 4.03%.  A summatr of
CIH's income statement for 1969 follows (in DH million):
A of Gross     % of Average
Amount     Income    TItal Assets
Gross Income                             21.08   100.00         8.95
Less:
(i)  Financial expenses            (9.49)  (45.02)        (4.o3)
(ii)  Administrative and general
expenses                   (4.02)  (19.07)        (1.71)
(iii) Provisions for doubtful
accounts                   (2.70)  (12.81)        (1.14)
(iv)  Taxes and investment reserve  (2.62)  (12.43)        (1.11)
Net Profit                  2.25    10.67          0.96
1969 net profit amounted to about 11% of year-end share capital and 9.5%
of year-end net worth. Administrative and general expenses of DH 4.02
million (compared to DH 3.23 million in 1967) included personnel for
DH. 1.6 million, general administrative epenses for DH 1.8 million and
depreciation of fixed assets for DH 0.7 million. Appropriation of CIH's
1969 earnings included a statutory dividend of DH 1 million and a supplementary
dividend of DH 0.6 million; total dividends corresponded to 8b of share
capital and resulted in a pay-out ratio of 71o of the 1969 net profits. This
is a high ratio v given the need to build up CIH's net worth.
60.       The impact of provisions for doubtful accounts, large in 1968,
was even larger in 1969.
Evaluation of Portfolio
61.       On December 31, 1969, CIH had a long-term portfolio of DH 227.2
million (including DH 3.4 million of maturities payable within one year
and DH. 7.1 million of loans receivable). This portfolio was spread over
four lending programs, as follows:
a. Hotel loans, which represented DH 162.9 million (72% of the
total portfolio). Since 1962, when it started, this program
has been the fastest growing part of CIH's portfolio, with
an average growth of 75,6 per annum.
/ Provisions from bad debts are treated like a normal expense.



- 16 _
b.  Medium-cost housing mortgage loans, which amounted to DH 61.3
million (27% of portfolio). This is the old CIH program and
was the largest part of it until 1967, when the hotel program
overtook it.
c. Rural housin loans,which amounted to DH 2.6 million of port-
folio (1.3$ of portfolio). Very important before 1960, this
program is no longer operational and the portfolio has since
been run down; two years ago, this activity was taken over
by the Caisse Nationale du Credit Agricole.
d. War damage program, also discontinued, representing an
insignificant portion of CIH's portfolio.
62.       In CIH's active hotel loans as of December 31, 1969, about three-
quarters of the amounts of loans were for four- and five-star hotel projects;
furthermore, such loans were individually large, i.e. 15 loans were over
DH 5 million each (all of these but one were granted after 1967). CIH's
housing portfolio of DH 61 million was scattered over more than 1,700 loans.
63.       In addition to the special case of the farm loans in arrears (see
paragraph 55), on June 30, 1969, long-term loans totalling DH 46.5 million
(2Wa of total portfolio) were in arrears. Among these, hotel loans amounted
to DH 38.0 million (23$ of hotel portfolio) and housing loans to DH 10.5
million (17% of housing portfolio). The actual arrears totalled DH 7.3
million, including DH 4.7 million for hotels, DH 1.6 million for housing
and DH 1 million for rural loans.
64.       The foregoing represents amounts in arrears for five months or
more.  In addition, DH 3.4 million was overdue on June 30, 1969 for less
than five months. Like some other financial institutions in Morocco, CIH
puts no particular pressure on clients for prompt payment of debt.
Maturities overduie are not considered as delinquent if they are paid within
six months and are not even classified as arrears until five months have
elapsed. The only action taken by CIH during this period is the mailing
of reminders every two months. When classifying overdues as arrears, CIH
makes full provision for them against its income and charges penalty
interest. Follow-up on arrears has not been energetic.
65.       CIH has never experienced a loss on the resale of a mortgaged
house or apartment. CIH considers the prospects for recovery in housing
arrears satisfactory.
66.       In view of the good record on housing loans, CIH's risks rest
essentially with its hotel portfolio. In assessing this risk, account
must be taken of (a) the value of the State guarantee covering about
60% of the face amounts of hotel loans, (b) the -eight of large loans
for two hotel concerns sponsored by CDG, which together owed DH 32.6 million,
and (c) the recent rapid growth of portfolio which includes new and large
projects with long grace periods which are still in effect.



- 19 -
67.       The position of the delinquent loans for the two CDG-sponsored
hotel projects in the portfolio required prompt settlement. A settle-
ment of these arrears and of the two other Government debts to CIH provided a
test the Government's guarantees on CIH's hotel loans. During negotiations
with the Bank, CDG and the Government agreed to a settlement. On CDG-
sponsored hotel loans, a repayment will be made before December 1970 for the
larger delinquent loan,on which nearly DH 3 million is overdue;while on the
other loan, involving a foreign investor,a court action will be filed if
an amicable settlement is not reached sooner. On its own debts the Government
has agreed to repay CIH in installments; the arrears on farm loans will be
entirely repaid before the end of 1970; and the State debt stemming from
social housing program will be reduced to DH 12 million at the end of 1970,
DH 6 million at the end of 1571 and to zero by the end of 1972.
68.       Excluding the amounts overdue on the CDG-sponsored loans, amounts
actually in arrears on hotel loans (about DH 2.2 million) appear to be un-
important. But one has to take into account CIH's limited experience in
financing and following up hotel projects, and the fact that a sizable
proportion of CIH's hotel projects is still under construction. Until
follow-up procedures are functioning properly, a better assessment of
Miorocco's tourism market is available, and more CIH-financed hotels are
operating, a portfolio review has to be focused on the actual defaulters
rather than on potential problems. On this basis, the figure of 3-4%h of
outstanding hotel loans affected by arrears is not bad.
VI. BUSINESS OUTLOOK
69.       CIH's business in the next few years will, as in the pasts be over-
whelniingly loans for housing and hotels.  CIH will have to continue adminis3-
tering the OPRS social housing program for the State, but this 411 have little
impact on CIH's organization and finances.
Housing Business
70.       Though the shift  towards hotel loans is expected  to conti-
nue, housing loans-are likeyv to remain significant.  The more liberal
housing loan criteria introduced in June 1969 have already resulted in an
increase in the number and value of applications presented to CIH. In part
responding to pent-up demand, applications in 1969 and in the first six
months of 1970 totalled DH 615 million, more than four times the total
for 1968. For this reason, CIH expects a particularly high level of housing
loan commitments in 1970. Though housing commitments in 1967 and in 1968
were low (at DH 12.1 million and DH 13.6 million respectively), it is not
unreasonable to foresee commitments rising to DH 25 million each in 1970 and
in 1971. Achievement of the 1S70 figure will be facilitated because 1969
approvals include loans for large programs of the Compagnie Generale Immobi-
liere and the Sucreries Nationales, which will be committed in 1970.



- 20 -
Hotel Business
71.       Based on the hotel applications now in its hands, a large number
of which have already been subjected to some scrutiny, CIHPs program from
mid-1970 through the end of 1971 calls for financing 30-35 hotels, including
four large hotel complexes. These hotels will have about 10,000 beds, and
will be built over the period from mid-1970 through 1974. Given the his-
torical average construction period of two years per hotel and the continua-
tion of CIH's roughly 52 contribution to total hotel investment in the
country, the CIH program implies that Morocco will have  about   20,000
additional hotel beds ready for occupancy by the winter season of 1973-74.
This also implies that Morocco is likely   to achieve its planned target
of 50,000 hotel beds by the end of the present five-year plan period, 1972.
72.       On the basis of the number of beds alone, CIH's program and its
implications seem reasonable. If Morocco realizes the present estimate of
750,000 stop-over visitors in 1970 it should, with effective promotion and
organization, be able to reach 1 million in 1973. On the basis of this
figure and an average stay of nine nights per visitor, an occupancy ratio
of 50% seems attainable. This level has been exceeded in Tunisia but is
generally accepted as good where traffic tends to be seasonal, as is the
case in Morocco, especially in the North.
73..      About 40/O of CIH's hotel projects fall into the three-star cate-
gory or below; over 40% are four-star hotels. Though less pronounced than
before, high categories still loom large in CIH's hotel program. The total
investment required for the projects for which CIH will make commitments
in the next 1& months should be around DH 260 million or about DH 26,000
per bed. This average is only slightly below that of the previous plan
period (1965-67), but the reduction is in fact greater when account is
taken of the roughly 20, increase in hotel construction costs since then.
Nevertheless, it remains particularly important that CIH carefully investi-
gate the occupancy forecasts and the construction costs of its projects,
especially in hotels of higher categories.
74.       CIH's hotel investment program to the end of 1971 calls for
commitments of DH 127 million, in the achievement of which the principal
risk of short-fall would be the failure or postponement of one or another
of the large hotel complexes referred to above.  This sum represents about
one half  of     the total cost of the projects.  Roughly one-third of the
total cost of hotel investment is attributable to imported goods and equip-
ment. Thus, about two-thirds of CIH's financing is used to cover the cost
of imports.
75.       The foregoing estimates of CIH's business, plus additional fore-
casts for 1972-74, are reflected in the following table, which compares
actual approvals, commitments and disbursements from 1967 to date and fore-
casts for the next four and one-half years.

Resources Needed
76.      Commitments from July 1, 1970 through 1971 will require DH 166
million. In addition, CIH needs DH 2k,.5 million to cover disbursements on
commitments already made, making a total of DH 195 million. To cover this
sum, it should have cash generation of about DH 10 million and it expects
to obtain another DH 10 million from the proceeds of the most recent World
Bank loan to BNDE. The proposed Bank loan would provide DH 50 million.
CIH will then be left with a shortfall of DH 125 million.  This it will
seek to borrow. As in the past, CIH's principal source of capital is likely
to be CDG and the Bank of Mlorocco, with 70-80% of the total coming from
CDG. No doubt CIH will return to the Bank for an additional loan as soon
as the proposed loan is fully committed. Full commitment may occur before
the end of 1971 and the full loan should be disbursed by mid-1973, as shown
in Annex 11. Whether or not CIH approaches the Bank for additional resources
to complete the financing of its program until the end of 1971 will depend
upon its ability to find other sources for the remaining finance it needs;
but it will in any event return for assistance in financing the commitments
forecast in 1972 and thereafter.
Financial Projections
77.      CIH's forecast of operations through 1974 are reflected in the
financial projections shown in Annexes 7-10. CIH's long-term assets in the
five-year period ending December 1974, will increase almost 3 times,
mostly on account of hotel loans.
78.     Profitability.  As in the past, nearly all of CIH's income will
be derived from interest payments, half of it from interest subsidies.
Financial expenses are expected to be higher due to (a) the increasing weight



- 22 -
of IBRD funds (including funds previously obtained through BUDE) and (b)
the likelihood that funds borrowed in Morocco may become costlier; as a result,
the average cost of borrowed long-term funds is expected to increase fromii
4.0% in 19'69 to about 5.h4o in 1973.  Administrative expenses are expected
to rise by 5-7% annually, a small increase in the face of the expected busi-
ness increase. As a percentage of average total assets, administrative
expenses drop from about 1.7,6 in 1569 to 0.7;6 in 1974.  CIH's financial
results are expected to evolve as follows:
Gross Earnings Net Earnings after Interest and Taxes as >6 of
as % of Average  Share         Average      Average
Total Assets   Capital        Equity    Total Assets
Actual 1969            8.95        11.25          9.01          0.96
1970           6.49         15.oo        12.05          1.G4
1971           8.60         19.97        13.80          1.03
1972           8.55         23.16        14.33          0.9u
1973           6.51         17.32         12.52         0.93
1974           8.50         19.h4        11.47          0.91
79.    Financial Structure.  In 1970, CIH forecasts medium- and long-term
borrowings in excess of its disbursement needs and therefore its cash posi-
tion is expected to improve. Furthermore, CIH has received assurance from
the Government that it will pay the DH 1> million of State debt in 1970-72.
In the first part of 1570, DH 5 million were already reimbursed by the
Government. Consequently,- the current ratio through the end of 1972,
arounting to more than 2:1, appears comfortable. Debt service co-
verage offers a less attractive picture.   Although  interest cover-
age would remain at about 1.7 through 1974, principal coverage is ex-
pected to drop sharply in 1973 and 1974, to below 1.0. This deterioration
of principal coverage is essentially due to the mismatching of the relatively
long maturities on CIH's hotel loans with the shorter maturities of CIH's
borrowings. Another striking feature in CIH's projections is the worsening
of its capital structure. The ratio of long-term debt to net worth is ex-
pected to increase from 8.LS in 1969 to 13.2 in 1972, levelling subsequently
to about 11.0 after the contemplated share capital increase of DH 10 million
in 1973. The present, to say nothing of the prospective, level is high,
and calls for remedial measures. Such measures, described in paragraph 81
below., have been agreed during negotiations.
80.    Care will have to be taken to assure that adequate provisions are
made for bad debts. The housing portion of the portfolio should give no
trouble in the future, as it has not in the past. But, as noted previously,
the hotel loan portfolio has grown rapidly and will continue to do so; and
it will be impossible to avoid losses even in the best of circumstances.
Although a prudent assessment of loans in difficulty might suggest an
amount of 10-15%o of the total portfolio, a substantial part is covered by



- 23 -
government guarantees as well as by specific security. In the cirumstan-
ces, bad debt provisions need to be made for only a fraction of the loans
one would expect to be in difficulty. The provision made in the financial
projections appear to be more than adeqaate and the excess could prudently
be considered as part of CIH0s net worth. Iowever, this should be reviewed
by CIH at the end of each financial year.
81.       The projections focused attention on the problem of CIH's capital
structure: the high level of senior debt and the imbalance between the
maturity of CIH's fixed obligation and the maturity of its outstanding
loans. During negotiations, various alternatives were considered to
remedy these weaknesses in CIHi's financial structure and to give it a
borrowing base large enough to permit the debt needed to finance the bu-
siness expected in the next few years. The alternative of an immediate
increase in share capital was not feasible, in view of the tight situation
in the capital market of Morocco. Agreement has been reached between the
Government, CDG and CIH on the following points:
a. CDG would subscribe in 1970-1972 to DH 30 million of CIH bonds,
on terms which would be equivalent to a 30-year loan, including
15 years of grace.
b.   In the event of liquidation of CIHI, these bonds would be subor-
dinated to all debt incurred originally for a period of more
than a year, including debt to the Banque du Maroc.
co  The Government would guarantee the execution of the foregoing
arrangement.
d.   If the Banque du Maroc cancelled or reduced the facility avail-
able to CIHi, tIh Government would provide long-term resources
in an equivalent amount.
e.   To cover the debt service deficit of 1973-1974 as presently
visualized, CDG would subscribe to additional 15-year bonds in
the necessary amount.
In view of the subordination arrangements, the new debentures issued to
CDG could be considered adequate underp?nning for senior debt, and in
the circumstances it would be appropriate for the Bank to consider that
debt as part of the borrowing base, for purposes of calculating the limit
of CIH's indebtedness.
82.       Given these arrangements,.and the DH 10 million share increase
which CIH plans in 1973, CIH would be able to meet all presently forecast
deficits in debt service and the ratio of CIHIs long-term debt to its



- 24 -
equity and subordinated debt would remain below 6. Given the nature of
CIH's portfolio, which will continue to contain 20-25% of traditionally
secured loans for dwelling, this ratio appears prudent, and the proposed
loan agreemend would fix 6 as the limit. CIH would be contractually
obliged to manage its affairs in such a wTay as to assure that no further
deficit or imbalance arises. In the light of the discussions that have
taken place w-Jith CIH on these matters over the past year, and of the steps
taken by CIH, by CDG, its principal shareholder, and by the Government,
there is adequate reason to be ccnfident in CIH's willingness and ability
to conduct its financial affairs satisfactorily.
VII. CONCLUSIONS
83.       In five decades of existence, CIH has accumulated considerable
experience in housing finance. Only in the past few years has CIH turned
increasingly toward hotel financing; in those years it financed about 52%
of hotel investment in M4orocco. The Moroccan authorities consider CIH
the main channel of finance for the development of this high-priority
economic sector. The Government has therefore provided substantial re-
sources to CIH and financial incentives to CIHPs borrowers. Considering
the Government's interest and involvement, both directly and through CIHIS
principal shareholders,and considering the composition of CIH's Board and
Executive Committee, the Government obviously exercises considerable in-
fluence over CIH. While this influence may from time to time have been
reflected in specific investment decisions, there is reason to believe
the Government wishes to see CIH develop as a strong and autonomous de-
cisionmaking body, acting, of course, within the general limit of Govern-
ment policy. The proposed financing by the World Bank and the arrangements
made both in preparation for end in consequence to this association, par-
ticularly in improving CIH's financial position and its appraisal and super-
vision of hotel projects, should greatly enhance CIH's performance and
hence increase its autonomy. As the Government desires Bank support for
CIH, there is an opportunity, not only to provide finance for a key sector
of the Moroccan economy, but also to strengthen CIH in the process.
84.       Although CIH has made considerable progress in developing its
hotel financing operations, further improvements are needed. To that end,
arrangements have been made to strengthen staff, organization and proce-
dures, especially in the Hotel Credit Department. Particular emphasis
has been placed on:
a. improving market studies and the assessment of occupancy
estimates for individual hotel projects-
b. safeguarding against cost excesses stemming from over-
elaborate hotel design and construction methods;



- 25 -
c. sharpening project evaluation criteria, particularly as regards
(i) the professional ability of the hotel sponsors and management,
and (ii) the minimum acceptable return on investment;
d. intensifying follow-up on hotel projects, especially those in
operation.
CIH is also continuing its recent progress towards better and separate
accounts for its hotel and housing operations, and recent evidence shows
that CIH has become stricter in following up hotel arrears.
85.      CIH housing portfolio is well protected, given both the security
required and the market for housing. Hotel  loans have a larger element
of risk. Arrears affect about 25% of CIH's outstanding hotel loans but
the bulk stems from loans to two companies sponsored by CDG. CIH's financial
position is also affected by Government debts of over DH 20 million.
Taking account of the arrangements made during negotiations for a settlement
of these debts by CDG and the Government, CIlH's financial position appears
reasonably sound, with adequate reserves to cover any losses that are
now foreseeable.
86.      CIH has achieved a substantial volume of lending both to housing
and the hotels. In view of Morocco's attractions and the Government's
support to the tourism sector, M.h has good hotel business prospects for
the next few years. From mid-1970 through 1971, CIH expects to commit
loans of over DH 166 million including DH 127 million for hotels. Because
of the pipeline of projects before CIHI, and the expectation that the
growth in tourism to Morocco will continue, CIH has a very good opportunity
to realize its expectation and thereby to continue to make an important
contribution to Noroccols growth. If it carries out its loan program
through 1971, CIH will need new resources totalling about DH 1y5 million.
As in the past, dirham resources would principally come from official
sources. For the balance, CIH looks to the Bank. The proposed $10
million loan would cover about 30% of CIH's expected commitments through
1971, or 40% of its conmitments to hotels. The full amount of the
loan will certainly be committed by the end of 1971, and probably much
earlier. Disbursements should be completed by end of 1973.
87.      To enable CIH to borrow the sums needed to finance its program,
it must increase its borrowing base and must bring into balance its
obligations and debt service. Suitable arrangements to this end have been
made by CIH, CDG and the Government.
Recommendations
88.      In the light of the steps taken by CIH to improve its organization,
procedure and financial position, and of the measures to which CDG and
the Government have committed themselves, CIH is a suitable borrower.
Since CIH would be a new borrower, and since it still has to effect improve-
ments in its work, ClHts import financing needs should be covered only
for approximately one year and a suitable amount would be $10 million



- 26 -
(DH 50 million). The proposed loan would be disbursed to finance:
a. 100% of the CIF cost of imported equipment,
b. 65% of the cost of imported goods purchased in Morocco, and
c. 11% of hotel construction costs, which has been estimated
as its import component.
Arrangements have been made for the Banque du Maroc to cover CIH0s foreign
exchange risk.
89.       The terms of the proposed loan would follow generally those
of recent Bank loans made to development finance companies, including
standard commitment charge. CIHIs senior debt would be limited to a
maximum of six times a borrowing base consisting of its net worth plus
subordinated debt.
90.      A "free limit" of $100,000 would be set for investment projects
above which the Bankts prior approval would be required for the use of
Bank funds. An aggregate free limit at $2 million would be prudent.
