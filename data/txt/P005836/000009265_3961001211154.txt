IEMRANDUN AND RECOIMENDATION OF TEE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL DE'ELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF YEMEN
FOR A LAND AND WATER CONSERVATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
credit to the Republic of Yemen for SDR 24.1 million (S$32.8 million
equivalent) for your approval. The proposed credit would be on standard IDA
terms with a maturity of 40 years, to help finance the Land and Water
Conservation Project, estimated to cost US$47.6 million equivalent.  Co-
financing, totalling US$3.2 million equivalent, would be provided by the
United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF).  Benefiting farmers would
contribute US$3.1 million equivalent and funds fr'om th"e ongoing IDA Credit
1453-YAR, totalling about US$0.2 million, would be utilized for financing
pre-effectiveness start-up activities. The Government would contribute the
remaining US$8.3 million of the project cost.
2.        Economic Situation. The unification of the Yemen Arab Republic and
the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen has brought together two economies
with different orientations. With scarce national resources and a per capita
Gross National Product of US$550, Yemen remains a poor country and is
classified as least develoned by the United Nations. While the two sets of
resources together offer a better potential for overall development, the
combined economy is presently faced with serious macro-economic imbalances.
Virtually all production in both parts of the country goes to consumption,
and gross domestic savings are negative. Consequently, investments have been
financed by external resources, in the form of workers' remittances, grants
or loans; a high dependence on external borrowings has created a precarious
external debt situation. The large budget and balance of payments deficits,
increasing inflationary pressures and the prevailing high unemployment have
been further aggravated by the difficulties inherent in unification and the
recent crisis in the Middle East.   IDA is currently working with the
Government on defining a medium-term strategy for reversing the poor economic
situation.
3.        Sector Backgroud. Agriculture is central to Yemen's economy:  it
is dominated by the private sector, generates about 20 percent of GDP and
employs about 60 percent of the labor force. An estimated 1.4 million ha are
cultivated annually, including 250,000 ha irrigated from controlled water
sources (mostly groundwater) and 150,000 ha from wadi spate flows; about 1.0
million ha is rainfed.  The central focus for agriculture in both parts of
Yemen has been on food self-sufficiency and improved production efficiency.
However, achievements have fallen short of expectations. Sector developments
have been constrained by, among others, weaknesses in the central government
and agricultural support services and the poor management of natural
resources.   The main constraints to better management of land and water
resources include:  (i) insufficient specialist trained personnel in the
Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources (MAWR); (ii) inadequate
monitoring, planning or regulation of irrigation water; (iii) poor operation
and maintenance (O&M) of public irrigation structures; (iv) uncontrolled
felling of indigenous forests and the absence of replanting programs; and (v)
sand encroachment and the erosion of terraces. Since the 1960s, population



-2-
growth and the increasing demand for food, linked with developments in pumped
groundwater, have led to a situation where national groundwater reserves are
being depleted and soil salinity is emerging. Tubewells have proliferated
(mostly private sector) without any development strategy or regulation over
groundwater utilizatio.. Simultaneously, the increased demand for fuelwood,
when combined with the neglect towards woody biomass regeneration, exceeds
the scope of existing natural biomass regrowth; tree cover has markedly
diminished over the last two decades. As a result, the delicate balance
between land and water resources is now endangered.
4.        The Government now recognizes this threat to Yemen's natural
resources and has identified land and water conservation as a priority.
Irrigation and forestry developments will be dominant themes for future
initiatives, and broad strategies agreed with IDA for these two sub-sectors
provide a credible basis for sustainable development. For water resources,
these emphasize better regulation of use of the depleting water resources of
the country, complement-d by the adoption of water saving te_hnologies in
agriculture. For forestry, which has received limited support in the past,
the emphasis would initially be on technically strengthening institutional
capabilities, combined with actions to better manage and conserve existing
resources and promote community participation in enlarging these resources.
Measures needed to reduce the reliance on fuelwood for meeting- domestic
energy demand have been the subject of an earlier review; during the mid-term
review of the proposed project actions taken towards implementing such a
strategy would be reviewed.
5.        Rationale for IDA Inyolvement.  With limited natural resources and
growing population, Yemen's primary concern is to ensure optimum food
production through efficient management of its scarce land and water
resources. Although the Regional Development Agencies supported by IDA under
earlier projects (RDAs) have had considerable impact on expanding
agricultural development, a coordinated approach to improving the key sub-
sectors for land and water would contribute significantly to further
expanding productivity. Accordingly, in order to consolidate developments
from past IDA support, the proposed project addresses issues related to water
and land conservation as follows: raise efficiency of irrigation management,
institute standards for water and soil conservation, and develop a program
for sustainable watershed and natural woodland management.
6.        Project Objectives.  The objectives of the proposed project are to
strengthen sustainable agriculture, through: (i) institutional and technical
developments in irrigation and forestry; (ii) initiating a program of water
resource monitoring and regulation in the agriculture sector; (iii) improving
water use efficiency in irrigated agriculture; (iv) conserving key indigenous
forest areas, accelerating tree planting, and extending soil and water
conservation; and (v) through pilot actions help in establishing a viable
approach for watershed management and terrace stabilization. In order to
achieve these objectives, the project would support ongoing water resource
planning activities, and set up a system for monitoring, controlling and
regulating water exploitation in the agricultural sector. It would initiate
actions for improving the efficiency of water conveyance from existing wells
for more efficient on-farm water use. The prevailing weaknesses in forestry
point to the need for technically strengthening the forestry institutions



first, as a pro-condition for any sustainable, long-term program. Project
actions are therefore deliberately modest, and would focus on strengthening
institutions and developing a cadre of skilled forestry technicians.
7.        Project DesXi2tion.  The project would constitute the following
four components:  (i) Irrigation pevelnment:   Provision of groundwater
conveyance pipes to improve wate- distribution efficiency from existing
tubewells; equipment for setting up improved 1-ha irrigation demonstration
units on farmers' fields; gabion baskets and other materials for improving
existing traditional spate schemes; and equipment, vehicles and staff
allowances for implementation units in the regional agencies; (ii) Fgrestrz
DevelogUM: Technical assistance, training, equipment, vehicles, materials
and staff allowances for initiating a program of indigenious woodland
management and rehabilitation, upgrading the network of tree nurseries and
promoting tree planting, sand dune fixation and coastal sand stabilization;
(iii) Institution Strengthening: Technical assistance, training, facilities,
equipment, vehicles and staff allowances for central and regional agencies
for strengthening the respective Directorates General of MAWR, establishing
a system of water monitoring and regulating its use in irrigated agriculture,
and strengthening technical capabilities in irrigation agronomy, engineering
and forestry; and (iv) Pilot Activities: Training, technical assistance,
materials, equipment and vehicles for initiating the survey, planning and
execution  of  pilot  programs  in  watershed  management  and    terrace
stabilization, and investigating the possibilities for recycling urban waste
water for crop production, and for using saline water for irrigation.
8.        The total cost of the project, which would be implemented over a
period of six fears, is estimated at US$47.6 million equivalent with a
foreign exchange component of US$36.5 million equivalent (77 percent). The
IDA credit of SDR 24.1 (US$32.8 million equivalent) would finance 69 percent
of project costs and 90 percent of foreign exchange costs; UNCDF would
finance 7 percent of project costs, while the Government, together with
direct contributions from the farmers, would finance about 23 percent of
project costs; funds from the existing CHADP (IDA Cr.1453-YAR) would finance
less than 1 percent of total costs for the pre-effectiveness start-up
activities. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan is shown in Schedule
A.   Procurement methods, with amounts, and disbursements are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key processing events is given in Schedule C, and
the status of Bank Group operations in Yemen is given in Schedule D.  A map
(IBRD 23186), and the Staff Appraisal Report No. 9842-YEN dated May 7, 1992
are also attached.
9.        Project Implementation.   On the ground implementation would be
farmers' responsibility, supported by the four Regional Development Agencies
(RDAs) concerned in the North, and the respective MAWR offices responsible
for irrigated agriculture and forestry in the South.   The strengthened
central MAWR Directorates General for Irrigation, Water Resources, and
Forestry and Rangelands would be responsible for planning and guiding
technical installations and pilot actions, and for monitoring progress, as
well as for the central procurement and distribution of materials in
accordance with Bank guidelines. To assist them in coordinating overall
project implementation and supervision, a Project Management Unit has been
established. Farmers would pay the full price for controlled irrigation



. 4 -
materials and for operating costs of machinery for trench digging and minor
spate works.
10.       Project SustainLbility.  The project is designed in a manner which
would ensure the future sustainability of the proposed actions. This would
be ensured through measures proposed for institution strengthening, as well
as from emphasizing the close involvement of local communities, and in
particular women, for implementing key w&ter resource, forestry and soil
conservation components. In addition, actions are aimed at improving tle
overall sustainability of natural resource utilisation in the country.
1l.       Lessons Learned fro-   previona IDA Involvement.   OED Project
Performance and Audit Reports (PPARs) indicate that past project have
contributed favorably to initiating research and extension services and to
establishing infrastructure and institutional capabilities in the regions.
However, their impact has been affected by weaknesses in technical planning,
insufficient attention to management, and superficial monitoring and
evaluation. Key findings have included: (a) adequate preparatory planning
and agreement on the schedule of key actions are essential for timely
implementation; (b) late procurement and inadequate recurrent budget
allocations have impaired effective implementation and achievement of
objectives; and (c) the Governments reluctance to recruit suitably qualified
technical assistance personnel and to pay competitive salaries to qualified
Yemeni personnel have also impaired project implementation as designed. In
addition, disbursements have been slow in the past against ongoing IDA
.0redits; however, efforts are being made to expedite disbursements. These
lessons from past projects have been taken into account in designing the
proposed project.
12.       Agreed Actions.  As conditions of negotiations, the Council of
Ministers has approved a decree for regulating and controlling the activities
of well drilling rigs and to initiate a system of licensing new well
drilling; supporting regulations for enforcing the decree have been approved,
and a project management unit has been established. A program of actions was
confirmed with the Government during negotiations for adoption and
enforcement of regulations and incentives, for both water resources and
forestry. This, it=r alia, includes: (i) regulation and control of drilling
rigs would be initiated within a pilot area, from July 1, 1992, and on a
nationwide basis by January 1, 1994; (ii) future exploitation of groundwater
would be based on area specific basin plans to be prepared under the project,
which would be categorized by defined criteria; (iii) water monitoring units
should be established in all relevant governorates; (iv) multidisciplinary
teams for the watershed component would be established by September 30, 1992.
In addition, assurances were obtained that MAWR will prepare a proposal by
September 30, 1992, for establishing a direct recovery mechanism of O&M costs
related to large scale schemes; make available counterpart funds in
accordance with annual plans; and appoint key extension and forestry staff,
as well as critical consultants, according to an agreed schedule.
13.       Saylr4mental Aspocts. 'The proposed project (Bank rated category
C") would have positive environmental impact on: (a) water conservation,
through reducing water loss from evaporation and infiltration; improving the
efficiency of water consumption by extending new technologies; and increasing



aquifer recharge from appropriate control s;.ructures; and (b) land
cona2rgtati n, through encouraging reduction in the indiscriminate cutting of
woody biomass and increasing tree planting; controlling sand dune
encroachment; and piloting a strategy for watershed management and terrace
stabilization for soil conservation.
14.       Pgjoect Beeafits. In addition to the positive environmental impact
and institutional developments, improvements in controlled irrigation would
significantly reduce water conveyance losses and generate economies in
pumping costs. Crop yield's would increase through improved extension on
irrigation agronomy, while improvements in spate irrigation would increase
cereal and fodder production. The forestry activities would generate direct
benefits from increased tree plantings; significant indirect benefits would
accrue from the multiplier effects of increased community participation,
better utilization and survival rates of nursery seedlings, rehabilitation
of natural forest areas, and the prevention of sand encroachment on
agricultural lands.   In addition, pilot actions would help arrest the
degradation of terraces, initiate actions for coordinated vatershed
management, and develop replicable approaches for the reuse of urban waste
water for agriculture and use of saline water for crop production. The ERR
for the project as a whole, based on the primary quantifiable benefits, is
estimated at 19 percent.
13.       Risks. The main risks relate to delays in implementation, possible
difficulties in enforcing conservation regulations, and ensuring local
community participation, effective use of technical assistance and adequate
availability of counterpart funds. The strong commitment demonstrated by the
Government for the proposed project and the actions already taken and those
agreed to in para. 11 above would help minimize these risks. In addition,
arrangements agreed for project implementation require direct interaction
with local communities to ensure their active involvement. A detailed mid-
term review in 1995 would also provide an opportunity to make adjustments to
the project, if necessary.
if.        Recogmendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
