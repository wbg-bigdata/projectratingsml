SETTLEMENT PROJECT,
SUMMARY
i.        The proposed seven-year project is for removal and sale of
timber from areas suitable for agriculture in the Nepal Terai plain, and
settlement thereon of families from the lowest: income groups in Nepal,
comprising mainly landless farm workers from the overcrowded Hills. An
IDA credit for the equivalent of US$6.OM to help finance the project,
estimated to cost a total US$11.5M equivalent, is recommended.
ii.       Nepal is a small country (141,000 km ) and one of the 25 least
developed, with per capita GDP about US$90. Nearly two-thirds of its
11.9M population live in the Hills, where one-third of the country's
arable land is situated. Population pressure there is great.
iii.      The Terai plain, in southern Nepal, became suitable for agri-
cultural settlement with virtual elimination of malaria over the last
20 years or so. Hill people (among others) have moved in rapidly but their
uncontrolled settlement has resulted in inequitable distribution of land
and destruction of much valuable timber. His Majesty's Government of Nepal
(HMG) asked the FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program to prepare a settlement
project for three areas in the Terai, and an IDA mission visited Nepal
in October/November 1973 to appraise the project.
iv.       IDA has made six credits to Nepal, totalling US$27.7.  The only
credit for agriculture (US$6.OM for Birganj Irrigation in eastern Terai)
has made a good start.
v.        Agriculture (including forestry) accounts for about 70% of Nepal's
CDP, 80% of export earnings and 90% of employment. Agricultural GDP, largely
through opening up of new land in the Terai, grew at about 2.4% per year
from 1964/65 to 1970/71 - barely faster than population, estimated to be
growing at 2.2% per year.
vi.       Forest covers some 46,000 km  (about one third of the total area),
much of it inaccessible. The Terai and adjoining Bhabar foothills have
the most significant areas, with a commercially valuable hardwood, Sal, as
the most common species. The contribution of forestry to the economy cannot
be accurately measured, but is believed to be about 15% of GDP. Commercial
forest exploitation is mainly by Indian contractors, though HMG's Timber
Corporation of Nepal (TCN), successor to a USAID operation, has a signifi-
cant concession and operates profitably.
vii.      Organized settlement under HMG's Nepal Settlement Company (NSC)
began with one scheme in 1965; four others have since been added. The World
Food Program (WFP) provides valuable food supplies during the period preceding



- ii -
first harvests. NSC has settled about 4,300 families in previously forested
areas; but timber removal and settlement were not properly coordinated and
settlers had a hard time growing crops under trees.
viii.     The project is:
(a) felling of timber by TCN over five years from about
17,600 ha of new land and 1,000 ha of land, already
allocated for settlement, in the Terai;
(b) sale of logs, followed by sawmilling and sale of lumber
as well, when sawmills are established by TCN;
(c) settlement by NSC of about 7,900 families and provision
of timely availability of cultivable land for about 1,500
more;
(d) provision of timber extraction and sawmilling equipment, farm
inptits, settlement infrastructure (including villages, village
roads, warehouses, schools, clinics); and
(e) technical assistance for logging, sawmilling, soil surveys
and irrigation investigations.
ix.       Two project areas are in western Terai at Kanchanpur and Bardia,
each of which would have two new settlement sites, and one is in eastern
Terai at Jhapa, which would have one new site. A sixth site, already
settled at Kanchanpur, would have timber removed. The new project sites are
uninhabited forest owned by HMG. They are close to the Indian border and
railway terminals.
x.        Timber would be extracted from Kanchanpur and Bardia by winch
lorries of a type developed in Malaysia for similar conditions. Technical
assistance would be provided to TCN for operation of these lorries and for
installation of sawmills, of a tvpe commonly used in India. A Sales Adviser
would help TCN gain access to the substantial market for its products, parti-
cularly lumber, in India and elsewf.ere.
xi.       Each NSC settlement site would comprise four or five villages of
250 families. NSC would be strengthened by appointment of an agricultural
adviser who would be attached to NSC headquarters to assist NSC's chief
agricultural officer in planning and implementing the special kind of
extension work needed for farmers moving to a completely new environment.
xii.      Credit for farm inputs would be supplied by the Agricultural
Development Bank of Nepal (ADBN) through settlement cooperatives.
xiii.     The estimated project cost of US$11.5M includes US$1.8M WFP food
supplies and US$1.OM working capital for TCN forestry operations. It is
equivalent to an overall cost per settler of about US$1,400 and net cost of
US$100, after deduction of net incremental forest revenue. The proposed IDA
credit of US$6.OM would finance 100% of the foreign exchange cost of imported



- iii -
equipment and technical assistance; 75% of civil works, field settlement
costs, ADBN medium term sub-loans and the incremental amount of ADBN short-
term subloans for farm inputs. WFP would provide US$1.8M and HMG and farmers
the balance of US$3.7M in local currency. IDA would thus cover 52% of total
cost, WFP 16% farmers 3% and HMG 29% (including NR 10M working capital (9%
of the total) from TCN revenues which HMG would otherwise receive).
xiv.      Purchases of equipment would be bulked into single contracts
wherever possible and bids would normally be invited for delivery over
two years. For contracts above US$50,000, procurement would be by inter-
national competitive bidding, in accordance with Bank/IDA guidelines,
except that prudent shopping would be permitted for items not exceeding
a total of US$50,000 to be purchased off-the-shelf,after April 30, 1974 to
expedite the project.
xv.       Under the project, about US$23M gross value of timber would
be extracted over five years compared with an estimated maximum US$7M
which might accrue to the economy from this source without the project, an
increase of US$16M. In addition, the project would introduce to Nepal a
novel and cheap method of extracting timber and provide knowledge and
experience not previously available for Nepalese loggers and sawmillers.
xvi.      The project would make fertile agricultural land swiftly and
effectively available for settlement, increasing annual production (at
full development) of maize by 13,700 tons, mustard by 6,500 tons, paddy
by 4,200 tons, and quantities of other crops, such as legumes, millet
and jute. Gross annual value of this production would be about US$2.9M.
xvii.     The project would increase exports and help feed a growing
population, reducing pressure in the overcrowded Hills. It would substan-
tially improve the standard of living for about 7,900 farm families, now
at the lowest income level in Nepal, through increased farm production and
also through village planning and the provision of roads, simple schools,
clinics and drinking water. It would lead the way to further projects of a
similar nature. It would provide part or full time employment in forestry
to about 1,100 annually over six years, with prospects of continuance.
xviii.    Clearance of the project areas (less than 2.5% of the total
Nepalese Terai forest) would not affect ra4nfall; runoff would be minimal,
and controlled. Project surveys would lead to large areas of forested land
being left under permanently productive or protective forest, thereby
serving as natural conservation areas for indigenous wild life, which would
also be accommodated in special reserves elsewhere in the Terai.
xix.      The estimated rate of return to the economy (ROR(E)) would be
high at 42%, though sensitive to both price and cost changes, a 10% change
in either affecting ROR(E) by 12 to 13 points.
xx.       Full account has been taken of recent input price increases,
especially of petroleum based products. The project is suitable for an IDA
credit of US$6M.






NE PAL
SETTLEMENT PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
A. Project Preparation
1.01      Nearly two-thirds of Nepal's 11.9M population live on one-third
of the country's arable hill area, where land pressure is acute (40% of hold-
ings less than 0.2 ha). The Terai plain, in southern Nepal, totalling some
2.5 M ha, used to be heavily forested and almost uninhabitable because of
malaria. With virtual eradication of malaria over the last 20 years settle-
ment has been rapid and largely uncontrolled, with consequent inequitable
land distribution and destruction of much valuable timber.
1.02      His Majesty's Government of Nepal (HMG) established a Department
of Settlement in the 1950's and the Nepal Settlement Corporation (NSC) in
1963 to undertake resettlement; but timely removal of commercial timber
remained a problem. HMG asked the FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program (CP) to
prepare a project for removal of heavy timber from selected areas and orderly
settlement thereon. CP report 20/73 NEP5 of July 13, 1973, was the basis
for HMG request for IDA help in financing a settlement project.
B. Previous Credits
1.03      IDA has made six credits to Nepal, totalling US$27.7M including
the recently presented water supply and sewerage project (US$7.8M). The one
credit for agriculture (US$6,QM for the Birganj Irrigation Project in eastern
Terai) has made a good start.
1.04      This report is based on the findings of an IDA appraisal mission
to Nepal in Oct/Nov 1973, comprising Messrs P.G. Nelson, D.W. Lister, W.P.
Panton (IDA) and G.H. Grayum (forestry consultant), and on data in the CP
Report. The mission was assisted by Bank and FAO Resident Representatives
in Nepal.
II. BACKGROUND
A. General
2.01      Nepal, a small country (141,000 km ) landlocked between China
and India, divides naturally into three zones: southern, Terai, an extension
of India's Gangetic Plain; central, Hills, comprising rugged mountains from
1,200 to 3,600 m, intersected by Nepal's north-south river system; northern,
Himalayas, up to 8,000 m, highest in the world.



-2-
2.02      About 90% of the population are Hindu, 9% Bhuddist; about 60%
live in the Hills, 30% in the Terai and 10% in the Himalayas. Population
density averages 620/km2 of cultivated land (compared with India, 320/km2 and
Java 1,250/km ); but rises to 1,100/km2 in the Hills, spurring migration to
the Terai and abroad, mainly India.
2.03      Nepal is one of the 25 least developed countries.  Estimated per
capita GNP is US$90; total GNP US$1,OOOM; annual growth, about 2.4%, scarcely
faster than population (2.2%).  Nepal's principal natural resources are
manpower (largely unskilled), agricultural land, forests and water. A
Sept/Oct 1973 agricultural se:tor survey concluded that high population to
land ratio and lack of yield improvement were the most serious problems.
B. Forestrv
2.04      Annex 1 describes Nepal's forest industry and forest management.
Forest covers some 46,000 km2 or about one-third of the country, in four
roughly parallel zones: Terai and Bhabar; Siwalik Hills and lower Mahabharat;
Middle and upper Mahabharat; and Himalayas. The first is the most significant,
with commercially valuable Sal (Shorea robusta) as the most common species.
Terai density is light (about 50 m3/ha compared with Malaysian forest of
100 m3/ha or more). The contribution of forestry to the economy cannot be
accurately measured but is believed to be of the order of 15% of GDP.
2.05      The Ministry of Forest is reponsible for forest management and
for forest industries. Commercial forest exploitation is mainly by Indian
contractors, though HMGs Timber Corporation of Nepal (TCN) has a significant
concession. There are about 30 sawmills, including TCN's; most are a small
semi-portable type, commonly used in India.
C. Agriculture and Settlement
2.06      Annex 2 describes Nepal's agriculture which (including forestry)
accounts for about 70% of GDP, 80% of export earnings and 90% of employment.
Agricultural GDP growth has been largely through opening up new lands in
the Terai.
2.07      Cereals are most important but, over the past decade, yields and
per capita production have declined. Wheat, a relatively minor cereal, has
been the only one with a dynamic upward trend, due mainly to introduction of
high-yielding varieties. Minor cash crops provide significant income for
many farmers, e.g. jute, sugarcane, mustard and tobacco in the Terai;
fruits, vegetables and potatoes in the Hills, though transportation to
market is a problem.
2.08      In 1970 there were an estimated 6.3M cattle (an average of 4.2
head/holding, compared with 2.9 in India); 3.4M buffalo, 2.214 sheep, 2.3M
goats. Management is poor, genetic quality and productivity low; and there
are religious bans on slaughter.



-3-
Settlement
2.09      Spontaneous and illegal migration of landless hill people into t.ne
Terai has averaged about 7,000 families a year over the last ten years.
Most have destroyed the forest in which they settled.  Organized settlement
under NSC began in Nawalpur in the Terai in 1965, since when NSC has built
190 km of roads, 26 schools, 3 clinics, installed about 90 drinking wells
and settled a total of approximaEely 4,300 families (Annex 3). About 1,10u
have 2.7 ha (four bigha) and 3,200, two ha (three bigha) holdings; but logging
and settlement were not properly coordinated and settlers had a hard time
growing crops before trees were cleared.
2.10      In deciding on farm size, HMG faces the dilemma of offering fewer.
larger, plots, so permitting a higher standard of living (which future
generations may expect), but satisfying fewer settlers; or offering smaller
plots providing a much higher standard than settlers now have, but liable to
cause social tensions later, should income expectations increase. HMG also
does not wish to create a privileged class significantly better off than
the average farmer (see para 7.11). HMG found the average family, with
bullock power, was barely able to cultivate 2.7 ha well; it now offers 2 ha,
with which settlers are well satisfied, and this size is adopted for the
project.
Extension, Research and Training
2.11      Agricultural extension in Nepal is weak, reflecting inadequate
staff training and limited research. Extension at farm level is carried out
by Junior Technical Assistants (JTA) who have only one year's training in
agriculture and little, if any, experience.  JTA are also underpaid and
materially ill-equipped. They are supervised by diplomate Junior Technicians
from the Chitwan Institute of Agriculture and Animal Science. Graduate
staff (e.g. Deputy Scheme Managers) have degrees from India, but the
Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu now has suitable courses. The first
graduates are expected in 1975.
2.12      The Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Irrigation with a large
research complex near Kathmandu and twelve small stations elsewhere, carries
out mainly food crop research. Horticultural research, supported by India
since 1960, is concentrated in the Hills, aimed at diversification to fruits
and vegetables. USAID is helping with cereal improvement based on high-
yielding wheat from India and paddy from the Philippines (International Rice
Research Institute). Rockefeller Foundation is helping a high protein maize
program.
Agricultural Credit
2.13      The mair agricultural credit institution is the Agricultural
Development Bank (AD7,N). The Nepal Rastra (Central) Bank (NRB) supervises
Nepal banking and provides refinance to ADBN for agricultural loans (see
Annex 4 on Banking and Credit, Annex 5 on ADBN).



-4-
2.14      ADBN, established in 1968, receives valuable technical assistance
from the Asian Development Bank. Authorized capital is NR 50M (US$4.7M) of
which HMG owns 87%, NRB 11%. Loan disbursements increased ten-fold between
1967/68 and 1969/70. Recovery performance is fair, overdues being 11% in
1969/70, but since increasing to 17% because drought afflicted many borrowers.
D. Health and Nutrition
2.15      Health and nutrition in llepal are relatively poor.  Malaria and
smallpox have been controlled, but other diseases, e.g. cholera, typhoid,
tuberculosis and dysentery, persist. Control depends heavily on improved
sanitation. Little is known about nutrition but many Nepalese, especially
children, suffer from protein and vitamin deficiencies.
III. THE PROJECT AREAS
Location and Ownership
3.01      The three project areas, descrited in more detail in Annex 2 and
illustrated in Maps 10800-802, are in the Nepalese Terai, a narrow alluvial
region between the foothills of the Himalayas to the north and the Ganges
plain to the south. Selected because they had suitable land, were close to
India, the principal market, and formed a natural extension of nearby NSC
settlement schemes, they are in different parts of the country to accommodate
different settler streams.
3.02      Two areas are in western Terai, adjacent to the Indian (Uttar
Pradesh) border; the third is in the extreme eastern Terai, a few kilometers
from the Indian (Bihar) border. Six sites would be included; in the west,
the existing Kanchanpur scheme (1,000 ha), new Kanchanpur A (2,400 ha) and
B (4,450 ha) and Bardia A (4,250 ha) and B (4,450 ha); in the east, the
Jhapa scheme (2,000 ha). Areas are estimated, subject to detailed survey.
3.03      The new project sites are uninhabited forest (adjoining agricultural
land) owned by HMG and controlled by the Ministry of Forest.
Climate and Soil
3.04      Climate is subtropical: 80% of precipitation is during the June-
October monsoon, and the annual total averages 1,300 mm in the west, 1,600 mm
in the east. Soils are medium to coarse. Neutral to slightly alkaline and
initially fertile, they are capable of continuous cultivation at high
intensities with fertilizer, to which thev are highly responsive. Drainage
is good and flooding no problem. Water retention permits winter cropping
after a normal monsoon. Groundwater potential is likely, but detailed
irrigation planning awaits the outcome of a USAID hydrological survey.



-5G
Vegetation
3.05      Characteristic vegetation is semi-tropical forest dominated by
the heavy hardwoods, Sal and Asna. Forest quality varies with soil and
drainage and the degree of burning and grazing. Marketable timber has been
reduced in many places through illegal felling.
Transport and Communications
3.06      Kanchanpur is 8 km from an Indian railhead immediately south
of Dhanghari, which has a light airfield. Bardia is 2 km from an Indian
railhead to the west, at Taratal, accessible by an Indian road that needs
improvement to all-weather standards. A recently constructed dry weather
road system provides access to the UNDP Babai Camp airstrip, about 10 km
north. Jhapa is a few km southwest of Bhadrapur along an unsurfaced dry
weather road joining Bhadrapur with Jhapa town, about 25 km further west.
A branch of the Indian railway runs along the east bank of the Mechi river
(the Indian border) within 2 km of Bhadrapur.
IV. TIRE PROJECT
A. General Description
4.01      The project is a major part of HMG's program to remove and sell
heavy timber from areas suitable for agriculture in the Nepalese Terai, and
settle families from lower income groups, comprising mainly landless farm
workers from the Hills, and farmers who have suffered deprivation through
flood, drought or erosion.
4.02      The project comprises:
(a)  felling of timber by TCN over five years from about
17,600 ha of new land, and 1,000 ha of land already allocated
for settlement, in the Terai at Kanchanpur, Bardia and Jhapa;
(b)  sale of logs, followed by sawmilling and sale of lumber as
well, when sawmills are established by TCN;
(c)  settlement by NSC of about 7,900 families and provision of
timely availability of cultivable land for about 1,500 more;
(d)  provision of timber extraction and sawmilling equipment, farm
inputs and settlement infrastructure;
(e)  technical assistance for logging, sawmilling, soil surveys
and irrigation investigations.



B. Detailed Features
Forestry (Annex 6)
4.03      Project forestry would comprise the felling and removal of timber
above 11 inches diameter, the light density remainder being left for
settlers' house building, firewood and fencing. Trees would be felled
manually, then trimmed and cut by mechanical chain saws (26 in total),
since hand cutting could not deal quickly or effectively with the large
volume.
4.04      Kanchanpur and Bardia are ideally suited to low-cost mechanical
extraction by 7.5 ton winch lorries (45 in number), of a type developed in
Malaysia. During the cooler five dry months (Nov-March), they would be
driven to tree stumps where felled logs would be winched on for transportation
to railhead or sawmill.  The customary bullock carts would be too few in
number and too slow in removing the large quantities (up to 64,000 tons/year
in Kanchanpur, 51,000 tons/year in Bardia). Furthermore, mechanical equip-
ment can handle longer, more valuable, logs.
4.05      Logging could only be carried out during the dry season but saw-
milling and lumber hauling to railhead would continue almost year-round. A
sufficient supply of logs would therefore be stockpiled and all-weather
roads constructed to connect sawmills to railheads. Winch lorries would sup-
plement 16 lumber haulage trucks during the wet season.
4.06      The Jhapa forest is unlikely to be suited to mechanical logging,
due mainly to high road costs, which could not be justified economically for
the amount of timber believed available. At Jhapa, therefore, logging would
be carried out mainly by contractors employing conventional manual felling
and bullock cart extraction. Many already operate there, but little forest
is left, except in the project area. TCN would hire them on contract to
cut and deliver logs to the three private sawmills already at Bhadrapur
or to railhead for direct sale in India, if this proved more profitable.
However, the project could provide for additional sawmill and limited
mechanical logging and extraction capacity for Jhapa if forest resources
should prove to be larger than presently assumed. Any such allocation of
capacity would be based on diversion of project inputs from the other
project areas and would not entail additional expenditure. TCN would have
to provide evidence of economic and financial viability of such investment
in Jhapa.
4.07      Nepal, unlike some Asian countries, cannot economically use
elephants for log extraction. There are not enough of them and not nearly
enough feed for them in the heavily grazed project forests.
Construction
4.08      After timber has been extracted, little vehicular traffic, except
bullock carts, would use project roads, which would therefore be mainly
dryweather, manually constructed and maintained. Fifty kilometers would



- 7 -
be provided at Kanchanpur; the same at Bardia. All-weather roads for timber
haulage would be 4 km at Kanchanpur, 11 km at Bardia. The existing road
system is adequate at Jhapa.
4.09      Buildings would be provided for sawmills and machine shops,
vehicle servicing, offices and residential quarters for project employees.
Sawmilling
4.10      Most logs now sold in India are of high quality and large dia-
meter. Project maximum annual log extraction (1976-78) would be about
80% of the present annual Terai total. While some project production
would replace existing output, the total would increase substantially
during 1974-80, though much project production would be small diameter low
grade logs, the market for which is weak and sensitive to supply. Whether
to sell project timber as logs or lumber would depend on the relative
market for the two products, and suitable assurances were obtained that TCN
would be free to sell as it thought fit, on local or foreign markets.
4.11      Sawmill units would be provided at Kanchanpur and Bardia, where
there are none now, while logs from Jhapa would be sold to existing sawmills.
14 units would be in one complex at Kanchanpur, 12 units at Bardia. Each
complex would be driven electrically by two large diesel generators. Unit
capacity would be 500 ft3/day sawn lumber (100,000 ft3/year). Sawmills
would comprise one horizontal bandsaw for initial log breakdown and one
vertical bandsaw for resawing. Units would be sited on well drained areas,
unsuitable for agriculture, and have regard to use for possible project
extensions nearby.
4.12      To make the most economic use of winch lorries and avoid
deterioration of felled timber, it is critical to turn them around
quickly at the sawmill site. Mechanical front-end rubber-tired loaders
would therefore be used, instead of labor gangs, not only to return winch
lorries promptly, but also because it would be virtually impossible to man-
handle the expected volume in an orderly manner, and so keep the mills
continuously supplied. Two would be required for Kanchanpur and two for
Bardia. In addition, one bulldozer would be provided at each area for
levelling and road construction.
Agriculture and Settlement (Annex 7)
4.13      As soon as logging permitted, NSC would set up a temporary head-
quarters and plan villages of about 250 families, each with a house plot of
0.68 hia (one bigha). following a successful pattern on other NSC schemes.
4.14      Setcuement by farmers, chosen according to criteria referred to
in para 6.10, would follow as soon as possible during Oct/Dec, when settlers
would build temporary dwellings, clear initial house plots and prepare land
for May/June rains. Sectlers would receive the remaining 1.36 ha (2 bigha)
as one plot a year later, though normally settlers would only be physically
able to open up one-third of each 2 ha holding in each of the first two years,



- 8 -
followed by the remaining one-third over the subsequent two years. The
sequence is described in Annex 7.
4.15      Cropping (see farm models in Annex 7, Tables 1-5) would be based
on maize (mostly consumed by the family), with a little rain-fed paddy in
the wet monsoon, followed by mustard (the main cash crop) and pulses in
the dry season. Several years' NSC experience shows this to give a satis-
factory livelihood from land properly cleared of timber. Jute would be a
partial alternative cash crop in Jhapa, where it grows well and enjoys a
ready market. If farmers prefer, millet and wheat would also be grown in
suitable areas. There are possibilities fDr other crops, e.g., groundnuts
and cotton, now being tried out by an Israeli team attached to NSC.
4.16      HMG has agreed that, as with other NSC schemes, settlers would
receive free WFP food during the first 270 days and further food, if needed,
on medium-term credit from ADBN to cover any short-fall between production
and family consumption up to the end of the first 18 months. Application
has been made to WFP for the estimated food requirements for Bardia A and
Jhapa. Appropriate assurances were obtained for NSC supervision of supple-
mentary food credits and ADBN finance thereof.
4.17      Short-term inputs, including seed, fertilizer and pesticide, would
be supplied in kind by HMG Agricultural Marketing Corporation (AMC) on 100%
short-term credit against vouchers from ADBN, which would also supply 100%
credit for the purchase of medium-term inputs such as tools (axes, hand saws,
shovels, plows, harrows) and bullocks (average one per farmer).. Farmers
would buy additional bullocks (making an average two per farm) for cash,
as needed.
4.18      NSC would build permanent headquarters on each scheme, including
staff housing, a store for food and marketable produce, a small workshop,
a school for each village, and a clinic to be staffed by HMG medical service.
NSC would also provide drinking wells, and hand pumps (1:20 families).
4.19      The project would include, on each new scheme,  a simple demonstra-
tion farm and settler orientation center, equipped with a small amount of
visuial aid equipment. Extension staff would provide courses to all settlers
upon arrival, and follow-up extension until the last arrivals reach full
development.
4.20      Other costs included are for NSC operations during the first four
or five years, after which an ADBN controlled cooperative would take over.
Phasing
4.21      Before operations at any site, detailed boundary, base line,
forest inventory and soil surveys would be carried out and structural layout
plans prepared, all to be satisfactory to IDA. They have already been
prepared for Kanchanpur A and assurances were given that they would be
completed for Bardia A by December 31, 1974 and, for other sites, according
to a timetable to be agreed with IDA. Proposed phasing of land development
(Annex 8) is:

Environmental Impact
4.22      Clearing the project areas (less than 2.5% of the total forest
remaining in the Nepalese Terai) would not affect rainfall.  Runoff would
be minimal, because soils are pervious and resistant to erosion (Annex 9)
and erosion control measures would be enforced.
4.23      Project surveys would ensure that large areas of forested land,
believed unsuitable for agriculture because of erosion and flood risk, would
be left under permanent productive or protective forest, also serving as
natural conservation for indigenous wildlife. The Terai will have three
wildlife reserves; the already gazetted Chitwan National Park, Sukla Phanta,
and Karnali. The project would not conflict with these.
4.24      Farm incomes are slender and cannot afford loss of crop from
serious pest infestation (stemborers, sawfly and aphids). Small amounts
of chlorinated hydrocarbons, less persistent than DDT, would be used.
Technical Assistance
4.25      Skilled and experienced operators would help TCN (for up to two
years): from Malaysia to equip and work winch lorries for logging; and
from India to set up and run the sawmills. A Sales Adviser, satisfactory to
IDA, would work with TCN's Export Sales Manager to gain access to the substan-
tial market for TCN products in India. Assurances were given that he
would be employed by August 31, 1975, on terms and conditions satisfactory
to IDA, with terms of reference as in Annex 10, Appendix A; and it would be
a condition of disbursement for purchase of equipment that contracts, acceptable
to IDA, had been entered into between TCN and two winch lorry operators and
two mechanics, for Kanchanpur and Bardia.
4.26      An internationally recruited consultant Agricultural Adviser
would assist NSC's chief agriculturist for about three years with training
of extension staff, establishment of demonstration farms and organisation
of orientation courses for all new settlers. Another consultant would assist
HMG for about one year with a soil survey of western Terai, to find out where,
and how much, forest land would be suitable for further settlement. Terms



- 10 -
of Reference are in Annex 10 Appendices B and C. All consultants would be
expected to train Nepalese staff on-the-job, for which specific provision
is included. Assurances were given that contracts, acceptable to IDA, would
be entered into by December 31, 1974 between NSC and an Agricultural Adviser
and between HMG and a Soil Surveyor.
4.27      There is potential for irrigation, but the extent and nature will
not be known until the USAID survey, expected in a few months time, is
available. US$100,000 is included for detailed test drilling and pilot
command area development or such technical assistance as the survey may show
to be needed in the project areas, with terms of reference to be agreed with
HMG and IDA, should the USAID survey show this to be worthwhile.
Working Capital
4.28      Incremental working capital, in the form of stocks and stores and
cash for wages and salaries, is included in project cost and would be
financed, for TCN out of its other revenue, and for NSC from HMG budget.
V. COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING
5.01      Total estimated seven-year project cost is NR 122M (US$11.5M),
including contingencies, of which about US$6.9M foreign exchange. This is
equivalent to about US$1,400 per settler family for total project cost, but
only US$730 excluding forestry costs, which would be fully covered by forestry
revenue, and US$100 after deducting net incremental forestry revenue. De-
tails, summarized below, are in Annexes 11-16:

5.02      Estimates are based on findings during appraisal, including
information from the CP report and the UNDP team in the field, and en-
quiries from overseas suppliers. Basic costs date from November 1973.
5.03      For physical contingencies, 10% is added to all equipment and con-
struction costs except dirt roads and minor equipment, to which 20% is
added because quantities are difficult to judge. 10% is added to settlement
costs and 20" to technical assistance to cover possible variations in
man-months required and 20% to fertilizer costs for possible additional
quantities. At the time of appraisal, 50% was added to fertilizer and fuel
costs because of recent sharp price increases (resulting in on-site cost of



- 12 -
US$142/ton equivalent for sulfate of ammonia and US$0.75/gallon for diesel
fuel). The above physical contingencies total about 4.6% of total project
cost. A price contingency, totalling about 22.5% is made up from compounded
price increases for equipment and civil works as estimated to be applicable. 1/
Financing
5.04      Proposed financing (Annex 17) is based on IDA providing 100% of
the foreign exchange cost of equipment and technical assistance, 75% of the
cost of other selected items, including ADBN sub-loans for farm inputs (see
para 5.10). This would cover 52% of total cost, leaving 16% for WFP, 3% for
farmers and 29% for HMG, including NR 10M working capital (9% of total cost)
from TCN revenues which HMG would otherwise receive. IDA financing of local
cost is justified partly to provide a meaningful IDA participation in NSC
and partly to provide a more substantial contribution to Nepal, one of the
poorest of the developing countries. A summary of project financing is:

5.O6      IDA funds would be channeled to NSC and TCN through the Treasury
and central bank (NRB); to NSC (US$1.5M) free of cost, since it has no reven-ue
and is, in effect, an HMG agency with a special development function; to TCN
(US$3.3M) as a five-year loan with one year grace for repayments at 7.5%, the
current rate for similar HMG lending, with TCN bearing the foreign exchange
risk. IDA funds for further studies/planning (US$0.2M) would be disbursed
directly to the departments concerned.
5.n7      IDA funds for ADBN (US$1M) would be channeled through NRB.  ADBN
would obtain ftnds for project sub-loans by rediscounting them at the curren.a;
rate of 3% per year. ADBN would lend to project cooperatives at 7% for
short-term and 5% for medium term credit (up to seven years). Cooperatives,
in turn, would lend to farmers at 10% for short-term (23% of sub-loans)
secured against the expected crop, and 7.5% for medium-term (77% of sub-loans,
secured against assets purchased and a cooperative bond or farm mortgage.
The wider margin for short-term credit is because small loans need more recora
keeping and administration per unit lent. ADBN provides management to settle-
ment cooperatives, through which farm credit is channeled, and has substan-
tial administrative costs (see Annex 5 para 21).
5.08      The texts of a subsidiary loan agreement and a project financing
agreement were agreed with IDA and it would be a condition of effectiveness
that they be signed. Suitable assurances on the above were given. The
financial implications for TCN and HMG are illustrated in Annexes 18 and
19. TCN cash flow is based on payment of maximum contributions to HMG,
after loan servicing. These, together with royalties and taxes, would
adequately finance HMG contribution to settlement and other development
activities, after the first year.
Procurement
5.09      For equipment (total US$2.5M), contracts above US$50,000, procure-
ment would be by international competitive bidding (ICB) following Bank/IDA
guidelines; except that prudent shopping would be permitted for one or two
winch lorries and equipment not eyceeding a total of US$50,000 if procured
after April 30, 1974. To attract the most competitive bids, take advantage
of the economies of larger orders, and secure the benefit of standardization,
orders for similar items would be bulked into single contracts for delivery
normallv over two years. It would not be practical to bulk contracts for
roads and buildings (US$1.7M) which would be widely scattered, small in size
and spread over several years. They would therefore not be suitable for ICB.
They would be *.ubject to NSC and TCN tender procedures, which are satisfactory.
Medium-term farm investments (US$1.2M) mostly bullocks for plowing, would be
purchased by individual farmers through their cooperatives; competition is
adequate and purchases wovild be monitored by NSC and ADBN. Fertilizer would
be supplied by HMC's Agricultural Marketing Corporation from bulk purchase
by international tender procedures, which are consistent with Bank/IDA
guidelines. Appropriate assurances were given.



- 14 -
Disbuirsement
5.10      TIDA would disburse 100% of foreign expenditures for imported
equipment.  For eqtuipment supplied off-the-shelf, IDA would disbur:se 75%,
representing the estimated foreign exchange component. IDA woui finance
75% of co-nstruction, field settlement costs, ADBN mediu,m, cerm sub-loans and
the increTnental amount of ADEN short-term  sub-loans to farmers for farm
innuits.  Disbursement for sub-loans would be nade annually or bi-saznually
against _DBN's certification of expenditures, the doczanenttiol.  z.or whLich
would not be submiitted for review, but would be retained by Ak>D3- and
available for inspection by IDA during project supervision.  ThA would also
disburse against the foreign exchange cost of expatriate proje c staff. To
expedite the project, retroactive financing would be alio ed .r' t'e winch
lorries and equipment in an amount not exceeding $50,000.  A disbursement
schedule is at Annex 20.
VI. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
General
6.01       Both NSC and TCN are limited liab'lity companies registered under
the 1964 Company Act and are wholly-owned by HMG, with HM& nominees as
shareholders.
6.02      Directors are appointed by shareholders in general meeting.  Each
board has different representatives of the Ministry of Forest and of the
Ministry of Industry and Commerce. On NSC's, but not TCN's, is a representative
of the Planning Commission; on TCN's, but not NSC's, a representative of the
Ministry of Finance.
Coordinating Committee
6.03      Settlement planning has suffered from lack of coordination, which
must be remedied. To ensure coordination of TCN forestry and NSC settlement
operations, therefore, a Settlement Coordinating Committee would be formed
comprising: one representative each from the Ministry of Finance, thie
Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Irrigation and the Ministry of Forest; the
General Manager of TCN; and the General Manager of NSC. The Chairman would
be the senior of these representatives. Suitable assurances were obtained
and it wouti be a condition of effectiveness that the Committee had be-en
established.
Forestry
6.04      In :iDite of many difficulties, TCN Is operating successfully under
good financial conItrol and has staff with several years' experience of
logging and samli"'Mling.  With t'se  ro.,,ary technical assistance proposed,
it would be suitable to undertake pro,ect forestry operations under its
General 'mtanager, with an rea Manager, directly responsible to him, stationed



- 15 -
in each project area. A description of TCN is in Annex 21. TCN staffing,
on which estimates are based, is in Annex 22 and assurances were given that
these would be broadly followed.
6.05      The Kanchanpur and Bardia Area Managers would be loggers with
several years' TCN experience of mechanical operation. Each would be
assisted by six superintendents, in charge of specific activities: logging
(including roads, felling, cutting); sawmilling; yard (log and lumber handlina
at the sawmill); maintenance; personnel (timekeeping, payroll, safety,
medical and security); office (records, accounting and procurement). Techni-
cal assistance would be provided to each of these two Area Managers by a
winch lorry operator, a mechanic, and a sawmill operator and sawdoctor, all
with appropriate experience (Annex 10, Appendix A).
6.06      The Jhapa Area Manager would have similar experience but not
essentially of mechanical operation. He would have two superintendents,
one for personnel and contract services and one for office records and
accounting, and five contract supervisors to take care of logging operations
by contractors hired by TCN for logging and transportation.
6.07      At TCN Hetaura headquarters, a Sales Adviser would assist the
Export Sales Manager in making contracts in India for the sale of logs
and lumber, He would also advise the General Manager on expected markets
and prices for the various products to assist in production planning (Annex
10, Appendix A).
Settlement
6.08      NSC is experienced in settlement and understands its problems.
Ilowever, it is understaffed and has been pressed by H1MG to take on more
schemes than it can handle effectively and to accept settlers before
land is ready for them. It is important that NSC staff be built up by
the appointment, not later than December 31, 1974, of a Deputy General
Manager, Chief Agricultural Offizer and Civil Engineer and that its organizaZion
not be overstretched. Assurances were given that NSC would appoint the
above staff and, before completion of the project, would consult with IDA
before undertaking substantial additional settlement activities.
6.09      Scheme management also needs to be strengthened.  Settlement
would be organized by NSC under its General Manager, with a Scheme Manager
directly responsible to him on each settlement, of which there would be
five under the project. The Scheme Manager would not necessarily be an
agriculturist, as at present, but would have, as he does not now have, a
Deputy, who would be an agriculturist with several years' experience in
extension assisted by two or three junior technicians and up to nine techni-
cal assistants, each living in a project village. Before posting to project
schemes, all would be trained in the field under the direction of the
Agricultural Adviser (see para 4.26). Attached to NSC headquarters in
Kathmandu, he would visit schemes frequently. He would be an agriculturist,
recruited internationally, with at least five years' experience in extension
work (see Annex 10, Appendix B). Extension would be aimed at helping hill
farmers to adapt to Terai plain conditions and achieve optimum farm production
value in a completely new environment.



-16 -
6.0       etLers would be selected according to criuerl  :n Annex 23.
They would have farm experience as laborers or tenants, good health and a
fanily unic with at least two working members.  They would not zrove to a
scheme until heavy timber had beer, cleared from it.  Assurances were given
that the above criteria would be applied and that settlement areas would
be clearly marked and policed to prevent premature occupation.
6.11      With the above changes, for whiich assurances w--r- 8i v-  NSC wou.ld
be suitable to undertake project settlement.
Staffing
6.12      By December 31, 1974, NSC and TCN have agreeedi to subuil an estimate
of staffing needs for existing and proposed activities over the next five
years, proposed sources of recruitment and, by June 2&, 1974, budget proposals
for 1974/75.  For both NSC and TCN, staff should be permanent bus, in view
of the uncertain tenure of NSC employment, it might be difficult to recruit
some NSC staff other than on secondment from HMG. Sucn secondment should be
for at least three years and renewable by mutual agreemenlt ,etween NSC and
the staff concerned.  Furthermore, NSC should provide suitabl,.  ineentives to
ensure adequate staffing in the project areas.  Suitable ass;trances o^n these
matters were given, including assurances that IDA would be coisulted before
changes were made in the appointments of NSC and TCN general mansgers.
Legal
6.13      Upon selection settlers would sign ten year bonds agreeing to
abide by NSC regulations. Thereupon settlers would be issued with evidence
of their right to use the land. The licenses would prohibit fragmentation
and have clear provision for termination for unsatisfac.ory performance, but
also would assure firm title on completion of five years' probation and
payment of the established purchase price of NR 300/bigha,, at the milnimum
rate of NR 30/bigha/year between years 4 and 13 after which land would be
freely transferable. It would be a condition of effectiveness that NSC had
submitted to IDA satisfactory evidence of its right to operate and hold land
for the project in Kanchanpur A, Bardia A and Jhapa.
Credit
6.14      NSC would organise settlers into scheme cooperatives, with village
branches, for input supply and credit and sale of cash crops. ADBN (see
Annex 5) would provide a manager and arrange accounting for each cooperative.
Since NSC holds land title during the probationarny period, individual farmers'
land cannot be pledged; but no credit would be advanced to s farmer without
NSC approval, which would not be given without a farin plan havIng been
prepared by NSC or ADBN and accepted by the settler. Suitable assurances
were glven including assurances that ADBN would provide appropriate credit
to project farmers.



- 17 -
Accounts and Auditing
6.15      NSC annual accounts are about two years in arrears and should
be promptly updated. Assurances were given that NSC accounts, as submitted
for audit, up to and including the year ending July 15, 1974, would be
prepared and submitted to IDA not later' than December 31, 1974 and that:
separate accounts would be kept for the project by NSC, TCN and ADBN and
they would be prepared annually for audit within three months of the financ-al
year end; quarterly summary draft, and audited annual, accounts of the
project and audited final annual accounts for the three institutions would
be submitted promptly to IDA, as would quarterly project progress reports
in a form acceptable to IDA.
6.16      Auditors in Nepal must be approved by HMG Auditor-General.  In
view of the shortage of Nepalese accountants it may be necessary to appoint
foreign firms to ensure timely audit of project institutions.
6.17      Assurances were given that:  independent auditors, acceptable
to IDA, would at all times be appointed for ADBN, NSC and TCN; auditors
would carry out comprehensive audits in accordance with guidelines in Annex 24;
within four months of the financial year end, copies of unaudited project
accounts would be submitted to IDA; and audited accounts and audit reports
would be submitted to IDA as soon as available, but not later than five months
from the financial year end.
Monitoring and Evaluation
6.18      NSC would monitor and evaluate project agricultural progress and
would arrange regular surveys of farmer performance. TCN would likewise
monitor and evaluate project forestry operations. They would promptly submit
annual evaluation reports to IDA. The alternative of asking the Tribhuvan
University to undertake evaluation is being considered. Suitable assurances
were obtained.
VII.  PRODUCTION, MARKETING AND FINANCIAL RESULTS
A. Yields and Production
Forestry
7.01.     Total timber to be extracted under the project over five years is
estimated at 600,000 m3 (logs or equivalent) - an annual average of
120,000 m3, compared with present estimated annual average extraction of
180,000 m3 for the whole of Nepal.
Agriculture
7.02.     Accurate information on crop yields in the Nepal Terai is scanty but
iaiciy good data are available from the Indian Terai. On the basis of



- 18 -
this, Ministrv of Agriculture data, and field observations, estimated yields
(quintals/ha) of the principal crops are:
Year      1       2      3       4       5
Quintals per hectare-------
Western Terai
Ma- ze                          8      8      14     18      18
Paddy                           -      -      -      20      20
Mustard                         6      6       7      9       9
Eastern Terai
Maize                          12     12      17     18      20
Jute                            -      -      11     12      14
Mustard                         5      5       6      7       7
7.03      Estimated crop production per average 2 ha farm at full development
is in Annex 7, Tables 1 and 3, in the western Terai it would include (kg)
about 1,800 maize and 600 paddy in the monsoon season, 900 mustard and
rather less than 200 of pulses in the dry season; in the eastern Terai it /
would include about 1,200 maize, 1,400 jute, 600 millet and some mustard and
pulses.
7.04      The above yields and production assume that fertilizer would be
available at prices referred to in para 5.03. However, even if fertilizer
prices were 33% higher than the price used in this report, and with due
allowance for risk, based on rainfall probability and available yield data,
it would still be worthwhile for farmers to use it, at crop prices forecast.
B. Marketing and Prices
Fore s try
7.05.     Annex 25 is on Marketing of Forest Products.  Since the project
is near the Indian border and railheads, project timber would be sold in
India, the home market being normally supplied from other TCN operations.
7.06.     There is strong Indian demand for logs, lumber, transmission poles
and firewood, though there could be temporary difficulty in selling the
large additional amounts of projSct timber in northern India alone. In 1970,
demand for logs was about 5.2M m , and by 1980 is expeSted to reach 6.9M m3
(estimated four year project output is about 100,000 m ).  Similarly, demand
for lumber was approximately 7.9 M m3 in 1970, and by 1980 is forecast to
be 10.7 M r:m- (estimated total project output is about 270,000 m3).  Trans-
mission poles and firewood would also face favorable demand.



- 19 -
7.07.     For the purpose of estimating the value of forest production, the
prices in Annex 25, Table 1, based on average 1972-73 Indian railhead (Bardia),
have been used. These have been agreed as reasonable by the Bank Commodities
Division. Prices have substantially increased since appraisal, but this
may be temporary, and has not been taken into account.
Agriculture
7.08      Annex 26 is on Marketing of Agricultural Products.  Part of project
crop production (about 40%) would be consumed by settlers; the rest would be
sold mostly on the Indian market, with which the Nepalese market is closely
integrated. Statistics of consumption in northern India are not available,
but project production would be insignificant compared to Indian needs and
the Nepal Terai has been a regular and unrestricted supplier of food crops
across the border.
7.09      Prices fluctuate greatly, depending on harvest and timing, but
the farm-gate average in the Terai over the last five years would be a
reasonable expectation and is adopted for project estimates (see also para
8.05).
7.10      It is probable that higher global fertilizer prices will reduce
Indian usage and crop yields and hence reduce crop supply and increase crop
prices. No account is taken of this factor in project estimates (but see
para 8.08 on sensitivity).
C. Farmers' Benefits
7.11      Farm models in Annex 7 show that project farmers would be able
to feed themselves and their families after the second year of settlement and,
at full development in the fifth or sixth year, produce crops with an
a,anual total net value per family of NR 2,700 in Western and NR 3,700 in
Eastern Terai. This is less than average estimated family GDP value from
all sources of NR 5,050, but more than the average estimated annual NR 1,730
from similar sized Terai farms, or NR 1,900 from average Terai farms; and
much more than the NR 1,000 estimated from average Hill farms; or than most
settlers would be likely to earn from previous activity (average about NR
800/year (see Annex 27, para 4)). 1/
VIII. ECONOMIC BENEFITS AND COSTS
8.01      The project would provide a total NR 247M (US$23M) in gross
timber value over five years. The gross incremental value, assuming that,
without the project, the forest would have yielded to Nepal the equivalent
1/   Farm Management Study in Selected Regions of Nepal 1968/69; see also
1973 agricultural sector survey.



20 --
of estimated royalties, duties and taxes, would be NR 169M (US$16M). The
net total timber value, after deducting operating expenses and NR 36M capital
costs (including technical and physical contingencies), would be MR 150M
(US$14M), and the net incremental timber value NR 72M (US$7M).  In addition,
the project wouid introduce to Nepal a novel and cheap aethod of extracting
timber, and provide training and experience not previously available for
Nepalese loggers and sawmillers.
8.02      More imnportantly, the project would make Lertile agricultural
land swiftly and effectively available for settlement and, at full
development (year 13), increase annual production (in tons) of nmize by
13,700, mustard by 6,500, paddy by 4,200, pigeon pea by 1,300, chick pea
by 1,300, jute by 1,300 and millet by 500. Gross annual production value
after full development would be about NR 30.OM (US$2.9M) and gross value
of marketed production about NR 10.0M (US$960,000).
8.03      The project would increase exports and help feed a growing
population, reducing pressure in the overcrowded Hills. It would substan-
t-ally improve the standard of living for about 7,900 farm families, not
only through increased farm production, but also thlrough village planning
and the provision of roads, simple schools, clinics and drinking water. It
would lead the way to further, hopeEully larger, projects of a similar
nature. 1/ It would provide part or full-time employment in forestry to
about 1,100 annually over six years, with prospects of continuance.
8.04      Logs and lumber are valued at average 1972/13 Indian railhead
prices, a reasonable basis, judged by recent trends arnd information from the
Indian market, though current (March 1974) prices are about 30% higher.
8.05      Agricultural production is valued at farm-gate prices used by
CP, which correlate closely with five-year average prices for similar products
in neighboring Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.
8.06      Investment costs are included at their financial value (exclud-
ing duties and taxes) except for unskilled labor and WFP food. Labor,
both for forestry and farm operations, is valued at its opportunity cost
(see Annex 27), based on average alternative earnings of labor in the areas
from which settlers would migrate, weighted according to the numbers
expected from each area. For full-time daily labor this approximates
NR 2.7/day, or 56% of the actual wage of NR 4.8. Food imports by WFP,
supplied free to HMG, are valued at the equivalent cost of local supply.
1/   Perhaps 250,000 ha (enough for 125,000 families) may still be available
in the Terai (Annex 2, para 1) far less than is needed to accommodate
all potential settlers '1973 Agricultural Sector Survey).



- 21 -
Rate of Return and Sensitivity
8.07      Comparison of overall economic cost (including physical contin-
gencies) with incremental benefits, provides an estimated 42% rate of return
to the economy (ROR(E), Annex 28). This is high because a valuable product
(timber) is obtained at low cost and settlement infrastructure cost is kept
to a minimum by organizing it on a self-help basis (e.g. settlers building
their own houses to their own standards from available waste timber). Esti-
mated ROR(E) from forestry alone is 65%; from settlement alone, 17%.
8.08      The effects on ROR(E) of possible increases in cost and decreases
in benefit are illustrated below:
Cost Increase
Benefit Decrease   NIL   10%  20%
20%          15    7    1
10%          29   19   11
NIL          42   31   22
8.09      ROR(E) is sensitive, indicating high risk, partly because annual
net benefit without the project (deducted from project benefit to arrive at
incremental benefit) is a high proportion of total benefit. This has the
same effect as a large element of fixed annual cost and creates leverage on
the remaining net incremental benefit. As shown in para 8.08, therefore, a
relatively small change in benefit (10%) causes a relatively large change
in ROR(E) (11%).
8.10      Project risks are substantial and similar to those on many agri-
cultural and settlement projects. Despite these risks, many thousand hectares
have been successfully developed for agriculture over many years in the Terai
plain, on both sides of the border. Furthermore project forecasts allow for
the risks involved: yield estimates have been-based on an average of good
and bad years; input price estimates, particularly of petroleum based products,
take account of recent increases; product prices are based on averages over
several years and available forecasts; detailed forest inventories are
being made to provide accurate information on which to base logging and
sawmilling schedules and equipment. The main protection against remaining
risks is the strengthening of institutions and management which will be
provided under the project.
IX. RECOMMENDATIONS
9.01      During negotiations the following principal assurances were given:
(a) NSC would appoint, by December 31, 1974, a Deputy General
Manager, Chief Agricultural Officer and Civil Engineer, and



- 22 -
would not, before completion of the project, undertake
additional substantial settlement activities without
consultation with IDA (6.08);
(b)  settlers would be selected according to criteria previously
agreed with IDA, and project sites would be protected by
notices and effectively guarded to prevent premature
settlement (6.10);
(c)  NSC would not give approval for farm credit without a farm
plan having been prepared by NSC or ADBN and accepted by
the settler borrower; and ADBN would supply appropriate
credit to project farmers (6.14); and
(d)  NSC and TCN General Managers would be responsible respectively
for monitoring and evaluating project agricultural and
forestry operations and would promptly submit project
evaluation reports to IDA (6.18).
9.02      It would be a condition of effectiveness that:
(a)  a subsidiary loan agreement between HMG and ADBN and a project
financing agreement between HMG and TCN and NSC, both acceptable
to IDA, had been signed (5.08);
(b)  the Settlement Coordinating Committee had been established
(6.03): and
(c)  NSC had submitted to IDA, satisfactory evidence of its right
to operate and hold land for the project in Kanchanpur A,
Bardia A, and Jhapa (6.13).



ANNEX 1
Page 1
NEPAL
SETTLEMENT PROJECT
Forest Industry and Management in Nepal and
the Project Areas
Introduction
1.        Nepal's forest industry is poorly developed, partly because
domestic markets for forest products are small, fragmented and without
connecting transportation networks, and partly because concessions are
not large enough to provide log supplies on which to base investments in
improved and enlarged timber manufacturing facilities. Sawmilling in
Nepal has therefore been limited to small units drawing on whatever forests
and supplying whatever markets are available in their own small areas.
2.        Traditional movement in Nepal is north-south, along deep river
mountain gorges and between these same rivers as they flood onto the Terai
plain along meandering channels, impassable, during the monsoon. The
natural flow of logs is southward across the border to satisfy a heavy
demand by Indian sawmillers. Indian railroads have many spurs heading
north between these river systems and terminating within a few miles of
the border.
3.        The intermediate hills and higher mountains are largely denuded
of forest under excessive population pressure. The few remaining forests
in the hills are small scattered fragments of original coniferous and oak
forest and serve mostly to supply firewood to local villagers. Forestry
on these steep slopes is limited to reforestation for additional firewood
anid soil protection.
4.        The low-lying Terai plains have the only forests now used as
a source of industrial timber. They are semi-tropical hardwood, dominated
by Sal (Shorea robusta) and, to a lesser degree, by Asna (Terminalia
tomentosa). Both species are heavy hardwoods and Sal, in particular, has
a strong demand and high price in Nepalese and Indian markets. Other
valuable species are present to a minor degree, but they are found only
as scattered individual trees or groups, with no concentration capable of
sustaining major industries. Without low cost east-west log transportation,
a limiting factor in the development of such industries as plywood and
pulp is the scattered nature of minor species that might otherwise be
suitable.



ANNEX 1
Page 2
Timber Volume
5.        Information on area of forest and volume of timber in the Terai
is out of date. The most recent survey is based on 1964 aerial photographs,
but since then there have been major unquantifiSd changes. Judging from
ERTS images, there is an estimated 40 million m of merchantable timber
growing in the Terai, outside of the 100,000 ha reserved for the Timber
Corporation of Nepal (TCN). Of this volume, 58% is estimated to be Sal,
15% Asna and 27% many minor species. No reliable statistics are compiled,
but an estimated 180,000 m3 of logs are cut annually in the Terai region.
Forest Management
6.        The method of managing Terai forests has changed many times.
Presently, all forest land is owned by the Government of Nepal. It is
managed by the Ministry of Forest, which has a considerable permanent staff
numbering 1,840 of which 110 are professionally trained, mostly at the
Forestry Institute of Dehra Dun in India, and 596 have sub-professional
training at the Nepal Forest Institute in Hetaura. Most of these officers
work in the headquarters staff in Kathmandu or in the field divisions
covering the Terai region. Few are occupied in the hill regions. The
training of this staff and the management policies it implements, are
very conservative and not oriented toward development of viable forest
industries.
7.        Some of the Terai forests are set aside for National Parks and
Game Refuges; some, including a three kilometer strip north of the Indian
border, for agricultural settlement; and some are considered to be pro-
tective forests on eroding soil. The remainder would theoretically be
available as industrial forest to be managed on a long-term rotation.
In practice, however, the remainder, wherever soil is suitable, is needed
for agricultural settlement and the only possible way it migh-t compete
economically with agriculture, on soils suitable for both, would be through
plantations of fast growing species, which might attract large-scale
forest industries.
8.        These competing pressures for forest land and the vacillation
of management methods have resulted in a lack of long term planning for
industrial forest development. Private capital cannot be interested in
major forestry investment when log supplies are uncertain, and this un-
certainty is increased by the Ministry of Forest method of selling
standing timber in very small blocks, with delayed sanctioning of contracts
after purchasers have been determined by oral auction (see para 10).
Timber Corporation of Nepal
9.        The notable exception to this uncertainty is the Timber Corpora-
tion of Nepal, a government-owned corporation which has a large block of
Terai forest allocated to its exclusive use and a large sawmill complex
at Hetaura (see Annex 21). TCN cuts its annual log requirement from



ANNEX I
Page 3
this forest and logs are measured only once after they have been trucked
to the sawmill yard. This measure is used for calculation of royalty
payment and for TCN internal accounting. Even in TCN's case, however, its
forest area has recently been drastically reduced by the designation of a
large part as a Park and Game Refuge. Unless additional forest, tributary
to Hetaura, is allocated to TCN, the productive life of the Hetaura mill
will be shortened and some machinery will soon have to be moved to other
forest areas.
Timber Sales
10.       Private sawmill owners must bid for standing timber in small
blocks. The Ministry of Forest takes a long time to mark block boundaries
on the ground, measure every commercial tree within the block, mark
every measured tree by painting a number at breast height and at ground
level, calculate the volume of commercial trees and firewood by species
and grade classes, calculate the total value of such trees and firewood in
the block, using set royalty rstes which vary for species and product,
and finally offer the block for sale at a minimum calculated lump sum
price. The auctions are held once or twice a year in Kathmandu. The
highest bidder must sign a contract and pay a deposit of 5% of bid price
if he is Nepalese, 10% if he is not. Most Nepalese purchasers are, in
fact, agents for Indian sawmillers, who move in their own bullock cart
loggers to extract timber to the Indian railhead or to their sawmills in
India.
11.       Most recent timber sales have been in areas whieh the Ministry of
Forest and Forest Department has been directed to clear for agricultural settle-
ment. The slow processing of timber sales, as outlined above, has so frustrated
the settlement procedure that although the Nepal Settlement Corporation
(NSC) has allocated farm areas to settlers after trees have been marked
and measured, the settlers have moved in before purchasers arrived to cut
their trees.; The purchasers find settlers have killed or stolen many trees
they have paid for and trees remaining are difficult to cut and remove
without damaging settlers' homes and fields. A principal purpose of the
Settlement Project is to provide a means of rapidly removing the trees
before the settlers move in.
12.       TCN has a definite advantage over private contractors for this
purpose and for sawmilling and selling under the project. The policy
is well established whereby the Ministry of Forest needs only to designate
a project area as a TCN working circle and arrange for logs removed by
TCN to be measured at the TCN sawmill and this procedure should be followed
in the project area. If TCN elects to export logs before its sawmills
are ready to operate, logs can and should be measured for royalty and
export duty at a convenient location which will not cause delay, keeping
in mind that all profit made by TCN accrues to HMG and that it is most
urgent to remove the trees and recover their value before they are destroyed
by settlers, and to make agricultural land promptly available to them.



ANNEX 1
Page 4
13.       TCN also has the advantage of a nucleus of employees trained in
mechanical logging methods and sawmill operation on a large scale. Many
have been TCN employees for 10 to 15 years and have been trained under
USAID technical assistance and on logging and sawmilling operations in
the U.S.A. These men would form the cadres of supervisors in the Project
areas without the delay inherent in forming a new corporation and hiring
personnel to handle the forestry operation.

SETTLEMENT PROJECT
Agricultural Background
A. General
1.        The project areas are in the Nepalese Terai, a northern fringe
of the central Ganges plain buit characterized by a more moist climate,
slightly stronger gradient, atd lighter textured soils.  Until recently,
the Terai was only sparsely irhabited but improved health conditions have
since induced many landless and poor people from the more crowded, land
hungry regions of Nepal to migrate into the Terai. Here they settled in
large numbers on the comparatively fertile soil underlying the extensive
areas of forest, of which about 820,000 ha 1/ still remain of the original
2.5 M ha.
2.        The most fertile soils, in the flood plains or close to the banks
of numerous streams flowing south through the area from the Churia and
other foothill ranges of the Himalayas, are almost invariably occupied by
Tharu tritesmen. Their agricultural system is based on paddy, the staple
food crop, grown during the monsoon, supplemented by a little gram or
winter cereal. In many places surface irrigation has been developed by
the villagers, using brushwood weirs in the stream beds from which intri-
cate systems of hand dug distribution channels run often for several
kilometers, into the paddy fields.
3.        Land beyond the traditional Tharu settlement is mostly at a
higher level, relative to the neigh1}oring stream courses and flood plains,
with soils usualA.; lighter in texture and therefore drier, which makes
them less satisfactory for paddy cultivation. These lands still remain
under forest over much of the Western Terai but in the central and
1/   An analysis of ERI "'A' Satellite imagery for late 1972, undertaken
by staff n  f-he FAO Fcrestry Development Project in Kathmandu, at
the request of the appraisal mission, indicated that 819,000 ha of
foreRtec lnd remains in the er4ire Terai. About 163,000 ha of this
is classed as moderately to badv.y dissected and therefore unlikely
to oe suit.;.le for agriculture, while 6nly half of the remainder is
estinated Lo have a reasonable agricultural potential. Allowing for
possible crnservaAion ceserves, development infrastructure and wastage,
it would :e wise to assume that no more than 250,000 ha could be
devel(ned to crops, peading systematic soil survey.



AKNEX 2
Page 2
eastern sections, where the migrational trend has been stronger, very little
forest remains except near the Churia foothills where the soil and water
table conditions are least conducive to permanent cultivation.
4.        In the absence of irrigation, rainfed paddy is a risky crop on
the drier lands, espcially towards the lower rainfall western edge of the
Terai. Other crops are, however, well suited to these conditions, including
maize, which is the staple cereal of most hill migrants, and a number of
dryland cropping patterns, not unlike those in adjoining Uttar Pradesh and
Bihar, in India, have gradually evolved. Such moderately intensive rain-
fed cropping patterns, including successful maize-mustard double-cropping
developed by NSC on its earlier schemes, supplemented by irrigation where
practicable, are proposed for the project.   These are capable of meeting
the food subsistence needs of five i:o six person families and providing an
above average income from the sale of surplus farm production from 2 ha
farms. They provide employment for about 1.5 persons per farm on a fairly
regular year-round basis.
B. Project Areas
5.        Suitable sites for three of the schemes proposed under the project
have been identified at Kanchanpur and Bardia in the western Terai, and at
Jhapa in the eastern Terai. Two extensions are proposed in Kanchanpur and
Bardia referred to as Kanchanpur B and Bardia B at sites to be selected,
after survey, near the sites alreac'. identified.
6.        1MG has directed, essentiall- for border security reasons, that
priority be given to siting NSC schemes within a 3 km strip along the
Nepal-India bor(ier. Three ne-w sites within this zone were accordingly
selected by the Forest Department for the project, and a program for gradual
relinquishment of these sites to NSC, after completion of commercial timber
extraction was agreed.
7.        Unfortunately, no boundary, forest inventory, or soil surveys of
sufficient detail to confirm the suitability of the selected sites, and to
facilitate preparation of physical development plans, were commissioned at
that time. Field observation by the appraisal mission showed that, in some
places, forest was of very poor quality, and topography or soil unsuited to
successful agricultural settlement. To confirm the suitability and quantify
the potential of the land resource base, and to avoid unsuitable or marginal
areas and substitute alternate2 areas wherever possible, terms of reference
were agreed with the Forest De,artment and NSC for boundary, forest in-
ventory, soil Fuitability and -nrer resource surveys (see Appendix). These
surveys are to oe carried out by experienced professional staff from the
several competent HMCG technical der3rtments before irrevocable decisions on
development are made. Surveys for Kanchanpur A have been completed; surveys
for Bardia A will be completed by December 31, 1974 and the remainder
according to   -imeble to be a-reed.



ANNEX 2
Page 3
8.        Meanwhile, field observation has confirmed the gerneral suitability
of sufficient land within these areas to justify the project.
Western Terai
9.        The Western Terai region includes  portions of Kanchanpur,
Kailali, Bardia and Banke Districts, where more than 40% of the total
remaining Nepalese Terai forest occurs. These districts are among the
least densely populated in the Terai.  Their forests are believed to include
a higher proportion of good quality timber, and soils suitable for settle-
ment and agricultural development, than the other ten Terai districts,
where most of the remaining forest lands are likely to be unsuitable, or
only marginally suitable, because of adverse soil or water table conditions.
10.       The region has a subtropical monsoonal climate, with more than
80% of the rain falling during the mid-June to early October monsoon.
Annual rainfall averages between 1,300 mm near the Indian border and
more than 1,600 mm close to the foothills on the northern edge of the
Terai, a distance of less than 3C km. Rainfall data are extremely scanty
for the project areas, but eleven year records for stations in the neigh-
borhood bf the Western Terai sites illustrate the relative abundance and
reliability of the monsoon rains in these areas compared with other parts
of the Ganges Valley, where similar crops are grown. Statistics for
Gularia, a small town a few miles southeast of the Bardia A scheme, with
an average of 1,260 mm, suggests that the monsoon can be relied upon to
the extent of 950 mm (more than 80% of the monsoon average) in at least
four years out of five, while even the worst year (1962) gave more than
400 mm in the monsoon.
11.       The hot, humid monsoon is suitable for a range of tropical annual
crops, and this is succeeded by a much cooler and drier season in the
winter months (November-February), when the average minimum temperature
can be down to 10'C. Low and variable rainfall in these months makes
agriculture risky, and makes irrigation a special boon. Finally, late
March, April and May are very hot and annual crops can only be grown then
if irrigation is assured. The Kanchanpur A and Bardia A schemes, being
near the Indian border are both in the lower rainfall belt, while there
are possible sites for Kanchanpur B and Bardia B a little way north of the
border in areas where the annual rainfall may be 100/200 m higher.
12.       The Terai soils are developed over deep and usually coarse
textured alluvial fans deposited by the northern tributaries of the Ganges
River as they disgorge from the foothills of the Himalayas. In contrast
to the main Ganges basin to the south, the Terai soils are distinctly
coarser in texture, and have higher organic contents in their natural
state. Because of their more open structure, they more readily lose
accumulated nutrients, and are accordingly more responsive to fertilizer,
particularly nitrogen and phosphate, after continuous periods of intense
cultivation.



ANNEX 2
Page 4
13.       The Nepalese Terai falls into two very distinct zones.  The north-
ern zone, the boundary of which usually extends several kilometers from
the foothills, has a distinct gradient to the south of 1-3%, and is
characterized by medium to coarse textured soils, usually with less than
20% clay and often distinctly sandy or gravelly.  These soils, known
locally as Bhabar, are very free draining and only suitable for drought
resistant crops. They are also highly susceptible to erosion and are
among the least fertile and most difficult to manage. No soils in this
group occur in Kanchanpur A or Bardia A and they should be avoided, if
they occur, in the selection of Kanchanpur B and Bardia B areas.
14.       The southern zone, which extends over the remainder of the Terai
plain and continues over the border into India, has medium textured,
rather than coarse soils. Their cropping suitability varies according to
relief, with the lower lands close to rivers, or otherwise possessing a
high watertable or subject to flooding, being especially favored for paddy
cultivation, followed by dry season pulses.
15.       The higher and drier lands in this zone are slightly less fertile
and more suited to maize or broadcast paddy, followed by barley, mustard,
dry season pulses, or even wheat, recently introduced with some success.
About half of Kanchanpur A and nearly all Bardia A as originally selected
by the Forest Department, belong to this category. The other half of
Kanchanpur A, and a small portion of Bardia A appear to contain a much
less fertile variant of these soils, which should be excluded from the
project if closer survey and examination confirms their unsuitability.
16.       This relatively infertile soil appears to be developed over a
relict portion of a former alluvial plain, lying a few meters above the
surface of the present plain. These remnant terraces are covered by
rather coarse textured, pale colored, heavily compacted and strongly
leached soils which would be difficult to manage and would yield a very
poor return to any settler unfortunate enough to be allocated them. The
surfaces of these remnant terraces are invariably rolling and uneven, in
contrast to the almost level recently formed and more fertile plain soils.
They are typically eroded by small ravines, indicating a fast rate of
geological erosion, even under natural forest cover. The depth to water
table appears considerable in these soils, as evidenced by the poor quality
of the natural forest and presence of more drought-resistant species. Soils
of this type, which may be fairly extensive in the remaining Terai forest
should be identified and excluded srom settlement schemes, though areas
where they occur may be used as protective or productive forest, possibly
as controlled grazing or firewood reserves, and as sites for sawmills
or other industrial operations.
Eastern Terai
17.       Only one project area has been selected in the Eastern Terai
in Jhapa District, which has the only large area of forest remaining in
the east within the 3 km border zone declared a priority area for settlement
by the GON.



ANNEX 2
Page 5
18.       The climate in the Eastern Terai is much wetter, and the monsoon
of longer duration, from mid-May through October. Average rainfall is
around 1,600 mm, and humidity is appreciably higher than in the western
project areas. Paddy is the dominant crop, with yields somewhat higher
than in the Western Terai. Other crops include maize, jute, and mustard,
all of which would be included in the cropping pattern to be followed for
Jhapa area.
19.       The Jhapa soils include medium to light textured, moderately
well drained types of average fertility, very similar to those on the
preferred areas at Kanchanpur and Bardia. They are equally suitable for
settlement with different cropping pattern, which includes Jute as a
significant monsoon crop, and millet in place of chick pea, as a late
monsoon crop after jute or maize.
20.       Field observation revealed that around 3,000 ha of the central
portion of the proposed Jhapa site consisted of steeply sloping hilly
country dissected by numerous ravines in an active state of erosion even
under the existing forest cover. This area, the boundary of which should
be demarcated by ground survey, supplemented by interpretation from
aerial photographs if possible, would not be suitable for agricultural
settlement and should be excluded from the project, except as protective
or productive forest grazing and firewood reserves. The remaining areas,
including the first three phases of the on-going NSC Jhapa scheme begun in
1971/72, are all situated around the edge of the forest, peripheral to the
hilly central block. The first three phases amount to about 2,500 ha, leaving
little more than 2,000 ha land suitable for additional settlers. This
residual area comprises a narrow fringe on the west, north and northeast of
the forest, averaging about 1 km in width and stretching in an arc for
almost 20 km, which will present much greater problems of administration
than the more compact scheme sites in the Western Terai.

SETTLEMEIT PROJECT
Recommended Terms of Reference for NSC Scheme Site Surveys
Boundary and Base Line Survey
1.        In the absence of an accurate topographic base capable of being
enlarged to a suitable field scale, a boundary and base line survey is
necessary for each proposed NSC scheme site. This is required to provide
an accurate base to aid the thematic survey of land resources i.e. forest,
soil, and irrigation potential, and to permit the preparation of a struc-
tural layout plan for orderly settlement.
2.        The survey, which should be carried out by NSC staff, should
include establishment of a straight base line on the long axis through
the approximate center of the site; plotting the proposed site boundary
and all important tracks and water courses, both natural and artificial;
and the approximate location of any cultivated lands, habitations, and
any other easily identified and mappable features within the perimeter
of the site. The base line should have numbered marker pegs at 250 meter
intervals to facilitate the positioning of forest inventory and soil survey
traverse lines.
3.        The base map prepared from this 3urvey should be reproduced on
a scale suitable for land resource inventory and planning purposes (be-
tween 1:10,000 and 1:20,000 scale should be satisfactory).
4.        The best time for such a survey would be in the fourth quarter
of the year (October-December), immediately after the monsoon. A
5,000 hectare block would take a field survey party about two weeks. 1/
Every effort should be made to complete the base map by the end of the
year, in order to provide sufficient time for the resource inventories to
be conducted before the start of the hot season in April of the second
quarter of the following year. Structural layout plans could be prepared
during the monsoon season, immediately after these surveys have been
1/  The time spent in carrying out this survey can be considerably
reduced if the boundaries of the area coincide with clearly recog-
nizable land use boundaries, such as those between forest and
agriculture, or rivers, roads and other physical features, in which
case the cutting and pegging of a base line may be sufficient for
the thematic surveyors' purpose.

completed. Plot demarcation follonied by the first phase of settlement
activity could then begin immediately after the ending of the monsoon
(October), in the fourth quarter of che same year, provided commercial
forestry operations had been completed in part of the scheme site by
that time.
Soil Survey
5.        The purpose of the soil survey, which should be carried out by
professional staff of the Department of Agriculture, is to identify and
map the boundaries of the agriculturally significant soil types and to
appraise their suitability for the crops aind cropping patterns proposed.
Special attention should be given to the ineed for identifying and
mapping any areas that are unsuitable for agriculture. Survey, which
will be by free traverse, using a compass and pacing or chaining, should
be made at approximately 1 km interval, or similar interval at the discre-
tion of the surveyor, at right angles to the base line. Tracks and other
convenient access routes will also be traversed. During these traverses,
the soils will be examined by auger at intervals dictated by the complexity
of the soil patterns.
6.        Aerial photographs, if available, will also be consulted.  A
few soil pits may be necessary if unfamiliar or problematical soils are
encountered, and a small number of carefully selected soil samples may
need to be collected for confirmatory analysis.
7.        A maximum of 100 km of field traversing may be necessary to
provide satisfactory coverage in a typical 5,000 ha block, and this
might occupy up to 20 man-days of field work by an experienced soil
surveyor, assisted by the usual field crew of auger men and pit diggers.
8.        A short report, in English, summarizing the agricultural
suitability of the soils, with particular reference to any crops and
cropping patterns which may have been proposed for the scheme site, should
accompany the soil map, and these documents should be prepared within
one month of completion of the field program. Recommendations for the
alternate use of soils considered unsuitable for agriculture should also
be included in the report, and these areas excluded from the revised
boundary of the proposed scheme, within which the other surveys defined
below will be undertaken.
Forest Inventory
9.        The purpose of the forest inventory, which should preferably be
carried out after the completion of the soil survey, in order to avoid
unnecessary inventory in areas deemed unsuitable for agricultural develop-
ment, is to: (a) estimate the totahl net hoppus cubic feet of sawlogs and
total number of poles of all commercial species available within each



ANNEX 2
Appendix
Page 3
project area, and (b) to indicate, by a forest type map, the locations
of the principal concentratiprs of these commercial stands within the units
of the area finally selected for agricultural settlement. The inventory
should be carried out by experienced Ministry of Forest staff.
10.       The strip line method should be used, with strips spaced
250 meters apart and running at right angles from the base line estab-
lished in the boundary survey. All commercial trees standing or lying
within a 20 meter wide strip (10 meters each side of the strip line)
should be measured and tallied. Each "Tally" should be 250 meters long and
20 meters wide, giving a measured area of 0.5 hectares. This will result
in a sample of eight percent of the total area. The lengths of each
Tally should be measured with a steel tape and the strip widths should be
measured wherever it is uncertain if a tree is inside or outside of the
strip.
11.       Height and diameter should be measured and tallied for each
commercial tree 11 inches DBI and larger. Diameter is measured to the
nearest inch at breast height and bole height measured by 5 foot log
classes from stump height up to the main branching or to 8 inches top
diameter outside bark. Dead standing or down Sal trees should also be
tallied, if they are still commercially usable.
12.       All commercial log size trees should be tallied by species and
by Classes I, II and III; Class I trees having straight boles and no visible
defect, Class II trees being partly defective, but containing 10 feet or
more of usable sawlog volume, and Class III trees being only usable for
firewood.
13.       Species to be tallied separately are Sal, Asna, Sissoo, other
hardwoods with low commercial value and other hardwoods with no commercial
value.
14.       Sal trees between 5 inches and 11 inches DBH which meet pole
specifications should be counted and tallied as numbers of poles.
15.       A map sheet should be carried with the tally sheet and each type
boundary, stream, ditch and road marked as they are crossed in the field.
Directions of these map features on each side of the strip line should be
estimated and drawn on the map sheet so the accumulated map sheets can be
used in the office to draw a forest type map showing all natural features.
16.       The forest type categories should be:  (a) sawlog size Sal
stands of high to medium stocking designated as SAL, (b) sawlog size Sal
stands of low stocking designated as S3, (c) Pole size Sal stands
designated as S2, (d) Terai hardwood stands of sawlog size, but con-
taining few or no Sal trees designated as TH3, (e) non-commercial forest
types containing small hardwoods, including a scattered few commercial
trees, or open brush land designated as G.



ANNEX 2
Appendix
Page 4
17.       Volumes should be calculated using the Hoppus cubic foot volume
table developed by the UNDP/FAO Forest Industry Project for the Bardia
district or the official Nepal volume tables, based on a USAID study. The
volume summary should show the net volume by species grouping and should
be calculated by reducing gross volume of Class I trees by 5%, reducing
gross volume of Class II trees by 25% and not including Class III trees.
Firewood volume should be calculated by using the usual Forest Department
formulae, allowing for firewood to be made available to settlers. Poles
should be shown as total number of poles with similar allowance.
Irrigation Potential Assessment
18.       A short report on the possibilities for irrigation, from
surface and groundwater sources, should be requested from the Department
of Irrigation, based on a short (2 to 3 days) field inspection of the
site by an experienced departmental specialist.
19.       Special attention should be given to the question of water
rights and the possibilities, and problems, likely to be encountered
in reaching water-sharing agreements with existing cultivators in and
around the proposed scheme site. Recommendations for further field
investigation should be made in the report if prospects appear favorable
for irrigation.
Structural Layout Plan
20.       Immediately upon receipt of thematic survey reports favorable
towards development, the preparation of a structural layout plan for the
site should be undertaken by a competent physical planner or civil engineer
on the staff of the NSC, in consultation with the relevant specialists
familiar with the site and its problems.
21.       The plan will show which areas are to be developed for agricul-
ture and settlement and which should be reserved for other purposes (river
bank protection, firewood, or communal grazing) or completely excluded
from the scheme.
22.       Overall boundaries of village (house lot) sites and public
service centers should be located on the plan, as well as the block
boundaries of the outlying lots to be allocated subsequently (individual
lot boundaries are not essential to this plan). Main access roads to
the villages and road reserves to future agricultural areas will also
be schematically located on this plan, following a careful study of the
land resource conditions shown on the topographic and thematic maps.
Roads and villages should keep as much as possible to higher ground; lot
boundaries should be drawn to coincide with obvious physical boundaries,
such as waterways and terrace edges, and every effort should be made to
avoid gullies and effect a fair distribution of lower lying lands or
other areas best suited to rainfed or irrigation agriculture between the
several villages and individual settlers.



ANNEX 2
Appendix
Page 5
23.       Consideration must be given to integrating the village road
network with the pattern of forest extraction routes which will be
used during the timber exploitation phase of development.
24.       Detailed plot layouts showing the boundaries of individual
settler lots will only be drawn up subsequent to NSC Board approval of
the structural layout plan.

Introduction
1.        The migration of landless hill dwellers into the Terai has been
evident for at least four decades, and has accelerated considerably in
recent years since Government (HMG) commenced large-scale malarial eradication
programs on the plain during the nineteen fifties. 1/ A Department of Re-
settlement was established in the Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Irrigation
to control this spontaneous movement and to organize migrant settlements
on some of the more favorable sites.
2.        The first large schene was at Hetaura, on the Inner Terai close
to the road between Kathmandu and the Indian border. This was followed
in the mid-nineteen fifties by the Rapti Valley resettlement scheme;
mainly for families who had lost their lands as a result of landslides
during the particularly heavy 1954 monsoon.
3.        The overwhelming demand for places on these and other, smaller
schemes, and the rash of illegal settlement which sprang up in many
Terai forest areas in the late nineteen fifties caused HMG to expand
its organized settlement activities through the creation of the
Nepal Settlement Company (NSC). This corporation was finally estab-
lished in 1963 following acceptance of the recommendations contained
in an Israeli report. The new corporation was made responsible for the
larger settlements.
4.        The Department of Resettlement, to which the NSC was attached,
retains direct responsibility for all smaller schemes, usually less than
200 families. Coordination between the two official bodies is largely
effected through the Commissioner in charge of the Department who is
also the Chairman of NSC board. The other five board members are presently:
Director-General for Agriculture; representatives of the Planning Commis-
sion, Ministry of Industry and Commerce, Ministry of Water and Power; and
the Chief Conservator for Forests, or his representative. The General
Manager is secretary to the board.
1/   Based on recent census figures, 400,000 persons are estimated to
have migrated to the Terai during the 10 year period 1961/71 and
to have occupied about 120,000 ha. This is equivalent to 6,700 families
per year and 1.8 ha per family, assuming 6 persons per family.

5.        The NSC is a private limited company, formed in 1963 under the
Nepal Companies Act, with authorize,i share capital of NR 2 M (US$0.19 M)
in 20,000 ordinary shares of NR 100 each. It is wholly owned by HMG. The
financial year ends on July 15, in conformity with the Nepalese calendar
and the Government fiscal year.
6.        NSC aims and objectives are to plan and carry out the systematic
distribution of land in model settlements, and to assist settlers to
improve their farming through provision of advice and credit.
History
7.        The first, small, NSC scheme was inaugurated in 1965 at Nawalpur,
in the Western Terai. This was followed in 1968 by a second scheme, at
Banke in the same region. Both these schemes are now almost completed with
about 2,300 families settled, and NSC is concentrating its efforts on four
others: at Jhapa, in the Eastern Terai, and at Yanchanpur, Bardia, and
Nawalpur II, all in the Western Terai. The proposed project would include
an improved continuation of the first three of these schemes and two
additional schemes at sites to be identified near Kanchanpur A and Bardia A.
8.        During the peak development period of the Nawalpur and Banke
schemes in 1966/69, the annual intake of settler families averaged 550,
but dropped to around 150 in the two subsequent years. In 1971/72, the
second phase of settlement activity commenced with acceptance of 900 fami-
lies, followed by 1,300 in 1972/73.
9.        The NSC achievement of 4,300 families settled in its first
eight years, together with possibly half that number settled directly
through the Department is equivalent to about 12% of the tot:al number
of migrant families believed to have moved into the Terai during that
period. The remaining 88% comprise illegal occupiers of forest land
scattered over much of the plain, but concentrated especially in the
few remaining forest areas of the central and eastern Terai.
10.       Recognizing the size of the settlement problem, the hardships
and illegalities involved, and the inevitability of the trend, which is
likely to persist until all agriculturally suitable land in the Terai
is fullv developed, HM. recently approved an expanded NSC settlement
program to cover the five years through to 1978.
11.       The project would contribute towards these totals commencing in
1975/76 when 405 families will be settled, rising to 855 in 1976/77 and
2,045 in 1977/78 (Annex 8), by which time the number settled under the
project will exceed the current NSC program target.
12.       The targets set for the early years of the current five year
program are tnduly high, recognizing the inevitable delay which will be
experienced in extracting timber from the designated sites, but the
targets in the last year, and subsequently, could be raised.



ANNEX 3
Page 3
13.       An alternative program through to the end of the project
period, would take due account of the likely constraint in timber
clearance and assume that additional schemes, which might possibly be
included in an IDA continuation project, are brought in towards the end
of the present project. An indispensable condition of such a program
would be that no settler is permitteid to enter his land until the area
concerned has been worked of its commercial timbers.
14.       Four bigha (2.7 ha) of land used to be provided for each family
in the early years, but the allocation was later reduced to three bigha
(2.0 ha) when experience showed that the larger area was generally too
much for the average family to manage and the smaller area was sufficient
to meet the employment needs of the average family while providing an
adequate living.
15.       Israeli agricultural specialists have worked with the NSC
since its inception and have developed a rainfed farming system well
suited to the needs of the hill migrants who form the bulk of the NSC
settler intake.
Settlement Design
16.       Settlers would be provided under the project with 2 ha (3 bigha)
of land in two parcels, comprising a house lot of 0.68 ha (1 bigha) and
a main farm lot of 1.36 ha (2 bigha). The house lot strips would be
laid out in villages of 250 families, each lot having road frontage at
one end of the strip, and the settler would have to construct his permanent
house within 16 m of this frontage. The main farm lots would surround the
village lots which would be sited as close to the geographic center of the
area as natural circumstances would permit. The total area occupied by each
village community would cover about 550 ha, after allowing for village
infrastructure (roads, schools, junior technical assistants quarters and
wastage). Potable water would be provided from hand pump tubewells at the
rate of one well to 20 settlers.
17.       The relatively homogenous physical conditions on the selected
scheme sites make it possible to subdivide the land and relate the house
lots to farm lots in such a way that a settlers' two parcels are unlikely
ever to be more than 1.5 km apart, and the average is likely to be about
1 km.
18.       NSC village layouts have to date followed a rather stereotyped
geometric design ignoring important physical variations in the land, and
the early appointment of an engineer planner to prepare structural layout
plans for each scheme based on data forthcoming from the proposed scheme
site surveys (Annex 2, Appendix) is essential to the preparation of
soundly based village plans, and the continuous introduction of design
improvements based on NSC experience.



ANNEX 3
Page 4
Problems
19.       The main problems facing NSC are:
(a) constraints in the choice of scheme sites;
(b) overlap of commercial timber operations with forest
clearing and cultivation activities;
(c)  difficulty in recruitment and retention of trained
and experienced managerial and technical staff.
20.       Selection of sites for NSC schemes has been determined 'Largely by the
Ministry of Forest and Forest Department and, in the case of the moat recent schemes,
has been limited to a 3 km zone along the Indian border, declared a high prior-
ity area for settlement largely for security reasons. NSC ought to be in
a position to select sites from a wider range of suitable lands and to
carry out adequate surveys to confirm their suitability and to provide a
sound basis for planning.
21.       The five-year settlement program (1973-78), approved by NSC
board and by HMIG, calls for 2,600 families to be settled in 1974/75,
rising to 3,100 families in each of the two following years. The program
does not appear to be well integrated with commercial timber extraction.
The practice of allocating land to settlers and encouraging them to
construct their houses and cultivate their land before or during timber
extraction should cease immediately because it interferes with, delays,
and on occasion even prevents the orderly working of the forest. It
also makes life more difficult for the settlers because their crop yields
are much reduced through excessive shade, root competition, and pest damage
from the forest remaining on the land.
22.       NSC administrative and junior technical staff have been appointed
through the Public Service Commission while senior technical staff are
obtained through short-term secondment from Government departments.
Neither of these methods is entirely satisfactory for they lead to delay
and often result in inappropriate appointments. NSC should be free to
hire and fire employees at its discretion, subject only to control by its
"oard of directors. The practice of obtaining senior agricultural staff
'r short-term secondment is particularly harmful for an organization which
depends on a high level of specialized agricultural expertise for its
success. At present, staff seconded from the Department of Agriculture
spend only two years with NSC. During this period they gain an under-
standing of the special problems of NSC settlers, who lack experience
of the Terai environment; but before they can apply their new knowledge,
thev revert to their parent service. A scheme of service for agricul-
tural staff comparable with that of the Department of Agriculture-which
will enable NSC to attract and hold skilled and experienced agriculturalists
is an urgent necessitv. Assurances were given that NSC would appoint
qualified staff at headquarters and within project areas and provide them
with suitable incentives to retain them.



ANNEX 3
Page 5
Conclusion
23.       After 10 years' experience and the more or less successful
implementation of its first two schemes, NSC is in a good position to
expand its operations by developing new schemes in other parts of the
Terai. In this way it will become the main institutional vehicle for
the transfer of poor families from the land-hungry hill and mountain
tracts to well planned settlements in fertile portions of the plain.
It has developed, with Israeli help, an effective farming system suitable
for these migrants, and has built up an extension and (in association
with ADBN) credit service which, with some strengthening and continued
improvement, should provide adequate livelihoods for settler families
much superior to that possible in their places of origin.
24.       More careful attention to scheme site identification-from a
wider choice of possible areas, improved planning capability, which
would allow particularly for the proper phasing of commercial timber
extraction in advance of settlement, and a strengthening of the quality
of managerial and especially technical staff, will be especially
important during the forthcoming expansion phase in NSC activities.

NEPAL
SETTLEMENT PROJECT
Banking and Credit
A. General
1.        The purpose of this Annex is to outline the Banking and Credit
system in Nepal, with particular reference to agriculture. It is based
on interviews with staff of the Nepal Rastra (Central) Bank (NRB) and the
Agricultural Development Bank, and on documents listed in the Appendix.
Note Issue
2.        NRB aims to match note issue with demand by allowing it to
increase in line with factors which create demand, currently increasing
at the rate of 10% per year on account of:
Percent
Price increases                         4
Increased domestic product              4
Monetization                            1
Replacement of Indian Currency          1
10%
3.        The currency (NR 739 M, mid-April 1973) is backed by NRB's
holding of foreign exchange (89%) including Indian rupees, gold, coin
and bullion (5%), silver (3%) and coinage (3%).
4.        Banking and Credit are controlled by NRB under the Nepal Rastra
Bank Act of 1955, whiclh requires NRB to issue and regulate the national
currency, stabilize the exchange rate, take custody of foreign exchange
reserves, mobilize capital for economic development and the stimulation
of trade ar-d industry, develop the banking system, and act as banker,
fiscal agent and adviser to His Majesty's Government of Nepal (HMG) on
financial mnatters. It is also required to maintain an agricultural
credit section to study questions relating to agricultural credit, and
mav icnd against security to other banks and institutions, purchase, sell
or underwrite their shares or debentures, but not take a direct interest
in an- cormerciai, industrial or other undertaking, nor engage in trade.



ANNEX 4
Page 2
NRB Direction, Management and Capital
5.        HMG, through the Ministry of Finance, after consulting with
NRB's Governor, may give directives to NRB, subject to which, NRB Board
of Directors is entirely responsible for its direction and management.
The Board has five to seven members. The Governor is Chairman and is
appointed for three years. The other members are up to two Deputy
Governors and four members appointed for two years, but retiring in
rotation. All may be re-appointed.
6.        NRB has an Issue and a Banking Department and an Agricultural
Credit Section. Authorized capital is NR 10 M fully subscribed and
paid up by HMG, the sole shareholder.
7.        NRB functions are similar to those of most central banks,
except that it may accept deposits from anyone and make loans directly
to agricultural cooperatives.
B. The Banking System and Financial Institutions
Banks in Nepal
8.        There are only two commercial banks in Nepal:  Nepal Bank Ltd
with assets of about NR 700 H (US$65 M) and Rastriya Banijya Bank with
assets of about NR 300 M (US$28 M). For mid-July 1973 figures (compared
with mid-July 1972) see Table 1. The high proportion of Fixed and Savings
Deposits is a notable feature, encouraged by relatively high deposit rates
(5% Savings and up to 8.5% Fixed); but these deposits can be fairly easily
liquidated.
9.        The wholly Government-owned Agricultural Development Bank (ADBN),
with assets of about NR 240 H (US$23 M) (including about NR 100 H from
the Land Reform Savings Corporation) and planned to increase to NR 480 M
by 1977/78, is the principal source of credit for agriculture. The Nepal
Industrial Development Corporation (owned by HME and NRB), with assets of
about NR 140 M (US$13 M) (mid-July 1972) provides mainly medium and long
term finTncing, including equity, to Nepalese private industrial enterprises.
Nepal Bank Ltd
10.       Nepal Bank Ltd, which now has 55 branches, was formed in 1937
under a special Act, replaced by the Commercial Bank Act in 1964. Author-
ized capital is NR 10 M. Only HMG or Nepal citizens may own its share
capital. HMG owns 52%. The seven-member Board includes a Chairman who,
with three other members, is nominated by HMG; the others are nominated
by the remaining shareholders.



ANNEX 4
Page 3
11.       Nepal Bank, as is traditional with commercial banks, finances
trade, commerce and consumption, but very little agricultural activity,
apart from produce marketing. It has rather underlent its resources
and had 24% of assets in liquid form in mid-July 1973 (Table 1).
Rastriya Vanijya Bank
12.       HMG formed Rastriya Varijya Bank as a commercial bank in
January 1966 to introduce an element of competition into banking and
to provide facilities over a wider area. Authorized capital is NR 10 M
and HMG is still the sole shareholder. It also has a seven member Board
of which five, including the Chairman, are appointed by HMG and two by
NRB.
13.       Its functions and limitations are similar to those of Nepal Bank
but it may also act as NRB agent. It has 33 branches. Like Nepal Bank,
it makes few loans for agricultural purposes. It had even higher liquidity
in mid-July 1973 with 38% of assets in liquid form (Table 1).
Agricultural Development Bank (ADBN)
14.       ADBN is described in Annex 5.
Credit Control
15.       NRB controls credit under a general regulation of 1966 by:
(a) fixing rates of interest for particular purposes;
(b) providing rediscount facilities, up to certain limits,
at rates related to development priorities;
(c) requiring banks to lend not more than prescribed
proportions of amounts for various purposes (e.g. 60%
for imports, or a "margin" of 40%).
16.       Regulated lending rates of interest effective from May 31, 1973
(mostly unchanged since April 14, 1971) are in Table 2. They vary from 6.5%
for export bill credit to 13% minimum for non-domestic hire purchase. Loans
for agricultural development have a maximum rate of 7.5%; for agricultural
production, 10%. ADBN has a separate schedule of maximum permitted lending
rates, in line with, but more detailed than, commercial bank rates (Annex 5,
Table 2). There are no limits on lending rates for purposes not subject
to regulation.
17.       Maximum permissible borrowing rates and NRB rediscount rates
are in Table 3. Rediscount rates vary from 4% (for up to 100% of the
amount lent) for export bill credit to 6% (for up to 90% of amount lent)
for advances to purchase machinery and parts for non-priority Nepalese
industr ies (loans to priority industries may be rediscounted up to 90%
at 4.5%). Rediscount for agricultural development advances is up to 90%



ANNEX 4
Page 4
at 5.5%; for the sugar industry 90% at 4.5% and to the Agricultural
Marketing Corporation, 100% at 4.5%. ADBN has a special rediscount
arrangements at rates listed in Annex 5, Table 1.
Expansion of Branch Banking
18.       NRB has created a fund, to which the commercial banks subscribe
10% of the profits, for the expansion of branch banking. It is used to
subsidize losses of prescribed branches up to 100% in Year 1, 75% year 2
and 50% year 3; also to provide interest-free loans to provide funds for
such branches.
Credit Survey
19.       NRB made a very extensive survey of agricultural credit needs
in 1969/70 and concluded, inter alia:
(a) agricultural credit needs probably exceed NR 80 M
without change in farming methods, but approach
NR 1,000 M if improved technology is to be
introduced;
(b) credit and improved technology could increase farm
income by 90% in the Hills, 40% in the Terai;
(c) about 70% of all credit needs would be long term;
(d) 70% of short term credit would be for household
(mostly food) consumption, now suppli.ed by village
moneylenders and merchants.
Non-Institutional Lending
20.       Moneylenders and merchants probably lend more than banks and
financial institutions in Nepal, though the amount is unrecorded. The
NRB survey estimated they provide about 80% of total farm credit at
nominal interest rates between 25% and 50% per annum, but probably higher
because prices paid for pledged produce are below market value. Most
such lending is for family expenses (e.g. food before harvest) but 33%
is estimated to be for longer term purposes and 20% for farm production
inputs.
Conclusion
21.       The principal problem of the Nepalese banking system is to
provide more outlets for lending, with security acceptable to the com-
mercial banks for, in recent years, not less than 25% of their resources
have remained unused. The 8% reserve requirement has, in effect, been a
purely nominal requirement, and the rediscount facilities have not been
necessary to maintain liquidity, though they have encouraged lending for



ANNEX 4
Page 5
particular purposes by providing a ready source of liquidity at rates
lower than normal deposit rates.
22.       HMG and NRB are making a real effort to expand the banking
system and to make credit available country-wide, especially to agriculture
(through ADBN).

Agricultural Development Bank of Nepal
Background and Purpose
1.        The Agricultural Development Bank of Nepal (ADBN) was established
by special Act of October 23, 1967 as an autonomous corporation, successor
to the Cooperative Bank of Nepal, to provide loans on short, medium and
long term to individuals, cooperative societies, village committees, cor-
porate bodies and tenants (including loans for purchase of land tilled by
tenants), all for the purposes of agricultural development. ADBN is
required to follow commercial policies and principles conducive to such
development. Minor amendments were made to the Act on April 10, 1969,
October 22, 1971, and October 15, 1973. One amendment required Government
(HMG) prior approval for foreign borrowing.
Ownership
2.        Authorised share capital is NR 50 M (US$4.7 M). HMG must own at
least 51% of the paid up share capital. All cooperative unions must sub-
scribe one share of NR 100, and individuals borrowing more than NR 10,000
are required to purchase one share for each NR 10,000 borrowed. At
July 15, 1973 the total issued capital was NR 44.8 M subscribed as follows:
NR million
Government                              38.7
Nepal Rastra Bank (wholly
Government owned)                      5.0
Others                                   1.1
4 48
3.        HMG intends to subscribe NR 10 M and Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB)
NR 5 M annually over the next few years, and the authorised share capital
will be increased as necessary, with prior approval of Government.
4.        ADBN has extensive borrowing powers, subject to approval of
Government, in consultation with NRB, and has rights to rediscount its
entire portfolio with NRB at various rates of interest (Table 1), to meet
its financing needs.



ANNEX 5
Page 2
5.        The Land Reform Savings Corporation (LRSC), with assets of book
value about NR 96 M, has recently been amalgamated with ADBN on satisfactory
terms, which included a Government guarantee for about NR 22 M doubtful
assets.
Organization and Management
6.        By the 1973 amending Act, ADBN Board was increased from 7 to 11,
comprising the Executive Chairman/General Manager, one representative each
of: NRB, two Nepal commercial banks, the cooperative movement, and farmers;
two representatives of the shareholders; three representatives of HNM, (from
the Ministries of Land Reform, and Food and Agriculture, and the National
Planning Commission). HNG nominates the Chairman on the recoumendation of
the Minister of Agriculture. The Chairman holds office for five years, the
other directors for three, and they may be re-appointed. The Deputy
General Manager is presently on overseas training. The Board also appoints
senior staff in the three highest pay brackets (of a total of seven staff).
The General Manager is responsible for all other staff appointments.
7.        Under the General Manager are six Divisions:  Administration
(Personnel); Research and Planning; Audit; Accounts; Loan; Cooperatives and
Institutions. The Division Chiefs all have Commerce Degrees or equivalent,
two from US Universities, the other four from the Nepal Tribhuvan University;
four have attended cooperative or credit training courses in USA or UK.
The Chief of the Accounts Division is, in addition, a. Chartered Accountant
of India. There is also a Legal and a Training and Information Section.
The Asian Development Bank has ably assisted ADBN in reorganizing its
administration, policy and planning, and the organization is a model of
its kind.
8.        ADBN has 11 branches and 21 sub-branches, increased during the
past year from 9 and 13. Further expansion to a total of 75 offices by
1977/78 is planned. Total staff is 247 of which 105 supervisory (officer
level); 69 (42 supervisory) are in the Kathmandu head office and 178 (63
supervisory) in branches and sub-branches. ADBN has a regular staff
training program (under the Training and Information Section) but will be
hard pressed to meet its expansion target.
Lerdtfng Policies and Procedures
9.        Within the general principles outlined in para 1, and the
constraints of NRB directives, particularly on interest chargeable and
payable (see Annex 4), ADBN specifies standard terms and conditions for
different types of loans, the most important being short-term cereal
production loans (up to 18 months). They are almost all based on standard
per hectare farm plans, worked out by the branch for the particular area
and crop and approved by head office. Up to 50% of a farmer's expected
crop proceeds (net of rent payable), valued at the previous season's
average prices, may be borrowed; the interest rate is 10% per annum. The
loan is repayable within 30 days of harvest and secured against the crop.



ANNEX 5
Page 3
Production loans are made, mostly in kind, by issuing vouchers against the
Agricultural Marketing Corporation (and some authorized dealers) for inputs,
such as seed, fertilizer, pesticide, small farm tools and equipment; loans
in cash are by instalments against payment of such items as irrigation
charges and transplanting expenses. Borrowers must be members of a recog-
nised cooperative (usually ADBN managed) and the loan is made through the
cooperative, which is charged 7% annual interest. Maximum loan amount is
based on standard farm plans for crop and area (not exceeding 6.7 ha).
10.       ADBN, through cooperatives which it manages, will also advance
up to 25% of the estimated value of the crop in the field, and will make
this up to 70% of the actual value of crop delivered, if producers wish
to await better market opportunities. These percentages are inclusive of,
not in addition to, any production loan a borrower may have for the same
crop. Security for these marketing loans is the crop, plus a bond from
the borrowing cooperative and plus a farm mortgage for loans to individual
farmers. Interest is 10% to the farmer, 7% to the cooperative; repayment
within 120 days, extended to 180 days if justified. Loans are also made
to approved dealers and ADBN-managed cooperatives for purchase and stocking
of inputs up to 80% value, repayable within 30 days of input sale at annual
interest of 10% for dealers, 7% for cooperatives, secured by a lien on
inputs plus cooperative bond or dealer mortgage.
11.       Another important category is bullock loans to cooperatives or
to farmers with at least 1.3 ha in the Terai (less in the Hills). Repayment
is over three years at 10% for individuals, 6% for cooperatives; security
is cooperative bond or farm mortgage. Standard rates of interest for ADBN
short, medium and long term credit are in Table 2. These rates are fixed
by NRB which allowes higher rates for short term lending because of the
higher cost per unit lent of recording and supervising the generally
smaller short term loans, and the greater risk they may entail.
12.       ADBN allows a rebate of 0.5% for early repayment, by at least one
month, of medium and long term installments. Penalties are charged for
delinquent instalments; for short term loans, 2% per annum for the
first month; 3.5% next five months; 5% thereafter. For medium and long
term loans, 2% per annum for the first three months; 3.5% for three months;
5% thereafter.
13.       Loan approval limits are:

Higher limits to head office.
14.       Though ADBN has the right to seize property without court order,
it is required to give notice as follows: within 15 days, first notice;
30 days, second; 45 days; third; followed by liability to legal action and
seizure. After 35 days, the names of delinquents are published.
Cooperative Management
15.       An interesting feature of ADBN operations is its management
of cooperative societies.
16.       Cooperatives increased in number during the twelve years of
their existence to about 1,300, of which 1,100 agricultural. Most were
disastrous failures financially, usually because of poor management,
and are being liquidated or reorganized. Following this experience, in
which LRSC suffered the worst, HMG instituted a Cooperative Revitalization
Program under the Fourth Five Year Plan, under which ADBN undertook to
employ and properly to train cooperative managers. It will not now normally
lend to cooperatives it does not control, and presently manages more than
150. Another 173 are planned for ADBN management over the next eight years.
As part of the Program, up to ten well-organized cooperative unions are being
established, mainly through reorganization and merger of existing societies,
in each of 28 districts selected for intensive agricultural development. The
Program is intended eventually to cover all 75 districts of Nepal.
17.       In addition to providing a manager, ADBN ensures that an accountant
is appointed and subsidises the operating cost of cooperatives and village
committees where necessary. A Junior Technical Assistant is appointed at
IIMG expense and trained by ADBN to help the manager with extension and
farm credit plans. ADBN loan officers make sample checks, before ADBN
financed cooperative lending is approved, and cooperatives report monthly
to the nearest ADBN branch. Cooperatives help members obtain ADBN loans of



ANNEX 5
Page 5
inputs in kind, usually with an undertaking to sell crop surpluses as the
cooperative directs, so that loan repayments may be collected from the
proceeds. Cooperatives also help farmers sell their surpluses and provide
storage facilities, usually also financed by ADBN loans.
Resources
18.       ADBN is well supported financially by HMG and, through rediscount
facilities, by NRB, which is used for residual financing. Summarized actual
and forecast balance sheets and profit and loss accounts for the last five
years (from last 10-year record supplied by ADBN) and next five years, are
in Tables 3 and 4. An analysis of the 1972/73 accounts shows that, of
assets totalling NR 82.3 M (US$7.8 M), the loan portfolio represented 70%,
receivables (including interest due) 16%, other assets 14% (including cash
and bank balances 8%). These were financed by share capital and reserves
58%, borrowing 27% (including NRB rediscounts 14%), deposits 6%, other
sources 9%. The Asian Development Bank has lent NR 835,000 (US$79,000).
An encouraging feature is the increase in deposits from NR 3.7 M in 1968/69
to NR 5.8 M in 1972/73.
19.       ADBN is not required to pay dividends and retains all surpluses.
It is required to place a minimum 20% of its net profit to a Reserve Fund.
20.       Accounts are audited by Sharma & Co, an independent firm of
auditors approved by the Auditor-General of Nepal.
21.       The following ratios are from the accounts:

The above confirms that ADBN aims to cover its expenses, taking one year
with another, but does not earn much on its equity capital. ADBN is
subsidised to the extent that this capital earns no return. Debt/equity
ratio has been reasonable but will rise sharply with the takeover of LRSC
portfolio and consequent extra debt financing under special low cost and
guarantee arrangements with HMG.
22.       Administration cost is high (6.8% of loan portfolio in 1972/73),
largely because of cooperative management costs, which ADBN bears. A more
normal percentage would be about 4% (e.g. agricultural development banks in
Uttar Pradesh and Bihar) bu_ a Reserve Bank of India 1970/71 study of
ten State banks showed an all-Indian average of 6.3%, and variations be-
tween 1.6% (Haryana) and 13% (Maharashtra). The percentage seems reasonable
under the circumstances and is planned to decline.
Operations
23.       ADBN does not yet have centralized figures on numbers of loans
by categories and size, but plans to have them from 1974/75 onwards.
Total lending (Nepalese rupees) has increased from 908,000 in 1963/64 to
112 million (US$10.6 million) in 1972/73. The following sznarises recent
trends (million Nepalese rupees):

24.       Delinquency at over 17% is high but, of the total of NR 11.9 M at
July 15 1973, about NR 3 M (26% of the total) was taken over from the former
Cooperative Bank. ADBN claims that, of loans made since July 1971, only
2%-3% have been overdue. Table 5 shows delinquency by time overdue at
July 15, 1973. 66% of delinquency was from individual, 34% from coopera-
tive accounts (including the NR 3 M referred to above). Of the individual
accounts, 77% of delinquency is less than one year; of total accounts 58%
is less than one year.
25.       Proportions of the amounts lent on short (up to 1.5 years), medium
(up to 7 years) and long (over 7 years) term during the last few years have
been:
69/70 70/71 71/72 72/73   69/70 70/71 71/72 72/73

Conclusion
26.       ADBN is well organised and well staffed and, though it will be
under strain through absorption of LRSC and planned expansion, it would be
a suitable channel for IDA financing of project agricultural inputs.

SETTLEMENT PROJECT
Forestry Operation and Sawmilling
A. Forestry
1.        Forestry operations in the two western project areas, Kanchanpur
and Bardia, would be identical mechanical extraction and sawmilling except
for minor variations in the amount of equipment required. The operation
in the far eastern Jhapa area would be principally manual, 1/ using whatever
log extraction methods and equipment can be provided by local contractors,
logs being sold to the three local sawmills or exported to India as market
conditions dictate. The Timber Corporation of Nepal (TCN) would contract
with bullock cart operators to cut and remove timber on its behalf, deliver-
ing logs as TCN directed. There are numerous such operators in the area
ard little forest available to them now, except on the project site. It is
not expected that TCN would itself own and operate bullock carts.
2.        In all three project areas the forests would be turned over by
the Ministry of Forests to TCN which would extract merchantable logs, trans-
mission poles and firewood by the m3st rapid and economical method pos-
sible. Royalty would be paid by TCN and calculated on measurement of
products removed. This measurement would be in a manner and location
agreeable to TCN, IDA and the Ministry of Forests with the intent that
measurement should not delay extraction and delivery. Speed of forest land
clearing is the essence of this operation and should hold precedence over
precision in measuring forest products and over adherence to established
methods (see paras 6-8 and 10-11 of Annex 1).
3.        TCN's operation in each project area would be under an Area
Manager, who would be directly responsible to the TCN General Manager
headquartered in Hetaura. The Area Managers would be stationed on their
respective project areas. In the case of Jhapa, the Area Manager would
need five Contract Supervisors with a staff of log graders and measurers
and the necessary accounting and clerical personnel.
1/   In order to permit some flexibility in view of the possible difficulties
which can be encountered in expeditiously removing logs by bullock
cart and in selling them to private sawmills in the Jhapa area, it was
agreed during negotiation that a small number of the sawmills and
related machinery, equipment and vehicles might be allocated to Jhapa
District This allocation would be subject to agreement between TCO
and the Association, based on evidence of economic and financial
viability to be provided by TCN.



ANNEX 6
Page 2
4.        Kanchanpur has about 35 m /ha merchantable timber, 1/ Bardia
28 m /ha and these are light densities (cf Malaysia 100 m3/ha or more)
with light undergrowth ideally suited to low cost mechanical extraction.
They are each concentrated blocks of forest situated on slightly elevated,
flat agricultural soils. In both cases, permanent living facilities,
sawmills, repair facilities and road systems can be established, which
could serve considerable areas of additional forest, much of which should
be suited to future agricultural settlement.  During the six months dry
season (November-April.), vehicles -an be driven almost anywhere through
this open type forest on the hard, dry soil. The cheapest method of
moving logs to the sawmill, under t:hese conditions, is to load logs
directly onto lorries at the stumps where the trees are felled. The most
practical machine for this operation is the winch lorry (Sang Tai Wong)
developed and used exclusively in Malaysia. In some parts of Asia elephants
/ can be used for low cost log extraction, but they cannot be economically
used in Nepal.  There is a shortage of elephants and not nearly enough feed
in this heavilv grazed forest.
5.        The earlier winch lorry in Malaysia was a simple winch mounted
in the chassis of a surplus, four-wheel drive ex-army lorry. As surplus
army lorries have become scarce in Malaysia, many are now built on new
lorry chassis. These are almost the same as the Tata lorries, which
constitute an estimated 98% of the commercial vehicles on Nepal's roads.
These Tata lorries are made in India, originally under a Daimler-Benz
license. This seems to be the only heavy equipment in Nepal with a
plentiful supply of spare parts and a large contingent of experienced
mechanics and drivers. Most other types of heavy equipment in Nepal
suffer from lack of spare parts, poor maintenance, and poor operation.
6.        Operations in Kanchanpur and West Bardia would be similar.
The Area manager would have six superintendents, each in charge of a
specific activity: logging; yard; sawmill; maintenance; personnel; and
office. All logging activities, including locating and constructing
logging roads, felling and bucking (cutting logs in lengths), moving logs
from stump to sawmill yard and supervising contract firewood removal, would
be the responsibilitv of the Logging Supervisor. Felling would be with ax
and hand saw, bv laborers trained and supervised by cutting foremen. Buck-
ing the trees into proper size logs would be done with light-weight, gaso-
line powerod chain saws bv skilled operators working with the winch lorry
operators. Bucking trees and loading logs onto winch lorries would be
supervised by winch lorr,y foremen. Cutting and stacking firewood would
be by contract piece work. After the stacked firewood has dried it would
be hauled to railhead (or local market) by contract bullock carts or lorries.
1/   The forest inventory, since completed, suggests a higher, more compact
density which may take longer to clear, than estimated, but will yield
higher revenue.



ANNEX 6
Page 3
7.        The Jhapa forest (about 35 m 3/ha merchantable timber) is not
suited to mechanical logging because an extensive ring of forest, around
an isolated block, would need to be worked. The relatively high cost of
road construction, sawmill erection, etc. necessary for mechanical opera-
tions would not be justified economically for the amount of timber believed
to be available. The center of the block is very steep (up to 90% slopes)
and unsuited to clearing for settlement. The only area suited to agricul-
ture is a flat, one or two km wide perimeter on the north and west sides
of the steep central core. The extent and location of this area is
presently undetermined, but is estimated at approximately 2,000 ha. Before
this narrow fringe of timber could be logged by mechanical means, approxi-
mately 20 km of lorry road would have to be constructed through low lying,
wet, paddy land, crossing many lateral drains at an approximate cost of
NR 1.5 million over at least a three-year period. Logging can be completed
much more economically and in a lesser overall time by using conventional
bullock cart contractors.
B. Sawmilling
8.        A critical element in full productivity of both logging and
sawmilling equipment is an efficiently functioning log and lumber yard
managed by a Yard Superintendent. Logging would operate only during the
six month dry season, but sawmilling and hauling lumber could be carried
out almost year-round if a sufficient supply of logs is stockpiled and
an all-weather road connects sawmill to railhead, though difficult working
conditions during excessively hot and wet periods would be a constraint.
To facilitate year-round operation, the log yard would be a large, flat
area, well drained and surfaced with a thick layer of crushed rock. It
would be laid out so that winch lorries could come in from the forest, be
unloaded and return to the forest promptly. Mechanical front end rubber-
tired loaders would be used, instead of labor gangs, because it is important
to return winch lorries without delay and so make fullest use of them. It
would also be virtually impossible to manhandle the large quantity of logs
in the yard in an orderly manner so as to keep the sawmills continuously
supplied. The log loaders would spread the logs for measuring and sorting
and then feed them directly to the sawmills or into high piles for feeding
to sawmills during the monsoon.
9.        The yard for stockpiling the lumber output from the sawmills,
also under the Yard Superintendent's direction, should similarly be a
large, flat, well drained and surfaced area. The same front end loaders
would move stacks of lumber from the sawmill into high stacks in the yard
and from these high stacks onto lumber lorries to be hauled to railhead
(or market) when rail cars are available. The road from this lumber yard
to the railhead would be built up with a well crowned surface, with good
side and lateral drainage. It would be necessary to have one bulldozer at
each area (Kanchanpur and Bardia) for ieveling and for road construction
and repair.



ANNEX 6
Page 4
10.       The sawmilling operation should remain flexible to maximize
profits as the project develops and the market situation clarifies. The
only prices available, for logs sold directly into the Indian market, are
based on sales, the majority of which are o.' high quality and large
diameter logs. These prices would indicate maximum profit from selling
all production as logs, without incurring the cost and delay of sawmilling.
However, the annual estimated production of project logs would reach
143,500 m3 or 80% of present total annual log production from the entire
Terai, estimated at 180,000 m3. It is impossible to forecast how much
project production would be in addition to present production and how
much would substitute; but log production increase would be substantial.
Much of this increased production would also be in the form of small
diameter, low grade logs, the market for which is weak and sensitive to
supply.
11.       All the first year's production from Kanchanpur and Bardia,
estimated at 25,200 m3, would be sold in log form in any case, prior to
project sawmills being in operation. But, during this initial year of
operation, for the above reasons, sawmilling equipment sufficient to cut
only half the anticipated total log production from Kanchanpur and Bardia
would be purchased and installed. Addition of further sawmilling capacity
would be based on an analysis of production, cost and market results from
this first year's operation. It is assumed that, after the first year's
operation, maximum benefits would accrue by sawing and marketing all
production from Kanchanpur and Bardia as lumber and selling all production
from Jhapa in log form.
12.       14 sawmill units would be provided under the project at Kanchanpur
and 12 at Bardia. Each sawmill unit would be a typical Indian style saw-
mill consisting of one horizontal bandsaw for initial log breakdown and
one vertical bandsaw for resawing. By using winch lorries from stump to
sawmill all logs from the project area, as well as from future nearby
project areas, could be economically sawn in one permanent sawmill location.
The locations would be as shown on the maps and would be on relict upland
areas, unsuitable for agriculture, which would be well drained for operation
during the wet monsoon.
13.       The proportion of horizontal bandsaws to vertical resaws and
the final plant arrangement would depend on further analysis of the market
during the first year and an analysis of the forest inventory now being
undertaken. An initial assessment of the timber indicates the average log
size is too small for cutting sleepers and that the most lucrative market
for this small size log would be in the form of "phanta" (squared timbers
6" x 6" x 18' or larger - see Annex 25). However, it is unknown how large
a quantity of phanta the market can absorb at any one time. It is therefore
important to coordinate sales data and forest inventory data with sawmill
design and instructions to the saw operators.
14.       The Indian market pays a premium price for long timbers, 18 feet
or more, so, whenever a tree is straight enough, it would be cut into logs
from 18 to 24 feet long. Winch iorries and mechanical front end loaders

at the sawmill yard can easily handle logs of this length, whereas the
usual bullock cart logging operations are restricted to shorter logs.
15.       All components of the sawmill units would be individually
driven by electric motors. Electricity for the entire complex, including
sawmill, machine shop, office building, officers' homes, workers' quarters
and guest house would be provided by two large diesel powered generators
at each operating area.
C. Equipment and Programming
16.       Equipment specifications iire attached at Appendix A and a Forest
Working Program at Appendix B.
D. Staffing
17.       All sawmill activities would be directed by the Sawmill Super-
intendent who would have saw operators, saw doctors and sawmill mechanics
assisting him. The machine shop wotuld be under the control of a Maintenance
Superintendent, who would be responsible for all major overhaul, minor
repairs and maintenance of mechanical and electrical equipment on the
project. He would have working under him, electricians, diesel engine
mechanics, welders, machine tool operators, gasoline engine mechanics
and chain saw mechanics, the electricians and diesel engine mechanics
being supervised by foremen.
18.       A Personnel Superintendent would be responsible for all time-
keeping, payrolls, safety, medical and guard activities. An Office Super-
intendent would be responsible for record keeping, financial accounting,
purchasing and clerical activities. Each of these superintendents would
have office staff necessary for these activities.
19.       The entire project would require one Export Sales Manager, who
would be based on TCN headquarters at Hetaura and report to the TCN General
Manager. He would be responsible for selling all the logs, poles, fire-
wood and lumber produced for export from the three project areas. He
would need a small office staff at Hetaura as well as an Assistant Sales
Manager and sales clerks at Kanchanpur and Bardia. It would be extremely
important for the Export Sales Manager and the Area Managers and Area
Sawmill Superintendents to work very closely together. The profitability
of this operation depends to a large degree on being able to produce and
sell the largest possible volume of the highest value product in the
Indian market. The export Sales Manager must be able to advise the saw-
mill superintendents on the highest value of product mix he can sell and
the sawmill operators must know how to utilize the size and grade of logs
available from the forest so ap to most nearly attain this mixture. Complete
cooperation is necessary so the Sales Manager does not accept orders for
products that cannot be produced from this low grade forest and the sawmill
operators do not produce large quantities of products which cannot be sold
profitably.

E.  Tachnical Assistance
20.       Technical assistance from outside Nepal would be necessary to
start the winch lorry logging and the sawmilling operations properly and
to train Nepalese to continue efficient operations. TCN would make a
two-year contract with two winch lorry operators and two winch lorry
mechanics from Malaysia. One operator and one mechanic would be assigned
to Kanchanpur and the same to Bardia. They would be responsible for
directing the conversion of purchased lorry chassis into winch lorries and
advising on the first year's winch lorry operation. They would also be
responsible for training Nepalese mechanics and operators to carry on
the operation. Two sawmill operators and two sawdoctors would also be
recruited from India on the same basis.
21.       Proper handling of export sales to India would be most important
for financial success. Technical assistance would be provided for the
first three years in the form of a Sales Adviser to work with the TCN
Export Sales Manager. He would be impartial with regard to sales outlets
in India and would have experience in lumber sales into countries such as
India.
22.       Draft Terms of Reference for the above technical assistance staff
are attached at Annex 10, Appendix A).

SETTLEMENT PROJECT
Farm Develolment, Yields and Budgets
A. Introduction,
1.        Several years' experience gained on the earlier Nepal Settlement
Company (NSC) settlement schemes at Nawalpur and Banke have shown that an
upland cropping pattern, based primarily on a maize-mustard rotation with
subsidiary areas under rainfed paddy, pigeon pea and chick pea, provides
a satisfactory livelihood for migrant families from a 2 ha plot on the
well-drained plain soils typical of the project areas in the Western
Terai. A rather similar pattern, based on existing NSC schemes at Jhapa,
with partial substitution of jute for maize, and millet for chick pea, is
satisfactory for the project area in the Eastern Terai.
2.        These conform to traditional patterns followed by farmers on
well drained un-irrigated lands in the Nepalese Terai and in the neigh-
boring Indian states, modified on the basis of NSC experimental evidence
and field experience, using improved varieties and fertilizers at rates
up to 150 kg/ha on monsoon crops arid 50 kg/hs on mustard, planted towards
the end of the monsoon.
B. Development Sequence
3.        Settlers take five years to reach full development of their land.
They arrive with their families during October/December, when weather is
cool and land is dry, and they start clearing their 0.68 ha (1 bigha)
house lots and building their houses. A small semi-permanent dwelling is
normally built within the first three months, using residual timber from
the cleared plot. A more substantial, permanent two-story house is built
within eighteen months of arrival. These houses are very secure structures
built around a frame of debarked tree trunks up to 30cm diameter and
roofed with paddy straw or grass. The family lives on the second floor,
and maize or other foodstuffs are stored in the roof rafters, or hung in
clusters from the roof edge along the outside of the house. The ground
floor often houses livestock and is a store for fertilizer and other dry
goods.  An open well, a threshing and drying space, and a small vegetable
patch are usually situated close to the house, and occupy a compound of
about 0.1 ha. Except for a few vegetables, no substantial area is planted
during the first six to eight months (October/December-May) which coincides
with the second, and drier, part of the traditional crop year (June - May 31).



ANNEX 7
Page 2
4.        The remainder of the house lot is cleared in time for planting
of a monsoon crop at the start of the second crop year in the following
June. The first crop is invariably maize, the staple food of the hill
people (the majority of the settlers), and this is usually followed by
a dry season crop of mustard in October. A small area is also planted to
pigeon pea, sown in the June/September monsoon and harvested in April
towards the end of the ensuing dry season.
5.        During the second dry season (October-May), one year after
arrival, a further 0.68 ha is cleared on the second and larger (1.36 ha)
parcel of land which is the settler's main farm area. This additional
land, together with the previously developed house lot, is planted in the
third crop year to a similar range of crops.
6.        An additional 0.34 ha of the main farm plot is cleared in each
of the two following dry seasons and planted to the same range of crops,
to which a dry season pulse crop (gram) is added in the fourth crop year,
and a little rainfed paddy in the monsoon of the fifth crop year, by which
time the full area of the two parcels will have been cleared, and 1.8 ha
will be under cultivation, after allowing for wastage and land occupied by
the dwelling compound. Employment at full development is calculated at
370 man-days/year, with a seasonal peak of 80 man-days in September when maize
harvesting and land preparation for mustard must be carried out. Except
during this month when the working capacity of the entire family win be
fully stretched, the labor requirements are well within the capacity of
the two adult labor units assumed for each family.
7.        The above cropping sequence would be applicable to the Kanchanpur
and Bardia project areas in Western Terai. At Jhapa, in the Eastern Terai,
a smaller area would be sown to mustard, and millet would be planted instead
from the second crop year. Jute, an alternate, more valuable, cash crop,
would be introduced from the fourth year. No formalized rotation is followed,
but the entire area of the farm is seldom planted in any one season, with
the uncultivated area being used for rough grazing. The more moist portion
of the land will be used continuously for paddy, followed by a winter pulse,
while the remaining areas are planted to maize followed by mustard for two
or more years in succession, then by pigeon pea or fallow for a year or two.
C. Yields
8.        In the early years, as the land is gradually being cleared and
prepared, local varieties capable of giving reliable, though modest, yields
under the pioneer conditions then prevailing wculd be grown, with more
fertilizer responsive improved varieties being introduced from the fourth
year as the settlers develop familiarity with their farm conditions and
respond to extension advice provided by project staff. Experience on



ANNEX 7
Page 3
existing NSC schemes has shown that the use of fertilizers is worth while
at the indicated rates, and the modest yields assumed in the farm budgets
make due allowance for the risk element occasioned by variations in the
length and intensity of the monsoon rains.
9.        Yield estimates used in the farm models (Tables 1 and 3) are
comparable to those obtained by farmers in surrounding areas, using the
same quality seed. Production inputs would include seed, fertilizer and
pesticide based on Department of Agriculture recommendations, modified
according to NSC field experience, and these would be supplied on short-
term credit through the ADBN agent based on each scheme. The most commonly
used fertilizers are ammonium sulphate and a proprietary compound high in
nitrogen and phosphorous, consistent with the relative shortage of these
elements in the Terai soils. Fertilizer costs have been raised 50% above
AMC prices at appraisal to NR 1,500/ton (US$142) for ammonium sulphate and
NR 2,336/ton (US$220) for the 20:20:0 compound, in conformity with a general
increase of this magnitude being considered by AMC at that time. Other credit
items provided from the same source on medium term would include tools and
equipment (axe, handsaw, hoe, shovel and locally manufactured plough and
harrow), bullocks and food (to cover the shortfall in farm production to meet
family consumption during the first 18 months of settlement).
D. Farm Budgets
10.       Production quantities by year, based on areas and yields con-
forming to the farm models described above, together with family consumption
needs and marketable surpluses are shown in Tables 1 and 3.
11.       Gross production value, based on estimated farm-gate crop prices
at harvest, together with operating costs, excluding farm labor (all pro-
vided within the family) are shown in Tables 2 and 4.
12.       Net value of marketable production (net production value less
net value of consumed production), also shown in these Tables, indicates
that a satisfactory annual cash income of around NR 2,000 (Western Terai)
and NR 3,000 (Eastern Terai) is obtainable from the fifth year. NSC farmers'
income, at full production, is about twice that of adjoining communities
and project farmers' would be likewise. Average net annual value of total
production from project farms would be between NR 2,700 (Western Terai) and
NR 3,700 (Eastern Terai) compared with national average agricultural family
GDP of about NR 2,600, which covers a wide range of hill farmers who produce
much less and irrigated rice farmers, some quite large, who produce much more.



ANNEX 7
Page 4
13.       There would be opportunities for further improving settler
incomes through the introduction of new crops, such as groundnuts, cotton,
or an exotic variety of dry paddy, all of which are the subject of ex-
periment by the small group of Israeli technicians who are assisting NSC
extension on the Nawalpur and Banke schemes; but such innovative develop-
ments are not taken into account in'preparing the farm models. Further
improvement in income could result from irrigation, if suitab.e sources of
water could be located and economically exploited.

SETTLEMENT PROJECT
Environmental Impact
1.        Before the Nepalese Terai was cultivated it was covered almost
completely by hardwood forest. The first cultivators were the indigenous
Tharu who settled along the river banks and developed the moist, low-lying
flood plains for paddy, their staple foodgrain. Increasing demand for
agricultural land from the Tharus, joined more recently by other Nepalese
from the hill regions in the north, whose staple is maize, has led to
progressive spontaneous, and largely unauthorized, clearing of the forest,
not only close to the river banks but also over the broad, flat, less flood
prone inter-riverine areas where the soils have proved well suited to dryland
cropping. Very little timber has been recovered from this clearing, except
for use in settler dwellings.
2.        As a result of this settlement wave, which still continues,
some 70% of the formerly forested land has been cleared and developed to
agriculture. These areas comprise the most accessible and fertile lands.
A potential for further settlement, provisionally estimated at 250,000 ha
(in the absence of an accurate soils inventory), is believed to exist in
the remaining 30% of forested land (820,000 ha) where the soil pattern
is basically similar to the developed areas,
3.        This 30% of presently forested land is believed to contain large
areas of soil which have very marginal fertility or are otherwise un-
suitable for permanent agriculture, largely due to erosion hazards or
flood incidence. These areas could best be used as permanent productive
or protective forests, and as such they would fulfil a most important
secondary role as natural conservation areas for indigenous wildlife,
notably deer, wild boar, monkeys, some elephants and tigers, and many
species of birds.
4.        Three areas in the Terai have been identified by the Nepalese
Wildlife and Game Department as worthy of retention in an undisturbed
condition. These include the already gazetted Chitwan National Park in
the central Terai, and two proposed wildlife reserves, at Sukla Phanta
and Karnali in the western Terai, with a game corridor to the west of the
Bardia project areas. The project does not conflict with these.
5.        It is important, from now on, carefully to assess the agricultural
suitability of the remaining areas, and to delineate the boundaries of
those that should be retained under forest. The reconnaissance soil survey
of the entire far western Terai, proposed under the project, would meet
this requirement, and would aid identification of sites for Kanchanpur B
and Bardia B schemes, scheduled for development in 1977.



ANNEX 9
Page 2
6.        The areas thus identified would contain fertile soils capable
of sustained yield agriculture under cropping patterns similar to those
proposed in the project farm models (Annex 7, Tables 1 and 3). Such land,
which would be free from flood danger, would be resistant to erosion under
normal management conditions. and runoff would be minimal owing to the
pervious nature of the mediunm to light textured subsoils common to it.
7.      . The provision of unit farms to needy families, within planned
settlements following efficient-working of the forest, as provided under
the project, would reduce the extent of indiscriminate felling of timber
and illegal settlement which is widespread through the Terai at the present
time.
8.        The orderly clearing of 18,550 ha of forest under the project
would represent less than 2.5% of the total residual forest area in the
Nepalese Terai. The effect of this on rainfall and runoff patterns would
be minimal. The project would ensure that land which would be liable
to erosion if it were cleared, would remain under forest, and would leave
areas unsuited to agriculture available for the wildlife that is abundant
in the Terai.
9.        Only small amounts of pesticides would be used for control on
the crops proposed, mainly chlorinated hydrocarbons (less persistent than
DDT), since project farmers would be unable to afford loss of crop from
uncontrolled pests.

ANNEX 14
Page 1
NEPAL
SETTLEMENT PROJECT
Forestry Production and Income
1.        The attached table shows forecast production and income from
project forestry operations, as scheduled in Annex 8, making allowance for
firewood and poles to be made available free to settlers.
Kanchanpur and Bardia
2.        It is assumed that initially only logs, poles and firewood (not
lumber) would be sold from Kanchanpur and Bardia, until TCN project saw-
mills are ready for operation there; and that only lumber, poles and
firewood would be sold thereafter. In practice, TCN would continuously
study the market to determine whether it would be more profitable to sell
timber as logs or to convert it and sell as lumber, having regard to the
relative market prices and the marginal cost of operating sawmills, once
installed.
Jhapa
3.        It is also assumed that TCN would produce and sell only logs and
firewood, and not any lumber, from Jhapa. There are already three saw-
mills in nearby Bhadrapur and a ready market across the border. 1/
4.        Log production is based on the following assumptions:
Density        Content %      Firewood      Poles
m37ha         Sal Asna       tons/h a      per ha
Kanchanpur             35             85   15  )             )      2
Bardia                 28             70   30  )       4     )
Jhapa                  35             85   15  )                  NIL
5.        Species other than Sal and Asna would be present but are ignored
in the forecast, except for firewood, for the following reasons:
(a) low volume;
(b) most have no market value as timber;
(c) value too low to justify extraction cost.
1/   See footnote Annex 6, para 1.



ANNEX 14
Page 2
6.        Volume conversion rate from logs to lunber is taken at 55%.
(total not hoppus), based on TCN-experience.
7.        Assumptions as to lumber output quality throughout (see also
Annex 25, paras 13 and 14 for description of types) are:

Timber Corporation of Nepal Ltd
Introduction
1.        The Timber Corporation of Nepal Ltd (TCN) is a public limited
company, formed in 1960 under the Nepal Companies Act, with authorized
share capital of NR 10 M (US$0.9 M) in 100,000 shares of NR 100 each. It
is wholly owned by His Majesty's Government of Nepal (HMG) and its shares
are held nominally by various HMG Departments and officials, principally
the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and the Ministry of Forests, with a
small holding (9%) by HMG Nepal Industrial Development Corporation (NIDC).
A list of shareholders is in Appendix A. TCN financial year is from
July 16 to July 15. Issued share capital at July 15, 1973 was NR 6.9 M
(US$0.65M) fully paid.
2.        The directors, a minimum of five, are appointed by the share-
holders in general meeting. The chairman of the board (elected by the
directors) is the Secretary, Ministry of Forests. The other four members
are presently: a Ministry of Finance representative; Director, Department
of Industry; Chief Conservator of Forests; General Manager, NIDC. It is
intended to add a non-Government director, but no appointment has yet been made.
3.        TCN has a concession to extract lumber from about 100,000 ha
of the Hetaura and Chitwan Forest Reserves (see Map) of which about
58,000 ha are commercially exploitable. TCN also owns a sawmill complex
at Hetaura. It does not operate in other parts of the country, but has
been asked to help the Nepal Settlement Company with removal of timber
from settlement sites.
History
4.        TCN operations originated from a sawmill established under a USAID
program to provide lumber for rebuilding of houses destroyed by the catas-
trophic 1954 flood. This sawmill was transferred to NIDC, and a second
diesel operated sawmill added in 1955. Initial lumber production of
300/350 cu ft/day rose to 600/700 cu ft/day during this first phase;
annual production was less than 100,000 cu ft.
5.        The second phase, from 1960 to 1966, saw the introduction of
the US Corinth sawmilling management team and annual lumber production
rose from 88,000 to 327,939 cu ft.

6.        The third phase, continuing to the present time, began with
the inauguration of a large third mill in 1966, the Corinth management
team gradually handing over to Nepalese management between 1966 and 1968.
A band saw was introduced to the main Hetaura mill in 1968/69 and two
small seasonally operated mills were erected at logging camps. Three of
the Hetaura sawmills were converted to electrical operation in 1970, and
the oldest mill taken out of production. During this phase, annual lumber
production rose to 518,545 cu ft by 1971-72, after a peak of 600,973 cu ft
in 1969/70.
Financial Results
7.        TCN has made a profit every year except 1967/68, during which
year the Corinth management team left and severe over-staffing followed.
Profits were somewhat erratic thereafter but, during the three-years under
the present general manager, Mr. P.B.S. Pradhan, they have risen steadily
from NR 517,290 in 1970/71 to 1,100,000 (US$100,000) subject to audit, in
1972/73. The highest recorded profit of NR 1,250,000 was in 1965/66 when
the first two mills were at peak production.
8.        HMG receives substantial royalties and taxes from TCN, totalling
about 40% of gross revenue, deducted before arriving at net earnings (about
11% of gross revenue). Summarized profit and loss accounts and balance
sheets for the years 1967/68 - 1972/73 are in Appendices B and C. During
that period the balance sheet total has risen from NR 12.7 M'(US$1,2 M)
(of which Fixed Assets, after depreciation, NR 4.3 M (US$0.4M) and Cash
and Bank NR 1.3 M (US$0.12Z)) to NR 16.1 M (US$1.5 M) (of whieh Fixed
Assets, after depreciation, NR 3.9 M (US$0.37 M) and Cash and:Bank
NR 6.3 M (US$0.59 M)). TCN always has large stocks at the year end,
financed by share capital and self-generated funds and by the-.withholding
of royalties and other amounts due to HMG, pending stock liqu'idation.
9.        A table of significant financial ratios is in Appendix'D.
10.       A table showing the average disposition of revenue-for the three
years 1969/70-1971/72 is at Appendix E. During this period HKG received
57% of total gross revenue in the form of royalty (31%) taxes;(5%),
dividends (8%) and corporation tax (3%). This highlights the financial
benefit to HMG of the TCN operation.
Problems
11.       TCN faces four major problems:
(a) limited size of concession;
(b) effect of rain (4-5 months) on forestry operation;
and
(c)  capacity of Nepalese haulage industry to carry lumber.



ANNEX 21
Page 3
12.       While no estimate is avalable of the amount of lumber remaining
in the TCN concession, a large part (285 km2) of the most easily accessible
southern area was recently declared the Chitwan Wildlife National Park. TCN
management is concerned that working in the northern area will be more costly
and that future production expansion to meet growing demand and exports will
be inhibited.
13.       Rains quickly impede log haulage and TCN has not, so far,
been able to stockpile sufficient logs to keep the main sawmill going
throughout the rainy season (June-October).
14.       HMG requirement that the local market (mainly Kathmandu) be
given priority, has meant haulage of lumber over a difficult road some
100 miles from Hetaura to Kathmandu, whereas sales across the Indian
border would have meant a shorter haul. TCN has not been able to find
enough private haulage capacity, but now has some relief through operation
of its own trucks.
15.       TCN is required to ask the Public Service Commission to fill
vacancies at all levels. This has caused TCN great inconvenience through
delay, and sometimes inappropriateness, of appointments. TCN has had to
hire numerous employees on temporary contract, sometimes for a year or
more, without any assurance that their appointments will be confirmed.
TCN should be free to hire and fire employees at its discretion, subject
only to control by its board of directors.
Conclusion
16.       In spite of many difficulties, TCN is operating successfully,
with no outside help, and to the considerable benefit of HMG. It has staff
of many years' experience in logging and sawmilling and is able to take
on the forestry operations of the Nepal Settlement Project. TCN will,
however, need some temporary guidance in operation of winch lorries for
timber extraction, which are new to Nepal, and in installation of Indian-type
sawmills which it has not previously undertaken without help. Since, as
a result of the project, large export sales would be developed in the Indian
market, with which TCN is not very familiar, and which requires lumber to
particular specifications, TCN would also need some help In developing that
market.
17.       It is important to TCN success in the project that the general
manager be competent and that he enjoy reasonable security of tenure in
his post. Assurances were obtained that the present arrangement for temporary
secondment from HMG will cease and the general manager will be appointed
under contract in the same way that a commercial firm would appoint him.

18.       It will also be important that TCN be free to make direct contact
with its customers, as an independent commercial enterprise,.without reference
to HMG (subject only to normal policy direction by its board), and.that it
be free to sell logs or lumber, at its discretion, in Nepal or-elsewhere,
as market conditions dictate.

Settler Selection and Legal Status
Settlement Procedures
1.        NSC schemes are designed for rural families, mainly from the
overcrowded and land-hungry hill regions, who possess no land or have
insufficient land to obtain an adequate living. 1/
2.        Prospective settlers first apply to the chief district
officer in their home districts. Details on their completed application
forms are checked by the village panchayats (local councils) in their
villages of residence and, if found satisfactory, are forwarded to the
office of the zonal commissioner. Following approval at this level, the
applications are sent on to NSC which makes a final selection and allo-
cates the chosen families to particular schemes.
3.        The basic criteria used for selection include farming experience
(usually gained as a farm laborer or unregistered tenant farmer). Appli-
cants must be married, and yotng families are favored. A positive atti-
tude towards farm work is especially sought, and good health is most
important. Selection procedures attempt to avoid those with hidden wealth
or who are not hard-working.
4.        A more formalized, two stage method of selecting settlers, based
on interview and grading of applicants according to a points system, has
been proposed and would be adopted. The object of this procedure would be
to weed out the least suitable and ensure that the available places go to
the most deserving.
5.        Under the proposed system, applicants would be made to NSC
through local officials who know the district and its people. At this stage,
the candidates' general suitability would be determined and the following
basic minimum criteria applied to ensure that the candidate:
1/   40% of holdings in the hills are under 0.2 ha.



ANNEX 23
.Page 2
(a) is a citizen of Nepal;
(b) is one of a minimum of two adult able-bodied persons in
his family;
(c) has no serious criminal record; and
(d) is prepared to abide by the rules and regulations
established by NSC;
6.        Following the interview, points would be awarded by,NSC to each
eligible candidate according to a scale based on age, numberaof.,children,
extent of land ownership, and agricultural aptitude.
7.        The final selection would be made at NSC Headquarters based on
the points system and interview of the applicant at a center.near his home.
Legal Status
8.        Upon selection, the settler must sign a 10-year bond agreeing
to abide by the regulations set by the NSC, and he is given.:a temporary
right to use his plot.
9.        Settlers are expected to purchase their land at the.-rate of
NR 300 per bigha (NR 900 for 2 ha farm). This would be paid, interest
free, at a minimum rate of NR 90 per annum between years 4 and 15,..,following
which a permanent title would be given.

Guidelines for Independent Auditors
1.        The independent auditors should submit both short-form and long-
form reports.
2.        These reports should be addressed to the Chairman of the Board
of Directors and not to any member of the management.
3.        The following is an example short-form report:
"sWe have examined the balance sheet of Corporation
as of July 15, 19.., and the profit and loss account
and related statements for the year then ended.
Our examination was made in accordance with generally
accepted auditing standards, and accordingly included
such tests of the accounting records, verification of
assets and liabilities, and such other auditing pro-
cedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements
and appended notes present fairly the financial position of
Corporation at July 15, 19.., and the results of its
operations for the year then ended, in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles, applied on
a basis consistent in all material respects with that of
the previous year."
4.        When a qualified opinion is offered by the auditors, the opinion
paragraph of a short-form report should be modified in such a way as to
make clear the nature of the qualification. It should refer specifically
to the subject of the qualification and to the effect on the financial
position and results of operations, if reasonably determinable.
5.        Generally accepted auditing standards include, in addition to
adherence to accounting principles which are generally accepted, standards
of preparation, standards of field records, standards of supervision,
review, reporting and disclosure. The scope of the auditors' examination
should be sufficient to enable them to express the opinion described above.
All of these standards are well-known to public accountants.



ANNEX 24
Page 2
6.        If generally accepted auditing standards cannot be followed
in any circumstance, the auditors should expressly state so, indicating
specifically the circumstance involved. Where there is a failure to observe
these standards, the auditors should refrain from offering an overall
opinion of the financial statements submitted.
7.        Verification of assets and liabilities should cover:
(a) cash and bank balances;
(b) inventories and produce stocks; and
(c) fixed assets - e.g. land and buildings; vehicles; fie-ld,
factory and office equipment.
Verification should include physical test checks; examination of records
and expenditure; obtaining of certificates independently from banks (and
other custodians of assets), contractors, suppliers, and other iebtors and
creditors.
8.        The long-form report is an extension of the short-form report.
Appropriate details (analyses, summaries, explanations and comments) of
items in the various certified financial statements should be fincluded in
the long-form report.
9.        Certified statements would include:
(a)  a balance sheet for the whole corporation;
(b) profit and loss account for the whole corporation;
(c) profit and loss statement for each major unit
contributing more than, say, 20% of corporation
revenue or incurring more than, say, 20% of
corporation costs, or such other criteria as the
auditor shall determine;
(d) sources and applications of funds;
(e) fixed assets showing additions, disposals, deprecistion
and balance sheet values;
(f) non-recurring expenses;
(g) miscellaneous income and expenditure; and
(h) classification of debtors and creditors according to
periods outstanding.
All statements should, when practicable, show comparative figures for the
preceding years.



ANNEX 24
Page 3
10.       Comments and recommendations in the long-form report would include:
(a) implementation of tecommendations made in previous
year;               I
(b) management organization;
(c) budgetary control;
(d) financial and field controls;
(e) payroll, procurement and sales procedures;
(f) inventory control and stock levels;
(g) adherence to public accounting standards;
(h) efficacy of the internal audit procedures; and
(i)  events after the date of the balance sheet significantly
affecting the financial position of the Corporation.

SETTLEMENT PROJECT
Marketing of Forest Production
A. Introduction
1.        Timber marketing, traditionally handled by the Ministry of Forest,
would be carried out under the project by the Timber Corporation of Nepal
(TCN). The primary market for project output would be India, with the
domestic market and potentially Bangladesh, as secondary outlets. Besides
the large size of the Indian market, the project areas are close to Indian
railheads, while transport within Nepal from project areas, to the domestic
market, is difficult. Bangladesh is also more difficult to reach than
India, and presently lacks funds to purchase timber. While most Nepalese
timber is now sold as logs, project output would be marketed as both logs
and lumber, the proportions to be determined as the project develops and
the market situation requires.
B. Timber Marketing
Historical Development
2.        Nepalese timber sales date back to World War I, when 200,000 broad
gauge sleepers were sold to the British Government. Since then, Nepal has
experimented with a variety of sales methods.
3.        Prior to 1945, long-term lease concessions for removal of logs
(to be sawn elsewhere) were granted mainly to Indian merchants, on payment
of a fixed royalty per cubic foot removed. This method proved wasteful,
however, as logs exhibiting the slightest defect were left in the forest
to rot, though parts would have been useful if royalty had been more
flexible.
4.        With creation of the Ministry of Forest in 1945, an auction-
quota system was introduced. Large blocks of up to 3,000 individually
marked trees were auctioned annually during the dry season. Sales were
not finalized at the time of auction, however, and lots did not necessarily
go to the highest bidder. Generally bidders were not sawmillers, but
speculators who exported logs to India. In order to supply the domestic
market, Government allotted each local sawmill an annual quota of about
78,500 cu ft (2,200 m3), and charged royalty on timber removed. This



ANNEX 25
Page 2
system led to abuse, however, as purchasers tried to "persuade" Ministry
of Forest officials to mark only the best trees. The holding of auctions
during the dry season necessarily curtailed the time available for logging
(only possible during the dry season).
Present System
5.        In 1969/70, three major changes were introduced:
(a)  auctions were replaced by valuation, under which
the volume and value of standing timber on a given
lot were estimated by the Division Forest Officer
(DFO);
(b)  sales to sawmills under the quota system were
discontinued, except for TCN; and
(c)  sales were largely confined to salvage areas
earmarked for settlement.
6.        But this system led to new problems:
(a)  since it is difficult for DFO to accurately assess
the market value of large volumes of standing timber,
considerable overvaluation/undervaluation occurs and
only undervalued lots are sold;
(b)  since the selection of successful applicants is made
arbitrarily, there is considerable scope for cor-
ruption;
(c)  abolition of quotas caused difficulties to sawmills:
(d) confining sales to future settlement areas forced some
mills in other parts of the country to close; and
(e)  sales continued to run into the dry season, wher logging
of sold lots should have started.
7.        Wlile quotas were not always adequate to meet local sewmill needs
in full, and there was no Luarantee that the quota would be renewed from
year to year, in practice owners could count on an annual allocation. Under
the valuation system, there is absolutely no security of supply. Special
problems also arose for wood-based industries using a small range of species
(e.g. match manufacturing), since they had to purchase lots containing many
different species, whether useful to them or not.
8.        In 1970/71, the first lots were not advertised until November, and
final allocation not made until January, leaving only the four months before
the monsoon, the hottest months of the year, for logging.



ANNEX 25
Page 3
Proposed Changes in the Existing System
9.        Under the project, lots would be allocated to TCN, royalty being
paid on timber actually removed, thereby eliminating time-consuming valua-
tion and sale of standing timber. TCN would also be authorized to market
its products directly (see Annex 21).
C. Indian Market
General
10.       Market prospects in India are good, provided wood is sawn to
Indian specifications, or sold as logs, though there could be unexpected
temporary difficulty in selling the large additional amounts of project
timber in its northern India market, extending down to Delhi and Calcutta,
but possibly not to Bombay.
Logs
11.       In the first year, and until project sawmills are ready, project
output would be in log form. In 1970, Indian demand for logs was about
5.2 M m3 and, by 1980, is expected to rise to 6.9 M m3. Total project
output of logs would be around 95,200 m3, at prices forecast in Table 1.
If the lumber market appears promising, as expected, it would be important
to saw logs to Indian specifications and to the size and type that brought
the highest price per unit.
Lumber
12.       Demand for the market served by Nepal is not separately recorded
but total Indian demand for lumber was approximately 7.9 M m3 in 1970, and
by 1980 is expected to be 10.7 M m3. Project output of lumber would total
about 268,000 m3.
13.       The most valuable type is known as phanta - large timber, 4 in
thick, 6-12 in wide and up to 24 ft long, usually resawn by the purchasers
into smaller sizes. Phanta quality is about equal to sleepers (i.e. no
boxed heart, sapwood, cracks or worms), but dimensions are more flexible.
Logs which could produce sleepers could also produce phanta, which fetches
a higher price per unit. Approximately 15% of project output is expected
to be phanta, which could be easily transported to railhead by truck.
Forecast prices are in Table 2, which shows that a premium is paid for
length (16 ft earns 20% more per cu ft than 8 ft).
14.       The next most valuable is gatu - a squared beam with the heart
in the center, minimum 6 in x 6 in and up to 24 ft long. Many project
logs would be suitable for sawing into gatu, and about 60% of project output
is expected to be marketed in this form. Forecast prices are in Table 3.



ANNEX 25
Page 4
15.       Third in value are sleepers.  The Indian Railway Board requires
about 400,000 broad gauge, 20,000 meter gauge, 25,000 narrow gauge and
numerous special size sleepers annually. Dimensions for sleepers are
restrictive, however, and the price per unit less than for gatu, and
considerably less than for phanta (see Tables 2, 3 and 4). The only
advantage in producing sleepers would be that long-term contracts could
be negotiated with the Indian Railway Board, which would probably be
difficult for private merchants. A small share of project output might
be sold as sleepers, if demand becanie difficult generally; but most of
it would be sold as more profitable phanta and gatu. Forecast.prices
for Class I and II broad, meter and narrow gauge sleepers are in Table 4.
16.       Last in value are scantlings and boards, for which.:small logs,
and portions of large logs too small to be sawn into phanta, >atu or
sleepers, would be used. About 25% of project output is expected to take
this form, and forecast prices are in Table 5.
17.       In addition to the above products, there is favorable demand
for transmission poles and firewood. Uttar Pradesh alone is-estimated
to need 4 M poles, and Bihar 1.6 M poles between 1974/79. The project
areas, however, contain few trees sufficiently straight and sound to be
made into poles. About 33,100 would be produced; forecast pfices are in
Table 6. Firewood production is estimated to reach a maximum1'8,.000 tons
in each of the years 1976/77 (16,000 tons in 1978/79) compaxedwith Indian
demand of around 203,000 tons in 1970 and projected 256,000 tmen by 1980.
Prices for firewood are in Table 7.
18.       In all cases, except firewood, sal is the preferred,species,
though asna is also acceptable in most areas.
Treaty of Trade and Transit
19.       Trade between Nepal and India, including forest products, is
regulated by a Treaty of Trade and Transit, renegotiated every five years.
Under the 1971 Treaty, forest products from Nepal are exempt from Indian
customs duties and quotas.
D. Domestic Market
20.       The Kathmandu area currently absorbs about 14,200 m3 of timber
annually, and there is also some demand in district towns near the project
areas (Mahendranagar, NepalganJ and Bhadrapur). With completion of the
East-West Highway, now scheduled for 1977, and construction of feeder
roads, the domestic market might absorb an increasing, though relatively
small, share of project output, mainly lumber, for which current prices
are in Table 8.



ANNEX 25
Page 5
E. Bangladesh Market
21.       Bangladesh cannot meet its requirements from domestic sources.
Its main demand is for sleepers (10,200 m3 at present), for which the
price is NR 1,060/m3. Bangladesh currently lacks funds for imports and,
even if this should change, transport from Nepal would still be expensive,
in the absence of direct rail or road links. A commercial treaty would
have to be signed with Bangladesh, and agreement on transit facilities
reached with India. Bangladesh is therefore only a potential market.
F. Prices
International
22.       Average free world market prices for logs (per m3 cif Tokyo)
declined from US$55.0 in 1970 to US$50.6 in 1971 and to US$45.0 in 1972,
but rose to US$62.4 in the first half of 1973. The Bank's 1980 projected
price (in 1974 constant terms) is US$102. Apart from rising world market
demand, prices will be favorably influenced by increased demand in producer
countries, as new processing plants are constructed.
23.       Except as an indication of trends, however, international prices
are of little relevance to Nepal, due to its transport situation, which
presently precludes shipment of forest products to markets other than
India.
Indian Market
24.       Though a price series for recent years is unavailable, interviews
during appraisal indicated that Indian market prices rose during 1972/73,
but not as much as international prices. Recent information indicates a
firm trend.
25.       For forest product estimates (see paras 13 and 14 for type
descriptions), the following prices, based on average 1972/73 prices at Indian
railheads serving Bardia, have been used:

SETTLEMENT PROJECT
Marketing of Agricultural Production
A. Introduction
1.        Project agricultural output would be mainly food crops (maize,
mustard, paddy, pigeon pea, chick pea and millet), the exception being
jute (to the extent that it is substituted for: maize in Jhapa). Initially,
most of the marketable surplus of these crops would be sold in India but,
if the domestic transport system improves, an increasing share could be
marketed in the Nepalese Hills. Jute, grown only in Jhapa, would be sold
to local agents, almost entirely for the Indian market.
B. Indian Market
2.        In 1970/71, Indian demand for paddy (in tons) was about 63.6 M
and by 1980/81 is expected to reach 78.5 M, compared to project marketable
annual surplus at full development in year thirteen of only 4,200. For
maize and millet, Indian demand (in tons) was approximately 22.4 M in
1970/71, but is projected to be 25.7 M by 1980/81, compared to a project
marketable annual surplus of 7,300. Similarly, Indian demand (in tons)
for pulses (chick pea and pigeon pea) 'is expected to rise from 6.5 M in
1970/71 to 8.9 M in 1980/81, compared to project marketable annual surplus
of 1,900. Demand figures for mustard are unavailable, though Indian demand
(in tons) for oils, including mustard oil, is expected to rise from 2.4 M
in 1970/71 to 3.8 M in 1980/81. Jute faces relatively constant demand.
Supply
3.        Although some official Indian sources predict that local supplies
of the above food crops will meet and, in some cases, exceed demand by
1980/81, recent production trends suggest that India generally will remain
in deficit for some years yet, particularly Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and West
Bengal, all of which border on Nepal, and are traditionally, in deficit.
In 1967/68, Bihar consumed about 1.9 M tons more cereals than it produced,
and in 1970/71 Uttar Pradesh' foodgrain deficit was of the order of 2.5 M
tons.
4.        Given the likely deficit in India as a whole and the almost
certain deficit in neighboring Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal, there
should be little, if any, difficulty in disposing of the limited marketable
surpluses of food crops generated by the project.



ANNEX 26
Page 2
C. Domestic Market
Demand
5.        Average per capita Nepalese consumption of foodgrains (cereals
and pulses) is presently estimated at 170 kg/year, and in 1971 population
was 11.6 M, growing at about 2.1% per year. Projecting these trends, demand
for foodgrains (in tons) would be about 2.4 M by 1980, compared to a market-
able annual surplus of foodgrains from the project of about 9,100.
supply
6.        Though statistics are unreliable, Nepal's traditional foodgrain
surplus apparently declined from about 500,000 tons in 1960/61 to 300,000
tons in 1970/71. The Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Irrigation estimates
the present surplus at only 100,000 tons. This is not surprising in view
of Nepal's population growth rate of about 2.1% over the last decade, and
the fact that cereal grain production from 1964/65 to 1970/71 increased by
only 1.7%. Over the same period, however, the average annual rate of
increase in cash crop, as distinct from foodcrop, production was 10%.
Exports
7.        In 1970/71 (the last year for which figures are available),
cereal production (million tons) was approximately 3.4 (2.3 rice and
0.8 maize). Of this amount, about 2.2 was edible, of which an estimated
1.9 was consumed domestically, leaving an export surplus of 0.3, virtually
all of which (0.294) was exported to India, mainly to Uttar Pradesh and
Bihar. The value of jute exports (in millions) in 1966/67 was; NR 25.7
(US$2.4), 97.8% of which went to India, 1.3% to China (Tibet), and 0.9% to
other countries, but by 1970/71, it had risen to NR 33.3 (US$3.2). Due
to disruption of jute production in Bangladesh, following the Indo-Pakistan
war, Bangladesh and Pakistan mills may also become significant markets for
Nepalese jute.
D. Trade Patterns
8.        If a foodgrain deficit were to develop in Nepal and a surplus in
India, it would seem paradoxical that project output be marketed in India
rather than Nepal, particularly the Hills where the greatest deficit is
expected.
9.        However, southern Nepal and northern India are virtually one
economy, with long established regional trade patterns. Foodgrain and
other commodities flow in both directions across an open border. Banke,



ANNEX 26
Page 3
for example, in the western Terai, sells paddy and mustard to neighboring
Uttar Pradesh (in exchange for salt, vegetables, oil and clothing), while
Baitadi in the far western Terai imports paddy from India (in exchange
for ghee). Since the project areas have surpluses and are adjacent to
India, it is natural that their marketable production should move across
the border, while for deficit areas, the reverse would be true.
10.       Another important factor is the domestic transport situation
which isolates the Hills from the lerai. There are few roads between the
two areas, and most transport is along narrow trails by pack animals and
porters, both time consuming and expensive. In some cases, the only access
between the Terai and the Hills is via India. With construction of the
East-West Highway and feeder roads, greater integration of the Hills and
Terai should occur, but until then, it will be uneconomic to move large
quantities of foodgrains between the two.
E.  Marketing, Transport and Storage
11.       Though the marketing season varies from district to district in
the Terai, the bulk of paddy is sold between mid-November and mid-February,
maize between mid-August and mid-November.  The Terai sells an estimated
55% of its marketable surplus between August and February.
12.       Most farmers sell their crops to merchants/moneylenders or traders/
millers' agents, from whom they borrow against their harvest.  Transport to
market is generally by bullock cart, though headbaskets are also used,
especially during and immediately after the monsoon. Because of the need
to repay the moneylender or miller's agent, most farmers do not store their
crops and thus do not take advantage of seasonal price increases. In
almost all cases, the price is determined by bargaining at the time of
delivery. Moneylenders and miller's agents generally store paddy, on
average, for four months, maize for two and wheat for one.
F. Prices
International
13.       Average free world market prices for rice (per ton) declined
from US$198 in 1967/69 to US$147 in 1972, but rose sharply to US$350 in
1973. The Bank's 1980 projected price is US$250.
14.       Average free world market prices for maize (per ton) rose from
US$51 in 1967/69 to US$56 in 1972, and to US$98 in 1973. The Bank's 1980
projected price is US$90.



ANNEX 26
Page 4
l . .     other crops grown under the project (millet, chick pea, pigeon
pea and mustard) are seldom traded internationally, and world prices are
.horefore not available.
16.       Except as an indication of trends, however, international prices
are of ].ittle relevance to Nepal, due to its distance from seaports which
presently precludes export of foodgrains to markets other than India. The
only crop that might reach the world market is jute, and demand and price
conditions there are important.
17.       Average free world market prices for jute (per long ton) ros.e
from US$275 in 1967/69 to US$305 in 1972, but eased to US$290 in 1973.
The Bank's 1980 projected price is US$385. In part, price trends reflect
competition from synthetic substitutes, development of which-has advanced
to the point where quality differences are insufficient to sustain a high
price for natural jute without excessive loss of sales.
Indian Market
1i.       Prices in the adjacent Indian states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh
have generally moved with, though not necessarily as rapidly as, the world
market.
19.       The harvest season (December) wholesale price for rice (Indian
rupees/ton) in Uttar Pradesh rose from 965 in 1970/71 to 991 in 1971/72,
and sharply to 1,300 in 1972/73. Similarly, in Bihar., it rose from 1,150
in 1970/71 to 1,230 in 1971/72, and to 1,400 in 1972/73.
20.       Likewise in the case of maize, the harvest season (October) price
in Uttar Pradesh rose from 643 in 1970/71 to 720 in 1971/72, and in Bihar
from 875 in 1970/71 to 925 in 1971/72. Price series are unavailable for
millet, pulses, mustard and jute.
Domestic Market
21.       Although farm-gate price series for crops grown under the project
are not available, information collected during appraisal indicates that
prices have generally followed Indian and international trends.
'2.       The peak season (December) wholesale price for paddy in the
Nepalese Terai (Nepalese rupees/ton) declined from 900 in 1970 to 830 in
1971, but rose to 910 in 1972. Similarly, the average annual retail (local
market) price for maize rose from 1,200 in 1971 to 1,300 in 1972, for millet
from 900 in 1971 to 1,300 in 1972, for mustard from 2,200 in 1971 to 2,400
in 1972. Present prices for pulses are not available. The.delivered
warehouse price for jute rose from 2,300 in 1971 to 2,400 in 1972.

Project Price Forecasts
23.       For the purpose of estimating the value of agricultural production,
the prices listed below, based on farm-gate prices reported by CP (which
correlate closely with five-year average prices for similar products in
neighboring Bihar and Uttar Pradesh) have been used, since no equivalent
price series for the project areas were available. Five-year retail price
series, which were available, confirm the basis is reasonable.

Opportunity Cost of Labor
1.        Farm budgets and farm size are based on a farm family of two work-
ing adults (usually a man and his wife) being able to cultivate the land
(with bullock plowing) and harvest the crop. At peak periods, farm families
(including children if needed) work all daylight hours.
2.        Settlers and laborers working on forestry and settlement activi-
ties, would come from different places, where work opportunities vary, though
most would be landless farm workers from the Hills. The attached table shows
how an opportunity cost of full-time male labor of NR 532/year is derived,
based on employment opportunities in various origins, weighted according
to the number of settlers expected, on average, from each origin (based
on NSC records).
3.        The equivalent opportunity cost of female farm labor is more
difficult to measure) since women have less mobility and, hence, less
opportunity. It would not be less than subsistence cost of NR 170/year
and is probably close to 50% of male labor opportunity cost.
4.        The opportunity cost of labor, for economic rate of return purposes,
is therefore taken as NR 798/family/year (1.5 times NR 532) for settle-
ment farms and NR 532/man-year for unskilled forestry operations.
5.        No adjustment is made for labor used during construction (possibly
totalling 6% of project cost), on the assumption that this would normally
compete with labor usage at peak (dry-season) periods and full financial
wage rates would be payable and represent true opportunity cost.

SETTLEMENT PROJECT
Economic Impact and Economic Rate of Return
A. Introduction
1.        The project's estimated economic rate of return (ROR(E)) is
42% calculated from data in Table 1 and based on the most probable assumptions
described in paras 2 - 7 below. The project would also have significant
balance of payments, demonstration, training and employment effects. Estimated
ROR(E) from forestry alone is 65%; from settlement alone (20 year life) 17%.
B. Economic Rate of Return Assumptions
Costs
2.        Except for unskilled labor and fertilizer, all costs are included
at their financial value at the time of appraisal (November 1973), adjusted
for duties and taxes. Physical contingencies are included, but not price
contingencies which, if incurred, are expected to affect both costs and
benefits about equally.
Labor
3.        Unskilled labor would be available in the project areas either
from settler families or, more likely, from migrants seeking work from
the Hills, elsewhere in the Terai and nearby India. For rate of return
purposes, the opportunity cost of labor explained in Annex 27 is used.
If labor were costed at market rates, ROR(E) would be 35%.
Fertilizer
4.        Fertilizer is valued at 50% above the local price at appraisal,
because of recent sharp price increases, and 20% is added as a physical
contingency for possible additional quantities.
Working Capital
5.        Incremental NSC and TCN working capital is included, representing
inventories, work in progress accounts receivable (delayed revenue) etc. To
reflect variation during the year, the amounts used are averages for each
year. Negative amounts indicate reductions in working capital needs.

Benefits
6.        Forest production has been valued at average 1972/73 Indian rail-
head (Bardia) prices, and agricultural production based on average farm-gate
prices over the last five years in neighboring Bihar and Uttar Pradesh
(Annex 26). Estimated gross consumed and marketable agricultural production
is in Table 2.
7.        To calculate incremental benefits, net benefit without the project
is assumed to be equal to the net value of forestry production foregone.
This is computed by totaling the royalty, export duty and exciae tax
which would have resulted from the project areas had timber extraction
continued at the present rate of about 500 ha/year on each of the five new
sites. No profit is attributed to this net benefit, since most contractors
are non-Nepali and no benefit would accrue to the Nepal economy. The total
would be about NR 6,000/ha and is in line with the 40% of gross production
value paid in royalty taxes and duties by TCN (see Annex 21, para 10). It
is unlikely, however, that more than about 70% of the entire area would be
logged without the project, since parts would not yield revenue to match the
royalty demanded and would not be cut. Estimated royalty and taxes from
70% of the area are therefore assumed. Table 3 illustrates net benefit without
the project.
Economic Rate of Return
8.        Based on these assumptions, the return to the economy would be
high, mainly because a valuable product (timber) is obtained at low cost and
settlement infrastructure cost is kept low, being traditionally handled on
a self-help basis in Nepal (e.g. settlers construct their own houses from
timber left after logging). But it is also very sensitive, as the tests
outlined in the following paragraph show (see also para 14). The rate of
return is particularly sensitive to the value of benefit without the project,
which is difficult to assess accurately. A change of 10% in this value
would result in a change of five points in ROR(E).
Sensitivity Tests
9.        Results of other sensitivity tests are summarized below:
Economic Rate of Return
Cost Increase
Benefit Decrease    Nil      10%      20%
20%           15       7        1

Nil           42      31       22

C. Balance of Payments.
10.       By accelerating the rate of timber extraction, and enabling Nepal
to export lumber as well as logs, the project would increase the gross value
of forest product exports over the five years of timber extraction by up to
about NR 169 million (US$16 million). It would also permanently raise
the annual value of agricultural exports by about NR 10.0 million
(US$960,000) from year 13. Since most of these additional exports would
go to India, Nepal's foreign exchange benefit would be largely in Indian
rupees. The project would also save some imports of foodgrain in border
areas traditionally supplied by India.
D. Demonstration
11.       With a population density of 620/km , land is one of Nepal's
scarcest resources, yet little attention has been given to land use
planning. By selecting five new settlement sites on the basis of forest
inventory, boundary, level and soil surveys, the project would set an
example of land use planning for future settlement projects and technical
assistance would be provided for future land use planning (not included as
an economic cost of this project). Proper phasing of logging and settlement
in the project areas would also have an important demonstration effect, as
would the systematic logging by winch lorries, an economic method of extraction,
new to Nepal.
E. Training
12.       By training Nepalese in logging and sawmilling, the project would
build up a skilled forestry work force capable of taking on new and larger
areas. Many of the skills acquired (e.g. equipment maintenance and sales
ability) would be readily transferable to other enterprises. Instruction
given to farmers in the use of fertilizer, weedicide, pesticide and high-
yielding varieties of seeds would also be improved through technical
assistance and visual aids (included in the economic cost of this project).
F. Employment
13.       The project would provide part or full-time employment for about
1,100 annually in forestry over six years, with prospects of continuance
from replication of the project or other forestry operations.



ANNEX 28
Page 4
G. Risk
14.       There are five particular factors which may adversely affect the
project:
(a) agricultural production may be lower due to poor weather
or poor settler selection;
(b) quantity and quality of available timber may be lower
than forecast;
(c) input prices, particularly international fuel and
fertilizer prices, may be higher, reducing the rate of
return both by increasing costs and reducing use, and
thereby reducing production;
(d) prices for forest and agricultural products may
decline (though forest products prices have shown a
sharply upward trend since the appraisal mission); and
(e) organizational and administrative problems may arise.
15.       Steps taken to allow for, or reduce, these risks are:
(a) average yields used in farm budgets take account of
average weather conditions, including some years of
poor rainfall; and procedures outlined in Annex 23
should reduce the risk of poor settler selection;
(b) forest inventories, now being made, following terms of
reference in Annex 2 Appendix, will provide more accurate
information to match equipment orders and logging and
sawmilling schedules to available timber;
(c) input price estimates, particularly of petroleum based
products, take account of recent increases; fertilizer
price estimates, for example, are 50% above those ruling
at appraisal;
(d) price estimates for forest and agricultural products are
based on averages over several years and available forecast
data; sensitivity analysis shows that price declines,
though not expected, would not seriously affect project
viability; and
(e) project institutions and management caliber would be
strengthened under the project.
