POSTS AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION (PTC)
APPRAISAL OF A TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a project for the expansion and mod-
ernization of the telecommunications network in Zambia for which a Bank
loan of US$32.0 million equivalent is proposed. The borrower would be
a recently established corporation, the Posts and Telecommunications
Corporation (PTC), which has succeeded the General Post Office (GPO), a
Government department, for the operation of postal and telecommunications
services in Zambia. GPO has been unable to meet the fast growth of demand
for telecommunications services. This has put a heavy strain on the pres-
ent limited and inadequate facilities resulting in poor service.
ii.       The project, which forms part of the development program of
the Zambian telecommunications network, consists of installation of 31,000
lines of telephone switching equipment; cables and subscriber apparatus to
add about 31,000 new subscribers; and expansion of long distance equipment
to remove congestion, to improve quality of services and to extend services
to new areas. The project which is estimated to cost K 50 (US$78) million
with a foreign exchange component of K 33 (US$52) million, would be financed
by the proposed loan, by a grant from the Swedish International Development
Agency, by a loan from the African Development Bank, by a Government loan
and from internal sources. This would be the first Bank loan for telecom-
munications in Zambia.
iii.      Zambia's industrial, agricultural and population centers are
widely dispersed and need the support of an efficient telecommunications
service. The present facilities are inadequate in quantity and the service
is poor with severe congestion of the network. The project would improve
the telecommunications services by meeting the bulk of the demand and by
removing congestion. The project would help in achieving government objec-
tives for economic development aiming at developing and diversifying the
modern sector and increasing agricultural output.
iv.       The Posts and Telecommunications Corporation Act of 1975 estab-
lishing PTC gives the new corporation sufficient autonomy to enable it to
carry out efficiently its operations and provides for adequate separation
between postal and telecommunications services. It the'reby removes the
main organizational constraints which hampered the development of telecom-
munications services when they were run by the GPO, a Government department.
v.        All procurement of Bank financed items would be by international
competitive bidding in accordance with Bank guidelines on procurement.



- ii -
vi.       The financial situation of the telecommunications operations
has been and is projected to continue to be satisfactory. Internal sources
are expected to cover about one third of total requirements of funds. The
internal return on the project which is a minimum estimate of the economic
return is estimated at 16.7%.
vii.      The project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$32.0 million equiv-
alent for a-term of 20 years including a grace period of four years.

POSTS AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION (PTC)
APPRAISAL OF A TELECCMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Zambia has requested Bank assistance in
financing its telecommunications development program to be carried out
by the Posts and Telecommunications Corporation (PTC), a recently estab-
lished Government corporation responsible for public telecommunication
services in Zambia.
1.02      The program, which forms part of the Second National Development
Plan of Zambia (SNDP), will expand and improve the service to meet the bulk
of demand in areas now being served and extend services to areas where tele-
communication services are sparse or non-existent. It will also provide
high quality telecommunications to other countries with the installation of
microwave links to Tanzania and Malawi and the construction of an interna-
tional transit center which will improve operation of international circuits.
The program is expected to be completed by the end of 1980.
1.03      The project proposed for Bank financing consists of the new works
in the program. It includes the installation of about 31,000 lines of
exchange equipment together with appropriate expansion of the cable network
and associated plant, which will meet the bulk of the expected demand for
telephone connections by the end of the project period. It also provides
for substantial expansion of the long distance facilities which will meet
the demand for long distance traffic in areas already served and extend
services to areas where they are at present scarce or non-existent.
1.04      The estimated cost of the project is K 50.1 (US$78.2) million
with a foreign component of K 33.4 (US$52.2) million. A Bank loan of US$32.0
million is proposed to cover about 60% of the foreign exchange cost of the
project. The remaining cost of the project will be covered by a loan from
the African Development Bank (ADB), a grant from the Swedish International
Development Agency (SIDA), by Government and by PTC.
1.05      The borrower of the proposed loan, which would be the first for
telecommunications in Zambia, would be the Posts and Telecommunications
Corporation (PTC), a statutory corporation established under the Posts and
Telecommunications Act of 1975 and succeeding the General Post Office of
Zambia (GPO), a department of the Ministry of Power, Transport and Works.
1.06      An appraisal mission composed of Messrs. S. A. Sathar, A. Grisez
and B. Holmgren visited Zambia in November and December 1973. A follow-up
million composed of Messrs. A. Grisez and B. Holmgren was dispatched to
Zambia in January 1975 to update information obtained during the appraisal
mission. This report is based on information provided by the GPO and on
the findings of the two missions.



2.  THE ECONaMY AND THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR
The Economy
2.01      Zambia, a landlocked country in the southern half of Africa
has an area of 752,600 km2 and a population estimated at 4.5 million (1973),
growing at about 2.5% per annum. Nearly half of the population lives in
the Copperbelt Province and in a small corridor along the railway running
from the Copperbelt Province through Lusaka, the capital, to Livingstone
and is employed in mining, agriculture, industry, commerce and administration.
The remainder of the population,'mainly engaged in small scale agriculture,
is unevenly scattered over the rest of the country, with relatively heavy
concentrations in some limited areas with good agricultural potential,
especially in the Eastern and Luapula Provinces, and a very low density
elsewhere. The economy in Zambia is dominated by the copper industry, which
contributes nearly 40% of GDP, 95% of exports and provides the major part of
Government revenues. The GNP per capita was about US$380 in 1971.
2.02      Government objectives for economic development aim at (i) develop-
ing and diversifying the modern sector, including mining, and (ii) increasing
the agricultural output by raising the productivity, especially in rural
areas with good agricultural potential. Achievement of these objectives
requires an adequate telecommunications network capable of providing effi-
cient domestic and international services to support administrative, commer-
cial and industrial activities. It must cover adequately the wide area over
which agricultural and rural population is scattered in order to allow inte-
gration of the population, administration and commerce.
The Telecommunications Sector
2.03      Public telecommunications services are provided jointly with
postal services by the Posts and Telecommunications Corporation (PTC) under
the provisions of the Posts and Telecommunications Corporation Act of 1975.
PTC has just succeeded the General Post Office of Zambia (GPO), a department
of the Ministry of Power, Transport and Works.
2.04      The decision for converting GPO into a corporation was taken by
the Government in order to vest it with sufficient autonomy, which was not
possible under the civil service regulations if GPO continued as a Govern-
ment department. The Act under which PTC is established achieves this goal
by giving it adequate powers in such essential fields as planning, staffing
and procurement. It also provides for an adequate separation between postal
and telecommunications services with respect to finance and accounts. Powers
retained by the Ministry of Power, Transport and Works, PTC's parent Ministry,
are those usually associated with governmental responsibilities and include
approval of tariffs, budgets and development goals. These arrangements are
satisfactory.
2.05      PTC is responsible for allocation of radio frequencies, controlling
sites of radio stations and licensing of all private telecommunications.



-3-
2.06      Apart from PTC, the Ministry of Information, National Guidance
and Culture with its affiliated broadcasting service, the Civil Aviation
Department, the Railways, Police and Defense services have specialized
telecommunications networks for their own purposes. The Zambia Broadcast-
ing Services operate radio and television stations, but leases the inter-
connecting circuits from PTC.
2.07      Privately owned and operated telephone systems, having access to
the public network, include four exchanges operated by mining companies for
their own use, which connect about 2,200 telephones. In addition, a portion
of ordinary PABXs, connecting about 14,000 telephones, are privately owned
and maintained. Since PTC lacks the necessary staff to take over the main-
tenance of these systems, the present arrangements are suitable.
2.08      Although at present there is no manufacture of telecommunications
equipment in Zambia, a factory now manufacturing electric cables might extend
its production to telephone cables in the near future.
Existing Telecommunications Facilities
2.09      As of December 1973  Zambia had about 59,000 telephone stations
including the 16,000 telephone stations conmected to privately owned and
operated systems (para. 2.07), which is equivalent to about 1.3 telephones
per 100 population. Although this appears relatively high in comparison
with similar countries in Africa (see Annex 1), such comparisons are not
indicative of the adequacy since these other countries have large waiting
lists which therefore conceal the extent of requirements. In Zambia, there
is a large unsatisfied demand for telephone service as shown by the waiting
list of 8,400, which is about 32% of all the direct exchange lines (25,900
DELs).  The details of the existing facilities are given in Annex 2.
(a) Local Telephone Service
2.10      As of January 1975 the public network comprised 47 local telephone
exchanges out of which 29 were automatic and the remainder manual.  The total
installed capacity of these exchanges was 35,500 lines (34,700 automatic and
800 manual) and their fill was an acceptable 75% on average. The automatic
exchanges are of the step-by-step Strowger type except for a crossbar exchange
in Lusaka and a few crossbar mobile exchanges in the rest of the country.
(b)  Long Distance Service
2.11      A backbone microwave system connects the Copperbelt Province to
Livingstone through Lusaka. It provides high quality circuits to serve about
90% of all the telephone subscribers in the country. Apart from this main
route, the long distance network consists of VHF/UHF radio systems and open-
wire lines equipped with carrier systems.  These are shown on the map.
1/-
the most recent date for which statistics are available for telephone sta-
tions in the whole of Zambia. However, up-to-date data for PTC is given
in paras. 2.10-2.12 and 2.14.



- 4 -
Automatic trunk switching exchanges are installed in Lusaka, Kitwe, Ndola
and Livingstone which provide "Subscriber Trunk Dialing" (STD) service to
the 12 principal towns situated in the Copperbelt Province and along the
railway line running from the Copperbelt Province through Lusaka to
Livingstone.
(c)  Telegraph Service
2.12      The telegraph service is available in about 70 towns; 14 of them
have access to the gentex service while others are served by point-to-point
telegraph circuits established mostly by SSB HF radio and operated in morse
code.
(d) Telex Service
2.13      As of December 1973, 404 telex subscribers were connected to three
auto-aiatic exchanges of the Strowger type, installed in Lusaka, Kitwe and
Ndola. The unsatisfied demand for telex service stood at 100.
(e) International Services
-2.14     An earth satellite station, commissioned in late 1974, provides
high quality communications to overseas destinations.  African traffic is
established by HF radio, except for the traffic to Malawi and Southern
Rhodesia which is via land-line carrier.
Service Standards
2.15      The quality of the local telephone service is poor due (i) mainly
to overload of the existing facilities which is largely a consequence of the
present shortage of facilities (see para. 2.09), and (ii) in some cases, to
the fact that some of the existing exchanges have outlived their normal life.
2.16      The quality of the long distance telephone service is also poor.-
The STD network is heavily congested due to an under-dimensioning of the trunk
switching equipment. Further, use of unreliable open-wire systems and obso-
lete VHF radio systems in large areas of the country has resulted in substandard
quality in these areas.
2.17      The domestic telegraph service, which is mostly on HF radio, is
rather poor. The telex service, apart from the fact that there is a substan-
tial delay in providing new connections, is reasonably satisfactory. The
international telegraph and telephone services are also reasonably satisfactory
although the latter is congested due mainly to overload of manual switchboards
handling international calls.
Ongoing Works (January 1975)
2.18      A contract has been placed with L. M. Ericsson for 19 new crossbar
exchanges and these are expected to be commissioned in 1976-77. The total



- 5 -
capacity of these exchanges is 22,450 lines of which 9,400 lines are for
replacement of equipment which has outlived its useful life. The cable
network of Lusaka is being improved and expanded under a contract; this
work is expected to be completed by the end of 1975. The telex network
is being expanded and modernized through two contracts relating to (i) a
new electronic exchange with a capacity of 800 lines to replace the existing
old Strowger exchanges, which is expected to be commissioned in early 1976,
and (ii) teleprinters and other subscriber plant to meet the requirements
for the next five years.



3. THE PROGRAM AND THE PROJECT
The Program
3.01      The program, which is scheduled for execution over the 1975-80
period, consists of (a) the ongoing works described in paragraph 2.18 and
(b) the proposed project described in paragraph 3.02. The cost of the
program, which includes the preliminary expenditure for the subsequent
program of expansion to commence in 1981, is estimated to be K 69.9 (US$109.1)
million including a foreign exchange component of US$69.3 million equivalent.
Annual and total capital expenditures are shown in Annex 3 while selected
network data is given in Annex 4.

3.02      The proposed project is composed of new works which will be
implemented in the 1975-80 period and consists of the following main items:
(i) installation of local exchange equipment of about 31,000 lines
including 7,900 for replacement of worn out equipment, giving a
net addition of about 23,100 lines;
(ii) expansion of the cable networks to provide about 31,000 connections;
provision of PABXs (including a 1,000-line PABX in Lusaka for the
Government) and subscriber apparatus;
(iii) expansion of long distance network including new microwave links
between Lusaka, Kasama and Nakonde on the Tanzanian border, between
Lusaka and Chipata on the Malawi border, and between Livingstone
and Mongu; construction of about 2,500 km of VHF/UHF radio links;
addition of multiplex equipment on existing and new routes to pro-
vide about 2,200 additional long distance circuits; construction of
new trunk exchanges in Lusaka, Kitwe, Ndola and Livingstone;
(iv) extension of gentex service to about 25 additional localities which
are at present served by means of point-to-pointtelegraphcircuits; and
(v) installation of an international switching center in Lusaka.
Details on the project are given in Annex 5 and in the map.
Cost of the Project
3.03      The estimated cost of the project, summarized below, is K 50.1
(US$78.2) million, including a foreign exchange component of US$52.2 million
equivalent.  Details, including annual expenditures, are given in Annex 3.

of basic estimate.
3.04       The project cost estimates for imported equipment and services
are based on PTC experience of prices obtained for the ongoing works (see
para. 2.18), and on recent experience of local expenditure for civil works,
buildings and installation. The basic prices, before contingencies, have
been updated to reflect the situation at the beginning of 1975 by using the
past trend for price of telecommunications equipment and associated services
and works.
3.05       The cost estimates do not include any custom duties or import
taxes on telecommunications equipment, which is exempt from these under
current fiscal system. They include a small provision, viz. US$200,000 or
about 15% of the CIF cost, for vehicles which are liable,to custom duties
under this system. Zambia has no agreement giving preferential tariffs to
other countries.
Contingencies
3.06       Ordinarily no physical contingencies are associated with either
local or foreign exchange costs of local service items as these form part
of a continuing growth process and comprise a large number of works spread



- 8 -
throughout the country with deviations in the estimates tending to balance
out in the aggregate. However, physical contingencies on both local and
foreign costs of 7% have been included in the project estimate for items
associated with the long distance network to cover a possible growth of
the long distance traffic at a faster rate than projected.
3.07      Price contingencies provided for in the estimate of total project
cost amount to 24% of foreign exchange costs and 30% of local costs and are
based on likely price increases for telecommunications equipment, associated
services and civil works over the project period.
Items for Bank Financing
3.08      The items proposed for Bank financing are summarized below
(cost estimates include equipment costs plus, where applicable, foreign
exchange costs of installation):
Local switching equipment                           8.73
Subscriber and junction cables and
associated plant items                           5.25

3.09      The African Development Bank (ADB) is financing the microwave
link between Lusaka, Kasama aLxd Nakonde on the Tanzanian border, which will
form part of the Pan-African Telecommunications Network, and various spurs
of this link, estimated to cost together about US$8.6 million, including a
foreign component of US$5.2 million. SIDA is participating to the extent
of US$2.5 million in the financing of the trunk and international switching
equipment, estimated to cost US$3.7 million - the remainder being financed
by PTC. Other main items forming part of the project but not proposed for
Bank financing are: a 5,000 line extension of the Ridgeway exchange in
Lusaka, estimated to cost US$1.3 million, the 1975-1976 expansion of the
cable networks (US$4.8 million) in the Copperbelt cities to be executed
under a turnkey contract; part of the new vehicles needed during the project
period, and extension equipment for existing facilities.
Procurement Arrangements
3.10      All equipment and material financed by the Bank would be subject
to international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank Group's



"Guidelines for Procurement". As requested by Government, a domestic pre-
ference of 15% of the CIF cost or the applicable customs duties, whichever
is lower, would be applied to bids on cables to provide for a possible bid
from a local manufacturer (see para. 2.08). The estimated cost of these
cables is not expected to exceed US$4.5 million.
Disbursements
3.11      The proposed Bank loan would be disbursed against CIF cost of
imported equipment and materials, the foreign cost of services and the
ex-factory cost of any locally awarded contract for goods specified under
the loan. Estimated disbursements from the proposed loan are shown in
Annex 6. Any unused balance of the loan would be made available after
consultation with the Bank for purchase of additional goods or services
similar to those already procured under the loan.
Execution
3.12      PTC is carrying out planning and detailed engineering of the
project with the assistance of a planning unit provided by Swedish con-
sultants (SWEDTEL) who are at present located with PTC's parent Ministry
in Lusaka and will be transferred to Ndola and attached to PTC directly.
PTC has just drawn up the specifications for the switching equipment inclu-
ded in the project; the specifications for the microwave link Lusaka-
Kasama-Nakonde have been set up by a consultant sponsored by the International
Telecommunication Union (ITU); other microwave links and VHF/UHF radio systems
forming part of the project will be surveyed by a consultant team not yet
selected. The switching equipment and the trunk bearers will be installed
by the equipment suppliers while the expansion of the cable networks in the
;aain cities will be executed up to 1976 by contractors with the assistance
of local staff. After 1976, PTC staff will execute all cable network expan-
sion on its own which is the most desirable arrangement. Other minor works
included in the project will be installed by PTC. Depending on its staff
resources (see para. 5.08 and 5.09), PTC may need assistance for supervision
of installation and commissioning of the switching equipment; in this case
PTC would contract the services of a suitable consultant. The above arrange-
ments for project execution have been discussed and agreed upon during
negotiations.



4.  JUSTIFICATION OF THE PROJECT
Main Objectives
4.01      Past development of the Zambian telecommunications network has
been far behind requirements, as shown by the large waiting list for tele-
phone and telex connections (see paras. 2.09 and 2.13) and the poor service
standards at present reached (paras. 2.15 to 2.17). The Government, well
aware of the adverse consequences of poor telecommunications services on
achievement of its economic and social targets has decided to remedy the
present situation. The program which includes the proposed project is the
most important step in this direction. Its implementation will (i) reduce
the waiting list to a more reasonable relative level, (ii) remove the present
congestion of the network, (iii) extend the long distance network to 32
additional cities spread over the country and not served at present, and
(iv) provide high quality international telecommunications with the instal-
lation of adequate switching facilities enabling semi-automatic operation
of international telephone links.
Demand for Telecommunications Services
(a) Local Telephone Service
4.02      As of December 31, 1973, PTC had about 25,900 direct exchange
lines and about 8,400 waiting applicants, giving a total expressed demand
of about 34,300 DELs. This does not take into account the existence of a
latent demand consisting of (i) demand in the areas not yet served, such as
Lundazi and Samfya, which is not recorded in the waiting list established
by PTC, and (ii) latent demand in the currently served areas from persons
who, because of the long delays in getting connections, have refrained from
applying for telephones. The latent demand has been estimated at about
3,000 giving a total demand of about 37,000 at the end of 1973.
4.03      The demand has been forecast to increase from the end of 1973 at
a conservative rate of 9% per annum, giving a total demand of 68,000 DELs
at the end of 1980. Though this rate is lower than in other developing
countries, it is consistent with the past trend in Zambia and is reasonable.
The number of persons waiting for connections at the end of the project
period is estimated to be about 15,000 and represent 28% of the number of
connections, PTCts limited manpower resources prohibitting it from coping
fully with demand by this date. Historical growth of demand and DELs as
well as forecasts are shcwn in Annex 7.
(b) Long Distance Services
4.04      Forecasts established by PTC for the long distance traffic are
based on (i) an assumption that the total local and long distance traffic
(both outgoing and incoming) per subscriber will be, on average, 0.11 erlang
irrespective of the size of the local telephone exchange system to which the



- 11 -
subscriber is connected, and (ii) an allocation of the total traffic per
subscriber between local and long distance services. These assumptions are
incorrect - total traffic per subscriber is usually lower in small exchanges
and the proportion of the total traffic which is for long distance in the
large exchanges is too high. For these reasons the forecast estimates of PTC
were considered high for the specific configuration of exchange sizes in
Zambia. The program has been adjusted to a more realistic forecast which
provides for a slower overall growth. Annex 8 gives the circuit requirements
for 1980 calculated from these revised forecasts.
(c) Telex Service
4.05      As of December 1973, the demand for telex connections stood at
504 including a waiting list of 100 applicants. Based on an increase of
about 10% per annum, which is reasonable, demand is expected to be about
1 00    the end of 1980.  The expansion proposed in the project is designed
to meet this demand.
(d) International Services
4.06      New international facilities together with additional multiplex
and switching provisions included in the project, will improve significantly
the quality of the international telephone and telex services. Partly as a
result of the better quality, telephone and telex traffic is expected to grow
at an average annual rate of 25% and 19% respectively over the project period
(1975-1980). Telegraph traffic, which is far less sensitive to improvement
of the quality of related facilities, is likely to show a moderate increase.
Least Cost Solution
4.07      The development of the telephone network is based on the use of
common control switching equipment for the new exchanges. This solution,
which has already been adopted for the exchanges under construction, is the
best suited to the specific configuration of the Zambian telephone network.
Decision already made for replacing gradually much of the old step-by-step
exchanges is justified since these exchanges have reached the end of their
economic life.
4.08      Development of the primary long distance network is based on micro-
wave links rather than coaxial cables. This provides the least cost solution
in this case and will also facilitate the subsequent addition of a television
channel. The secondary network will be extended by VHF/UHF radio facilities,
better suited to local conditions than open-wire lines. The existing open-
wire lines will be used only to provide short local circuits, where their lack
of reliability will be less critical than for the long distance circuits which
they provide at present.
4.09      Local network planning and plant provisioning periods follow appro-
priate practices. For the new and extended cable networks, PTC has recently



- 12 -
adopted modern solutions, including the use of conduits and cross-connection
cabinets in the large networks, which give flexibility and are economical in
the long term.
Economic Rate of Return
4.10      The internal rate of return on the project, defined as the dis-
count rate which equalizes the stream of expected revenues attributable to
the project with the capital and operating costs, net of amortization, taxes
and duties attributable to it, is 16.7%. The basis of this estimate is
given in Annex 10. A sensitivity analysis has been carried out, showing
that even an unfavorable combination of the main parameters would result
in a rate of return of no less than 12.0%.



5. THE BORROWER
5.01      The Posts and Telecommunications Corporation (PTC), the recently
established Government Corporation which has replaced the General Post
Office (GPO), would be the borrower; its role in the sector is given in
paragraph 2.03.
Organization
5.02      PTC's present organization is along normal lines for an entity
operating both the posts and telecommunications services. It is shown in
Annex 11. The headquarters consists of five divisions - Telecommunications,
Posts, Finance and Accounts, Personnel and Administration, and Training.
The last three divisions are common and deal with both postal and telecom-
munication services.
5.03      The telecommunications division is organized in three sections:
(i)  Engineering Projects, dealing with the development-related activities;
(ii)  Engineering Services, responsible for the maintenance of the network;
and
(iii)  Telecommunications Services, responsible for commercial matters
(including billing), traffic and statistics, and manual operations.
The present structure is strongly centralized with PTC headquarters at Ndola
and a small regional office in Lusaka which is responsible for the day-to-day
operation and maintenance in the southern half of the country. These arrange-
ments are satisfactory considering the present size of the network and operations.
Management
5.04      PTC's management, headed by a Postmaster General, a Zambian national,
is adequate. The present Director of Telecommunications was provided under
the Swedish Aid (SIDA) in the fall of 1972 and has considerable experience
in this field. Most other senior executives in the telecommunications division
are expatriates, especially in the engineering section where they account
for almost 100% of the managerial staff. They are generally competent. The
Director of Finance is also an expatriate, and while he will require assistance
to set up a new accounting system (para. 5.11), he will be able to maintain it
after the new system is set up.
5.05      The policy of the Government is to Zambianize posts now filled by
expatriates as soon as qualified and competent Zambians are available. This
policy would in the long run ensure that the know-how acquired in the oper-
ation and development of the network will stay in Zambia and provide better
continuity of management. Recruitment and training needs to achieve this
are discussed in paras. 5.08 to 5.10. A first step towards Zambianization



- lit -
has been taken recently at the management level with the appointment of a
Zambian to the post of Assistant Director, Telecommunications Services.
Further steps in this direction will be taken when competent staff is
available.
Staff
5.06      As of December 1973 the total staff employed for telecommunications
activities was about 1,600 including 150 for telegraph operations, This works
out to a ratio of 35 staff per 1,000 telephones installed, which is reason-
able. Expatriates were still numerous in the telecommunications division
(about 200), filling technical posts ranging from telecommunications engineers
to jointers. More rapid Zambianization should be possible in the future as
a result of improvements both of local recruitment (para. 5.08) and in train-
ing methods (para. 5.10).
5.07      In view of the need for gradual Zambianization of the posts filled
by expatriates (para. 5.05) and the growing need for skilled staff resulting
from the future expansion of the network, it is necessary to determine the
manpower and training requirements for the next five to six years. Some
steps have already been initiated by PTC in this direction. It was agreed
during negotiations that PTC will complete these by December 31, 1975 and
submit the results to the Bank for comments.
Recruitment
5.08      In the past, with a few exceptions, recruitment from the Univer-
sity of Zambia and the Zambian Institute of Technology has not been possible
due to the insufficient number of graduates compared to Zambia's overall
requirements. Improvement is expected in the future as a result of the
increase in the number of graduates and more competitive salaries which can
be introduced now that telecommunication services are run by a corporation.
Recruitment of lower grade staff has improved considerably with the increased
number of secondary school graduates. Even so the present arrangement for
recruiting all technicians at secondary school level also needs review; lower
educational qualifications should be sufficient.
5.09      In the short term, for some years more, PTC will have to continue
relying on foreign recruitment to meet its growing requirements. It has been
experiencing problems in recruiting competent staff from its traditional source,
the UK, but it hopes to meet these requirements by recr,uiting primarily in Asia,
where the response has been satisfactory.
Training
5.10      The PTC training school at Ndola, assisted by UNDP, is equipped for
the simultaneous training of 150 postal and telecommunications trainees up
to the technician level. The training has been based on a curriculum of City
and Guilds Examination (UK) which covers diverse needs and involves a period



of four years for each technician to be qualified. Recently the prograri has
been reviewed by PTC and a modular and job-oriented system has been adopted.
This type of training system, which is used in USA and Sweden, is based on
giving a number of short courses (of a few weeks up to two months) each
aimed at training for a particular job. Adoption of such a system should
make it possible for the training center to produce the necessary output of
skilled technical staff in the future without any major increase in the fac-
ilities already available.
Accounts
5.11      Although PTC's present accounting system (which was taken over
from GPO) produces annual financial statements based on the accrual con-
cept, it has a number of deficiencies in that: (i) it does not provide for
separate accounts of the postal and telecommunications operations necessary
to assess the financial performance of each service; (ii) it lacks a work
order system and (iii) it lacks an effective budgetary control system. It
is essential to overcome these deficiencies and introduce an adequate com-
mercial system of accounting.  Since PTC does not have the staff capable
of undertaking this job, financial/accounting consultants to be financed
under the proposed loan have been retained.  These consultants will make
recommendations for the setting-up of a proper accounting system and assist
in its implementation (terms of reference in Annex 12). During negotiations,
assurances were obtained that the necessary studies will be completed by
September 1975 and implemented in accordance with a time schedule to be
agreed with the Bank.
Audits
5.12      GPO's accounts were being audited annually by the Auditor General.
Although the Auditor General, if given necessary resources, can carry out
an audit of PTC satisfactory to the Bank, the scope and timeliness of these
audits at present, from the Bank's viewpoint, is inadequate. Government
corporations in Zambia are in general audited by private firms. Assurance
was obtained during negotiations that beginning with FY1975 annual audits
will be performed by an independent auditor acceptable to the Bank and that
the auditor's report and certified financial statements for PTC and its two
services separately will be submitted to the Bank within eight months after the
close of each fiscal year.
Billing and Collection
5.13      The present billing system, which utilizes simple accounting machines,
is fairly satisfactory. Howiever, since the volume of work is expected to double
over the next five years, the present system will need to be reviewed to recom-
mend modifications as may be needed. Such a review has been included in the
terms of reference of the accounting consultants (para. 5.11). Up to October
1973, all Government bills were paid by the Ministry of Finance, which were



- 16 -
later settled with the various Ministries and Government Agencies. These
arrangements worked quite well. In late 1973 the procedure was changed and
collection had to be made directly from each Ministry and Agency. Some
transitional difficulties were being experienced in getting the accounts
settled, but the situation subsequently improved and will be kept under
review.
Tariffs
5.14      The present telecommunications tariffs are set out in Annex 13.
The level of these tariffs is inadequate to generate a reasonable rate of
return and to provide the funds necessary to expand and improve the service
(para. 6.4). The structure of the present tariffs, which is based on meter-
ing of local calls with no free calls, is basically sound. The annual rental
of K 17.00 (US$27.00) and the call charge of K 0.03 (US$.045) are both within
the range encountered in many countries. The long distance tariff has recently
been reviewed and adjusted to eliminate some minor anomalies.



6. FINANCES
Background
6.01      Up to 1972, GPO, which has now been succeeded by PTC, was required
to invest its annual net operating surplus in Government bonds and it re-
ceived its annual capital requirements from Government in the form of loans.
After 1972, GPO was allowed to retain its surpluses for capital development
and only the net requirements were being met from Government. While postal
services are being operated at a loss, the telecommunications services gen-
erate a satisfactory surplus which, after covering the postal deficits,
resulted in an cverall satisfactory financial situation. The future fin-
ancial situation of the telecommunications service is expected to be sound
with the rate of return to be 11%. Funds generated out of telecommunica-
tions operations are in future expected to be used for telecommunications
development and would provide 33% of investment requirements.
Past Finances
6.02      Income statements for the consolidated operations (posts and tele-
communications) for the 1968-1974 period are shown in Annex 14.  Proforma2/
income statements for telecommunications separately are shown in Annex 15.
Although postal service is being operated at a loss which is estimated to be
about US$1.0 million, the telecommunications service generated a profit
resulting in a net profit for the combined operations of K 1.3 million in
1972 and 1973. However, the practice of automatically using the surplus of
telecommunications operations to cover deficits arising out of postal opera-
tions did not promote operational and developmental efficiency and good fin-
ancial management. With the new corporation, the two services will be finan-
cially autonomous and transfers of funds will only be made as a result of
properly prepared action for which the implications have been critically
analyzed. As measured by the rates of return on net plant in service, past
financial performance for the consolidated operation was satisfactory up to
1972 when it exceeded 10%; however it decreased in 1973 to 7% and in 1974 to
4.7% (estimated). The rate of return of telecommunications separately has
also been satisfactory.
Present Financial Position
6.03      Actual balance sheets for the consolidated operation are shown in
Annex 16, and the position as of December 31, 1973 is summarized below:
j GPO has not kept separate accounts for postal and telecommunications
operations.

tion equipment have been fairly stable. Plant life estimates are high for
some items and low for others but on balance appear to be on the high side
which has caused inadequate provision for the accumulated depreciation.
During negotiations, it was agreed that the depreciation rates and the
adequacy of the depreciation reserve would be reviewed and any changes
required implemented by about December 1975. Separate accounts are not
kept for postal and telecommunication operations except for equipment used
exclusively for telecommunications purposes. The value of these items con-
stituted 84% of fixed assets at December 31, 1973. The remaining fixed
assets comprising buildings and vehicles would to a large extent be attri-
butable to telecommunication operations and overall, more than 90% of fixed
assets are for telecommunication purposes. Proforma balance sheets for tele-
communications operations are shown in Annex 17.
6.05      Long term capital consists of:  (i)  the value of the assets taken
over when GPO was formed in 1963; (ii) reserves which include retained
earnings and a sinking fund; and (iii) funds obtained from the Government
for capital development.  Interest of 5-1/4 to 6-1/4% is payable to the
Government on long-term capital except for the reserves.
Financing Plan
6.o6      Forecast funds flow statements are in Annex 18. Requirements of
funds for telecommunications development and sources from which they would
be met over the 1975-1980 period are summarized in the following table:

6.07      The funds available from internal sources are projected to be
K 35.7 million. This estimate assumes that additional revenues would need
to be raised through adjustments in the tariffs in the 1976-1980 period.
Debt service includes debt service payments on the estimated portion of
existing debt that has been incurred in respect of telecommunications
development, and the loans that are being contracted for the program. The
decrease in working capital is due to the liquidation of securities that
has been used in the past for investment of surplus funds.
6.o8      The funds froa external sources include (a) a loan from ADB,
(b) a grant made by the Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA)
to finance the trunk and international exchange, (c) a loan from Government
already included in the proposed 1975 budget, (d) a loan to be made from
Government to cover the estimated remaining requirements, and (e) the proposed
Bank loan. Also included is a portion of an assumed future loan which would
partly cover advance payments on the program beginning in 1979.



- 20 -
6.09      The financing plan does not provide for any dividend to be paid
during the construction period and it also assumes that beginning in 1975
telecommunications profits no longer will be used automatically to cover
postal requirements (para. 6.02). During negotiations, assurances were
obtained that payments of dividends will only be made after Bank approval.
Furthermore, during negotiations, assurances were obtained that telecommuni-
cations funds would be used for other purposes only when those funds were
surplus to telecommunications' operational, debt service and investment
requirements and that, in the event of deficits resulting from other activities
carried out by PTC, Government would take steps satisfactory to the Bank to
cover such deficits.
Future Finances
6.10      Forecast income statements and balance sheets of telecommunica-
tions are given in Annex 15 and 17. Notes and assumptions are given in
Annex 19. Salient features are shown below:
Year Ending December 31: 1972 1973 1974 1975 1976 1977 1978 1979 1980 1981 1982

Debt Service Coverage     3.5  3.0  7.0  2.5  2.2  2.4  2.3  2.1  2.1  1.5  1.6
6.11      Operating expenses before taxes are projected to increase during
the 1975-80 period by an annual average of 16% and income taxes by an annual
average of 18%. This forecast takes into account the fact that the new
corporation will no longer enjoy various exemptions and privileges in the
past enjoyed by GPO such as exemptions from taxes and customs duties. It
also provides for general salary increases that will make the salary level
in the new corporation more competitive. These are needed to attract compe-
tent staff to operate and maintain the expanded network. As revenues based
on present tariffs only are expected to increase by 13% per annum, the re-
turn on net fixed telecommunications assets in operation without tariff
increases is expected to gradually decrease to below 3% by 1980. Overall,
telecommunications would without a tariff increase show a loss after 1975.
To ensure that the telecommunication operations earns a satisfactory return
on its investments and to allow a reasonable contribution from earnings for
the financing of this project as well as for continued development after the
completion of the proposed project, it was agreed during negotiations that
the retu-rn on telecommunication assets would be maintained at not less than
11% beginning in 1976. This requirement will make necessary gradual adjust-
ments of tariffs from 1976 that would increase the level of revenues towards
the end of the period by about one third.



- 2X -
6.12      During the construction period short-term finance is expected to
be required to overcome temporary funds shortages. During negotiations,
assurances were obtained that such funds will be available as and when
required. The overall financial position is expected to be satisfactory
and the debt/equity ratio is expected to be about 69% after the completion
of the project. During negotiations it was also agreed that Bank approval
would be obtained before new long-terra debt is assumed unless the debt
service coverage exceeds 1.4 (actual present internal cash generation divi-
ded by maximum future debt service for all existing debt and the proposed
loan).
Fiscal Impact
6.13      During the 1975-1980 period, Government is expected to receive
interest payments totalling K 9.7 million and tax payments o- K 7.5 million.
Since the Government has already included about K 5.7 million in the 1975
budget for the telecommunications capital development program and a further
contribution of K 11.3 million is required in 1977-1979, the net fiscal
impact is a K 0.2 million receipt by Government. After the construction
period, the net payments to Government would becane larger.



7. AGREEMENTS AND RECO'MEIDATION
7.01      The followrng assurances have been obtained.
(a) If necessary PTC would contract the services of a suitable
consultant to assist in supervision of installation and com-
missioning of the switching equipment (para. 3.12);
(b) A new accounting system will be established with the help of
management/financial consultants (para. 5.11);,
(c) Audit reports together with certified financial statements will
be submitted to the Bank within eight months after the close of
each fiscal year (para. 5.12);
(d) PTC will review depreciation rates and the adequacy of the
accumulated depreciation (para. 6.o4);
(e) Dividends during the construction period will only be made
after Bank approval (para. 6.09);
(f)  Telecommunications funds will only be used for other purposes
when these funds are not needed for telecommunications purposes
and that in the event of deficits resulting from other activities
carried out by PTC, the Government would take steps satisfactory
to the Bank to cover these deficits (para. 6.09);
(g)  Tariffs will be maintained at a level adequate to assure a minimum
rate of return on average net assets of 11% (para. 6.11);
(h) Funds will be made available as and when required to overcome
projected temporary cash shortages (para. 6.12); and
(i) Additional debt will only be incurred with the approval of the
Bank if historical 12-months internal cash generation will cover
maximum future debt service at least 1.4 times (para. 6.12).
7.02      A condition of effectiveness of the loan is that the Government
has entered into an agreement with PTC to lend the amount required to complete
the financing plan (para. 6.08).
7.03      With the above assurances, the proposed project constitutes a suit-
able basis for a Bank loan of US$32 million for a term of 20 years including
four years of grace.

Existing Facilities
Local Telephone Facilities
1.        The exchange capacity of the telephone network is 35,524 lines
(January 1975) out of which 34,709 are automatic and 815 are manual (see
Annex 5 for details). Automatic exchanges are in operation in 26 towns of
whdch Lusaka, Kitwe and Ndola have more than one exchange. "Subsatellite
units" (SSUs), which technically form part of a main exchange but are located
at the center of the distant area they serve, are used in eight cities.
Most automatic exchanges are of the Strowger step-by-step type and have
been installed up to the mid-fifties. The few main exceptions are (i) a
5,000-line crossbar exchange at Lusaka Ridgeway, and (ii) six 1,000-line
crossbar mobile exchanges used on a temporary basis to provide new connections
in networks where this would be otherwise impossible due to lack of exchange
capacity. Manual exchanges are in operation in 17 cities.
2.        As of December 1973 there were 25,859 Direct Exchange Lines
giving an exchange fill of 72.8%. The total number of telephones in service
was about 43,000 out of which nearly 2,000 were connected to some 180
party lines.
3.        The subscribers' distribution netwiorks make extensive use of a
armored cable laid directly in the ground. PTC is now using ducts in the
main cities and has shifted recently from paper insulated, lead sheathed
cables to plastic insulated plastic sheathed cables. Most distribution
networks have little or no spare capacity.
Long Distance Facilities
4.        The primary long distance network consists of
(i)  a 2GHz microwave link, installed in 1968, which connects Lusaka
and the Copperbelt (Ndola, Kitwe);
(ii)  a 6.8GHz microwave link, recently commissioned, which connects
Lusaka and Livingstone;
(iii)  2GHz UHF radio links between Kitwe and Mansa, and Kitwe and
Solwezi; and



ANNEX 2
Page 2 of 3 pages
(iv) various open-wire lines equipped with carrier systems (see map).
The secondary network consists of open-wire lines with carrier systems,
some VHF radio links, and a few HF radio links.
5.        Transit switching units commissioned in September 1971 in Lusaka,
Ndola, Kitwe and Livingstone provide STD service between twelve main towns
located in the Copperbelt and along the railway line running from the
Copperbelt province through Lusaka to Livingstone. The service, however, is
poor due to congestion in these exchanges.
Domestic Telex and Telegraph Facilities
6.        The telex network consists of three automatic exchanges of the
Strowger type with a capacity of 460 lines in Lusaka, Ndola and Kitwe to
which 404 subscriber lines are connected (December 1973).
7.        A gentex service is in operation between 14 main towns while
point-to-point circuits, most of them being established by means of SSB
HF radio equipment, provides about 60 other towns with telegraph service.
International Facilities
8.        A satellite earth station has been put in operation at the end
of 1974 and provides high quality circuits to other continents; however the
congestion of the manual switchboard positions associated to the earth
station results in a rather poor quality of the telephone service, waiting
times of several hours before an intercontinental call is put through
being usual. The situation will improve in the future with the commission-
ing of an international transit center - which forms part of the Project -
which will make possible semi-automatic operation of international circuits.
9.        Traffic to Rhodesia and Malawi is routed over land lines equipped
with carrier systems (from Livingstone and Siavonga to Rhodesia, and from
Chipata to Malawi). Other interafrican connections, except a six-channel
VHF link between Kitwe and Lubumbashi in Zaire, are provided by HF ISB
radio systems in Lusaka to Nairobi (2 telephone channels, 8 telegraph
channels) and Dar es Salaam (1 telephone channel, 4 telegraph channels).
International telex traffic is automatic to Rhodesia, Malawi, Botswana and
South Africa; it is operated manually elsewhere.
Ongoing Works (January 1975)
Local Telephone Facilities
10.       Nineteen ARF crossbar telephone exchanges totalling 22,450 lines
are to be installed in 1976-1977 at Kitwe (9,000 lines), Chingola (3,000 Uncc),
1Nufulira (3,000 lines), Luanshya (3,000 lines), Choma (800 lines), Chipata
(800 lines), Mazabuka (800 lines), Monze (600 lines), in the rest of the

Chona Group (3 exchanges totalling 350 lines), the Chipata Group (5 exchanges
totalling 500 lines), the Kitwe Group (2 exchanges totalling 400 lines), and
at Mumbwa (200 lines). The contract for these exchanges includes trunk
switching equipment for Ndola (200 lines), Choma (400 lines) and Chipata (200
lines).
11.       The cable network in Lusaka is being expanded under a turn-key
contract passed to L. M. Ericsson, which will bring the capacity of the
primary cable network to 13,500 pairs by the end of 1975.
Long Dstance Facilities
12.       Ongoing works include (i) the construction of UHF radio links
between Goma, Pemba, Namwala and Itsehi Teshi and between Pemba and Gwembe,
and (ii) various expansions of multiplex equipment on existing facilities.

Rate of Return
General
1.        The rate of return calculation is based on costs and revenues
during a 20-year period (the average lifetime of the equipment) commencing
in 1979 when most of the equipment will be in operation. All costs and
revenues are in constant (1975) prices. Revenues and costs--capital as
well as current--from equipment which is to replace worn out equipment has
been excluded from the calculations.
Construction Costs
2.        Project expenditures excluding contingencies have been obtained
from Annex 3.
Operating Costs
3.        The cost of additional staff during the 1977-1981 period has been
apportioned between ongoing works and the project in proportion to their
value. Likewise, the incremental costs for materials, accommodation, etc.,
has also been apportioned on the same basis.
Operating Revenues
4.        New subscribers connected during the 1977-1981 period have been
apportioned between ongoing works and thle project in proportion to installed
switching plant. The revenue attributable to the project consists of
(i) telephone revenue generated by subscribers attributable to the project
and obtained by multiplying their average number by the average revenue per
subscriber, and (ii) the portion of revenues generated by other subscribers
which can be attributed to improvement and expansion of the long distance
network under the project.
Cost and Revenues
5.        The incremental annual costs and revenues in K million attributable
to the project are summarized below:

Accounting and Financial Services Reorganization
Terms of Reference 1/
1.        The Government of Zambia has decided to reorganize the General
Post Office (GPO) which is responsible for all Postal and Telecommunica-
tions in Zambia. This will include a separation of GPO's accounting and
financial services as well as a separation of its assets and liabilities
between telecommunications and postal operations.
2.        The broad objectives of the reorganization of GPO, which results
from the recognition of the commercial nature of telecommunication operation,
are to unify responsibility and control of telecormunication operations and
to make possible a measure of performance of telecommunications separately
from postal operations. The objectives of the accounting and financial
services reorganization are to strengthen the financial and accounting function
by the establishment of a modern system of accounting and budgetary control
based on full commercial principles, which will provide management with timely
and adequate financial and statistical statements and reports to enable it to
effectively plan and control operations, to measure the performance of the
various services and personnel, and to evaluate periodically the adequacy of
the tariffs.
3.        The following outlines the main point-s which would be included in
the contract with the consultants engaged to carry out the necessary study,
to make the appropriate recommendation and, to assist with implementation of
the required changes. The consultants should in particular review the
appropriate timing of the introduction of the varmous subsystems taking into
consideration availability of sufficiently qualified staff.
(a) Financial Reorganization. The separation of GPO's assets and
liabilities between telecommunications and postal operations
and the establishment of separate balance sheets.
(b)  Accounting.  An accounting plan covering GPO's overall opera-
tion, and distinguishing between telecommunications and postal
oDerations; the accounting for fixed assets, associated records,
inventory and valuation of fixed assets, depreciation policies
and records, retired plant procedures; and inventory accounting,
stock levels, stock valuation, stock write-offs, sale of stocks,
procurement and ordering procedures, storage locations, and
inspection procedures.
I/ These terms of reference were drawn up for the GPO and now apply to the
Posts and Telecommunications Corporation (PTC).

(d) Costing. Cost units to be adopted for operations and capital
development; establishment of cost standards; works order system
for job costing; workshop costing; vehicle operation costing and
cost allocation; time recording; allocation of labor and material
expenses; apportionment of central administration expenses between
operations and capital development; and cost control.
(e) Organization Structure and Staffing. The detailed organizational
structure, and the degree of centralization of accounting and
financial functions required; and staff levels, qualifications
and training.
(f) Documentation. Reporting requirements with design of forms and
outline of information to be included in the various reports,

POSTS AND TELECOMMUNICATIONSCORPORATION (PTC)
Notes and Assumptions on Financial Statements /
Income Statement
1.        Telephone Rentals.  Based on the projected number of direct
exchange lines (DELs) resulting from the construction program and the
past actual average annual rental revenue per subscriber of K 30.
2.        Telephone Call Charges.  The average call charge revenue per sub-
scriber has been increasing in the past three years mainly due to the
introduction of STD and a microwave link between Copperbelt Province and
Lusaka, but is expected to remain at the present level through 1980.
3.        Telephone International.  As a result of the commissioning of
the earth station in 1974 and the new international exchange in 1976,
international revenues are expected to increase rapidly up to 1978 (composite
growth rate of 22%) from which year they are expected to grow at 15% p.a.
4.        Telex.  Due to lack of facilities only limited growth is expected
up to 1975. The commissioning of the new telex exchange in late 1975 will
make it possible to catch up with the accumulated demand.
5.        Telegraph.  In line with experience in most other countries,
telegraph revenues are expected to be fairly stagnant. The decline in
revenues between 1971 and 1972 is believed to be the delayed effect of a
decrease in the copper prices in 1970/71.
6.        Labor.  Projected labor expenses include allowances for general
increases that will make the salary level of the new corporation more
competitive (30% during 1975-76), for additional number of staff (7% p.a.
during 1975-1978 and 5% p.a. thereafter), and for general salary improvements
(10% p.a.).
7.        Other.  This item, which includes materials and stores consumed,
accommodation, administrative and general expenses, is projected to increase
at about the same rate as the number of telephone subsc.ribers.
8.        Depreciation.  A composite depreciation rate of 5% has been applied
from 1973.
1/ The financial statements presented for the period up to 1975 is for the
General Post Office, and those for the period from 1975 are for the Post
and Telecommunications Corporation. The financial statements for
telecommunicationsseparately up to 1975 are on a profonra basis as the
activities were not separated between Post and Telecommunications operation.

9.        Interest Charged Operations.  Breakdown of interest shown on Page 3.
Funds Flow Statements
10.       Government Loans.  Government loans are separated into two portions.
One represents amounts already committed and the other represents the amount to
be made available under a loan agreement to be entered into between PTC and
Government.
Balance Sheets
11.       It has been assumed that the assets and liabilities of the tele-
communications and postal operations will be separated according to usage
and that those items that cannot be clearly allocated to either operation
have been separated in the same proportions.
12.       Plant in Operation.  The amounts to be transferred from work in
progress to plant in operation has been based on the time schedule for imple-
mentation of the program and the cost estimates of the various assets to be
