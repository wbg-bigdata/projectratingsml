F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The project's development objectives are to: (i) contain the spread of HIV/AIDS/STI in
vulnerable groups as well as the general population through a focused multi-sectoral
approach, with renewed attention to the most vulnerable populations; (ii) expand the
coverage of Directly Observed Treatment (DOT), improve case detection and treatment
outcomes for TB; (iii) reduce or at least maintain malaria mortality and morbidity at the
current low levels; (iv) improve the coverage of effective Reproductive Health (RH)
interventions; and (v) strengthen the overall health system, including human resources for
health, to enable the country to better address HAMSET diseases.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.     The Eritrea HIV/AIDS/STI, tuberculosis, malaria and reproductive health project
(HAMSET II) is a repeater project of the IDA-financed Eritrea HIV/AIDS, Malaria, STD
and TB project (HAMSET). The first HAMSET (P065713) was implemented using US$
40 million IDA credit from 19 December 2000 (approval) to March 31 2006 (closing).
HAMSET II was approved shortly after on 30 June 2005 and closed on 30 June 2010.

1.1 Context at Appraisal

2.     At the time of appraisal, Eritrea had an annual Gross National Income (GNI) per
capita of US$ 180, was ranked 156 out of 177 countries in the UNDP’s 2003 Human
Development Index and was still suffering from the effects of three decades of war.

3.      Despite these challenges, Eritrea had made large strides in improving the health
status of its population in the years preceding the project: the infant mortality rate (IMR)
had fallen from 72 (1995) to 48 (2002) and the under-five mortality rate (U5M) had
fallen from 136 (1995) to 93 (2002); full immunization coverage had increased by 83%
between 1995 and 2003; and, malaria mortality and morbidity had fallen by more than
80% between 2000 and 2004, accompanied by some of the best insecticide-treated net
(ITN) coverage in SSA. HIV/AIDS prevalence was relatively low at 2.4% of pregnant
women in 2003 and the number of reported sexually transmitted infections was falling
Blood safety was impressive, with 100% of blood units screened for HIV.

4.     Notwithstanding these successes, control of HIV/AIDS/STI, tuberculosis and
malaria, as well as the improvement of reproductive health interventions, was considered
an unfinished agenda. At appraisal, the status of these five HAMSET areas of focus could
be summarized as follows:

HIV/AIDS/STI: Compared to other SSA countries, Eritrea’s average adult HIV
prevalence was relatively low at 2.4% (2003), but much higher in certain geographic
areas (up to 7.2%) and sub-populations, pointing to the threat of a more generalized
epidemic. Programmatic areas that needed strengthening were scale-up of efforts to
prevent infection, such as VCT and PMTCT, especially outside Asmara; management of
STIs; and treatment, care and support for people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA).

Malaria: The malaria program had enjoyed tremendous success in recent years (as
described above), but continuous control efforts were important because of the significant
risk of outbreaks. The epidemiology of malaria in Eritrea is very complex with different
transmission patterns in different parts of the country.

Tuberculosis: Progress in TB control lagged behind that of malaria and HIV/AIDS/STI
and it was agreed that the program suffered from inadequate implementation capacity,
weak supervision, lack of quality assurance, as well as a limited information base for
decision-making. In 2004, Direct Observed Treatment (short-course) (DOTS) coverage
was 80%, the case detection rate was 70% and the treatment success rate was 82%.


                                             1
Reproductive Health: At appraisal, Eritrea’s reproductive health (RH) indicators were
among the worst in SSA. The maternal mortality ratio (MMR) was well above the SSA
average, at 998 per 100,000 live births, with substantial regional disparities. While 70%
of pregnant women had at least one antenatal care (ANC) visit, only 30% had their
deliveries with a skilled birth attendant, and the accessibility, availability and quality of
emergency obstetric care was limited. Only 8% of women of reproductive age used
modem contraceptive methods and female genital mutilation (FGM) was widespread
(85%).

Human resources: There was also a severe shortage of skilled human resources for health
(HRH) – a legacy of the war – and health staff to population ratios were among the
lowest in Sub-Saharan Africa (at 41st out of 48 for doctors and 42nd out of 47 for nurses
and midwives).

5.      Other challenges included poor data and health information systems which
hampered decision-making, limited health financing, weak coordination of the activities
of the different technical programs of the Ministry of Health (MOH), a shortage of
qualified health staff (especially in remote areas), and a highly mobile and dispersed
population.

6.      Recipient’s policies, strategies, commitment and actions: Prior to appraisal, the
GoE had formulated a draft health sector policy, which emphasized equitable provision
of basic health service to its people. Priority was given to the control of infectious
diseases, especially HIV/AIDS/STI, TB and malaria, as well as the reduction of maternal
mortality. The GoE had developed, and had been implementing, well-defined,
comprehensive five-year plans for HIV/AIDS/STI (2003-2007), TB (2004-2008) and
malaria (2001-2005 executed, 2006-2010 adopted) that provided the framework for the
HAMSET II project’s support. There was a new emphasis on the reduction of maternal
mortality and a draft National Sexual and Reproductive Health Policy had just been
prepared. Overall, the Government had demonstrated strong commitment to improving
health, in general, and to the fight against HIV/AIDS/STI, TB and malaria, in particular.

7.     Rationale for Bank involvement: The rationale for the HAMSET II repeater
project was a combination of the success of the HAMSET project, the paucity of
domestic resources for investment in HAMSET health areas of focus1, alignment with the
Bank’s strategy for engagement in Eritrea and the Bank’s comparative advantage in this
investment area:

    -   Implementation of HAMSET had been very successful: it was considered the best
        performer in IDA’s portfolio in Eritrea and compared favorably with other IDA-
        financed Multi-Country AIDS Program (MAP) projects in the region. With the




1
  Henceforth, the phrase “HAMSET areas of focus? will be used to refer to HIV/AIDS/STI, tuberculosis,
malaria, reproductive health and human resources for health. The phrase “HAMSET diseases? will be used
to refer to HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and reproductive health.


                                                  2
          prospect of the HAMSET project closing, it was considered important to maintain
          the momentum in addressing HAMSET areas of focus and to scale up successes.
      -   It was determined that Eritrea had inadequate domestic resources for health. Apart
          from US$10.7 million from the Global Fund for AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria
          (GFATM), there was also very limited donor assistance for the health sector.
          Indeed, IDA was the largest external financier of the health sector.
      -   Investing in a follow-on project was also consistent with the Eritrea Interim
          Strategy Note (ISN) for 2005-2007 and in line with the World Bank’s overall goal
          for health, nutrition and population in the Africa region.
      -   Finally, it was determined that the World Bank has clear comparative advantages
          in (i) macroeconomics and health, (ii) multi-sectoral actions for health and (iii)
          health system strengthening. In short, according to the Project Appraisal
          Document (PAD), “For a low-income SSA country like Eritrea, the rationale to
          combat HIV/AIDS/STI, TB, malaria and RH, all of which are Millennium
          Development Goals (MDGs)…(was considered)… beyond dispute? (World Bank
          2005).

8.      Related projects: IDA’s contribution to health sector development in Eritrea has
been significant. In addition to HAMSET, the Eritrea Health Project ($24.6 million) had
recently closed and, at the time of appraisal, the Bank was supporting an Integrated Early
Childhood Development Project ($45 million) in satisfactory status. Technical assistance
in the form of a Health Sector Note (Report No. 28267-ER7 2001) informed policy
development.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)

9.    The project's development objectives, as stated in the Development Grant
Agreement (DGA), are to assist the State of Eritrea in:

(a) containing the spread of HIV/AIDS/ STI in vulnerable groups as well as the general
population through a multi-sectoral approach which aims at scaling up prevention,
diagnosis, care, and support services for HIV/AIDS/STI, with a renewed focus on the
most vulnerable populations;
(b) expanding DOTS coverage, improving case detection and treatment outcomes for
tuberculosis;
(c) further reducing or at least maintaining malaria mortality and morbidity at the current
low levels;
(d) improving the coverage of reproductive health interventions; and
(e) strengthening the overall health system’s capacity to address the HAMSET diseases.


10.       The project’s key indicators, as described in the DGA, are:

HIV/AIDS/STIs
(i) Maintain HIV prevalence rate among commercial sex workers under 12% and among
pregnant women (ANC attendees) aged 15-24 under 3%.


                                               3
(ii) Reduce syphilis sero-prevalence rate among pregnant women (ANC attendees) from
1.6% to below 1%.
Tuberculosis
(iii) Detect at least 70% of infectious tuberculosis cases in the population.
(iv) Treat at least 80% of diagnosed tuberculosis cases with DOTS.
(v) Successfully treat at least 85% of new smear positive cases.
Malaria
(vi) Further reduce or at least maintain at the 2004 levels, the proportional malaria
morbidity at 1.9% and mortality at 3.9 %2.
Reproductive health
(vii) Increase the percentage of pregnant women receiving focused antenatal care by
20%3.
(viii) Increase the percentage of pregnant women who deliver with skilled birth from
30% to 60%.
(ix) Ensure all public hospitals and health centers offer basic emergency obstetric care by
December 2009.
(x) Increase the percentage of the contraceptive prevalence rate (modern methods) from
4% to 10%4.
Human Resources for Health
(xi) Train at least 200 nurse midwives, 200 public health technicians and 200 laboratory
technicians by December 2009.
(xii) Increase the percentage of health stations with at least 1 nurse from 28% to 50% by
December 2009

data sheet.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

12.    The PDOs and key indicators were not revised.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries,

13.     The beneficiary group includes the entire Eritrean population at risk for HAMSET
diseases and that utilizes the health system. The project does not target a specific
geographic area, although it does underscore the importance of reaching areas outside the
capital and pays attention to regional variations in disease risk. It also emphasizes the
importance of reaching vulnerable groups. The particular target group differs depending


2
  These targets were transformed into absolute numbers for reporting in the ISRs. These
were a proportional malaria morbidity (confirmed cases) of 35,215 and malaria mortality
(confirmed cases) of 24, respectively
3
  As discussed in the data sheet, while the DGA described a 20% increase, the task team’s
intention was to target a 20 percentage point increase.

on the disease/condition that is being addressed. For HIV/AIDS/STI, interventions seek
to treat the infected (i.e. PLWHA), reduce transmission among individuals in core
transmitter groups (e.g. commercial sex workers, bar, hotel and shop workers,
housemaids and servants, military personnel and truck/bus drivers), and prevent
transmission from these groups to the general population. Students are an important
beneficiary category. Malaria efforts (such as bed net distribution, use and treatment)
focus on pregnant women and children under five (who are at most risk of the
consequences of malaria), and people living in high-transmission areas. Tuberculosis
efforts focus on detection in the general population and treatment of all those who test
positive. By definition, reproductive health interventions focus on women of reproductive
age, adolescents and, particularly, pregnant women, especially in those zobas (such as the
Southern Red Sea) with the highest MMR.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

14.      Component 1: Multi-Sectoral Response (appraisal estimate: US$ 3 million;
actual: US$2.34 million; actual as % of appraisal: 78%). First, this component aimed to
support participating agencies other than the Ministry of Health including the Ministry of
Education, Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Labor and Human Welfare, civil society
organizations such as the National Union of Eritrean Women at both national and zoba
level to scale up prevention, care and support interventions for HIV/AIDS/STIs, malaria,
tuberculosis and reproductive health. Second, it aimed to promote healthy behaviors and
lifestyles, through various multi-level communication methods including information
dissemination, education and communication campaigns, and peer-led behavior change
communication programs

15.     Component 2: Health Sector Response (appraisal estimate: US$ 14 million;
actual: US$16 million; actual as % of appraisal: 114%), consisting of HIV/AIDS/STI (at
approval: US$ 3 million; actual: US$1.95 million), TB (at approval: US$ 2 million;
actual: US$1.41 million), Malaria (at approval: US$2 million; actual: US$1.26 million),
Reproductive health (at approval: US$4 million; actual: US$5.58 million), and Human
Resources for HAMSET diseases (appraisal estimate: US$3 million; actual: US$5.81
million). Each of the four disease sub-components comprised three activity categories:
(a) improving the information base for decision-making, through supporting disease
surveillance and reporting, carrying out of surveys and operational research in program
management, epidemiology, entomology, drug resistance and behavior of HAMSET
diseases; (b) scaling-up and expanding preventive interventions for HAMSET diseases;
and (c) scaling up diagnostic, treatment, care and support services for HAMSET diseases,
all through technical advisory services, in-service training, financing of operating costs,
acquisition of drugs and medical supplies, equipment, and minor renovation of
reproductive health facilities. The human resources component supported the
development and implementation of an overall human resource health policy and
strategic plan to strengthen human resources for HAMSET diseases, through: (a)
consolidating existing health policies and developing a five-year national strategic plan,
and (b) developing and implementing annual work plans, the provision of technical
advisory services, training, workshops, and development and dissemination of training
materials.

16.     Component 3:         Community Managed HAMSET Response Program
(appraisal estimate: US$4 million; actual: US$3.35 million; actual as % of appraisal:
84%). This component involved scaling-up and consolidating community-managed
response initiatives to address HAMSET diseases through: (i) financing of sub-grants for
small scale community subprojects aiming at controlling HAMSET diseases, and (ii)
developing the capacity of communities to (a) mobilize and identify HAMSET problems
and (b) develop, implement, monitor and evaluate subprojects.

17.     Component 4: Project Management and Coordination, Capacity Building,
M&E, and Innovation and New Policy Development (appraisal estimate: US$ 3
million; actual: US$3.71 million; actual as % of appraisal: 124%). This component
focused on strengthening project management and evaluation capacity, through: (i)
provision of support to project management units at the national and zoba levels, and
coordination of project activities at the central level; (ii) training in planning,
management and implementation of project activities for key staff in non-health sectors
and local governments; (iii) developing and carrying out a health sector monitoring and
evaluation system; (iv) developing, piloting and evaluating innovative approaches in
service delivery; and (v) strengthening health policy related to HAMSET.

1.6 Revised Components

18.         No changes were made to project components.

1.7 Other significant changes

19.     Funding allocations: Two reallocations (see Table 1) were undertaken during
project implementation.

      (i) In May 2008 (at 61% disbursement), in response to the availability of
          substantial resources from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and
          Malaria (GFATM), there was a reallocation of resources across health sector
          response subcomponents towards priorities not supported by the GFATM,
          namely HRH and RH. This reallocation was subsequent to, and on the
          recommendation of, the Mid-Term Review.
    (ii)  In July 2009 (at 94% disbursement), and in light of continued GFATM
          funding, an additional reallocation was made.
There, nevertheless, remained a substantial share of project resources dedicated to
HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria (see the appraisal and actual estimates in section
1.5).

20.     The reallocations (which were cleared by the country director and legal
departments) took place within the HAMSET II framework and did not affect the PDOs.
In both cases, project implementation had been considered satisfactory and in compliance
with the covenants of the Development Grant agreement and there were no outstanding
audit reports. Although not a formal reallocation, in 2007, $200,000 was allocated to the
health care waste management safeguard (through a tax on all categories of expenditure
and project components). These issues will be discussed further in section 2.2.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

21.     The project was prepared over a very short period in order to allow for the
continuity of activities undertaken in the predecessor HAMSET project and to take
advantage of the remaining IDA allocation. Time taken from concept to appraisal was
only two months, with a further two months from project appraisal to Board approval.
Effectiveness was declared two months ahead of schedule. The project was also able to
move very quickly from preparation to implementation, facilitated by the preparation of
the first year’s implementation plans in advance of effectiveness. The task team took
advantage of the Quality-at-Entry Assessment (QEA) process. This resulted in only
minor changes to project design and overall quality-at-entry was rated as “highly
satisfactory? by the Quality Assurance Group (QAG). The quality of the GoE’s inputs
was a critical contributing factor to the quality of project preparation.

22.      Sufficiency of background analysis and lessons taken into account: As a repeater
project, HAMSET II was able to benefit from the experience of the previous project, as
well as related projects, and carefully incorporated some of the lessons learnt into the
design of the new project. Lessons from HAMSET include (i) the need for further
strengthening of the M&E system (reflected in the M&E activities of Component 4); (ii)
that while communities can be successfully mobilized for disease control and behavior
change, their efforts need to be genuinely community-driven (resulting in efforts to build
community capacity in needs identification and project implementation under Component
3); (iii) that implementers (especially at lower levels) should prioritize the most effective
interventions (through efforts to strengthen technical leadership, coordination and
program implementation under Components 1 and 2), and, (iv) that HAMSET diseases
cannot be adequately addressed without also improving RH services (resulting in the


                                                   7
addition of RH as a new health area of focus). The project also drew on lessons from the
earlier Eritrea Health Project (1998-2004), especially with respect to developing a more
focused PDO and results chain, in favoring “software? activities (e.g. training and policy
development) activities over “hardware? activities (e.g. construction), and in choice of
malaria control interventions. It also drew on lessons from the Interim Review of MAP
projects (2004), especially with respect to moving towards a performance-based
disbursement system, involving civil society in the design of the application process for
subgrants, and ensuring adequate resources to develop operational M&E systems.
Although deemed sufficient at the time, with the benefit of hindsight, the project could
have benefited from more background analysis of government capacity for the
implementation of the health care waste management safeguard; capacity in this regard
was overestimated with implications for project performance (see section 2.4). The
project complied with both basic repeater requirements and MAP repeater requirements.

23.     Assessment of design: This was a complex project that tackled four diseases, as
well as human resource strengthening. As noted by QAG, adding reproductive health to
an already large (albeit successful) project increased project risk with respect to the
attainment of PDOs. However, due to the limited availability of IDA funds (for Eritrea),
incorporating reproductive health into HAMSET II was the only way for the Bank team
to ensure that there would be IDA support for reproductive health – an area where there
was clearly so much unmet need (see section 1.1). One advantage of the broader scope
was that because there are both clinical links between the HAMSET diseases, as well as
strong technical links between their interventions 5 , bringing these diseases together
within one project had a strong synergistic effect. Also, adding a component on human
resources for heath – something not financed by other donors – was an important
contribution to overall health system strengthening, and the performance of all HAMSET
II disease programs. An unusual element of the HAMSET II design – and a departure
from HAMSET – was that the project components were organized by implementing
agency/group (i.e. health sector response, multi-sectoral line ministries/CSOs response
and community-managed response), rather than by HAMSET disease. This innovative
design element facilitated implementation because it followed the existing organizational
structures and allowed the multi-sectoral and community-based actors to more easily
implement multi-disease interventions. Finally, focusing on “software? rather than
“hardware? components (i.e. devoting only 4% of funds to civil works) was wise,
especially in light of macroeconomic constraints that could (and did) make construction
increasingly difficult. Overall, the project design was highly consistent with the project
development objectives and was tailored to the domestic context, project activities were
well-defined and appropriate to the challenges, and there was internal consistency in the
design elements (i.e. a clear causal chain between activities, outputs and outcomes).

 For example, since HIV patients are more likely to develop TB, HIV+ patients are routinely screened for
TB and vice versa. Similarly, because VCT services are offered during antenatal care visits, improving the
utilization of antenatal services also limits the spread of HIV infection and increases the coverage of
PMTCT.


                                                     8
24.     Adequacy of risk identification and mitigation: There was a candid risk
assessment and seemingly appropriate mitigation strategies were identified and adopted6.
In addition, a step-wise approach of developing annual work plans and annual budgets
(rather than a five year plan), together with close coordination between implementers and
development partners, was followed, providing ample opportunity during implementation
to make adjustments and manage risk. There were only a limited number of conditions of
effectiveness for the project, because of the solid track record of performance in
HAMSET, and many of them were standard. Despite the fact that mitigation strategies
were, on the whole, well-implemented, two of the project risks, namely (i)
implementation failure due to national cross-cutting challenges and underlying
macroeconomic constraints and (ii) relatively weak M&E, went on to pose
implementation challenges (see sections 2.2. and 2.3 respectively). It is unlikely that the
team could have done more during project preparation to further mitigate these risks.

25.     Participatory processes: Project preparation was undertaken in a spirit of true
partnership between the Bank and the GoE. A consultative approach was also adopted
vis-à-vis other partners, both in reviewing the experiences of HAMSET and in using
them to improve the design of HAMSET II. Highly participatory meetings were held with
all stakeholders (including officials, civil society groups and development partners).
Throughout the preparation period, the project enjoyed a very high level of commitment
from the GoE.

2.2 Implementation

26.     Progress from effectiveness to Mid-Term Review: The MTR took place on
schedule, halfway through project implementation (December 2007), when about half
(US$12.7 million) of project resources had been disbursed. At that time, although
confronted by a worsening operational environment (in terms of the macroeconomic
situation, problems with fuel, incentives, communications, non-availability of contractors
for civil works, a shortage of raw materials – all of which were beyond the project’s or
the sector’s control), project implementation was on-track. Progress in malaria control
was excellent (with continuing reductions in mortality and morbidity despite high levels
of rainfall), the HIV/AIDS/STI program was expanding as planned (with rapid scaling-up
of BCC, VCT, PMTCT, ART, care and support), and the human resources for health
subcomponent was making good progress, and had already met some of its end-of-project


6
  The risks included intensification of border tensions (to be mitigated by flexibility in project design and
implementation), the risk of complacency in disease areas where HAMSET had had major successes
(mitigated by continued policy dialogue, strengthening the information base, and communication programs),
the severe human resource shortage (to be mitigated by developing a HR subcomponent, working beyond
the public sector, and strategic procurement of consultancies while building in-country capacity), the risk of
failing to use the most cost-effective interventions at local level (to be mitigated by strengthening the
capacity of the zoba committees to appraise proposals and work plans, development of guidelines and
menus of eligible interventions, and sharing information on good practices with local implementers),
implementation failure (due to cross-cutting challenges and underlying macroeconomic constraints, and the
mixed performance of the Eritrea IDA portfolio, to be mitigated by close supervision and dialogue), and
inadequate M&E (to be mitigated by hiring M&E staff, ring-fencing the budget, making an M&E plan a
condition of effectiveness, applying LQAS, and establishing a computerized MIS in the PMU).


                                                     9
targets for pre-service training. The tuberculosis program had good treatment coverage
and outcomes, but case detection rates were low. The poorest performance in the health
sector response component was in the reproductive health subcomponent which had
shown no significant improvements in outcomes over the first two and a half years of
project implementation. The multisectoral approach was working well (but more so for
HIV/AIDS than for other HAMSET diseases) and the CMHRP component was becoming
increasingly community-driven, lowering subproject costs and reaching more
beneficiaries. Project performance as measured by both the DO and IP indicators was
satisfactory.

27.      Major decisions of MTR and follow-up actions: First, in light of the availability of
significant GFATM resources for HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria, there was a
recommendation for a reallocation of funding from these subcomponents to HRH and RH
(see section 1.7). The reallocation (which eventually occurred in May 2008) increased the
balance for RH from US$2.78 million to US$3 million and for HRH from US$1.81
million to US$4 million 7 , creating opportunities for additional investments in these
subcomponents. Reallocating funds despite the fact that the project was on-track indicates
proactivity on the part of the Bank team. Second, the MTR recommended specific
revisions to two key project indicators (KPIs) and to the targets of an additional two KPIs
(for the reasons described in Table 2). Ultimately, it was decided not to include these
proposed revisions into the results framework and HAMSET II was exempted from the
umbrella restructuring (and accompanying KPI revision) of MAP projects that occurred
in 20078. Third, the creation of a safe storage facility for DDT (funded through GFATM
resources) was agreed as an important follow-up action. This was not achieved timeously
(see section 2.4), eventually contributing to potential problem project status. Fourth, it
was agreed that additional staff would be recruited for M&E. These vacancies took a long
time to fill and, at project close, the M&E Division still lacked capacity (see section 2.3).
Fifth, it was agreed to strengthen the staffing of the Environmental Health Unit (EHU).
This was an important action for an under-resourced unit charged with ensuring an
important safeguard and this decision contributed to improvements in the implementation
of the Health Care Waste Management Plan (HCWMP). Recommendations specific to
addressing the PDOs for which performance was poorest included: (i) for TB, conducting
an assessment of the possible reasons for the low case TB detection rate, monitoring the
percentage of PLWHA referred for TB testing, improving microscopy capacity and
conducting quarterly TB review meetings for all sub-zone coordinators at zoba level; and
(ii) for RH, improving BCC activities, enhancing community mobilization (including
development of a community mobilization strategy), filling vacancies for RH focal points
at zoba level, increasing the supply of qualified obstetricians, improving referral for
obstetric emergencies (including through better communication and transportation),
improving the integration of the RH program with other disease activities, and

 HAMSET II was not part of the umbrella restructuring of MAP projects in 2007 (Report No. 39906-AFR)
which dropped the term “prevalence of HIV? from PDO indicators. This is because the GoE was able to
make a case about the link between project activities and prevalence that was deemed acceptable to the
Bank.

28.     Major factors affecting implementation: All components struggled with the
completion of renovations and civil works (due to the non-availability of contractors and
supplies), but this was (wisely) only a small share of project allocations. Recruitment of
staff and expert consultants was difficult, slowing down the filling of positions; there
were especially long lags in HRH and M&E recruitment. Conducting supervision visits
and holding national-zoba and inter-zoba meetings was difficult because of the limited
availability of fuel and vehicles, but most programs nevertheless managed to do so
despite these constraints, suggesting a high level of commitment to implementation
success. Another strength was good multisectoral coordination that helped to strengthen
integration in the management of the HAMSET diseases, avoid duplication of
interventions and fill gaps in the coverage of beneficiaries. In general, collaboration and
coordination across the technical programs, and between the technical programs and the
implementing units (at national and zoba level, including local government), improved
over the life of the project. The targeting and coverage of the main project beneficiaries
also improved. Factors affecting the implementation of specific HAMSET II components
and subcomponents are discussed in more detail in Annex 2, along with a description of
the components’ major strengths/accomplishments and weaknesses

29.     Preparation for project restructuring, including the introduction of results-based
financing (RBF): Following selection of Eritrea as an RBF pilot country (under the
Health Results Innovation Trust Fund), considerable Bank and PMU energy was put into
preparing a plan for the restructuring and three-year extension of HAMSET II. This did
not proceed (for reasons discussed in section 2.5.) and, instead, the project closed. The
restructuring would have involved changes to the PDOS and KPIs in line with the Bank’s


                                                    11
new regional requirements regarding the PDO structure of HIV/AIDS operations, as well
as the introduction of RBF pilot activities9 into the reproductive health subcomponent.
An exceptionally detailed project paper on the proposed restructuring and an RBF
operational manual were prepared, preceded by various assessments and missions. While
this preparation had an opportunity cost in terms of the attention and time of the task
team and PMU, it was very helpful in strengthening the dialogue on critical reproductive
health issues, both between the Bank and the PMU and Ministry, and within the Ministry,
and in improving the orientation towards results.

30.     Project at risk status: After satisfactory progress on the DO and IP until shortly
after MTR, HAMSET II entered potential problem project status in early 2009 when the
failure to construct a safe storage facility for DDT and delays in preparing the Health
Care Waste Management Plan (HCWMP) triggered the pest management and
environmental safeguards (see section 2.4). This raised the number of project flags to
three, including also the country environment flag (in place for the duration of the
project) and the country record flag (in place for most of the project). The project
emerged from potential problem status around January 2010 once significant progress on
these safeguards had been made. The main drivers of the country record flag were the
cross-cutting constraints linked to the overall economic and political situation (described
above) and lay beyond the control of the Ministry of Health (sector) and the PMU
(project). These became more challenging as the project progressed. Despite this, the
project was able to maintain good overall performance, and consistently outperformed
other projects in the Eritrea portfolio. This can be attributed to wise project design,
excellent sectoral leadership and commitment and the PMU management’s pragmatism
and flexibility (see section 5.2).

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

Design

31.      The focus on strengthening M&E (both directly through sub-component 4 and
indirectly through the activities of the multisectoral and CMHRP components) was, as
noted in section 2.1, a lesson learnt from HAMSET and from other MAP programs. Plans
for strengthening M&E (including the implementation of a national M&E framework, a
national operational plan, standardized reporting forms, and the development of a
Management Information System (MIS) were appropriate and, at the time, seemed
realistic. In addition, specific risk mitigation measures were taken to combat M&E
weaknesses which were deemed a “substantial? project risk. These included (i) applying
LQAS methodology in M&E, (ii) making the operational plan for M&E of HAMSET
diseases a project condition, (ii) establishing a computerized MIS in the PMU, (iii)
recruiting M&E staff for the PMU, and (iv) ring-fencing the budget for M&E.

  The RBF would have consisted of (i) conditional cash payments for utilization of antenatal care,
institutional delivery and growth monitoring, as well as transport vouchers for emergencies, and (ii) supply-
side performance-based financing (PBF) incentives for heath workers and health authorities.


                                                    12
32.     The design of the HAMSET II results framework had some good characteristics,
but, overall, was not very strong:

   (i)     On the positive side, by adopting, where possible, indicators from the National
           Strategic Plan (NSP), the HAMSET II results framework showed good
           harmonization.
   (ii)    It also monitored outcomes across a broad spectrum of beneficiaries,
           including commercial sex workers, truck drivers, pregnant women, children,
           TB patients, and the general population.
   (iii)   However, it lacked specific (intermediate) indicators related to the CMHRP
           and multisectoral components. Formally tracking and reporting of the results
           of these components might have improved their implementation.
   (iv)    Also, while the indicators in the DGA are considered sound, there were an
           inconsistency between one of the project indicators listed in the DGA and in
           the ISRs (see discussion in data sheet), and several inconsistencies between
           the indicators included in various parts of the PAD (e.g. PAD Annex 3 vs
           PAD Section B2).
   (v)     Unfortunately, baseline data for many indicators were not available until well
           into project implementation. However, once available, they were well-
           synchronized with the project start (dating to end-2004 or June 2005).

Implementation

33.     The MOH (Department of Research and Human Resources) performed routine
data collection for the technical programs well, with a sophisticated electronic HMIS:
data are collected on an extensive number of variables, there are internal consistency
checks, telephonic data verification, and monitoring of data timeliness, quality and
completeness. A subset of the HMIS addresses HAMSET diseases and there are also
databases for the multisectoral and CMHRP programs. Individual technical programs
gather data additional to that collected through the HMIS.

34.     The multisectoral component was fairly weak. Reporting and presentations by
partners had an overwhelming focus on inputs, processes and activities, with limited
reference to outcomes (e.g. changes in knowledge, attitude and behavior). The PMU
could have worked more closely with the M&E division to develop outcome indicators
that could be used for reporting early on in the project, to revise the reporting format to
include outcomes, and to synthesize data to show the cumulative progress of the
component.

35.     The CMHRP component successfully established an EPI-info based MIS for
CMHRP, in all zones and PMU, which tracks data on planned and actual activities, target
groups, expenditure and some results. Disaggregated data exist down to the sub-project
level. The CMHRP also developed a standard supervision checklist, trained zoba staff on
its use, and used it to supervise as many as 80% of community management teams
(CMTs) per month. The MIS was also upgraded during the course of the project to
include contributions from communities and supervision data. However, the CMHRP
MIS was not successfully integrated with the HMIS, did not include baseline values and


                                            13
targets for sub-projects, and (despite good intentions) was not modified to include
outcome indicators. The PMU CMHRP team can, however, track outcome indicators
manually. The CMHRP results framework (finalized with the support of the M&E
Division) could not be operationalized because there was no funding for CMHRP after
2009.

36.     The use of the results framework improved during project implementation. A
proactive step was the identification of possible revisions to the PDO indicators at MTR,
simultaneously with an in-depth analysis of M&E, even if (as discussed in section 2.2)
these revisions were not implemented In Sept 2008, the results framework was modified
in order to include the core indicators 10 for IDA 15 reporting and a special ISR was
prepared to reflect this. However, its effectiveness as a tool for project performance
measurement and monitoring was hampered by poor data availability on outcomes, A
further disappointment is the fact that that some of the endline data in the results
framework are dated. The DHS, on which the project was relying for the measurement of
some of the endline results, was delayed in its implementation, and at the time of writing,
only a limited number of preliminary indicators had been made available by the GoE.
Consequently, it is difficult to measure the attainment of all the PDOs. For instance, the
most recent HIV and syphilis prevalence data are from 2007 and the most recent TB data
are from 2008. Perhaps most critically, for most of the project period, the ISRs did not
include all the KPIs, meaning that the results framework did not effectively fulfill its
function as a project monitoring tool. Towards the very end of the project (late 2009), this
was rectified.



Utilization

37.    In general, and in spite of training, the use of data for decision-making was poor,
especially at the zoba level. The four disease programs varied somewhat in their
performance in this regard, though, and the NMCP was arguably the strongest. One
example of where the project did, in fact, excel in data utilization were the Joint Annual
Reviews (JAR) during which progress towards objectives and targets was discussed, on
the basis of data, and data-driven adjustments to program, workplans and budgets were
made. Another example was the annual (and, more recently, quarterly) zoba-level
reviews and planning exercises. It also appears that the PMU and ZPMU held periodic
discussion with stakeholders about the MIS reports.

38.      Evaluation research and its use for policy was another weak spot. There is still no
systematic mechanism for identifying and evaluating research priorities and, overall, very
little evaluation was undertaken. An evaluation with an experimental research design
carried out by the National Malaria Control Program (NMCP) and an evaluation of “Best


10
    The core IDA indicators relevant to HAMSET II include: number of direct project beneficiaries,
pregnant women receiving antenatal care during a visit to a health provider, health personnel receiving
training, long-lasting insecticide-treated malaria nets purchased and/or distributed, and health facilities
constructed, renovated and/or equipped.


                                                    14
Practices? in the sub-projects of the CMHRP were rare exceptions. While some
multisectoral partners did conduct surveys, their results were not systematically compiled
and analyzed, and there is also not much evidence that experiences in previous years
were assessed and used to inform the design of subsequent work plans. Also, while
multisectoral partners apparently documented some of their success stories, at the time of
writing this had not yet been shared with the PMU or the Bank.

Factors affecting M&E in HAMSET II:

39.     The high fragmented institutional structure of M&E (with key units spread across
three departments of M&E – M&E Division in Regulatory, HMIS in R&HR, and IDSR
and the various technical programs), as well as the CMHRP and the multisectoral
programs in the PMU, contributed to difficulties in coordination and harmonization, even
though the M&E Division has a clear mandate to lead the coordination. Also, having
responsibility for HMIS rest with one department (Research and Human Resources) and
responsibility for overall M&E supervision and direction rest with another (the M&E
Division of the Regulatory Department) severed the link between information collection,
on the one hand, and the analysis and use of that information for decision making, on the
other hand – a link that is critical for successful program management. One consequence
was that the M&E Division, which was supposed to guide the analysis and use of data for
program management, did not have access to an up-to-date repository of health data. This
was aggravated by the fact that, although the M&E Division had prepared an integrated
work plan for HAMSET II, it was often by-passed by the Bank and the PMU who went
directly to the technical program managers for their data needs, undermining the M&E
Division’s core function.

40.     Lack of human resource capacity was another consistent problem with long
delays in the recruitment of some staff to positions already envisaged during project
design, including technical staff at the central level and M&E focal points at the zoba
level. Significant time passed without a Head of the M&E Division in place. By the end
of the project, positions had been filled, but technical competencies remain limited and
the division of roles between staff is not always clear.

41.     All in all, over the course of the project, significant progress was made in the
collection and compilation of data in the health sector, but less progress was made in
using them for policy-making, planning and management. The institutional split in
competencies between the HMIS and the M&E Division remains an impediment to
improving M&E. That said, while health sector M&E may not have optimal institutional
arrangements and exhibits weaknesses in information management, the system as a whole
is capable of producing a lot of (but certainly not all) information very quickly, and
should be applauded for that. Moreover, the project was also able to deliver on most of its
planned M&E activities (described in Annex 2, Component 4).

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

42.  The safeguard policies for Environmental Assessment (OP/BP/GP 4.01) and Pest
Management (OP 4.09) were triggered. The project was classified as category “B?


                                            15
(partial assessment) at the time of appraisal because of the risks associated with the
handling and disposal of medical wastes, but as a repeater project it was permitted to use
the existing safeguards arrangements that had been developed by GoE and approved by
the Bank under HAMSET. These include the Health Care Waste Management Plan
(HCWMP) of 2004 and the creation of a MOH task force to ensure dissemination and
compliance. Overall safeguard compliance was rated moderately satisfactory or lower for
most of the project life. This was driven mainly by lack of action on the implementation
of Health Care Waste Management Plan (HCWMP) and the triggering of the Pest
Management safeguard for storage of DDT.

43.          Health care waste management:

      (i)       A primary explanation of the poor early performance on this safeguard was
                that no provision for funding of HCWM was made during project preparation
                (either at national or zoba level) and the GoE did not have the resources to
                fund it. This was rectified in 2007 through a $200,000 project tax (shared by
                all project components) and transferred to the Environmental Health Unit to
                support the implementation of the plan, enabling the unit to produce the 2007
                HCWMP.
      (ii)      A second issue was that overall management and organization was largely
                inadequate: the HCWM Task Force only managed to meet on an ad hoc basis
                about once per year and there was poor participation from other ministries and
                units.
      (iii)     Third, there was only a small number of staff assigned to HCWM. At the
                national level, the entire program was initially being implemented by only one
                environmental health manager who managed not only HCWM but a wide
                array of environmental health issues and, although a HCWM coordinator was
                later appointed, it was also not a full-time position. There were (eventually)
                HCWM focal points in each zoba, but they did not have clear terms of
                reference.

It is not surprising, then, that overall progress in HCWM was weak. By June 2009, only
moderate progress had been made in following the recommendations set out in the 2005-
2009 Health Care Waste Management Plan. Also, the development, distribution and
implementation of HCWM policy, planned for 2007, was only developed and
disseminated within the last six months of 2009, and was not yet fully implemented at
project close. Nevertheless, it is important not to be too critical: health care waste
management is an emergent area in Eritrea around which interest and commitment and
technical capacity needed to be built, and to which new resources needed to be dedicated

44.     Pest management: HAMSET II used the existing arrangements of HAMSET and,
at appraisal, had complied with the recommendations of the Environmental Assessment
for insecticides approved under HAMSET. In general, the MOH did well to ensure safety
in the use of WHO-approved insecticides for malaria control and compliance with the
pest management safeguard was rated satisfactory for the first few years of the project.
Achievements (which gained pace as the progress progressed) include training and
refresher training, provision of protective equipment, and good collaboration between


                                                16
MOH and Ministry of Agriculture (MOA). The major safeguard issue was the failure to
complete construction of a safe storage facility for DDT (not funded by the project) – the
cause of the downgrading of the safeguard rating in the ISR from a consistent S to MS in
June 2008, and later to MU. While all parties (including MOH, MOA and NMCP) agreed
on the importance of a new facility, it could not be constructed during the project period
owing to the lack of availability of contractors, fuel and materials (due, in turn, to poor
physical transport and limited foreign currency). It is now expected to be completed in
2011.

45.     Financial Management: Overall, the financial management of this project is
considered satisfactory. At the country level, the inherent risk to financial management is
considered high because of the limited information available on Eritrea’s public financial
management system, the limited number of professionally qualified accountants and the
government’s unwillingness to take ownership of the Feb 2008 CPIA. Yet, the continuity
(and longevity) of institutional, control and staffing arrangements – which are the same as
those used in the previous HAMSET project – coupled with the relative degree of
autonomy of the PMU (which is responsible for FM), its managerial strength, and the
experience and competency of its staff (some in place since HAMSET) have largely
insulated the project from this risk. Indeed, financial management was sound throughout
project implementation and, bar two exceptions, was rated as “satisfactory? in all ISRs.
All financial management reports prepared by the PMU have been submitted on-time and
judged to be of good quality, there were no unqualified audits, no accountability issues
were identified and, at project close, there were no outstanding FM issues. The only
difficulty was in the area of funds flow where, on occasions, there were difficulties in
obtaining financial information from remote zobas (specifically bank statements),
resulting in delays in accounting for advances, the transfer of funds from the PMU to the
zobas and the replenishment of the Designated Account, explaining the U rating in the
ISR of Mar 2006 and the MS rating in the ISR of Aug 2007. This was outside the control
of the central and local PMUs, however, and the Bank was able to proactively find a
solution that still ensured fiduciary compliance. The 2005 QEA and a 2009 Financial
Management Assessment Report of the PMU, conducted by Bank staff, both rated
financial management as satisfactory. This ICR concurs.

46.     Procurement: The project used the same institutional and control arrangements
that were used for HAMSET, with overall responsibility assigned to the PMU. The
procurement systems of the first project were judged to be appropriate for use in the
repeater project. In addition, the same person was responsible for procurement for the
duration of both projects. As in the case of financial management, this continuity
contributed to sound performance, and procurement was rated “satisfactory? in each ISR.
Towards the beginning of the project, there was a small delay in procurement, mainly for
consultant services, but this is attributed largely to the PMU’s focus on closing the
previous HAMSET project. There were no procurement delays for drugs. A number of
delays occurred for civil works, but this was outside the control of the PMU. Rather, it
was the consequence of the fact that only a small number of private contractors were
permitted to operate in Eritrea, a situation that worsened over the course of the project.
However, as previously mentioned, since civil works accounted for only 4% of the
project funds, and were mainly used for renovation, its impact on overall disbursement


                                            17
and, indeed, development outcomes is deemed to be low. Moreover, by the end of the
project, all procurements that had been envisaged under the annual procurement plans
had been executed. Overall, procurement under HAMSET II is considered satisfactory.

47.      Disbursement: The estimated project cost at appraisal was US$ 26.5 million, with
US$ 24 million from IDA, US$ 2 million from the Government of Eritrea and US$0.5
million in in-kind (i.e. labor) contribution from local communities. The project used a
report-based (IFR) disbursement method which the borrower considered a favorable
change because it allowed more predictability of cash flow, greater flexibility and, in
general, smoothed project implementation. In general, actual IDA disbursement, despite a
somewhat slow start in the very early years of the project (for example, with no
disbursement between 2006 Q2 and 2007 Q2), closely tracked planned disbursements for
most of the project. At project mid-term review (which occurred on schedule), the
disbursed amount from the IDA grant was $12.7 million or about 50%, and the total
disbursement for the project at closing on 30 June 2010 was 98.9% of the credit ($23.9
million), with the remainder of the grant committed. Counterpart (GoE) funds were made
available in a timely fashion and, at project close, US$2.4 million had been received,
which was US$ 0.4 million more than planned. An additional US$ 0.4 million should be
forthcoming, earmarked specifically for the retention of works and customs and taxes. In
total, the Government contributed approximately 12% of the grant, rather than 10% as
originally planned. Overall, there were exchange rate gains of approximately US$1.5
million, but these were used to compensate for price fluctuations.

48.    Covenants: All six legal covenants 11 were complied with on-time, with the
exception of the development of the National Strategic Plan for reproductive health
which was complied with after a delay of 3 months (and adopted even later).

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

49.      GoE and the Bank had intended to restructure, provide additional financing to,
and extend the project for an additional 36 months beyond its initial closing date.
However, because Eritrea ultimately decided not to sign the supplemental Letters on
Financial and Economic Data, which are a condition for IDA financing and intended to
keep the World Bank informed of the Borrower’s debt status, there could be no additional
IDA financing or new Trust Funds made available to continue operations beyond the
initial closing date. Consequently, the restructuring and extension could not take place.
This also meant that the Health Results Innovation Trust Fund resources earmarked for
the implementation of a results-based financing pilot (RBF) (see section 2.2) could not be
used. The Bank is open to the possibility of future engagement.



11
  These include that the National Strategic Plan for reproductive health is developed and adopted; the
operational plan for M&E of HAMSET diseases is in place; the project is implemented in accordance with
the operational manual and any substantial change in the operations manual would require prior IDA
approval; the project activities are implemented in accordance with annual work programs agreed with
IDA; annual joint reviews are conducted for each HAMSET disease and major project components; and a
mid-term review is implemented no later than June 30, 2008.


                                                 18
50.     Because it was uncertain that there would be a follow-on IDA-funded project in
the form of a restructured HAMSET II until a few months of closing (pending the
decision of the GoE on the supplemental letter), there was no time for the Bank team to
work with the MOH and PMU to put in place measures that would help to smooth the
transition to a post-operation environment.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Rating: Substantial

Relevance of Project Development Objectives

51.     In the absence of a Country Assistance Strategy for Eritrea, the Bank’s strategy
for engagement at closing is the draft Interim Strategy Note (June 2008-2010). HAMSET
II’s PDOs remain highly relevant to the ISN objective of supporting the government to
deliver improved human development. The anticipated health sector results outlined in
the ISN include a reduced incidence of communicable disease, improved reproductive
health care, improved child health and education outcomes, and building an improved
knowledge base through analytic work with the government and development partners.

52.    The PDOs also remain very well-aligned with Eritrea’s Development Strategy,
2005-2007, which includes focusing on, inter alia, “reproductive health care (equivalent
to PDO 4), treatment and control of common infectious diseases (equivalent to PDO 2),
control of malaria (equivalent to PDO 3)?, “acquiring manpower and equipment
necessary to make (these) facilities operational (equivalent to PDO 5), and “containing
and controlling HIV/AIDs? (equivalent to PDO 1). This is the most recent Development
Strategy available.

Relevance of project design and implementation modalities

53.     Based as it is on well-tested technologies and interventions, and appropriate to
country conditions which are largely unchanged, the project’s design remains as
technically relevant today as five years ago. The beneficiaries targeted, and especially the
high risk groups on which many of the interventions focus, continue to be appropriate.
Combining all HAMSET II diseases into one program continues to make sense because
of the small population and land area, the costs to the government of handling more than
one project, and the synergies between disease interventions. It also facilitates the
integration of vertical programs and health system strengthening activities. In terms of
technical assistance, it enables the Bank, which is the major technical partner, to provide
technical support across all programs. The final allocation across health
subcomponents/diseases (after reallocation), with larger amounts allocated to
reproductive health and human resources than at preparation, better exploit the Bank’s
comparative advantage in light of the availability of financial (but not technical)
resources from GFATM. HAMSET II’s implementation modalities also remain relevant:
tackling HAMSET diseases through the health ministry, other ministries (i.e.


                                            19
multisectoral response) and communities (i.e. CMHRP response) is appropriate and the
PMU has proven itself to be a consistently strong implementing partner, able to
adequately handle IFR-based disbursement. The project’s balance between “hardware?
and “software? (with limited financing of civil works, for example) is more appropriate
than ever in the hardened macroeconomic environment.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives / Efficacy

Rating: Modest

54.     In assessing efficacy, the aim is not merely to measure performance on PDO
indicators, but rather to assess achievement of the five project development objectives (of
which the indicators are simply the measure). Consequently, the analysis of the
achievement of PDOs in this section is supplemented by additional output and outcome
indicators, including from non-governmental sources. It also employs a results chain
analysis to link outputs to outcomes and, where PDO indicator data are somewhat dated
(as discussed in section 2.3), infer what the effect on outcomes (including in later
periods) is likely to have been. Detailed tables of data on outputs and outcomes in support
of the conclusions in this section can be found in Annex 10.

55.     HIV/AIDS: According to the latest available data, HIV prevalence among
pregnant women (aged 15-24) was maintained below 3%, as planned. The target of
reducing the syphilis prevalence rate among pregnant women from 2.1% to below 1%
was also achieved. Unfortunately, prevalence data are from 2007 and it is not known
what happened to prevalence rates (of both HIV12 and syphilis13) over the last half of the
project. Data are also not available to assess whether the objective of maintaining HIV
prevalence among CSWs below 12% was met, but the near-doubling of condom use
among CSWs to 87% over the project period, as well as the increase in condom usage
among truck drivers (who are important clients) from 7% to 96.3%, suggests that
prevalence is unlikely to have increased.

56.    Achievements in project outcomes are likely linked to achievements in project
outputs, specifically the increase in the availability of services (such as VCT, PMTCT,
condom distribution and antiretrovirals) that reduce the likelihood of infection. Data from
NATCoD show that:

     -   The availability of VCT services and their utilization increased substantially over
         the project period, exceeding initial targets. The number of VCT sites almost


12
   In the case of HIV, since it is prevalence rather than “incidence? that is being monitored, drastic change
over two to three years is not too likely. Also, the slight decline in the percentage of positive cases
identified during VCT over the project period (from 3.38% in 2005 to 2.06% in early 2010), as well as the
fact that HIV positivity observed through testing women at PMTCT sites fell from 1.95% in 2005 to 0.66%
by project close, is reassuring. The 2010 Eritrean DHS provides the first prevalence figures based on a
household survey: 1.13% among all women and 0.5% among men.
13
   Routine data showing that the number of STI cases treated fell from around 5,900 in 2007 to 5,300 in
2009 are compatible with continued improvements in STI prevalence.


                                                    20
       doubled, growing from 74 (2005) to 135 (Q2, 2010), the annual number of VCT
       attendees grew from 69,121 (2005) to 96,285 (2009), and the percentage of adults
       who were both tested and received their HIV results increased from 17% (2007)
       to 37.4% (2009).
    - The provision of PMTCT services increased markedly from 39 sites in 2005 to 93
       sites across all 6 geographic zones by 2009 and the number of pregnant women
       tested for HIV increased from 8,144 to 50,000. By the second last quarter of the
       project, the uptake of PMTCT services among those on their first visit for
       antenatal care was almost total (96.5%), and double the rate at mid-term (2007).
       By 2009, 95% of infants born to HIV+ mothers were HIV negative (up from 87%
       in 2007).
    - Overall treatment coverage of ART is good (estimated at 77% under the old
       guidelines of less than 250 CD4 count), despite only 17 sites and the fact that
       services were available in only 4 out of 6 zobas. As of April 2010, the cumulative
       number of patients enrolled in ART was at 5,557, up from 709 in 2005.
Thus, there was a marked improvement in the provision of HIV prevention and treatment
services which would be consistent with improvements in HIV/AIDS-related outcomes.

57.      Tuberculosis: In 2008, the project exceeded its end-of-project target of
successfully treating (i.e. curing) at least 85% of new smear positive cases, but because
data beyond 2008 are not available, it is now known if those gains were sustained. DOTS
treatment of diagnosed TB cases (another PDO) was impressive, reported at 100% in
2008 (latest data). These accomplishments can be attributed to large number of workers
being trained on DOTS – more than double the target; no stock-outs of medication; the
fact that all health facilities had staff trained in detection and treatment; and that all
facilities were equipped with AFB microscopes (up from 79% at baseline). Case
detection was not strong, however, and, at last measurement, the project was not yet
detecting 70% of infectious cases,14 improving from 41% at baseline to only 49% in June
2008. Poor case detection rates can be attributed to poor information systems, relatively
weak supervision and gaps in the availability of testing equipment. That said, case
detection rates may well have improved since 2008 due to the expansion of microscopy
and training, but later data are not available.

58.     Malaria: In light of the impressive gains during HAMSET, HAMSET II sought to
further reduce, or at least maintain at 2004 levels, malaria morbidity and mortality.
Impressively, over the project period, both confirmed mortality and morbidity fell further
from 24 (2004) to 3 (2009) in the case of the former and from 35,215 to 6,785 in the case
of the latter. This is a remarkable achievement. Somewhat surprisingly, given this
achievement, is that there was virtually no increase in the percentage of children under-5
and pregnant women sleeping under ITNs the previous night, with coverage of both at
only 49% and 54% respectively (in 2008), despite a PDO target of 75%15. The successful


14
  A 70% case detection rate is not only a HAMSET II target, but also a global target.
15
  As argued by O’Meara et al. (2010), the fall in malaria morbidity and mortality may instead be due to
other program interventions that were implemented on massive scale in Eritrea, such as larviciding, indoor
residual spraying and community-based management of fevers. However, there was only a modest


                                                    21
roll-out of testing and anti-malarial drugs was an important contributing factor to DOTS
coverage: by 2009, the MOH had procured double the number of rapid diagnostic tests
that it planned to obtain and drug availability at health facilities was very good.

59.      Reproductive health: HAMSET II was not particularly successful in improving
coverage of reproductive health interventions. Recent DHS data show that skilled birth
attendance increased slightly from 28.3% in 2002 to 34.1% in 2010. However, this figure
is still substantially below the project target of 60%16. On the other hand, the utilization
of focused antenatal care showed improvements over the project period, increasing from
28% in 2005 to 37.5% in 2008, but still remained below the 50% target. This is supported
by DHS data showing that ANC utilization increased from 70.4% in 2002 to 88.5% in
201017. The contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR) rose only slightly from 8% in 2002 to
8.4% in 2010 (according to the DHS), but still falls below the project target of 10%18.
The provision of inputs was successful, though. Specifically, the project was able to
ensure that 100% of public hospitals and 80% of health centers (up from 55% and 47% in
2004) were able to provide emergency obstetric care. There were also minor
achievements in other areas, but all of these fell short of the MOH’s targets, e.g. the
prevalence of female genital mutilation (FGM) among girls under 10 fell from 89% in
2002 to 83% in 2010 (not quite reaching the MOH’s target of 80%)

60.       Health system strengthening, including human resources for health: HAMSET II
reached its training targets for nurse midwives and laboratory technicians, but fell
substantially short for public health technicians (133 actual out of 220 planned). It also
did not achieve the target of increasing the proportion of health stations with at least once
nurse from 28% to 50% (reaching only 35%) and, in fact, the percentage of health
stations with a nurse was lower at project close than at MTR. That said, while the project
fell a little short in terms of PDO indicators, in terms of the overall PDO of strengthening
human resources for health, there were some important accomplishments, including the
graduation of the first batch of medical doctors from Eritrea’s Orotta School, as well as
the graduation of anesthetists, many nurses, and the development of training curricula
(see Annex 2).

61.    Discussion of overall rating on achievement of PDOs: Of the five project
development objectives, the two relating to HIV/AIDS and malaria were fully, and
unequivocally, achieved. Where data on a few KPIs are somewhat dated, the results chain
analysis builds a sufficiently strong case for a continued positive trajectory. Performance
on the PDO for tuberculosis was mixed: there is evidence of strong performance in the



improvement in the proportion of households aware of environmental management prevention methods
(from 68% in 2004 to 75% in 2008, and short of the 85% target).
16
   At MTR, the MOH requested that this target be lowered to 40% because 60% was too ambitious. The
Bank agreed, but then this change was postponed until the (anticipated, but not realized) restructuring.
17
   The DHS information was recently provided by the GoE in summary form and makes no mention of the
number of antenatal care visits. It is assumed to refer to one antenatal care visit. By contrast, “focused?
antenatal care (measured by the PDOs) includes four visits, explaining the lower overall estimates.
18
   The project baseline value for this indicator was given as 4% in 2005, despite a 2002 DHS showing a
CPR of 8%.


                                                    22
area of treatment, but weaker performance in the area of case detection. That said, case
detection data are from 2008, had been trending upwards, and may have improved as
investments in detection (equipment and training) have risen. A fourth PDO, namely
strengthening the overall health system’s capacity to address the HAMSET diseases
(including human resources) showed mixed performance and, despite some impressive
training completion rates, did not succeed in reaching a critical target for the percentage
of nurses in health stations. Finally, although one can point to some areas of achievement
(such as the performance on the KPI on the provision of EmOC) and there is some
evidence of improvements over the life of the project, overall the final PDO related to
reproductive health was far from achieved. Thus, with full achievement on two PDOs,
substantial achievement on a third and a fourth, and poor performance on a fifth, the
overall rating of achievement of PDOs is considered modest.

3.3 Efficiency

Rating: Substantial

Cost-effectiveness of HAMSET interventions

62.     Studies from different parts of the world, analyzed as part of the Disease Control
Priorities Project 2 (DCPP 2), show that the interventions related to HAMSET II diseases
are highly cost-effective (see Table 3). Most cost less than US$100 per DALY averted
(which is a commonly-used threshold for cost-effectiveness).

63. When combined with project information on the interventions prioritized by
HAMSET II, the following conclusions can be drawn:

    -    Overall, HAMSET II was a highly efficient project that appropriately selected
         highly cost-effective interventions. This is not surprising considering the careful
         analysis and project preparation that was undertaken with precisely this goal in
         mind.
    -    The fact that some of the highest cost-effectiveness ratios are observed for
         activities that require the integrated management of multiple diseases suggests
         that HAMSET II’s emphasis on integrated disease management was a highly
         efficient strategy.
    -    The expansion of the HAMSET diseases to include reproductive health
         interventions (in HAMSET II) was also cost-effective.
    -    Unfortunately, the cost-effectiveness ratios of community mobilization for
         HIV/AIDS in low-prevalence settings (see Annex 7) can be very poor, raising a
         concern about the efficiency of CMHRP resources. Indeed, early HAMSET II
         missions remarked on the low efficiency of CMHRP implementation. However,
         this did improve over time: community sub-projects were chosen more selectively,


                                                      24
       the percentage of activities that were integrated rose, the duration of sub-projects
       increased, and the number of beneficiaries per sub-project was increased in order
       to drive down average sub-project costs
   -   For tuberculosis, DOTS is highly cost-effective, but MDR-TB treatment is
       considerably less so. This is something for Eritrea to consider as the tuberculosis
       program makes decisions about how to respond to emerging MDR-TB.
   -   Eritrea has had an extraordinarily successful multi-pronged malaria program, with
       exceptional performance at the community level in surveillance, spraying and
       bednet usage. Yet, a recent study by Morel et al. (2005), which looked at
       combinations of malaria interventions, found that high coverage with artemisinin-
       based combination treatment (ACT) is the most cost-effective strategy for
       malarial control in most countries of Sub-Saharan Africa (at both 85% and 90%
       coverage levels), at around US$9, and that adding other interventions in
       combination with ACT, such as indoor residual spraying, nets and intermittent
       presumptive treatment during pregnancy, substantially lowered average and
       incremental cost effectiveness. In an environment of exceptionally limited health
       resources, the implications of this finding for Eritrea’s malaria control strategy
       need to be considered. On the other hand, even the least cost-effectiveness of
       those packages of interventions was, on average, still very high (below US$50).
   -   Finally, HAMSET focused on interventions for high risk groups (such as sex
       workers, truck drivers, and pregnant women) to concentrate resources where they
       are most needed and can have the most impact. By and large, it also succeeded in
       reaching those groups. Table 3 shows that peer education among high-risk groups
       is highly cost-effective.

64.     Efficiency of project execution: The efficiency of project execution, as measured
by the speed of disbursement, was good. As described in section 3.2, despite a somewhat
slow start in the very early years of the project, actual disbursement closely tracked
planned disbursements for most of the project. At MTR, the disbursed amount from the
IDA grant was $12.7 million or about 50% of the credit, and the total disbursement for
the project at closing on 30 June 2010 was 98.9% of the credit ($23.9 million), with the
remainder of the grant committed. Counterpart (GoE) funds were made available in a
timely fashion. At the community-level, project subgrant execution was marked by
increases in efficiency as the project progressed: subgrant size and duration increased,
disease integration improved and per capita (beneficiary) costs fell by 90% (See Annex 2,
Component 3).

65.     Sectoral and allocative efficiency: The low overall levels of government health
spending in Eritrea, the fact that the HAMSET diseases are responsible for a large share
of the burden of morbidity and mortality, and the fact that HAMSET II covers some
health areas that are barely supported by other donors suggests that expenditure on
HAMSET II is unlikely to have displaced or (inefficiently) distorted health program
allocations. Over the five years of implementation, the average annual cost of the project
(in terms of IDA) was US$4.8 million or US$ 0.96 per capita per annum. The latter is
equivalent to almost a tenth of annual health spending per capita (estimated at around
US$10 per capita) and almost a quarter of total public health spending (US$4 per capita)
(WHO 2010)

66.    Details of the DCPP 2 estimates, as well as a number of other illustrative
estimates of the cost-effectiveness of HAMSET II-type interventions, are discussed in
Annex 3.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately satisfactory

67.     Based on the preceding discussion, project relevance to current development
priorities is considered substantial, efficiency is considered substantial and achievement
of outcomes is considered moderate, resulting in an overall rating (as per guidelines) of
moderately satisfactory on overall outcomes.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

68.     Through including diseases that manifest themselves more among the poor than
among the better-off (or have greater financial consequences for the poor than the better-
off), and because of the established linkages between improved health outcomes and
productivity, the project is likely to have had a substantial poverty impact. Indeed,
facility-based data from Eritrea have shown that the top causes of adult mortality were
the consequences of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, with obvious effects on
productivity and lost income. Moreover, the community- based component implemented
interventions (that were considered local priorities) in even the most remote and
impoverished parts of the country.

69.     In terms of social development, the project succeeded in involving local leaders
and civil society in the identification of problems and the implementation of interventions,
it gave consideration to issues related to demobilization, and it improved the
empowerment of communities and building of local capacity through a community-based
component. Importantly, the project explicitly targeted vulnerable groups, articulated the
emphasis on these groups in the PDOs and PDO indicators and, according to available
data, actually managed to reach this population.

70.      The gender-based approach was strong and gave particular attention to
empowerment issues. The RH subcomponent, by definition, targeted the needs of women.
In the HIV/AIDS subcomponent, CSWs, in particular, were empowered to form groups,
mobilize funding, implement programs and take action to protect themselves against HIV
and violence. In addition to reaching female beneficiaries, the project also empowered
women to become project implementers. For example, organizations like the National
Union of Eritrean Women (NUEW) were strengthened under the multisectoral
component and women were very much involved in the management of community-led
initiatives under the CMHRP component.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

71.     One of the greatest contributions of the Bank was its role in putting in place
structures and processes for program management and implementation. Many of these
have already been discussed in detail in the relevant sections of the ICR, and include:

   -   Creation of the Joint Annual Review (JAR) process that brings together all
       stakeholders, regardless of funding source, to jointly review progress and develop
       work plans for the next year. The GoE intends to continue this practice even
       though the Bank will no longer be involved in the health sector.
   -   Strengthening of the project management, financial management and procurement
       capacity in the PMU during HAMSET II (and HAMSET) that contributed, over
       time, to a very strong unit that is more than capable of directing multiple flows of
       external donor assistance (and not only of Bank projects) and managing
       implementation. These same systems are now also been used by other donors,
       such as the GFATM.
   -   Creation of institutional arrangements for CMHRP to facilitate planning,
       implementation, management, monitoring, and reporting.
   -   Putting in place and strengthening mechanisms of coordination between the
       multisectoral partners, as well as between the different technical programs of the
       MOH. This includes establishing steering committees, technical committees and
       task forces (at both national and zoba level).

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

This project had at least two unintended (positive) impacts:

72.     First, the project and financial management capacity built up within the PMU
during HAMSET II (and HAMSET) no doubt contributed to GoE’s successful
application for GFATM resources and will, in future, contribute to the successful
fiduciary management of these (and other donor) resources. Indeed, the current GFATM
resources for Eritrea flow through the PMU and use the same reporting and financial
processes as were used for Bank funds, as well as the same procurement methods. This is
also of longer-term benefit for Eritrea because it sets the PMU up as a potential channel
for future pooled donor funding. This can in large part be attributed to the institutional
strengthening that occurred under the two HAMSET projects.

73.      Second, the opportunity to implement an RBF pilot within HAMSET II sparked
an interest in the effect of supply- and demand-side incentives on performance, especially
in the area of reproductive health. This involved the development of a detailed operations
manual and the implementation of a “pre-pilot?. While the implementation of the pilot
could not proceed for reasons already discussed (see section 2.2), the interest in RBF
appears likely to endure. Consequently, should resources become available to implement
such a pilot in the future, some groundwork has already been laid. This could have
potential long-term effects on health financing arrangements and access to RH services in
Eritrea.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Rating: Substantial

74.     The sustainability of development outcomes will depend on the availability of
financial resources, technical design, the strength of health program management,
sectoral leadership, the durability and strength of institutional structures as well as any
changes to the external environment that may have an impact on health threats/risks and
behaviors. External changes may prove be as diverse as economic growth, food insecurity,
international conflict, and non-health ministry policies.

75.      Financial sustainability: Maintaining health outcomes requires ongoing financial
investment and Eritrea’s current macroeconomic position means that domestic resources
available for the health sector are likely to be limited. GDP growth grew at an average of
2% over the project period (World Development Indicators 2010). However, external
debt grew from US$725 million in 2005 to US$962 million in 2008 and in November
2009 the World Bank and IMF declared Eritrea to be “in debt distress?19. The external
debt situation is further complicated by an extremely high level of domestic debt. The
currency remained constant at 15 nakfa to the dollar throughout the period of project
implementation and is believed to be about six times overvalued. The country has also
ranked as a poor performer under the World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional
Assessment (CPIA) with an average score of 2.41 during 2006-2008. Current public
health sector spending is only US$4 per capita per annum (WHO 2010). At project
preparation, it was estimated that US1.4 million in recurrent annual costs would be
needed after the project purely for maintenance, supervision, and continuance of training
activities – a non-trivial amount.

76.     Consequently, Eritrea will continue to need external financial support to fund
health sector policies. In 2008, 37.1% of total health care expenditure was derived from
external sources (WHO 2010). In the short-term, there will be considerable funds
available through the GFATM for the health sector (see Table 4) (albeit for a limited set
of health priorities) but the future availability of funds from this source is less certain,
especially in the current global economic climate. GFATM monies also tend to be less
flexible than IDA in that it is more difficult to reallocate them to different spending
categories during the course of implementation (unlike the adjustable annual work
program planning and budgeting used under HAMSET II), delays have been experienced
in GFATM disbursement, and there is typically some uncertainty as to what share of the
total amount allocated to each five year tranche will eventually be available. For example,
Malaria VI was reduced by $1.1 million, HIV/AIDS V by $5.2 million and TB VI by

$3.5 million. Also, while GFATM resources will allow GoE to undertake many of the
activities under HAMSET (especially since it has allowed funding of “health systems
strengthening activities?), it cannot tackle all: one notable gap is reproductive health. The
financial contributions of other donors are insignificant.

77.     Technical sustainability: A major accomplishment of HAMSET II was the
improvement of human resources for health, but while capacity and skills have increased
dramatically (including the graduation of the first batch of medical doctors), national
human resources for health remain very limited (e.g. there is not one epidemiologist in
the country) and Eritrea’s increasing isolation limits opportunities for external learning.
Also, although MOH are competent, overall staffing levels are thin. Consequently, the
technical assistance provided by the Bank during project supervision was highly-valued,
but in the absence of a new Bank-supported project, this will cease and there does not
appear to be an alternative development partner who is able to provide a similar level of
TA.

78.      Operational sustainability: The very strong project management and
implementation skills within the PMU (which will continue to manage the GFATM
resources) will contribute favorably to the sustainability of development outcomes
beyond the project period, as will the success of the institutional strengthening measures
undertaken as part of HAMSET II (see section 3.5). There is also strong management
within particular MOH programs and, on the whole, the HAMSET II implementing
agencies have proven that they can deliver results in spite of difficult circumstances. In
the short-term, operational sustainability could have been further enhanced if the Bank
had provided (in the final months of implementation) more technical assistance to
facilitate planning for any activities that the PMU and MOH might want to implement in
the immediate post-completion period.

79.     Other internal and external risks to health outcomes: The persistence of fuel
shortages and suspension of private contractors which contributed to procurement,
construction and supervision difficulties during project implementation show no signs of
being resolved and are likely to continue to be a risk to the sustainability of development
objectives. Importantly, the major gains under the previous HAMSET project and in the
early years of HAMSET II were realized under different political leadership in the health
sector and current leadership appears less able to mobilize resources for the health sector
and assist the MOH in overcoming operational barriers. In terms of external risks, the
achievements in malaria are subject to variations in rainfall patterns and population
complacency, there is the risk that border disputes may escalate to full-scale conflict, and
food insecurity is an ever-present threat.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

80.     A QAG Quality-at-Entry Assessment (2005) awarded this project the rare rating
of “highly satisfactory? for overall quality at entry. In addition, four of the assessment
dimensions were rated highly satisfactory (namely strategic relevance and approach,
poverty gender and social aspects, policy and institutional aspects, and risk assessment),
while the remaining four (namely technical financial and economic aspects,
environmental aspects, fiduciary aspects and implementation arrangements) were rated
satisfactory. The team carefully analyzed, and systematically applied the lessons learnt
from, HAMSET and other related projects, and project preparation documentation was
comprehensive, detailed and thoughtful. All of this was achieved in a preparation period
of less than four months. With the benefit of hindsight, the project could have benefitted
from more careful work on the environmental safeguards, as well as in M&E (in
particular, the preparation of the results framework and monitoring arrangements).

81.     Appropriate Bank technical expertise and experience with the Eritrean health
sector and the previous HAMSET project were important ingredients of successful
project preparation. There was also continuity between the staffing of HAMSET and
HAMSET II, with both TTLs (and some team members) of HAMSET II preparation
having led or worked on HAMSET.

82.     The Bank team points out that the quality of their preparation was only possible
because of the high level of commitment of the MOH, as well as the president and the
vice president of the country and the other line ministries involved. Design was the result
of a highly consultative process, emerging as a product of true partnership between the
MOH and the Bank team, as well as the engagement of civil society groups.

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

83.     This is a project that required intensive supervision given its fast-track preparation,
innovation, multisectoral and multi-agency nature, and the wide range of activities.
Supervision was also made more challenging due to the absence of any technical staff
(with the exception of procurement) in Asmara. For the first three years of
implementation, the team undertook a mission (on average) every six months (as
planned), including Joint Annual Reviews (initiated by the Bank under HAMSET II). By
mobilizing additional staff resources (e.g. through the Roll Back Malaria Initiative and
MAP program), the Bank was able to put together large teams to provide technical
assistance (with missions typically including a malaria expert, TB specialist, RH expert,
HIV/AIDS expert, community response specialist, FM specialist, procurement specialist,


                                             30
HR specialist and M&E specialist). In addition, non-core technical experts or consultants
joined the supervision missions or undertook separate trips, as needed.

84.     Supervision missions were used as effective monitoring and planning tools. Aide-
memoires were very candid and designed to guide government action after the mission.
Consequently, they elaborated in detail on project progress, highlighted major issues,
made recommendations and provided deadlines for follow-up. The team also undertook
extensive field visits, typically visiting five out of six zobas per mission. Several missions
were also undertaken using videoconferencing, e.g. in order to save budget for mid-term
review. In addition, there were a number of ad hoc videoconferences to resolved critical
issues, indicative of Bank responsiveness and availability to the borrower. The Bank team
also organized videoconference-based training for PMU and MOH staff which was well-
received. The mid-term review occurred exactly on time, halfway through project
implementation in Dec 2007 and when US$ 8 million of project funds had been disbursed.

85.     The PMU and MOH has praised the Bank team for their “supportive supervision?
and the rigor with which the Bank team and its processes helped to keep them “on track?
in project implementation. Indeed, the PMU intends to continue with similar planning
approaches even in the absence of a Bank project. They also very much appreciated the
joint work on aide-mémoire documents and how they could be used to follow-up
effectively in time for the next mission, plan and keep to deadlines. They also thought
Bank staff brought excellent examples of the experience of other countries, but struck the
appropriate balance between sharing foreign experience while still allowing Eritrea to
develop its own way of doing things.

86.     Fiduciary issues were sound and while health care waste management was a
persistent safeguards issue for the project, the team took many proactive steps to help in
its resolution, including reallocation of funding across categories and providing expert
consultant advice (see section 2.4). M&E in the project had a number of weaknesses, but
attention to M&E increased as project implementation progressed. This was driven by the
combination of the Bank’s institutional shift towards increased scrutiny of M&E in its
project portfolio and the particular interest in M&E shown by the HAMSET II TTL.

87.    Something that stands out in this project is the effort to which the Bank team went
to establish relationships of trust and mutual respect with the borrower, and how
responsive the team was in providing technical assistance and trying to help resolve
problems. With this relationship in mind, and since the Bank’s technical assistance was
so highly valued by the borrower, it is unfortunate that there were no missions for the last
18 months of the project (owing to uncertainty as to whether the Government of Eritrea
would sign the supplemental letter). The Bank team, nevertheless, continued to hold
semi-annual “supervision missions? via videoconference.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory




                                             31
88.     As per ICR ratings guidelines, because Bank performance in ensuring quality at
entry is rated “satisfactory? and Bank performance in quality of supervision is rated as
“satisfactory?, the rating for overall Bank performance is “satisfactory?.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Rating: Moderately satisfactory

89.     A high degree of government ownership of, and commitment to, the project
prevailed during project preparation. This was at the level of the Ministry of Health, but
also at the levels of the president and vice-president’s office, as well as in other line
ministries. The former Minister of Health, in particular, was a champion of HAMSET
and HAMSET II. The government exercised leadership in convening multisectoral
partners and various stakeholders, and in strengthening the institutions needed for
HAMSET II implementation.

90.    To the extent that “government performance? includes the broader macro-
economic environment, it could be argued that the government’s own policies – and their
consequences for the availability of foreign exchange, the availability of private
contractors, fuel shortages and restrictions on travel – were obstacles to project
implementation, including civil works and project supervision, especially in the more
remote areas. Yet, despite this environment, implementation did not fall below
“moderately satisfactory? and HAMSET II continued to be a stand-out performer in the
Bank’s Eritrea portfolio – something that would not have been possible in the absence of
strong government commitment to HAMSET II.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

91.     The project was implemented by the MOH, selected non-health line ministries,
national and local civil society organizations, and community groups. Responsibility for
project management and coordination was given to the PMU. In spite of the external
challenges to project implementation, implementing agencies were generally able to
adhere to the agreed implementation schedule, follow up on actions agreed during
previous missions and showed resilience in the face of a difficult operating environment.
It was only towards the end of the project that the broader country constraints started to
have an effect on implementation, specifically through delays in civil works and pending
consultancies. One area of relative weakness was M&E which, across implementing
agencies, was mainly focused on inputs and process indicators, with only limited
monitoring of outcomes indicators. Also, in the early years of the project, collaboration
between the technical departments of the MOH and other implementing agencies at the
national level (either formally through the national technical committees and steering
committees or on an ad hoc basis) was not as strong as it could have been, but this
improved over the project period.


                                           32
92.     Overall, all ministries and implementing agencies were very engaged, but
different agencies had different capacities and, as a result, performance varied. In general,
the multisectoral component (consisting of 13 government and CSO partners) performed
well, something that can be attributed to a high degree of ownership and commitment,
strong focal points, and good coordination at the zoba level. Among multisectoral
partners, the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Education and NUEW were
particularly strong (see Annex 2). The CSOs and community groups (working under the
CHMRP component) appear to have achieved much better results (see Annex 2) than
often seen in community-based projects. By the end of the project, there was a high
degree of integration of HAMSET diseases in their subprojects, female beneficiaries were
successfully reached (73% of beneficiaries), and there was a fair amount of collaboration
between CMHRP partners and other HAMSET partners. There was also substantial
learning-by-doing and the subprojects became increasingly selective, increasingly
integrated and lowered their unit costs as the project progressed. Within the Ministry of
Health, performance varied across technical programs. The malaria program had strong
leadership and a history of success, and was able to achieve further gains. NATCoD
(implementing agency for HIV/AIDS and TB activities) was fairly strong in HIV/AIDS,
but less so in TB where TB expertise was lacking in the early years of the project and
program supervision and quality assurance remained weak. The Department of Research
and Human Resources had strong leadership, but the Department of Reproductive Health,
while admittedly facing tremendous public health challenges, struggled somewhat,
suffering from a shortage of managerial and implementation capacity. Overall, though,
despite capacity constraints, and in the face of very challenging circumstances, the
technical programs managed to achieve a lot.

93.     The performance of the PMU was very strong. Contributing factors include: staff
continuity – most staff had worked together since the HAMSET; cohesiveness – the
PMU works as a team with strong sense of unity; energetic leadership; a high degree of
familiarity with Bank procedures and processes (from HAMSET); and, a self-critical
disposition, an interest in identifying own weakness, and a hungriness to learn. Overall,
and as confirmed by the Bank task team (in person and in project documentation), credit
should be given to the PMU for the quality of project preparation and a solid record in
implementation.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Moderately satisfactory

94.     As per ICR ratings guidelines, because government performance is rated as
“moderately satisfactory? and implementing agency performance is rated as
“satisfactory?, overall borrower performance is rated as “moderately satisfactory?.

6. Lessons Learned

95.    The new HAMSET II approach holds great promise as a way to better integrate
multiple vertical programs with each other and with health system strengthening efforts,
and reach vulnerable groups: The evolution from HAMSET (which was itself innovative


                                             33
in that it integrated three vertical programs) to HAMSET II was a real innovation. First,
the HAMSET II approach integrated three vertical programs with health system
strengthening (reproductive health and human resources) with obvious synergistic effects.
Second, it also facilitated implementation by adopting an implementor-based approach.
In other words, project components were defined by their implementers (i.e. CMHRP -
community, health sector - MOH, and multisectoral – line ministries and CSOs) rather
than by the diseases with which they are concerned. This improved coordination and
allowed targeted to better be reached by multiple integrated interventions.

96.     Value of repeater projects: Because the first HAMSET project “invested?
substantially in establishing guidelines and processes and policies (and, to some extent,
operationalizing them), HAMSET II could use existing systems (and improve them),
putting the project on a fast-track to realizing gains. Also, because the repeater followed
so quickly on the previous project, the government and Bank team were also able to build
on the momentum and cumulative experience of the first project’s implementation.

97.    Bank and client working together as partners during project preparation improves
the quality of implementation: This helped to ensure that the project was appropriately
designed, feasible, understood by all stakeholders, and owned. In the words of the client:
“Implementation is easy when you understand it from the beginning?.

98.    Continuity of staff and systems in the PMU makes a difference: By HAMSET II
close, most staff in the PMU had worked together on HAMSET projects for 10 years.
They were very familiar with Bank processes, had honed their own operational skills and
procedures, and had become a closely-knit and effective team.

99.    Continuity of staff in the Bank team makes a difference: There was continuity
between the staffing of HAMSET and HAMSET II, with both TTLs (and some staff
members) of HAMSET II preparation having led or worked on HAMSET. This
contributed to a high degree of trust and ease between Bank and client.

100. Missions should balance supervision equally with technical support: Clients value
“supportive supervision? where missions go beyond monitoring implementation to
provide high quality technical assistance and assist implementing agencies in setting up
institutions and processes that help the borrower to improve planning, strengthen project
management, resolve problems and evaluate progress. Moreover, this learning and these
processes endure, and can have positive spillover effects (for example, on the
management of other donors’ funds). In this way, HAMSET II was a good example of
the World Bank acting as a “Knowledge Bank?. Indeed, with the closing of HAMSET II,
the loss of Bank technical assistance is one of the major concerns of the MOH and PMU.

101. Effective use of information technology: The Bank team successfully used
information technology solutions in its supervision and capacity-building activities. For
example, some supervision missions were conducted via videoconference (VC) and VC-
based training opportunities were made available to PMU staff. This brought about
significant cost-savings.




                                            34
102. Flexible step-wise approach to project planning and budgeting: The project was
implemented using a step-wise approach where annual work plans and budgets were set
based on a review of the previous year’s activities and performance. This gave the
borrower more flexibility to respond to changing conditions and resolve problems as they
arose, thus also mitigating risk. The project set long-term objectives to guide
implementation, but planned activities over the short-term.

103. Reliance on external surveys to evaluate endline performance may be technically
appropriate, but carries its own risks: From a technical standpoint, it is appropriate to use
household survey data to measure many of the health outcomes in a Results Framework.
However, because the implementation of these surveys is not under the control of the
project, there is a risk that the eventual timing of the survey will not coincide with the
endline of the project (even if originally planned to do so). This project relied on the DHS
2010 for a share of endline data, but this was not available for the ISR with the
consequence that some “endline? ISR data were from two years prior to closing 20. One
approach that could be pursued in future could be to have a greater share of the DHS (or
other externally-managed survey) managed by the project to give the project more control
over its timing.

104. Social values matter: This project took advantage of the Eritrean nation’s strong
community orientation, team work, patriotism and independence to facilitate success.
Examples include the thousands of small community-driven projects (paid for partly by
community labor) implemented under the CMHRP, the campaign-style interventions in
malaria control, the perseverance of village-level committees in communicating behavior
change messages, and the social consensus that HIV/AIDS should be a priority, enabling
a broad multi-sectoral attack on the epidemic. The lesson is that if implementation
modalities are were well-aligned with social values, implementing agencies will be able
to marshal broad-based project support and capitalize on their investments in the health
sector.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component 1: Multi-sectoral response (at approval: US$ 3 million approved; actual:
US$2.43 million)

105. Implementation: Consisting of 13 multi-sectoral partners, this was a complex
component, but on the whole, implementation was satisfactory. The program was quick
to implement and disburse and, each year, most of the line ministries achieved their
annual project targets and disbursed close to their planned amounts. An implementation
delay occurred in early 2008, due to some delays in accounting for funds, submitting
work plans and subsequent disbursements, but this was short-lived and the following
year’s approval of work plans even occurred early.

106. Strengths: The successful implementation of this component can be attributed to:
(i) a great degree of ownership and commitment among the Ministries and CSOs, (ii)
energetic focal points who, generally, remained in position for a long time, (iii)
streamlining of the process and learning from HAMSET, (iv) increased collaboration
over the project period between the partners and the technical departments of the MOH
and with each other in developing interventions and supervision visits (e.g. between RH
and MOD, between NATCoD and MOE for BCC, and between NUEY and MoE for
reaching vocational students, (v) good coordination between partners at the zoba level,
helping to integrate activities and exploit comparative advantages, (vi) restricting this
component to “software? components (i.e. no construction), thus avoiding difficult
procurements and delays, and (vii) better targeting of vulnerable groups.

107.   Weaknesses:

   -   Opportunities for inter-zoba learning within the same line ministry or CSO were
       not sufficiently exploited.

   -   At the national level, in contrast with the zoba level, coordination between
       ministries and CSOs was not very strong. Increased coordination at the national
       level could have helped to ensure that there was no duplication of interventions
       (given commonality of target groups), enhancing cost-effectiveness of resources.

   -   Monitoring was not very strong. Multisectoral partners placed an overwhelming
       emphasis on tracking activities, with limited monitoring of outcomes. Lists of
       numbers of beneficiaries were compiled, but there was typically no information
       on results, (i.e. changes in knowledge, attitude and behavior). The partners
       apparently documented some of their success stories, but at time of writing this
       had yet to be shared with the PMU or the Bank. The PMU could have worked
       more closely with the M&E division to develop outcome indicators that could be
       used for reporting early on in the project and to revise the reporting format
       accordingly. More effort could also have been made to synthesize data to show
       the cumulative progress of the component.




                                           37
     -   Similarly, evaluation was not very strong. While some partners did conduct
         surveys, their results were not systematically compiled and analyzed. There is
         also not much evidence that experiences in previous years were assessed and used
         to inform the design of subsequent work plans.

     -   Activities appear to have been weighted towards HIV/AIDS prevention and
         treatment. Yet, integration of HAMSET II diseases did improve somewhat over
         the project period, though, especially in the activities of the Ministry of Defense,
         National Union of Eritrean Women, Catholic Church and Ministry of Education.

108.     High-performing partners: The performance of the following partners stand out:

     -   Ministry of Defense: Already lauded for its performance in HAMSET (see ICR of
         first HAMSET), the Ministry of Defense documents a long list of achievements
         under HAMSET II. It also integrates a number of HAMSET diseases into its
         activities, including HIV/AIDS, malaria, TB, RH. The Ministry was also very
         effective in collaborating with a number of other partners, including NUEWS,
         NUEYS, RH and malaria. Like other multi-sectoral partners, the Ministry stresses
         mainly activities rather than results in its reports. Unfortunately, verification of
         the Ministry’s accomplishments is difficult: while the Ministry keeps good health
         records on services delivered and health outcomes, it does not make them
         available, either to the public or to the Ministry of Health.

     -   Ministry of Education: Schools had a lot of ownership of their programs and BCC
         activities have become integrated into the school curriculum. The MOE was also
         the only partner which evaluated its own performance, namely through
         assessments of the effectiveness of high school BCC programs21. Also, by the end
         of the project, it was starting to institutionalize the use of survey tools in its
         HIV/AIDS prevention work.

109. Sustainability: Beyond the project period, some of the multi-sectoral partners will
continue to receive funding from the Global Fund which will help to sustain activities.


Component 2: Health Sector Response (at approval: US$ 14 million; actual: US$16
million)
HIV/AIDS/STIs (at approval: US$ 3 million; actual: US$1.95 million), TB (at approval:
US$ 2 million; actual: US$1.41 million), Malaria (at approval: USS2 million; actual:
US$1.26 million), Reproductive health (at approval: US$4 million; actual: US$5.58
million) and Human Resources for HAMSET diseases (at approval: US$3 million; actual:
US$5.81 million)


21
  In 2008, scores on awareness (of transmission modalities) of HIV/AIDS were above 80% and on attitude
towards testing around 90%, but knowledge and attitude scores were substantially higher among girls than
boys. In 2007, 70% of high school students reported using a condom during their last “high risk’ sexual
encounter and only 2.5% reported having had sex with non-regular partners in the previous 12 months, but
8% had had sex before the age of 15 years.

See Annex 10 for a list of health sector outputs, organized by HAMSET health area of
focus. The outputs shown in those tables are discussed below.


110.   HIV/AIDS/STIs: HIV-related outputs improved under HAMSET II:

   -   The availability of VCT services and their utilization increased substantially over
       the project period, exceeding initial targets. The number of VCT sites almost
       doubled, growing from 74 (2005) to 135 (Q2, 2010), the annual number of VCT
       attendees grew from 69,121 (2005) to 96,285 (2009), and the percentage of adults
       who were both tested and received their HIV results increased from 17% (2007)
       to 37.4% (2009). There is a relatively high ratio of free-standing vs integrated
       VCT facilities, though, which poses a challenge to the integration of VCT and TB
       screening. Disaggregated data of VCT by urban or rural area or proximity to high
       risk groups (e.g. sex workers or truck drivers) are not available. Testing rates by
       gender are available from an LQAS conducted in 2007 when rates were much
       higher for adult men (23%) than adult women (14%). Data from 2009 show that
       the ratio of male to female testing is 1.7:1 for repeat testers and, among all who
       went for a test, 56% were men
   -   The provision of PMTCT services increased markedly from 39 sites in 2005 to 93
       sites across all 6 geographic zones by 2009 and the number of pregnant women
       tested for HIV increased from 8,144 to 50,000. By the second last quarter of the
       project, the uptake of PMTCT services among those on their first visit for
       antenatal care was almost total (96.5%), and double the rate at mid-term (2007).
       By 2009, 95% of infants born to HIV+ mothers were HIV negative (up from 87%
       in 2007) and in the first quarter of 2010, 96% (74 of 77) of babies born to HIV
       positive mothers still tested HIV negative after 18 months, suggesting that the
       current prophylaxis and breastfeeding counseling protocols are effective in
       preventing infection.
   -   Overall treatment coverage of ART was good (estimated at 77% under the old
       guidelines of less than 250 CD4 count), despite only 17 sites and service available
       in only 4 out of 6 zobas. Part of the explanation of the low coverage may be
       because NATCoD policy only permits ARVs to be administered in hospitals by
       physicians (of which there are few). As of April 2010, the cumulative number of
       patients enrolled in ART was at 5,557, up from 709 in 2005 when ART was first
       initiated on a pilot basis in Asmara. Despite being a recommendation of every
       mission, the project was never able to expand paediatric HIV outside Asmara.
   -   The distribution of male condoms to the zones dipped sharply (by almost a
       quarter) in 2007, but by project close had almost returned to the levels seen at the
       start of the project.
   -   Practices among high risk groups show good improvement: according to surveys,
       the percentage of truck drivers who used condoms properly during their last
       sexual encounter increased from 78% to 96% between 2006 and 2008, and the
       percentage of commercial sex workers who did so increased from 76% to 87%
       over the same period.



                                           39
   -   The knowledge, attitudes and practice of high school students is also reassuring:
       In surveys carried out in 2008, more than 80% were aware of HIV transmission
       modalities and around 90% considered HIV testing (of self and partner) to be
       desirable (although knowledge and attitude scores were substantially higher
       among girls than boys). 70% of high school students reported using a condom
       during their last “high risk’ sexual encounter and only 2.5% reporting having had
       sex with non-regular partners in the previous 12 months, but 8% had had sex
       before the age of 15 years.
   -   The development of policies and guidelines was rather slow and typically behind
       schedule. For instance, the development of the NSP 2008-2012 guidelines
       eventually occurred in 2009), the completion of the STI guideline and training
       manual was outstanding (eventually completed 2010), the condom availability
       study was carried out slowly and at the close of the project only a draft version
       had been completed.

111. Tuberculosis: The project succeeded in reaching the target of successfully treating
at least 85% of new smear positive cases. DOTS treatment of diagnosed TB cases
(another PDO) was impressive, reported at 100% throughout project duration. These
accomplishments can be attributed to the large number of workers being trained on
DOTS – more than double the target; no stock-outs of appropriate medication; the fact
that all health facilities had staff trained in detection and treatment; and that all facilities
were equipped with AFB microscopes (up from 79% at baseline). Case detection was not
strong, however, and the project failed to achieve the PDO of detecting at least 70% of
infectious cases, improving from 41% at baseline to only 49% in June 2008. Poor case
detection rates can be attributed to poor information systems, relatively weak supervision
and gaps in the availability of testing equipment. That said, case detection rates may well
have improved since 2008 due to the expansion of microscopy and training, but later data
are not available.

112. Malaria: Over the course of the project, around three-quarters of a million
bednets were distributed (in a country with a population of around 5 million). There was
virtually no increase in the percentage of children under-5 and pregnant women sleeping
under ITNS the previous note, with coverage of both only at 49% and 54% respectively
(in 2008), despite a PDO target of 90%. Also, there was only a slight improvement in the
proportion of households aware of environmental management prevention methods (from
68% in 2004 to 75% in 2008, and short of the 85% target). The successful roll-out of
testing and anti-malarial drugs was an important contributing factor to DOTS coverage:
by 2009, the MOH had procured double the number of rapid diagnostic tests that it
planned to obtain and drug availability at health facilities was very good.

113. Reproductive health: The project was not particularly successful in improving
coverage of reproductive health interventions. According to DHS data, skilled birth
attendance increased slightly from 28.3% in 2002 to 34.1% in 2010. However, this figure
is still substantially below the project target of 60%. On the other hand, there was some
improvement in the utilization of antenatal care: according to the HMIS, receipt of
focused antenatal care increased from around 28% in 2005 to 37.5% in 2008. This is
supported by DHS data showing that ANC utilization increased from 70.4% in 2002 to


                                              40
88.5% in 201022. The contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR) rose only slightly from 8% in
2002 to 8.4% in 2010 (according to the DHS), but still falls below the project target of
10%. The provision of inputs was successful, though. Specifically, the project was able to
ensure that 100% of public hospitals and 80% of health centers (up from 55% and 47% in
2004) provide emergency obstetric care. Studies carried out include a study of the quality
of reproductive health, a study of vulnerability and service utilization, and a kebabi
capacity assessment.

114. Human Resources for Health: There was a large expansion of preservice training
(for female nurses and other paramedical staff), the graduation of the first batch of
medical students from the Eritrea School of Medicine, 10 students with a Masters in
Anesthesiology from Moi University, Kenya (by end 2010), and distance learning for
Bachelors nursing training and Bachelors in Health Services. There were also changes to
the institutional arrangements of health training institutions such that they all fall under
the Board of Higher Education. Renovations to existing training facilities were completed,
despite some delays due to the non-availability of contractors and supplies. Computers,
text-books and supplies were also procured and distributed. A database of all MOH staff
was created, there is a functioning staff appraisal system and a health worker productivity
study was conducted. The major shortcoming was the failure to produce a final HRH
strategy and costed plan – something that had been on the agenda from the beginning of
the project. This is under development. This subcomponent, like many others, struggled
to find and recruit appropriate consultancies, resulting in delays in the implementation of
activities.


Component 3: Community Managed HAMSET Response Program (at approval:
US$4 million; actual: US$3.35 million)

115. Implementation: Implementation was a little slow in the first year because some
of the planned proposals were not submitted by the zobas, mainly because of
transportation problems and fuel shortages. There were also only two persons (namely
the CMHRP coordinator and assistant project coordinator) staffing the national PMU
office (but with additional staff at the zoba level), and it was difficult to recruit CMHRP
consultants to provide technical assistance. Consequently, most of the expenditure (69%)
was incurred in the second two years of the four-year implementation period. Overall
community contributions to the community sub-grant subcomponent was 25% (and 75%
from IDA) which, although 8 percentage points less than originally planned, is still
testimony to the high degree of buy-in by communities in the CMHRP subprojects.

116. Outputs: Sub-projects reached 20% of the 2,016 kebabies/villages. 57% of
completed subprojects were in Window A (<$300), 37% were in Window B ($300-
<$3,000), and 6% were in Window C ($3,000-<$5,000). By far, the largest number of
rejected proposals was in Window B (10%). Taking into account the cost of projects, the


22
  The DHS information makes no mention of the number of antenatal care visits. It is assumed to refer to
one antenatal care visit. By contrast, “focused? antenatal care (measured by the PDOs) includes four visits.


                                                    41
largest expenditure was on Window B (71%), versus 10% in Window A and 16% in
Window C. Of the 2,422 completed projects, only 8 of the projects that were approved
were not completed. In total, the PMU estimates that the project reached 693,502 unique
beneficiaries. Table 5 shows the number of beneficiaries reached with different types of
interventions. The emphasis was on training and information-sharing activities: 84% of
completed subprojects carried out IE/BCC activities (rather than C&S).

117.   Achievements and strengths:

   -   The subprojects effectively involved women, both as beneficiaries and in the
       management and implementation of sub-projects. According to the 2009 Best
       Practices study, 73% of beneficiaries were female.

   -   In general, this component was a good model of a “learning-by-doing? approach
       to design and implementation, and included conducting rigorous stock-taking of
       past implementation lessons, and incorporating them into revised processes and
       procedures. Examples include increasing project size (in terms of beneficiary
       numbers) over time, improving the integration of diseases within projects,
       increasing the focus on high-risk groups, increasing project length and repeating
       sub-projects that had been successfully implemented in the past. Learning-by-
       doing was facilitated by the built-in project flexibility that allowed the CMHRP to
       adapt the rules according to experiences and difficulties identified during
       implementation.

   -   In many cases, the CMHRP worked very closely with the HAMSET II multi-
       sectoral partners and line ministries in order in order to improve technical inputs
       and improve the quality of community work. For example, it worked together
       with the Ministry of Labour and Human Welfare and NUEYS on issues affecting
       youth; it collaborated with MoE on issues related to in-school (and out of school)
       youth. Technical MOH program directors and coordinators at the national level
       and zoba level provided technical inputs and, in the latter years of the project,
       jointed undertook supervision visits with CMHRP staff. The Ministry of Local
       Government made significant contributions at the community level by providing
       logistical and material support to project monitoring and supervision.

   -   Using a combination of an open menu along with a negative list (e.g. excluded
       vehicles, larger civil works, overheads above 10%, food supplies and income
       generation to non-vulnerable groups, salaries to civil service employees and
       drugs/medical fees outside home care and DOTS) for the selection of sub-projects
       appeared to have provided enough flexibility and room for innovation, while still
       helping to ensure fiduciary responsibility and promote cost-effectiveness.

   -   Importantly, the CMHRP succeeded in the integration of HAMSET diseases.
       77.3% (n=2,166) of completed sub-projects addressed multiple diseases (see Table
       6). More than 90% of beneficiaries were beneficiaries of sub-projects that
       integrated at least two HAMSET diseases (see Figure 1), 27% of beneficiaries
       participated in sub-projects that integrated all four HAMSET diseases, a further
       19% received services that integrated HIV and TB services, and a further 12% of
       beneficiaries received services that integrated HIV and reproductive health
       services. This was a vast improvement over the start of the CMHRP component
       when the share of subprojects targeting more than one HAMSET disease was very
       modest indeed.

are not necessarily unique individuals.

Weaknesses:
  - There was too much emphasis on HIV/AIDS: 152 of the single disease projects
      were HIV/AIDS-specific (compared to 37 for malaria, 15 for TB and 50 for RH)
      (see Table 6) and, where projects were integrated, most were integrated with
      HIV/AIDS services. Of all beneficiaries reached by the project, 93% were
      reached by subprojects that included HIV interventions (see Figure 1). There could
      have been more coverage of other HAMSET diseases, especially considering that


                                                             44
       HIV/AIDS is a relatively low level epidemic in Eritrea and there is a great need in
       terms of reproductive health that there is in other areas, especially in reproductive
       health.
   -   Performance on monitoring and evaluation was mixed. On the one hand, the
       component succeeded in establishing an MIS and modifying it to include
       community contributions, but it did not succeed in integrating it with the HMIS,
       modifying it to track outcomes or including baseline indicators or end-line targets.
       That said, much effort was made to track outcomes manually, supervision tools
       were developed and project were regularly monitored by technical and
       management teams, including from national level. A results framework was
       developed, but could not be operationalized. Conducting the Best Practices study
       was a highlight.

Sustainability:
   - Average subproject costs declined sharply over the period of implementation.
       During the 2006 pilot phase, the average cost was US$31 per beneficiary for 2.5
       months. But, the CMHRP and the Bank team took proactive steps to reduce
       average costs, including increasing the threshold for the minimum number of
       beneficiaries in each window. By end of Sept 2006, average costs were down to
       $8.6 over an average of 2.5 months. Average subproject length later increased to 6
       months. By 2009, the Best Practice study (Nov 2009) showed that the average per
       capita (beneficiary) cost was $3 per beneficiary for IEC/BCC subprojects and $15
       for care and support subprojects. Still, in a country where total expenditure on
       health is around $10 per capita per year (WHO 2010), even 2009 costs are high,
       bringing cost-effectiveness and financial sustainability into question. There is
       funding available for CMHRP through GFATM.
   - Another aspect of sustainability relates to the sustainability of the results
       achieved. This is of concern because the average project length of 6 months may
       not be long enough to effect behavior change.


Component 4: Project Management and Coordination, Capacity Building, M&E,
and Innovation and New Policy Development (at approval: US$ 3 million; actual:
US$3.71 million)

118. Project management and coordination was the responsibility of the PMU and it
performed very well in this regard. As already discussed in section 5.2, contributing
factors include: staff continuity – most staff had worked together since the HAMSET;
cohesiveness – the PMU works as a team with strong sense of unity; energetic leadership;
a high degree of familiarity with Bank procedures and processes (from HAMSET); and, a
self-critical disposition, an interest in identifying own weakness, and a hungriness to
learn.

119. It has already been noted that the contribution of HAMSET II to capacity-
building and institutional development is one of its most significant contributions. Many
of these have already been discussed in detail in the relevant sections of the ICR, and
include:


                                            45
   -   The creation of the Joint Annual Review (JAR) process that brings together all
       stakeholders, regardless of funding source, to jointly review progress and develop
       work plans for the next year. The GoE intends to continue this practice even
       though the Bank will no longer be involved in the health sector.
   -   Strengthening of the project management, financial management and procurement
       capacity in the PMU during HAMSET II (and HAMSET) that contributed, over
       time, to a very strong unit that is more than capable of directing multiple flows of
       external donor assistance (and not only of Bank projects) and managing
       implementation. These same systems are now also been used by other donors,
       such as the GFATM.
   -   The creation of strong institutional arrangements for CMHRP to facilitate
       planning, implementation, management, monitoring, and reporting.
   -   Putting in place and strengthening mechanisms of coordination between the
       multisectoral partners, as well as between the different technical programs of the
       MOH. This includes establishing steering committees, technical committees and
       task forces (at both national and zoba level).

120. The project was able to deliver on most of its planned M&E activities. These
include updating an M&E training manual, tailoring it and using it in training sessions at
the zoba-level; data collection for the Eritrea DHS 2010 (albeit late); zoba-level M&E
action plans, reporting formats and draft results frameworks that are actively being used
(although not yet fully aligned with indicators national-level); a national M&E Advisory
Committee and an M&E Technical Working Group; a five-year integrated and costed
M&E workplan/roadmap; and, guidelines for HMIS auditing and supervision. Specific
databases and information systems, including HMIS, LMIS, multisectoral and CMHRP
have been automated, but need further strengthening. However, as discussed in section
2.3, the project failed to achieve the vision of developing an integrated M&E system
which unifies reporting across different technical programs and also links data from the
different clinical programs (and HMIS) to data from the CMHRP and multisectoral
programs. The PMU could have worked more closely with the M&E division to develop
outcome indicators that could be used for reporting early on in the project, to revise the
reporting format to include outcomes, and to synthesize data to show the cumulative
progress of the component. The CMHRP MIS was not successfully integrated with the
HMIS, did not include baseline values and targets for sub-projects, and (despite
intentions) was not modified to include outcome indicators. The PMU CMHRP team can,
however, track outcome indicators manually. The Joint Annual Reviews were one
example of good performance in M&E; in these reviews progress towards objectives and
targets was discussed on the basis of data and data-driven adjustments to the program,
work plans and budgets were made. It also appears that the PMU and ZPMU held
periodic discussion with stakeholders about the MIS reports.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis


121. This section provides additional information on the cost-effectiveness of
interventions related to HAMSET diseases (discussed in section 3.3)

122. In general, the interventions supported by this project are widely considered to be
very cost-effective. In 1993, the World Bank’s Development Report included prevention
and treatment of HIV/AIDS/STIs, malaria and TB, as well as maternal health and family
planning as some of the key elements that should be included in an “essential health
package? that would make the most efficient use of scarce health resources.
Unfortunately, rigorous cost-effectiveness studies are not sufficiently common, local
costs differ, and context (local disease burden, epidemiology, behavioral norms,
variations in the health system’s implementation of interventions) matter tremendously.
What might be considered a cost-effective disease intervention in one country may not be
in another, depending on the prevalence, modes of transmission, behaviors and health
system response.

123. Nevertheless, studies from different parts of the world reviewed as part of the
Disease Control Priorities Project 2 provide some indication of the cost-effectiveness of
the different interventions support under HAMSET II (see Table 3 in section 3.3). The
World Bank has described interventions that cost less than US$100 per year of life saved
as highly cost-effective for poor countries. By this benchmark, most if the interventions
supported by HAMSET appear to be highly cost-effective (with the arguable exception of
anti-retroviral therapy and treatment of latent TB in non-HIV+ people), but this
benchmark is arbitrary. Rather, these measures of cost-effectiveness could be used for
priority-setting by comparing the relative cost-effectiveness of the different interventions.

124. In addition to the DCPP 2 figures, a number of other illustrative estimates of cost-
effectiveness for interventions under each of the HAMSET diseases were obtained from
the literature. Only one study with estimates for Eritrea could be found. Yukich et al.
(2009) found that the cost-effectiveness of ITN delivery at the community level and
through antenatal care facilities in Eritrea was US$ 13 – 44 per DALY averted and the
cost per death averted was US$ 438–1449. This is notably higher than the range reported
by the DCPP project (US$5-17).

HIV/AIDS/STIs

125. Although remarkably little rigorous evaluation has been conducted, population-
based programs to prevent HIV/AIDS appear to be highly cost-effective approaches in
countries with high HIV/AIDS prevalence where the epidemic is generalized. This would
be less so in a country like Eritrea where the epidemic remains largely concentrated
among high risk groups. The DCPP 2 estimated that treatment of most infectious
opportunistic infections among PLWHA is cost-effective (US$10 to US$500 per DALY
averted), with treatment becoming significantly more cost-effective for patients who also
have access to antiretroviral treatment. In low-cost settings with high adherence rates,
anti-retroviral treatment is moderately cost-effective (US$350 to US$500 per DALY


                                             47
averted). However, cost-effectiveness is likely to be significantly poorer if adherence is
low and drug resistance is allowed to emerge. In terms of prevention, voluntary
counseling and testing (US$14 to US$261 per DALY averted), peer-based programs to
educate high-risk groups (including sex workers and injecting drug users) (US$1 to
US$74 per DALY averted), and social marketing, promotion, and distribution of
condoms (US$19 to US$205 per DALY averted) are highly cost-effective. Programs to
improve blood and needle safety, while highly cost-effective (US$4 to US$51 per DALY
averted), are limited in terms of the burden of disease they can avert. Prevention of
mother-to-child transmission using a single dose of nevirapine in generalized epidemic
settings (US$6 to US$12 per DALY averted) stands out for its combination of well-
documented high cost-effectiveness and significant avertable infections and deaths (but
its cost-effectiveness in low prevalence setting like Eritrea is not known). Treatment of
sexually transmitted infections to lower the risk of HIV transmission, although less well
proven, also appears to be highly cost-effective (US$16 to US$105 per DALY averted).

126. The DCPP 2 draws on global studies, but many of them are from high prevalence
generalized epidemics, very different from Eritrea. In order to capture this, one can
compare the results of models of the cost-effectiveness of different interventions in
different prevalence situations, assuming various levels of effectiveness in terms of
proportion of infections averted (see Table 7). In a lower prevalence situation, the models
indicate that prevention among sex workers (SW) and men who have sex with men
(MSM) are the most cost-effective, while blood safety, condom distribution, prevention
of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT), and workplace programs have a medium level
of cost effectiveness. The models suggest that community mobilization, mass media, STI
treatment, and education interventions (which were very important parts of the CMHRP)
are least cost-effective in a low prevalence situation. By contrast, working with high-risk
groups is highly cost-effective. One of HAMSET II’s successes was its activities with sex
workers (which is also highly cost-effective), although it paid less attention to MSM
(even though this is highly cost-effective). It is of concern that community mobilization
on which the project put so much emphasis is found to have relatively high cost per
infection averted and have relatively low impact in terms of the percentage of infections
averted.

its low prevalence, is considered more analogous to the Central and West Africa scenario.

Malaria

127. In countries where malaria is prevalent, both prevention and effective treatment of
this disease are highly cost-effective and can result in large health gains. The DCPP 2
showed that insecticide-treated bednets (US$5 to US$17 per DALY averted) and indoor
residual spraying where DDT, malathion, deltamethrin, or lambda-cyhalothrin is applied
to surfaces inside homes as a spray or deposit for prolonged action (US$9 to US$24 per
DALY averted for Sub-Saharan Africa) are highly cost-effective. Intermittent preventive
treatment of malaria during pregnancy using sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine is a highly cost-
effective intervention (US$13 to US$24 per DALY averted) to decrease neonatal
mortality and reduce severe maternal anemia. Changing first-line treatment for malaria
from chloroquine to artemisinin-based combinations offers the advantage of faster cures
and potential reductions in transmission, with cost-effectiveness ratios of less than
US$150 per DALY averted. According to the DCPP 2, changing to sulfadoxine-


                                                  49
pyrimethamine may be slightly more cost-effective initially because of the lower cost of
this drug relative to artemisinin-based combinations; however, this advantage is likely to
be eroded quickly because of the rapid expected growth of parasite resistance. One
challenge with most cost-effectiveness studies, as noted by Goodman et al. (2008), is that
most of these estimates were based on data collected during trials or use models to
synthesize data from many different sources, and evaluations from routine service
delivery are very rare.

128. A very recent study (Yukich et al. 2009) of the cost-effectiveness of ITN delivery
at the community level and through antenatal care facilities in Eritrea found that the cost
per DALY averted was USD 13 – 44 and the cost per death averted was USD 438–1449.

129. A useful supplement to this work is the study of Morel et al. (2005) who study
combinations of interventions (rather than assuming that costs and effects sum up when
interventions are used concurrently) and used data on efficacy and resource costs from
Sub-Saharan Africa. They found that high coverage with artemisinin-based combination
treatment (ACT) was the most cost-effective strategy for malarial control in most
countries of Sub-Saharan Africa (at both 85% and 90% coverage levels), both in terms of
average cost and incremental cost (see Table 8). Adding other interventions in
combination with ACT, such as indoor residual spraying, nets and intermittent
presumptive treatment during pregnancy, substantially lowered average and incremental
cost effectiveness. However, on balance, even the least cost-effectiveness of those
packages of interventions was, on average still very high, below US$50.

130. Once again, context is relevant. For example, while the relative effectiveness of
indoor spraying and nets has been debated, and assumed as being equally effective in
Morel et al.’s (2005) study, their respective advantages in a given setting, such as



                                                    50
whether mosquitoes are endophilic, the length of time they rest indoors, the time children
go to bed, and people's willingness to use bed nets consistently.

Tuberculosis

131. The DCPP 2 found that the treatment of all forms of active tuberculosis (TB)
using the directly observed treatment strategy based on short-course chemotherapy is
among the most cost-effective of all interventions available to improve health in LMICs
(US$5 to US$35 per DALY averted. The bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination
for children is also cost-effective (US$40 to US$170 per DALY averted), but its main
effect is to reduce the burden of severe TB in children (TB meningitis and miliary TB)
with little effect on the huge burden of pulmonary TB in adults. The treatment of latent
TB in adults uninfected with HIV is relatively cost-ineffective (US$4,000 to US$25,000
per DALY averted), but it is more cost-effective for groups of patients who are
coinfected with TB and HIV. In the context of TB control, antiretroviral therapy for
HIV/AIDS is likely to be useful in extending the lives of patients successfully treated for
TB.

132. Multidrug-resistant TB is much more expensive to treat than drug-susceptible TB
– 2 to 10 times the cost of standard first-line regimens for drug-susceptible TB – one
reason why priority should be given to preventing its emergence and spread. The
management of drug resistance through the use of a standardized regimen that includes
second-line drugs costs roughly US$70 to US$450 per DALY averted. Individualized
treatment regimens for multidrug-resistant TB – that is, with drug combinations adjusted
to the resistance pattern of each patient – are more costly but usually yield higher cure
rates. Individualized treatment is harder to implement on a large scale but may not be less
cost-effective than standardized treatment with regimens that include second-line drugs.
The set of interventions needed to manage drug-resistant TB and TB associated with HIV
requires higher levels of investment than the basic directly observed treatment strategy,
but its cost is still typically less than US$1 for each day of healthy life gained. Thus, a
strong economic argument exists for integrating such interventions into an enhanced
strategy for TB control.

133. As with other HAMSET diseases, the cost effectiveness of TB control will
depend on local characteristics of TB epidemiology (for example, epidemic or endemic,
low or high rates of HIV infection and drug resistance), the rate of application of any
chosen intervention and local costs.

134. Importantly, for any intervention with the potential to cut transmission (that is,
excluding BCG vaccination), control of epidemic disease produces more favorable cost-
effectiveness ratios than control of endemic disease, because the benefits gained from
reduced transmission are greater during outbreaks (Dye and Floyde 2006).

135. WHO estimates that that every dollar invested in the TB DOTS program will lead
to a US$55 return to the country due to increased productivity.




                                            51
Reproductive health

136. Given the hugely disproportionate burden of maternal and neonatal deaths in
LMICs, identifying affordable, easy-to-implement interventions to prevent these deaths is
a priority. Evidence from South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa suggests that improved
primary-level coverage with a package of interventions is extremely cost-effective
(US$3,337 to US$6,129 per death averted and US$92 to US$148 per DALY averted).
Improvements in the quality of prenatal and delivery care are of similar cost-effectiveness
(US$2,729 to US$5,107 per death averted and US$82 to US$142 per DALY averted). An
important finding is that improving the quality of care and expanding coverage are of
comparable cost-effectiveness.

137. In using cost-effectiveness analysis as a tool in the economic analysis of
HAMSET II, we need to bear in mind the limitations, including that the desirable “returns?
are measured only in terms of health outcomes, and more specifically in terms of DALYs,
rather than the many other benefits that can accrue as a result of these health
interventions both to the index person and to their household member and communities.
A proper cost-benefit analysis would be needed to assess the full impact of the
investment in HAMSET II. That analysis would also need to make assumptions about the
future benefits because expenditures incurred on HAMSET II today will have a stream of
(discounted) benefits into the future.

Below is the “Borrower Evaluation Report on HAMSET II Project?, received from the
Borrower on 14 December 2010, and included verbatim with minor typographical editing.

1. Back ground Information
The HAMSET II Project development objectives are to (i) contain the spread of
HIV/AIDS, STI in vulnerable Groups as well as general population through a focused
multisectoral approach, with renewed attention to the most vulnerable populations (ii)
Expand the coverage of DOTS, and improve the case defection and treatment outcomes
for TB (iii) reduce or at least maintain Malaria mortality and morbidity at the current low
levels (iv) improve the coverage of effective Reproductive Health (RH) interventions
and (v) Strengthen the overall health system including human resources for Health to
enable the country to better address HAMSET diseases.

The project’s total cost being USD 26.5 million, while the proportion of funding were
USD 24 million from IDA, USD 2 million from Government of Eritrea and USD 0.5
million from community contribution and the duration of the project period was 5 years
covering June 30, 2005 – June 30, 2010.

1.1   Project Components and Budget Allocations
      ♦ Component No. 1 Multisectoral Response USD 3 million
      ♦ Component No. 2 Health Sector Response USD 14 million
      ♦ Component No. 3 CMHRP USD 4 million
      ♦ Component No. 4 Project Management coordination, Capacity Building M/E
      and Innovative on New policy development (USD 3 million) including evaluation
      of innovative approaches

1.2   Component No. 1 Multisectoral Response
       ▪ This component supports key non health line ministries, local governments
          and CSO at both national and Zonal levels to respond to HAMSET II diseases.
        ▪ All multisectoral were required to work under comparative advantage basis
          owing to the limitation of funds in this component.

1.3 Component No. 2 Health Sector Response
▪ Under this component there were five sub-components with their respective allocated
   Budget being as follows:
   - HIV/AIDS (3 million USD)
   - TB            (2 million USD)
   - Malaria       (2 million USD)
   - RH            (4 million USD)
   - HRH           (3 million USD)
Except for HRH each component had these groups of activities:
   1. Improve the information base for decision making, i.e disease surveillance
       reporting surveys and operational research
   2. Scale up prevention interventions



                                            57
                3. Scale up diagnostic, treatment care support
                4. Mitigating Social and economic impact

          1.4 Component No. 3 CMHRP
             ▪ Supports genuine community managed initiatives
             ▪ Development of community capacity to implement sub projects, conduct M/E of
               sub projects.

          1.5       Component No. 4 Project Management
                -    Covers operating costs of project
                -    Supports cross cutting operational aspects of M/E
                -    Supports the development, piloting and evaluation of innovative approaches

          2.       As HAMSET II supports the priorities and activities of the National Strategic
          Plans (NSP) for HAMSET II diseases, the project adopted selected indicators from the
          NSP as its key performance indicators.

          3.   Borrower’s Evaluation of Preparations
          HAMSET II project had been prepared within two months making the preparation
          schedule highly compressed leaving much less time for most processes.




                                                        58
This had been made possible owing to accumulated experience from previous projects,
namely the Health and HAMSET I projects. The momentum and success of HAMSET I
was the basis and foundation for HAMSET II project preparation and implementation.

The lessons learnt in HAMSET I contributed a lot in giving priority to the most effective
evidence based interventions, the need for reviewed focus on high risk groups and
harmonization of interventions and integration of program implementation.

As hard ware had been built under HAMSET I, software was the focus area of HAMSET
II and the initiative of working on comparative advantage basis for multisectoral and
using RRI as implementation tool were strategies piloted and scaled up.
The management structure of HAMSET II though different from other MAP projects was
appropriate for the Eritrean context and has served the project well at all levels. The
borrower also had been prepared well for its contribution to the project. The Government
had continued to honor its commitments despite hard economic times.

3.1      Government Implementation Performance
Implementation by the Government of Eritrea was highly satisfactorily for the following
reasons:
    (i)     High level support and commitment for HAMSET II.
    (ii)    Successful oversight and coordination by the steering committee made up of
            several ministries chaired by the Minister of Health.
    (iii) Effective leadership, at the decentralized levels
    (iv)    Effective mobilization of communities and their positive response.
    (v)     Good governance and transparency in the context of the project
            implementation.

3.2     Implementing Agencies
The HAMSET II as indicated in the PAD would be implemented by various agencies
including MOH, MOLG, MOE, MOTC, MOLHW, MOI, NUEYS, NUEWA, NCEW etc.

The PMU staff as usual demonstrated extraordinary commitment throughout the project
life and were responsive to their stakeholders however it should not be passed without
citing that PMU was constrained by lack of adequate focus and technical expertise in
several program areas.

3.3    Planning and Budgeting
The budgeting process was not reviewed in the course of the project period to reflect any
changes and address the reality on the ground and respond to the principle of
performance-based interventions and implementation in the context of comparative
advantage basis.

3.4    Project Management, Disbursement and Financial Management
As of end of June 2010, 98% of the HAMSET II Grant funds had been disbursed while
the remaining grant is committed. In accordance with the notification of the grant closure
forwarded to the Ministry of Finance by the World Bank Eritrea Country Director



                                           59
disbursements from the credit will be made for withdrawal application received by close
of business on October 31, 2010 in respect of eligible expenditures in respect of services
that have been provided prior to the closing date, while proceeds of the grant remaining
after disbursements have been made in respect of these withdrawal applications will be
cancelled. Counterpart funds have been made available by the Government of Eritrea.
To date USD 2.4 million has been received representing USD 0.4 million more than
planned and an additional USD 0.4 million should be forth coming which is earmarked
for the retention works, customs and taxes

In total Government contribution amounts 12% of the Grant rather than 10% as normally
planned.
The fiduciary arrangements have been assessed as satisfactory owing to PMU being
staffed with qualified finance staff.
Financial reports FMR/IFR and Audit reports and management letters were submitted to
the World Bank within the stipulated periods and inform and substance satisfactory to the
Bank.

3.5      Procurement
Considering the complexity of HAMSET II due to the design as well as the number of
stakeholder’s involved overall procurement was successful owing to PMU’s staff
capacity, proper use of specialized institutions harmonization of stakeholders involved in
the service realistic procurement plan and implementation.

In total USD 1,651,463.93, USD 9,756,368.51 and USD 8,110,201.8 were disbursed for
works, goods and consultancy procurement respectively.
Despite the complexity of the project and due to the number of agencies involved
HAMSET II procurement was conducted successfully

The achievement can be attributed to:
   (i)    Adequate capacity of our Procurement Officers
   (ii)   Strong commitments by all participating agencies
   (iii) Introduction of medium term procurement planning.

3.6        Internal Audit
The Internal Audit was operated by a single staff member, leaving the unit’s day to day
activities focusing on an accounting nature. Because HAMSET II was well managed and
also audited by External Auditing Firms the arrangement sufficed without no incidence of
fraud or loss of project assets.

3.7 External Auditor
The Annual Audit Reports for HAMSET II were all submitted in time and in compliance
with the financial covenant on audit. The auditing firms also provided unqualified
opinions on the annual financial statements for the project from the outset.




                                           60
4.      Project Design flexible and tailored for Eritrea
The HAMSET II steering committee (equivalent to NAC) was chaired by the Minister of
Health and the PMU based in the Ministers Office of the MOH.
This arrangement neither denied the project high level support neither neglects the
interest of non health sectors.
The other sectors were satisfied with technical input by the health sector in their
interventions.
HAMSET II invested a lot in Behavior Changes Communication (BCC) awareness
creation in the most vulnerable groups, HAMSET II also benefited for the investment
HAMSET I made in various areas, e.g VCT, entomology laboratories, school clubs,
sentinel sites and training of various health workers and enhancement of the health
systems focusing the provision of solar powers rehabilitation and equipping of health
facilities to accommodate patients affected by HIV/AIDS Malaria and Tuberculosis.

5.        Mobilization of Communities
As confirmed by evidence the multisectoral and CMHRP components conferred great
benefits to both Malaria and HIV Control.
Most of the key effective interventions e.g. BCC, coverage of ITN, care and support
community treatment by Malaria Agents at community levels benefited from active
participation of the communities and the other sectors had their comparative advantages
in reaching certain populations. There are important lessons learnt not only for malaria
and HIVAIDS but also for the control of other communicable and non communicable
diseases.

6.   Effective Integration of vertical program and Harmonization of
        activities.
A well designed integrated project should limit the overlapping of activities seen between
different components of HAMSET and will inevitably address key health sector issues as
important consideration for sustainability and focus on systemic issues which constrained
the project include weak health management information system and inadequate skilled
human resources.

7.   Policy issues on usage of DDT% and cross border Transmission of
     Malaria
The environmental aspect of Malaria control has been complicated by the mixed and
diversified messages on DDT usage among international organizations and governments.
As the country strives towards Malaria control to avoid epidemics the development
partners need to provide clear direction on their policies and how far they are willing to
support the government’s decision on its decision.
Besides the cross-border transmission of Malaria needs the consideration and action of all
organizations involved in the malaria control.

8.       Capacity Building and Budgeting
It has been agreed that planning was a major pitfall in HAMSET II Project.
Consolidated work plans lacked clear narratives and linkage with budgets and
expenditures explaining the wide gaps between approved budgets and actual expenditures



                                           61
including strategic planning in the budgeting process need to be included in future
HAMSET Projects.
Lack of oversight that otherwise would have helped adjust planning and budgeting is
accountable to both the MOH, its stakeholders and the World Bank back up teams.

9.      Give M/E Component Higher Priority
As the MOH and PMU lacked technical expertise in M/E, special consideration needs to
be given to M/E strengthening at HQ and Zonal levels.
This should be complied with capacity building of the projects staff in M/E at all levels
and provision of back up support and training to the staff.
Introduction of simple and participatory M/E entailing feedback at local levels need to be
adopted to foster decision making and sub project management, which is consistent with
the World Bank strengthening the result based framework

10.     Addressing the challenges of sustainability starting with integration and
community ownership
Like all other MAP projects, sustainability raises a major challenge unluckily in our
context HAMSET II was not privileged to be sustained by HAMSET III project.
However the various Global Fund Grants are complementing the HIV/AIDS, TB, Malaria
and multisectoral program funding.
Nevertheless, the other programs like RH, HRH, CMHRP do not have funds from the
Global Fund Grant funds and these program will be affected owing to lack of funding and
especially like CMHRP which laid the basis for program implementation will cease
functioning.

11. The positive effects of the Report Based Disbursement System
The report based disbursement system adapted in HAMSET II project allowed more
predictable cash flow, more flexibility and facilitated project implementation.
Building the fiduciary capacity of the PMU to enable them to switch to such a
disbursement system was pivotal.

12.      Lessons Learned
HAMSET II provided several important lessons as being one of the MAP projects
financed by the IDA. The HAMSET II design with its multi disease approach is different
than the ordinary MAP projects which focus only on HIV/AIDS and this considered
efficient and cost effective. Sustainability need to be ensured from the outset of project
implementation than later.

13.      The World Bank’s Performance Lending.
The World Bank performance can be judged to be satisfactory.
The financial and technical aspects of project preparation were well handled and
Technical Assistance (TA) was provided to the government during project preparation by
the Bank and other development partners.
The project design was based on local needs and priorities.
However, there were some challenges which include:
♦ Overlaps among project components



                                           62
♦ Lack of clarity and roles and responsibilities of share stakeholders of
♦ Inadequate focus on M/E especially on quality of data and utilization

13.1      Support Supervision
Technical support by the Bank was made regular and some targeted consultancies
occurred.
Missions were generally made six monthly and generally adequate support was provided
despite the absence of technical staff at the country office.

12.2      Financial Management:
The World Bank supported installation of enhanced computerized based accounting
system through upgrading FINPRO soft ware which has significant effect on the PMU’s
performance to maintain excellent and reliable data and information. The shift to FMR
disbursement benefited the project by increasing flexibility and efficiency in grant funds
utilization and liquidity.
