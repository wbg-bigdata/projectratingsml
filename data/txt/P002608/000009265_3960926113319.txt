MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF SUDAN
FOR THE SOUTHERN KORDOFAuN AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.      The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Democratic Republic of Sudan for SDR 15.0 million
(US$19.7 million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit
would be on standard IDA terms with 40 years maturity and help finance an
agricultural development project in the Southern Kordofan Province. The
project would be co-financed by the African Development Bank (AfDB) for
US$15.6 million equivalent.
2.      Background.  Agriculture contributes significantly to Sudan's
economy. In 1986 it accounted for 32% of GDP, and virtually 100% of
exports, employed 70% of the labor force and supplied inputs for a
substantial portion of industrial activity. About 4 million ha (15% of the
total) are under irrigation and 22 million ha (85% of the totai) are under
rainfed cultivation. Rainfed areas produce about 66% of agricultural
output. However, it has been estimated that only half of the potential
production from rainfed agriculture is being realized, partly because most
investment has been concentrated in irrigated areas. To address this
discrepancy, the Government, with IDA support, formulated a strategy in 1966
for the development of rainfed agriculture. This strategy calls for:
increased investment in the rainfed areas; institutional strengthening;
improved supply of agricultural inputs; better marketing and pricing
systems; improved farm technology; resource conservation; and improved
infrastructure.
3.      The Southern Kordofan Province (population of 1.4 million) is an
area of rainfed crop and livestock production. The typical farm size is
about 6 ha although a few smallholder farmers with access to agricultural
machinery cultivate about 14 ha. About 85% of the crops produced are
consumed on the farm and additional grain is usually imported from other
regions. Livestock production is practiced by both nomads and sedentary
farmers and prior to the 1982-85 drought the Province was a net livestock
exporter. Agricultural sector analysis and Bank experience with projects in
or near the Province have shown that major constraints to agricultural
development include: (i) weak agricultural institutions resulting in
inadequate services; (ii) limited water supply; (iii) shortage of farm
inputs; (iv) poor infrastructure and; (v) environmental degradation.
4.      Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The project forms an integral part
of IDA's lending strategy to Sudan. This strategy includes agricultural
projects in both irrigated and rainfed areas aimed at institutional
strengthening, introduction of sustainable agricultural service systems,
environmental protection and technological development. The project would
also support the rainfed sector strategy and is closely related to the
Western Sudan Agricultural Research Project (WSARP) and the Western Savannah
Project (WSP I) implemented in Kordofan and the adjacent Darfur region.
Relevant lessons learned from these projects relate to   (i) crop production
technology with respect to farm inputs and improved practices;



-2-
(ii) development of an extension service to propagate proven technological
innovations; (iii) an effective water infrastructure rehabilitation program;
(iv) successful cost recovery systems for water, veterinary drugs and farm
inputs; and (v) project organization and management. The experience gained
through the WSP and WSARP projects would be enhanced by improving the
effectiveness, sustaigability and replicability of the institutional
structures, service systems and technological packages supported through the
proposed project.
5.      ProJect Objectives.  The main objective of the Project is to provide
a sound institutional framework and, through selected direct interventions,
to assist smallholder farmers and livestock owners in Southern Kordofan to
improve their standard of living through: (i) improved agricultural
services by strengthening selected institutions in the Project area; (ii)
increased availability of farm inputs; (iii) improved water supply and road
infrastructure; and (iv) improved crop production technology. Cost recovery
systems would be established for appropriate services and inputs, and
measures would be taken to enhance environmental protection.
6.      Project Description.  The proposed project would ti) strengthen the
Provincial Agricultural Departments responsible for extension and plant
protection services; (ii) support the production of improved seeds and
horticultural seedlings; (iii) improve livestock health by increasing the
supply and administration of veterinary drugs and vaccines; (iv) improve
rural water supply through rehabilitation of wateryards and haffirs; (v)
improve agricultural machinerv services by supporting farmers to purchase
equipment on credit, reconditioning equipment .d rehabilitating repair
facilities; (vi) improve the rural road netwo,k through construction and
rehabilitation of feeder roads; and (vii) strengthen the capability of the
implementing agencies with respect to planning, financial management, cost
recovery and monitoring and evaluation. The project would also include a
land use plan for the Province and would strengthen the capability of the
Regional Ministry of Planning to monitor the natural resource base. The
project, to be implemented over six years, provides funds for civil works,
farm inputs, vehicles, equipment, training, technical assistance, studies
and incremental operating costs. It would be implemented by exist- 'g
services in the Proviace with assistance from a Project Management Llit
(PMU) established for the duration of the project. The total cost of the
project is estimated at US$39.8 million equivalent with a foreign exchange
component of US$28.9 million (75%). A breakdown of costs and the financing
plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of
disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A
timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in Sudan are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map and
the Staff Appraisal Report, No. 6939-SU, dated November 25, 1987 are also
attached.
7.      Agreed Actions.  Prior to negotiations the Government established
the PMU, and the Agricultural Machinery Services (AMS) as a separate legal
entity, and appointed the4r respective Directors. The Government has agreed
on the following: (a) lending terms and conditions to the Agricultural Bank



- 3 -
of Sudan (ABS) and to the AMS as described in the Credit and Project Summary
above. On-lending terms and conditions applicable to the AES would be
reviewed annually and modified accordingly with a view to move toward
positive real interest rates; (b) by Project Year 6 charges for water, plant
protection treatments, seedlings, improved seeds, veterinary drugs and
agricultural machinery hiring would be at full cost recovery levels; (c)
establishment -by the Regional Government of a Road Maintenance Unit during
Project Year 1; (d) appointment of the Director of the Provincial Extension
Service by April 15, 1988; (e) preparation of a training program for Project
Year 1 by April 15, 1988; and (f) establishment of a project account and
initial deposit of LSd400,000 by the Government not later than April 15,
1988. Conditions of effectiveness are: (a) appointment of the PMU financial
controller; (b) fulfillment of conditions precedent to the AfDB loan
agreement; and (c) execution of the respective subsidiary loan agreements
between the Government and the ABS and AMS.
8.      Benefits.  Agricultural institutions and smallholder farmers and
livestock owners in Southern Kordofan would oe the main project
beneficiaries. Benefits would be expected from: (i) institutional
strengthening; (ii) the rehabilitation and maintenance of water sources;
resulting in greater crop and livestock production; (iii) higher yields from
improved inputs, better cultivation practices and plant protection; (iv)
increased area under cultivation and higher yields from use of agricultural
machinery; and (v) increased livestock production from expanded vaccination
and improved diagnostic and therapeutic servicee. In view of the Province's
current deficit in grain production and its estimated populat±on growth it
is expected that all of the incremental crop production would be consumed in
the Province but incremental livestock production would contribute to the
Province's exports.
9.      Risks.  Possible risks include the difficulty of recriiting
qualified high level staff, weak management of some implementing agencies,
inadequate provision of iudgetary resources and possible start-up delays due
to the Province's remote location and limited infrastructure. To Tinimize
these risks the Project provides staff recruitment incentives, technical
assistance, training and hands-on support by the PMU to the implementing
agencies; emphasis on cost recovery and firm commitment by the Government to
provide adequate budgetary resources; posting of project staff in Khartoum
and Port Sudan to expedite procurement and movement of supplies to the
Project area; and commitment by the Government to make available to the PMU
and to the Extension Service existing office and housing facilities in the
Province.
10.     Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
