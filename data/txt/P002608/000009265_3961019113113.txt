SOUTHERN KORDOFAN AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Credit 1867-SU)
PREFACE
1.        This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Southern Kordofan
Agricultural Development Project in Sudan, for which IDA Credit 1867-SU in the amount of
SDR 15.0 million (US$19.7 million equivalent) was approved on February 4, 1988 and became
effective on February 27, 1989.
2.        Following delays in the payment of amounts owed to IDA, disbursements under the
Credit were suspended on September 14, 1993. Disbursements for existing contracts relating to
civil works and for overseas training of project staff were not affected. On account of non-
payment of the arrears, the Credit was closed on February 14, 1994, compared with the original
closing date of December 31, 1994. The final disbursement took place on February 3, 1994. An
amount of SDR 6.26 million was cancelled by IDA on April 28, 1994. Cofinancing for the
project was provided by the African Development Bank (AfDB).
3.        The ICR was prepared by the staff of FAO/CP on behalf of the Agriculture and
Environment Operations Division (AF2AE), Eastern Africa Department (AF2), and was
reviewed by Ms. S. Ganguly, Division Chief, AF2AE, and Mr. S. Agarwal, Project Adviser,
AF2. The report is based on material in the project files, as well as the findings of the ICR
mission that went to the field. The Borrower's comments on the ICR have not been received.
The project authorities contributed to the preparation of the ICR by providing comments and
views, which are reflected in the mission's aide memoire.

SOUTHERN KORDOFAN AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Credit 1867-SU)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
Between 1975 and 1986, IDA extended 23 Credits in the agricultural sector, totaling
about US$0.5 billion. Sixteen of these projects and three quarters of the funds were
focused on irrigated agriculture. The Western Savannah Agriculture Project - Phase I
(WSAP-1) in South Darfur, which became effective in 1981 and was followed by Phase
li (WSAP-2) in 1986, was the first integrated project to address the challenge of
developing rainfed agriculture in the Sahelian zone of Sudan.
2.        The Southern Kordofan Agricultural Development Project (SKADP) was
aimed at providing a sound institutional framework, and, through selected direct
interventions, to improve rainfed agriculture and farmers' income. This was to be
achieved through: (a) improved agricultural services by strengthening selected
agricultural institutions in the project area; (b) ir.creased availability of farm inputs; (c)
improved water supply and road infrastructure; and (d) improved crop production
technology. It was also, intended that agricultural technologies developed under WSAP-
1 would be extended under SKADP, cost recovery systems would be established for
appropriate services and inputs, and measures would be taken to enhance environmental
protectionl.
3.        In order to achieve the above objectives, the project comprised of the
following  eight components: (i) water supply (US$13.4 miilion); (ii) agricultural
machinery, including rehabilitation and credit (US$4.6 million); (iii) agricultural services
(extension and plant protection -US$3.1 million); (iv) agricultural inputs (improved seeds
and horticultural seedlings - US$2.5 million); (v) livestock health (US$4.5 million); (vi)
road improvement (US$5.0 million); (vii) project management (US$4.7 million); and
(viii) institutional support and management training (US$1.4 million). The project was
modeled after WSAP-2, which was prepared in 1985. Implementation was to be
undertaken through public agencies, which the project would strengthen, under the
coordination of a Project Management Unit (PMU). The PMU was to be dissolved at
project completion.
4.        The multiplicity of components, involving a number of weak government
agencies for their implementation, and the lack of sound strategies for water supply and
mechanization, in particular, were serious design weaknesses.



iii
Implementation Experience and Results
5.        The security situation greatly hampered implementation from the first year
(1989) and should have led to the suspension of disbursements within a few months from
effectiveness. It is only when the situation improved significantly in 1993 that field
activities started.
6.        Since then, a unified extension system has been established in the project
area. The recommendations from a study, completed under the Project in 1992, were
successfully implemented, and resulted in unifying the different extension services in the
region. This extension system is supported by a promising on-farm technology testing
(OFTT) program. The OFTT program allowed farmers to manage the tests, under their
own conditions, and compare the performance of 3 - 5 varieties of the major crops. This
program, which was well received by farmers, was supplemented by   a seed
multiplication scheme using contract growers. In 1994, 53 tons of seeds were distributed.
The scheme covered 1,000 ha., involving private seed growers, in 1994. The OFTT
program is linked with the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-arid
Tropics (ICRISAT) through the regional agricultural research center at El Obeid. These
programs, together with the development of animal-drawn implements, could bring about
significant improvements in rainfed farming productivity, although it is too early to
evaluate the potential impact.
7.        Despite the decline in staff resources, animal health services registered
significant improvements under the project. With partial support from the Pan African
Rinderpest Campaign, 3.3 million vaccinations and treatments covering annually 600,000
of an estimated 2.4 million cattle were completed; a revolving fund was established for
the sustainability of these services; training of veterinary scouts was undertaken; and,
capacity  was created  for vaccine  production.   In  addition, following  IDA
recommendations, six private pharmacies were allowed to operate in the project area. The
buildings component (18 houses/offices and I workshop) was satisfactorily completed.
The Plant Protection component also performed satisfactorily, albeit with limited staff,
and the production of horticultural seedlings increased by 20 - 50 percent.
8.        By contrast, achievements in infrastructure (water supply and roads) are
minimal. The implementing agencies responsible for these components have not been
strengthened, no maintenance system has been established, and cost recovery for water
remains at a fraction of real costs. Also, tractor services have not been satisfactorily
reorganized, and the 85 tractors procured by the project have not reached the intended
beneficiaries, nor have they been paid for at their real cost by the recipients. The
monitoring and evaluation (M&E) function was to be undertaken by the Project
Management Unit (PMU) with the assistance of an expatriate consultant. Following the
premature departure of the consultant on health grounds and lack of an early replacement,
insignificant M&E data was maintained. Key constraints during implementation relate to
the security situation, poor government counterpart funding of project activities, weak
capacity and inadequately funded implementing agencies, and communications



iv
difficulties between SKADP and the cofinancier, AfDB, which led to low disbursements
from AfDB (only 19 percent of SAR estimates). Finally, the suspension of IDA
disbursements, first in April 1993 and then in September 1993, hampered efforts to put
the project back on track. Not surprisingly, therefore, the overall project outcome is
generally unsatisfactory.
9.        IDA performance during appraisal was not fully satisfactory, and was clearly
insufficient during implementation, as only 2 of a total of 8 missions were able to visit
the project area because of security reasons and the difficulty to obtain Government
authorization. As previously mentioned, the security conditions should have caused the
Bank to suspend disbursements earlier. The performance ol the Government of Sudan
(GOS) has also not been up to the required levels. Project funding was irregular and
insufficient, and Government support in staffing matters has been weak. Furthermore, the
diversion of some project vehicles by security forces undermined project implementation.
Findings, Future Operations and Key Lessons
10.       The State Government of South Kordofan intends to maintain SKADP
organization as a regional agency to plan, implement and coordinate rural development in
South Kordofan, and is expected to support its operations. SKADP's capacity to fulfill
this role will depend not only on continued funding, but also on more attractive
employment conditions to recruit and retain competent staff. There is no viable plan for
the future rehabilitation and maintenance of wateryards, nor is there one for road
maintenance.
II.       The Project's meager achievements in infrastructure are not sustainable.
Even if the security conditions had been more favorable, it is likely that the difficulties
experienced in infrastructure development would have remained, as they stemmed from
poor project design. In particular, the capacity and willingness of farmers to pay for an
expensive water supply system had been overestimated. However, the benefits of on-
farm varietal testing and seed multiplication, if confirmed, might be sustainable as they
require only limited funding and seem to have an effective demand from the farmers.
The animal-drawn implements program is also likely to be sustainable and could further
expand if the private sector were involved, as was achieved in South Darfur by WSAP-2.
Cost recovery in animal health services is still insufficient to guarantee sustainability,
while the loss of qualified staff is particularly acute in this area. The PMU intended to
explore opportunities of reducing dependency on GOS funding through increased cost
recovery from the sales of inputs, vaccines, and extension services. The level of funds
raised from these sources will, however, depend on the beneficiaries' willingness and
ability to pay. Overall, therefore, the sustainability of the project is uncertain unless
continued funding is forthcoming.
12.             As the pace of implementation of project activities picked up only
during the last few months, before the project closed, the lessons learned from the project
are limited. A major lesson is that attempts to implement a project under poor security



v
conditions are likely to result in the loss of resources for meager results. The other key
lessons include, inter alia:
(a) An integrated approach to development should not mean that all
directions should be pursued simultaneously. To be successful, it requires
a well defined strategy, and the selection of the more critical components
that are likely to have a crucial development impact.
(b) The broad strategy needed to structure project activities to achieve
objectives should be defined before implementation and be shared with
the major actors, rather than be developed as the result of studies to be
carried out during implementation.
(c) As far as possible, a project should be implemented through existing
line agencies.
(d) Strong commitment from the Government and implementing agencies
is essential to achieve project objectives.
(e) If full cost recovery for wateryards appears to be beyond the payment
ability of most farmers in the project area, cheaper alternatives (e.g.
handpumps) should be considered.
(f) For on-farm technology testing to be successful, the farmers should be
allowed to manage these tests under their own conditions, with guidance
from the extension and research staff.
(g) The M&E function for any project is too important to be made
dependent on the recruitment and availability of expatriate technical
assistance staff. To the extent possible, projects should be designed to
ensure that the M&E function is carried out regularly by suitably qualified
and experienced local staff

SOUT HERN KORDOFAN AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Credit 1867-SU)
PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. STATEMENT/EVALUATION OF OBJECTIVES
1.        The project was designed to provide a sound institutional framework and, through
selected direct interventions, to assist smallholder farmers and livestock owners in Southern
Kordofan to improve their standard of living. This main objective was to be achieved through:
(a) improved agricultural services by strengthening selected agricultural institutions in the project
area; (b) increased availability of  farm  inputs; (c) improved water supply and  road
infrastructure; and (d) improved crop production technology.  It was also intended that
agricultural technologi^s developed under Western Savannah Agriculture Project I (WSAP-1)
would be extended under SKADP, cost recovery systems would be established for appropriate
services and inputs, and measures would be taken to enhance environmental protection.
2.        In order to achieve the above objectives, the project comprised of the following
eight components: (i) water supply (US$13.4 million); (ii) agricultural machinery, including
rehabilitation and credit (US$4.6 million); (iii) agricultural services (extension and plant
protection -US$3.1 million); (iv) agricultural inputs (improved seeds and horticultural seedlings -
US$2.5 million); (v) livestock health (US$4.5 million); (vi) road improvement (US$5.0 mnillion);
(vii) project management (US$4.7 million); and (viii) institutional support and management
training (US$1.4 million). The project was modeled after the Western Savannah Agricultural
Project - Phase II (WSAP-2) which was prepared in 1985. Implementation was to be undertaken
through public agencies, which the project would strengthen, under the coordination of a Project
Management Unit (PMU). The PMU was to be dissolved at project completion.
3.        The lack of clear development strategies led to a multiplicity of components. Also,
the linkage between agricultural production and water yards (haffirs) was less apparent in this
relatively humid region than is the case for South Darfur. The number of executing agencies
involved, many with recognized weaknesses, was a further design weakness. Studies to be
carried out during project implementation on land utilization/tenure, mechanization and water
supply were expected to provide the basis for the development strategies. However, it is not fully
clear how these could have significantly influenced project activities. For example, it was
acknowledged that experience with public tractor services had not been encouraging; however,
40% of the mechanization component was allocated to the rehabilitation of the public
Agricultural Machinery Services (AMS), while the rest was earmarked to help farmers buy
tractors on credit. The proposed mechanization study was scheduled to be carried out in project
ye.tr 3 (PY3), with the objective to recommend steps towards the privatization of the AMS; the
achievement of AMS' privatization during implementation was, however, an optimistic
objective.

B. ACHIEVEMENT OF OBJECTIVES
Physical Objectives
4.         As shown in Part II, Table 5, the project achieved few of its physical objectives,
largely because of widespread insecurity in the project area during the early years of
implementation, persistent inadequate funding by GOS and, later, because of suspension of
disbursements by both IDA and AfDB. The civil works program, therefore, fell far short of the
appraisal targets. Only 11 wateryards were rehabilitated (SAR: 133), 30 boreholes cleaned (SAR:
100), 3 new water tanks erected (SAR: 36), 5 of 80 small haffirs were rehabilitated, and none of
the 10 large haffirs. No progress was made in the establishment of a wateryard maintenance
system. Similarly, the road improvement program did not commence. Only the building
component (18 houses/offices and 1 workshop) was satisfactorily completed.
Development Objectives
5.         Agriculture: The project failed to adequately extend the technologies envisaged at
appraisal. Instead, it established, in 1994, an on-farm technology testing system (OFTT), not
envisaged at appraisal, which looks promising and has already yielded encouraging results. The
seed multiplication scheme, also established in 1994, looks equally promising. A dormant
animal-drawn implements program' was revived and, given the success of a similar program
under WSAP-2, may have potential for further development. Three public horticultural nurseries
have been rehabilitated, and the production of seedlings has increased by 20 to 50%.
6.         The reorganization of tractor services has brought only limited improvement in their
management and AMS privatization is not likely to take place. The Government will retain a
majority of shares, and it is unlikely that the new joint stock company can be more effective. As
envisaged at appraisal, 85 tractors have been bought by the Agricultural Bank; however, they
have not been distributed to the intended beneficiaries (para. 18).
7.         Animal Health services have made commendable efforts to improve the coverage
of vaccination and treatments, as well as the sustainability of those services through the operation
of a revolving fund, the training of veterinary scouts, and the establishment of a capacity for
vaccine production. However, coverage was limited. Vaccinations reached only a third of the
cattle in the project area. Also, the revolving fund was constantly eroded by inflation, and the
service was not able to retain skilled staff.
Economic Benefits
8.        No attempt was made at estimating the benefits of the project, as virtually none had
accrued until 1993, and it remains to be seen if the new crop varieties, distributed in 1994, will
produce the expected benefits.

C. IMIPLEMENTATION RECORD AND MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROJECT
General
9.        The security situation worsened soon after effectiveness (February 1989) and greatly
hampered implementation of field activities, as well as the recruitment of national and
international staff. No supervision mission could visit project areas until two years after
effectiveness (April 1991), and in total, only two of the eight missions visited the project
headquarters in Ka ugli.
Technical Assistance
10.       With the exception of the Khartoum-based Financial Controller, the recruitment of
the other technical assistance (TA) staff (expatriate consultants) was delayed till late 1990 when
there was some improN zment in the security situation and the Ministry of Finance and Economic
Planning (MOFEP) lifted the ban on sending TA staff to Kadugli. As shown in Table 5, of the 6
TA staff employed by the project, only 2 were able to serve the full length of time as stipulated in
the SAR. Expert advice was provided in, inter alia, agriculture, engineering, finance, and
information systems. Because of the relatively short time the consultants stayed with the project,
and because of restrictions on their mobility due to the security situation, their impact on the
project was limited.
Training
11.       The training program was adversely affected because of delays in getting approval
from the National Training Administration (NTA). The donor agencies encouraged the project to
concentrate on short-term courses so that staff were not kept away from their work for long
periods, which would have disrupted project activities. Consequently, only three persons went
on long term training - one for an MSc. degree course in extension at the Khartoum University,
and two on one-year courses on laboratory techniques in the U.K. The rest attended short-term
courses, both locally in the Sudan and overseas. As shown in Part II, Table 5, the number of
staff trained in computing, vehicle repair and maintenance, and financial analysis, was less than
the appraisal targets. The main reason for these shortfalls was the lack of local counterpart
funding. Also, the NTA continued to place obstacles through delays in the approval process.
For example, of the 17 technicians whom the project selected for training in 1992/93, NTA
approved only three.
Road Improvement
12.       Procurement for road equipment was delayed, partly due to the high cost of imports
caused by the 1992 devaluation of the Sudanese Pound. The terms of reference (TOR) for the
design of the 300 km feeder roads and tender documents were prepared when the security
situation improved in 1991, but the engineering contract was only signed in 1994. As MOFEP
had rejected the inclusion of a price escalation clause, the contractor did not implement the



4
construction. The road maintenance program was to be implemented by the State Road
Maintenance Unit (SRMU). However, the Unit, being poorly staffed, never submitted an annual
work plan and budget to IDA. The equipment procured by the project was, therefore, returned to
SKADP (para. 29).
Wateryard and Haffir Rehabilitation
13.       This component, financed by AfDB, suffered from  irregular communication
between the PMU and AfDB. Procurement of wateryard equipment was delayed, and only 30%
of the loan was disbursed until mid-1994. The performance of the National Rural Water
Corporation (NRWC) has also been below expectations; workplans were unclear and
overambitious considering the available funding, and priority was given to a UNICEF supported
program of handpumps, for which incentives in the form of materials were available to user
groups through NRWC. The rehabilitation of large haffirs was delayed due to shortages of
construction material and the lack of spare parts for the heavy equipment. For smaller haffirs, the
lack of implements and incentives for user participation (food for work was expected) hampered
implementation.
Agricultural Development
14.       Extension: The regional extension service was re-established in 1990, with the
appointment of a Director. However, staff has gradually reduced since, from a total of 7 in 1990
to 3 in 1993. The service was strengthened in 1994 by merger with the extension section of the
Nuba Mountains Rural Development Project (NMRDP) at its closure. A total of 12 Development
Centers were established, employing 78 extension agents and 26 extension officers under the
authority of SKADP. Due to the lack of trained staff and the paucity of suitable technology,
extension was largely confined to the distribution of seeds and seedlings. Quantities distributed
were modest, except in 1990 when some 50 tons of sorghum seeds were supplied to farmers as
drought relief. The distribution of fertilizers (TSP) ceased in 1989/90, as unsubsidized fertilizer
application was not profitable for the farmers. Aldrex, a seed dressing chemical, was banned the
same year due to its toxicity. However, some two tons of Thiram were distributed instead, for
cereals; no satisfactory replacement of Aldrex has been found for groundnut.
15.       In 1993, a modest on-farm technology testing (OFTT) program was launched, which
was expanded to cover 81 sites in 1994. The tests, managed by farmers, allow them to compare,
in their own conditions, the performance of 3-5 varieties of the major crops. This program, which
was well received by farmers, was supplemented by a seed multiplication scheme using contract
growers. In 1994, 53 tons of seeds were distributed. The scheme has expanded in 1994 and now
covers over 1,000 ha., involving 45 private seed growers. The project also took over the animal
traction program of the NMRDP. This is expected to further develop, following the lead of
WSAP-2 in South Darfur. The OFTT program receives guidance from the regional agricultural
research center at El Obeid, which is itself linked with ICRISAT.
16.       Plant Protection:  This component was implemented by the Plant Protection
Department of MOA, and has performed satisfactorily with limited staff. It consisted of direct
control campaigns of infested areas by ground or aerial spraying. Main pests treated were
weaver birds, locusts, rodents, and a variety of garden pests. Only services to individual farmers



5
were charged. Project support included vehicles, spares, fuel and travel allowances. Support was
obtained from NMRDP to alleviate insufficient funding from AfDB.
17.       Tractor Services: AMS was established as a corporation in 1990; 52 tractors were
rehabilitated, a workshop was constructed, and staff were trained. However, management was
weak, and tractor availability declined to 35 in 1992. A number of these were hired out at below
cost rates; those operated by AMS ploughed an average of 330 ha each in 1992, and for about
250 hours, or half the capac ity rate and much below the performance of privately used tractors.
The mechanization study, completed in 1992, recommended a partial privatization of AMS,
rather than outright dissolution as suggested by the supervision missions. The proposed joint
stock company (i.e. owned jointly by the Governmnent and interested individuals from the private
sector) was yet to be established when the project closed.
18.       The project provided medium term credit for the purchase of 85 tractors with
ploughs, and 20 trailers. The credit was channeled through the Agricultural Bank of Sudan
(ABS). However, although tho landed cost of each tractor was about US$17,000, equivalent to
LS 1.65 million at the then official rate of LS 97.00 to US$1.00, the tractors were sold at only
LS 0.65 million each, thus providing the buyers a substantial subsidy. Secondly, although the
machinery was supposed to be bought by groups of farmers, it was, in fact, allocated (1990) to
the newly formed "Peace Villages". These, according to GOS, consisted of traditional South
Kordofan farmers who were displaced as a result of disturbances and were now returning to their
traditional villages and homesteads. A number of those tractors were reportedly used by
merchants for transport. The project management vas still trying to retrieve the machinery and
allocate it, after overhauling, to selected groups of farmers, when the project closed.
1 9.      Animal Health: The component was implemented by the Veterinary Department. In
spite of project support, irregular supply of drugs and vaccines affected the delivery of health
services, because of cumbersome Government ptocurement procedures and limited cooperation
from the Veterinary Central Administration. The establishment by the project of a revolving fund
could partially alleviate the difficulty, provided improved cost recovery is achieved. Also, some
6 private pharmacies have been allowed to operate, in conformity with IDA recommendations.
The other major constraint is the loss of qualified personnel in the Service. The number of
veterinarians has declined from 25 pre-project to 11 in 1994, due to unfavorable employment
conditions and expanding opportunities in the private sector. This is only partially compensated
for by the training of veterinary assistants (20), nurses (15) and scouts (60). However, the
Veterinary Department was able, during project implementation, to slightly increase the number
of vaccinations (particularly for rinderpest, for which Pan African Rinderpest Campaign [PARC]
SUppOrt was also available) and of treatments, which is an achievement given the circumstances.
Dul-ing project implementation, a total of 3.3 million vaccinations were performed, or an annual
average of 600,000 (total cattle population is estitnated at 2.4 million).
Monitoring and Evaluation
20.        The monitoring and evaluation function was carried out by the PMU. A TA advisor
was attached to the unit but, on his premature departure due to health grounds, he was not
quickly replaced. Very little monitoring of project inputs and outputs was done. A supervision
mission, which visited the project in February 1993, expressed disappointment at the total lack of



6
basic data on agricultural activities in the project area. Without such information, it is difficult to
quantify the impact of the project in physical and financial terms.
Project Costs and Financing
21.        Project costs are estimated to be about US$15.3 million (see Part II, Table 8A) or
about 38% of appraisal estimates. This large shortfall is due to three main factors: the very slow
implementation rate in the first few years because of widespread insecurity in the project area;
the slow disbursement of AfDB funds; and severe under-funding of the project by GOS.
22.        As shown in Part II, Table 8B, IDA contributed the equivalent of US$11.8 million,
about US$8.0 million less than stipulated at appraisal. AfDB contributed the equivalent of
US$3.0 million or just 19% of the appraisal estimate. The slow rate of disbursement by AfDB
was an issue throughout project implementation and this adversely affected the components
which were to be funded from that source. The GOS has contributed the equivalent of only
US$0.5 million or 11% of its total commitment. The severe under-funding of this project by
GOS compared with the other development projects in the country could imply that either the
government was not committed to the project, or project staff did not actively pursue for funds
from GOS. In 1990, the Islamic Development Bank (IDB) pledged the equivalent of US$3.9
million in local currency to the project, but none of this was disbursed. Following the suspension
of IDA disbursements to the Sudan in September 1993, SDR 6.3 million or 42% of the Credit
was canceled. US$13.0 million of the AfDB Loan remained undisbursed.
D. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
23.        The sustainability of the project is uncertain unless continued  funding is
forthcoming. Project management was optimistic that GOS will fund a substantial share of
project operations but, given the past record, this is not likely. The PMU intended to explore
ways of reducing dependency on GOS funding through increased cost recovery from the sales of
inputs, vaccines, and extension services. The level of funds raised from these sources will,
however, depend on the extent to which the beneficiaries are willing or able to pay. At a
technical level, project sustainability is also threatened by the likelihood of senior staff resigning
their posts because of funding uncertainty and the attraction of getting higher paying jobs
elsewhere.
24.        The sustainability of the infrastructural improvements on roads, wateryards and
haffirs is, in general, unlikely as these require constant maintenance (including funding of spare
parts for plant and machinery in foreign exchange). This will be difficult to carry out without
Government support. Moreover, no road maintenance has been carried out during
implementation, as priority was given to new construction. The maintenance unit was not
operational when the project closed. For water supply, cost recovery has actually decreased by
some 45% (in constant terms) over the implementation period, and it covers only a third of full
costs at present, as against the SAR expectation of 100% by PY6 (1993). The general condition
of wells and pumps has continued to deteriorate during implementation, and the possibility for
Rural Councils to finance major repairs is doubtful. The UNICEF-funded handpump program is



7
providing an alternative source of water in many villages; this, however, will contribute to
reducing the demand and revenues from wateryards.
25.       The agricultural benefits generated by the OFTT and seed multiplication activities,
though modest, could be sustained or even increased, as the mechanism put in place requires
only limited Government funding and is popular with farmers. The animal-drawn implements
program is also likely to be sustainable, and could further expand if the private sector were
involved, as was achieved in South Darfur by WSAP-2.
E. BANK PEF FORMANCE
26.       The performance of the Bank at appraisal was not fully satisfactory.  The
preparatic -i was insufficient; development strategies were not clearly spelled out (water supply
and mechanization); assumptions regarding the availability of new technologies and the
capability and willingness of implementing agencies to play their expected roles were optimistic;
and the piraject desi,,n was complex. There were eight supervision missions during
implementation. For security reasons, only two could visit the project area. Given the difficulty
to implement field activities, the impossibility to ensure meaningful supervision, and the lack of
Government funding for the project, the project should have been closed or suspended in 1989 or
1990. Notwithstanding this, and given the difficult conditions, the supervision missions did their
best to assist project management, particularly in facilitating procurement and in obtaining a
level of commitment from the Government.
F. BORROWER PERFORMANCE
27.       The Government performance was unsatisfactory, particularly during the earlier
years. In addition to severe under-funding, the Government was unhelpful on a number of
issues, including the possibility for the project to retain funds generated by cost recovery,
inadequate staff incentives, delayed authorizations for staff training, the allocation of project
tractors to non-project beneficiaries, and the commandeering of some project vehicles by security
forces. Much of the effort of supervision missions was spent on reversing such decisions, and a
lot of time was lost. With the almost complete restoration of security in 1993, this attitude
changed, and there was a much more supportive attitude from both the Central and the concerned
State Governments.
G. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
28.       The outcome of the project is generally unsatisfactory. The three major components,
cost-wise (water supply, roads and agricultural machinery) had little impact: water output was
halved during implementation due to lack of maintenance of wells and pumps, instead of being
increased five-fold; road construction had hardly commenced (10% of the SAR estimate) and no
maintenance of existing roads has been performed or is envisaged; AMS remains to be privatized
and the tractors bought by the project have not reached the intended beneficiaries, although some
may have been put to productive use.

29.        Against this bleak overall picture, it is only fair to highlight some recent positive
developments. With a newly appointed, able manager, and the team trained by the project,
SKADP is emerging as a much stronger organization" , capable of playing a leading role in the
development of the region. With the limited funding that it may attract from central and local
governments, it is not unrealistic to hope that SKADP might strengthen its technology
development program and bring it to fruition, while continuing its useful support to line agencies
such as the Veterinary and the Plant Protection Departments. Without significant external
support, its role in infrastructure development must be viewed with much more skepticism.
H. FUTURE OPERATIONS
30.        The decentralization has left State Governments with weak line agencies. Under
these circumstances, the role of SKADP as a development agency, with direct responsibilities in
a number of fields as well as in overall planning, is bound to increase rather than recede, as
envisaged at appraisal. Increased support is expected from State authorities and GOS has
promised to continue its funding. These arrangements, if followed through, would contribute to
ensure the sustainability of agricultural development activities.
31.        For the roads, SKADP plans to retain all equipment procured by the project for road
maintenance, and use it to further implement the road upgrading program envisaged in the SAR.
There is no plan for road maintenance. The sharing of responsibilities between SKADP and the
State Ministry of Engineering Affairs remains to be defined. For water supply, the national
policy is to establish NRWC as a commercial company which would contract its services to
Rural Councils for the maintenance of the wateryards, while the Councils would be fully
responsible for their operation and management, including the provision of spares and fuel, and
the collection of water revenues. Given the difficulty to raise water charges to full cost recovery,
the possibility for the Councils to finance more than the O&M costs is open to question.
1. KEY LESSONS LEARNED
32.        At this stage, the main lesson to be learned from the project is that attempts to
implement a project under difficult security conditions are likely to lead to a loss of resources for
meager results. Other lessons include the following:
-      An integrated approach to development should not mean that all directions
should be pprsued simultaneously. To be successful, it requires a well
defined strategy, and the selection of the more critical components that are
likely to have a crucial development impact.
The broad strategy needed to structure project activities to achieve
objectives should be defined before implementation and be shared with the
major actors, rather than be expected as the result of studies to be carried
out during implementation.
2   Originally used as an acronym for the project, SKADP has, contrary to original plans, developed into a large
regional development agency.

As far as possible, a project should be implemented through existing line
agencies. Though these were weak in the case of the project, this
arrangement worked relatively well, with the exception of the road
component.
Strong commitment from the Government and implementing agencies is
essential to achieve project objectives.
If full cost recovery for wateryards appears to be beyond the ability to pay
by most farmers in the project area3, cheaper alternatives (e.g. handpumps)
should be considered.
To ensure proper maintenance of wateryards through the participation of
farmers, the project design should include the setting up of water users'
associations.
For on-farm technology testing to be successful, the farmers should be
aliowed to manage these tests under their own conditions, with guidance
from the extension and research staff.
- The proposed privatization of loss-making public sector agencies, envisaged
at appraisal, needs to be carefully considered, as it is often not possible to
achieve these objectives during the project period.
'The Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) function for any project is too
important to be made dependent on the recruitment and availability of
expatriate technical assistance staff. To the extent possible, projects should
be designed to ensure that the M&E function is carried out regularly by
suitably qualified and experienced local staff.
Project Management Units, which are created initially to ensure smooth
implementation of projects, can become the nucleus of a "regional"
development agency in instances where a country decides to decentralize
administrative authority and transfer resources to administrative units (e.g.
regions, provinces, districts).
This is the implicit conclusion of the study carried out in South Darfur by WSAP-2 in 1992.

MISSION'S AIDE-MEMOIRE






SUDAN: South Kordofan Agricultural Development Project
Implementation Completion Report Mission
Aide-Memoire
Introduction
1.           An FAO/World Bank Cooperative Program  (CP) mission composed of Francois
Dauphin (agronomist, mission leader), Fred Bitanihirwe (financial analyst) and Ahmed Balfouzi
(eng;ineer), visited Sudan from 12 to 30 September 1994 to prepare the Implementation Completion
Report for the above project as well as for Western Savannah II project. The mission held discussions
with senior officials of the Ministry of Finance and Planning, and visited the two projects areas,
accompanied by an official of the Ministry of Ag-iculture. In South Kordofan, the mission held
discussions with the Director General and SKADP senior staff, met with the State Minister of
Agriculture, and visited project areas in Kadugli and Dilling Provinces.
2.            The mission wishes to express their appreciation for the excellent organization of the
visits, the efforts made by project staff to prepare the needed information, and their cordial hospitality.
These made the work of the mission that much easier in a very tight time-frame.
Project Objectives
3.            The project was to improve rainfed agriculture by rehabilitating water supply systems
and extending agricultural technologies developed by Western Savannah I for Qoz and Naga'a soils,
with the objective of increasing farmers income and production. This was to be achieved through
extension, input supply, seed production, and tractor services. Additional components included the
strengthening of animal health services, and a large road improvement program, including the
construction of 300 km of all-weather roads. Implementation was to be through public agencies, which
the project would strengthen, under the coordination of a Project Management Unit (PMU) to be
dissolved at project completion.
4.            The lack of clear development strategies led to the multiplication of components, with
no explicit relationship between them. In particular, the linkage between agricultural production and
wateryards is much less clear in this relatively humid region than is the case for South Darfur. The
number of executing agencies involved, many with recognized weaknesses, was a further design flaw.
Stddies to be carried out during implementation on land utilization, mechanization and water supply
were expected to provide those strategies. However, it is not clear how these could have significantly
influenced project activities.
Implementation Experience and Results
5.            General. The security situation greatly hampered implementation, in particular field
activities and the recruitment of national and international staff, while supervision missions were not
allowed to visit project areas.
6.            Water Supply. The program has witnessed major delays, due partly to procurement
difficulties, but also to weak commitment on the part of NRWC to the objectives of the project. In
particular, this component suffered from the competition of a UNICEF program of hand pumps which
I



has mobilized NRWC staff and resources.  Achievements are a fraction of expectations for the
wateryards, and negligible for the haffir program.
7.            Cost recovery has remained low, and is adequate for only around 200 million liters
representing 10% of the SAR estimated water output at completion. Water charges were increased 25
fold, but this mainly compensated for inflation; moreover, water revenues do not entirely accrue to
NRWC. Water losses remain considerable (about 1/3 of abstractions). Due to the success of UNICEF
hand pumps, water demand from wateryards for human consumption is expected to decrease. The
sustainability of this component remains questionable (see para 20).
8.            Roads. Protracted delays in contracting road construction, due to security problems,
has led the PMU to undertake itself some of the construction worked in 1993/94 (35 km of feeder
road), using equipment originally intended for maintenance by the Regional Road Maintenance Unit
(RRMU). The RRMU itself never had the capacity or the will to implement its foreseen task, and no
road maintenance has been carried out yet.  The contract for the design and supervision of the
remainder of the construction program was signed in June 1994 and construction is only expected in
1995/1996. No road maintenance unit has yet been established within the new State administration
(Ministry of Engineering Affairs), and SKADP plans to assume this responsibility in the meantime.
9.            Agriculture Development. Due to the lack of trained staff and the actual paucity of
adapted technology, extension was largely confined to the distribution of modest quantities of seeds and
seedlings. It is only in 1993 (PY 5) that an on-farm testing program (not foreseen at appraisal) started,
while extension services were unified and reorganized, and a viable seed multiplication program
launched. The animal traction program of the Nuba Mountain Project, now closed, has been revived
by SKADP and is also expected to yield benefits. Good progress in those areas is visible during this
season, and these activities are expected to be sustainable.
10.           The reorganization of tractor services has brought only limited improvement in their
management, and it remains to be seen whether the joint company now envisaged to replace AMS can
be more effective. As envisaged at appraisal, 85 tractors have been bought by the Agricultural Bank,
but were diverted to other uses. Project management now hopes to reverse that situation.
11.           Animal health services have made commendable efforts to improve the coverage of
vaccination and treatments, as well as the sustainability of those services through the operation of a
revolving fund and the training of veterinary scouts. However, coverage is still limited, the revolving
fund is constantly eroded by inflation, and the service is not able to retain skilled staff.
12.    Physical Achievements. The project rehabilitated fully 11 wateryards (SAR estimate 133), and
desilted 5 small haffirs (SAR 80), but none of the large ones (SAR 10). Thirty-five km of roads have
been constructed (SAR 300). Some 70 t of improved cereal seeds were produced and distributed in
1993/1994 (SAR 300 t). The project bought 72 motor vehicles including 32 pickups, 10 trucks, 2
tipper lorries, a fuel tanker and a water tanker. Thirteen PMU staff attended short-term courses in
Khartoum in areas covering administration, computer use, procurement, vehicle maintenance and
laboratory techniques.  One officer is attending an MSc course in extension at the University of
Khartoum. Another 11 people attended short-term courses overseas in various disciplines including
project implementation, management, food security and laboratory techniques.
13.    Project Costs and Financing. Project costs (yet to be finalized) are expected to be in the
region of only US$ 16 million (SAR estimate US$ 40 million). Of this, IDA contributed US$ 12
million (agreement amount SDR 15 million or US$ 20 million). AfDB is estimated to have contributed
only US$ 3 million (agreed amount UA 13 million or US$ 15.6 million). The GOS has contributed
2



only US$ 0.4 million (SAR estimate US$ 4.5 million) while the project beneficiaries under the credit
component have contributed the equivalent of US$ 0.15 million. GOS contribution to the project has
been particularly low and raises the question of government commitment to the project.  IDA
disbur.ements were suspended in September 1993 while little has been disbursed from AfDB since.
14.   Majior constraints.  Apart form security conditions (and the related diversion of project
vehicles and tractors,, which have only improved since 1993, the major impediment to smooth
implementation has been the weakness of implementing agencies, largely due to low Government
funding and lack of staff (several of those have seen their staff numbers decreasing during that period),
and the inability of SKADP management to direct their activities towards agreed development
objectives.  Low counterpart funding of project activities has contributed to this situation.  These
difficulties are probably in turn a reflection of low central Government commitment, as well as of weak
SKADP management. Achievements were also affected by the slow rate of disbursements by AfDB,
due in particular to protracted communication problems during p. ocurement for the water supply
component. Finally, the suspension of disbursements by IDA has hampered recent PMU's efforts to
put the project back on track.
15.   Bank and Borrower Performance. Although IDA performance was creditable up to appraisal
stage, it slackened during implementation. Project supervision was inadequate with long intervals
between missions. Onl-. 7 missions visited the country after effectiveness, and only one visited the
project headquarters, citing insecurity problems.  However, till suspension, disbursements were
generally made in good time.
16.   GOS performance has also not been up to the required levels. The project was starved of funds
and althou gh management was weak, no decisive steps were made to change it until recently.
Furthermore, the diversion of project equipment by GOS operations undermined the physical
implementation of the project.
17.   Project Outcome. While project outcome must be rated as unsatisfactory at this stage, there is
a real possibility that this judgment may have to be revised over the 2-3 coming years as project
management improves and as the introduction of more productive varieties and of suitable animal
drawn implements can be expected to benefit a growing number of farmers.
Future Operations and Key Lessons Learned
18.   Faced with dwindling resources from external financiers, project management is intensifying its
efforts to promote cost recovery, to establish revolving funds for animal health and input supply, and to
mobilize local funding from rural and district councils as well as from the State Governments of South
and West Kordofan. There are plans for AMS to be run as a commercial operation by a joint stock
company, while the PMU intends to repossess, overhaul and redistribute to selected farmer groups the
tractors supplied by the project.
19.    Roads. SKADP plans to retain all equipment provided by the project for the maintenance of
existing and future planned roads, while it will continue to supervise the construction program as
planned in the SAR. The sharing of responsibilities between SKADP and the State Ministry of
Engineering Affairs remain to be defined.
20.   Water Supply. The national policy is to establish NRWC as a commercial company which
will contract its services to rural councils for the maintenance and rehabilitation of wateryards, while
the latter will be fully responsible for their management, including revenue collection. Given the
3



difficulty to raise water charges to full cost recovery, the possibility for rural councils .o finance more
than O&M costs is open to question.
21.    SKADP's future.  At the time when decentralization leaves local governments with the
responsibility to operate their own services, SKADP appears to be the only structure that has the
capability to plan and implement sound agricultural development programs.  There is clearly no
intention to disband the PMU, which is on the contrary expected to expand its role. Increased support
is expected from State authorities and cooperating agencies, and GOS has promised to continue funding
it. These arrangements, if followed through, would contribute to ensure the sustainability of most of
the project programs.
22.    However, the capacity of the PMU to meet the increased expectations depends not only on
continued funding, but also on more attractive national salary structures and incentives to retain
existing and recruit new competent staff.
23.    The lessons to be learned from project implementation include the following:
Attempts to implement a project under insecure conditions are likely to result in a squandering
of resources for meagre results;
An integrated approach to development should not mean that all directions should be pursued
simultaneously. It rather implies a coherent and explicit strategy, and the selection of the more
critical components for which the project may have a crucial impact;
The broad  strategy  needed  to  structure project activities should  be defined  before
implementation and be shared by the major actors, rather than to be expected as the result of
studies to be carried out during implementation.
As far as possible, a project should be implemented through existing line agencies. In the case
of this project, this arrangement worked relatively well, with the exception of the road
component;
Full cost recovery for wateryards appears too heavy for the resources of most farmers in the
project area. Careful site selection for best economic and environmental benefits as well as for
complementarity with alternative options, such as handpumps, should accompany a likely
recourse to public subsidies.
Next Steps
24.    On return to Rome, the mission will prepare a draft ICR to be forwarded to IDA by the end of
October 1994.
