Main Policy    This Development Policy Loan (DPL) i s designed to support the poverty reduction
Areas          efforts o fthe Government o f Panama inthe context o fthe global economic crisis. Two
               complementary policy areas are supported:
                   Mitigating the impact of economic shocks on the poor through improved targeting
                   and coverage o f social sector programs.

               0   Reducing economic risks o f a banlung crisis through enhanced risk management
                   and strengthened regulation and supervision.

Key Outcome    Mitigating the impact of economic shocks on thepoor through improved targeting and
Indicators     coverage of social sector programs.
(by March 31,      The real value o fmonthly conditional cash transfers, adjusted by the consumer
2010).             price index, has been maintained or increased for beneficiaries o f the CCT
                   program. (Baseline: B./ 35 per month, July 2008).
                   At least 2 new social programs are utilizing the Red de Oportunidades CCT
                   program database to identify poor beneficiaries. (Baseline: 3 programs using the
                   CCT database to target social spending, January 2009).
                   Enhancednutritional services to promote children's growth are being deliveredto
                   at least 75 percent of the beneficiaries of the basic package o f health services in
                   poor and isolated rural communities (Baseline: 0 percent, January 2009).
                   At least 60,000 additionalpersons inpoor and isolated rural communitiesare
                   receiving the new nutritional component o fhealth services package. (Baseline: 0,
                   January 2009)
                   Social investment expenditures defined as priorities by the Acuerdos de la
                   Concertacidn Nacional are fully executed as stated inthe 2009 Budget Law.

               Reducing economic risks of a banking crisis through enhanced risk management and
               strengthened regulation and supervision.
                   Consolidated supervision has been completed in at least half o f the financial
                   conglomerates as measured by assets. (Baseline: 0, January 2009).
                   All banks apply the new regulatory parameters for the use o f guarantees to cover
                   credit risk. (Baseline: 0, January 2009)
                   All banks are valuing their liquidityriskinline with Directive No. 4-2008
                   requirements and have submittedregular reports thereon to the Superintendency o f
                   Banks.

                0   All banks meet the minimum capital adequacy ratio calculated on a consolidated
I                   basis.    (Baseline: 0 percent, January 2009. Banks comply with the minimum
                    required capital adequacy ratio but not on a consolidated basis.)
                (Note: The full list o f outcome indicators can be found inTable 3).


Program         The DPL operation supports progress towards medium-term program outcomes related
Development     to three CPS objectives: (1) reducing poverty, especially among the rural poor and
Objectives  and indigenous groups through targeted social interventions; (2) improving health and
Contribution to nutrition outcomes through the expanded supply o f basic public services, and (3)
CPS             promoting broad-based economic growth by means o f supporting financial sector
                stability.


                (Table 2 highlightsthe CPS areas directly connected to the DPL Program).
Risksand Risk   The operation i s subject to two main risks:
Mitigation
                On the economic front, the main risk derives from the ongoing global crisis and more
                specifically, from the possibility o f a deep and prolonged global recession. Although
                Panama is not expected to fall into recession in 2009 and beyond, the current global
                situation i s anticipated to adversely impact growth as private sector credit contracts and
                foreign demand for Panamanian services, real estate, and exports weaken. Should the
                global slowdown be more protractedthan anticipated, ongoing financial sector reforms
                may be delayed.         Risks o f economic slowdown have been incorporated into the
                macroeconomic projection and the Bank and the Fund are maintaining an on-going
                dialogue with the authorities on macroeconomic policy issues. Incase o f unanticipated
                financial sector developments, both institutions would be available to provide
                consultation and support to the authorities as deemed appropriate.

                On the political and institutional front, the main risk relates to the government
                transition on 1July, 2009, which i s likely to involve changes within the civil service as
                the new government takes power. Under Panama's Constitution, the president may not

                                  I. INTRODUCTION

1.      This documentdescribes a DevelopmentPolicy Loan for US$80 millionto the
Republic of Panama. The operation supports the poverty reduction efforts o f the
Government o f Panama in the context o f the current global financial crisis and economic
slowdown. Specifically, it supports policy measures, which: (a) mitigate the impact o f
economic shocks on the poor through improved targeting and coverage of social sector
programs, and (b) help reduce the risk o f an economic and financial crisis through
enhanced banking sector risk management and strengthened banking regulation and
supervision. Maintenance o f financial sector stability is a necessary condition to poverty
reduction efforts as it is fundamental to sustained growth. Moreover, the costs o f financial
and economic instability tend to be borne disproportionately by the poor. The Protecting
the Poor under Global Uncertainty DPL also assists Panama by providing access to long-
term financing to support priority spending duringthe global financial crisis.

2.      Originallyenvisaged in the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY10, the
preparation of this DPL has been accelerated to FYO9 owing to the deteriorating
global economic environment and the need to protect the poor. Due to new
circumstances since the CPS was discussed by the Board on October 30, 2007, the
Government has requested that the Bank accelerate the preparation o f this DPL in order to
have it ready by the time that a new administration takes over on 1 July 2009. The
government is responding to the new challenges with policy actions to mitigate the impact
of the global economic crisis on the poor. The impacts of the deteriorating external
environment, the government response, and proposedWorld Bank support are described in
the following sections.

                               11.     COUNTRY CONTEXT

3.      Panama is an upper middle-incomecountry with a population of 3.3 million
and a per-capitaGNI of US$5,510(2007). About three-quarters o fthe population live in
urban areas, mostly around the Panama Canal. Less than 10percent o f the population i s o f
indigenous origin and primarily reside in remote rural areas, having little contact with
mainstream economic activities. Panama has traditionally been characterized as a dual
economy, consisting o f a dynamic services export sector that is very competitive at the
global level and a rigid, largely protected, low productivity domestic goods sector. The
international services sector, which accounts for three-fourths o f Panama's GDP and over
80 percent o f its total exports, rests on five main activities, comprising the operations o f
the Panama Canal, ports and logistics, tourism, re-exports o f the Colon Free Zone, and
financial intermediation.

4.      The economy has been expanding very fast in recent years with GDP growth
averaging8.8 percentper year in 2004-08, much higher than the historicaltrend and
the regionalaverage. Duringthese years, Panama reaped the benefits o f external growth
with a broad-based reform agenda that was initiated in the second half o f the 199Os,when


                                               1

trade barriers and price controls were largely dismantled.     In addition, a far-reaching
privatization program, anti-trust legislation agenda, and fiscal reforms coupled with
reducingthe level o fpublic debt to GDP allowed Panama to regain access to international
financial markets. The current Government continued the momentum o f this structural
reform agenda and placed a renewed emphasis on fiscal sustainability, transparency and
improved efficiency while, at the same time, exploiting the advantages o f Panama's open
trade and investment regime. In particular, the Government succeeded in moving ahead
with a project to expand the Panama Canal and is currently exploring a range o f other large
infrastructure projects. The canal expansion, planned for completion in 2014, is expected
to provide a basis for additional growth.

5.      A key development challenge facing Panama is to ensure that economic
stability and growth are maintained and that benefits are broadly shared. Indeed,
Panama's economic development has been characterized by a high degree o f inequality.
Growthhas traditionally benefited mainlythe capital-intensive service sectors concentrated
geographically in the Panama and Colon provinces, while generating little economic
opportunity for low-income members o f society. A large share o f the population (32
percent) continues to live in poverty, including about 15 percent in extreme poverty,
according to.the 2008 Living Standards Measurement Survey (LSMS).             With a Gini
coefficient o f 0.47, inequality o f consumption in Panama i s among the highest in the
region and the world, and considerably higher than the average for countries with similar
per-capita income levels. Social outcomes similarly exhibit a wide dispersion. In the
indigenous areas, for instance, chronic child malnutrition rates are as high as 56 percent
while the national average is 21 percent.

6.      To address this challenge, the current Administration introduced a flagship
program for reducing poverty and strengthenedsocial programs that provide basic
services to the poor. Launched in early-2006, the Red de Oportunidades (a conditional
cash transfer program) targets the poorest households with children aiming to improve
standards o f living and access to basic social services.   The conditional cash transfer
program currently covers all regions, includingindigenous areas. The government has also
strengthened programs that offer basic health services to the poor in rural and isolated
areas and scaled up and accelerated activities to improve the quality and access o f
educational services in indigenous areas. In the medium term, Panama will benefit from
increased fiscal transfers due to higher revenue from greater canal traffic due to the canal
expansion. This offers a unique opportunity for the country to ensure a broader sharing o f
economic benefits.

7.      Presidential elections are scheduled for May 2009.            Since the return to
democratic rule in 1989, two parties, the Partido Revolucionario Democratic0 (PRD) and
the Partido Punamefiista (PP), have alternated government leadership. The term o f the
current Tomjos administration (PRD), will expire on July 1,2009. With the conclusion o f
the last primary election in early September 2008, the main contenders for the presidential
elections on May 3, 2009 have been determined.          All the main candidates in the
presidential race support deepeningpoverty reduction efforts and are expected to maintain
Panama's current economic policy framework.

       111.     ECONOMIC CONTEXT AND MACROECONOMICOUTLOOK

A. EconomicContext

8.      Panama's economic growth acceleratedduringthe past four years, peakingat
a record rate of 11.5 percent in 2007, and has remained relatively robust at 9.2
percent in 2008. The economic boom was triggered by rapid improvements in the
external environment, coupled with an improved fiscal stance and banking system, both o f
which raised investor confidence and facilitated the transmission o f positive global
developments to the domestic economy (Figure 1). GDP growth was mainly drivenby the
internationally oriented service sector, accounting for some 80 percent o f GDP growth
since 2002, and, to some extent, a booming construction industry. Incontrast, the highly
protected agriculture and manufacturing sectors did not exhibit anywhere near the same
dynamism shown by the service sector.

9.      High growth in recent years has made some inroads in decreasing poverty
rates, but extreme poverty remains endemic in indigenousareas. Between 2003 and
2008, poverty fell from 36.8 to 32.0 percent, while extreme poverty was reduced from 16.6
to 14.5 percent.' Extreme poverty, however, remains almost universal among indigenous
groups (see Box 1). The intransigence o f poverty, particularly inrural areas, despite high
growth is explained by the fact that growth was driven primarily by the services sector,
which tends to employ relatively high-skilled individuals. The marked increase in food
prices in2007 and 2008 is likely to have affected the poor disproportionately as they spend
a larger share o f their income on food than the non-poor. It is also likely to have pushed
those that werejust above the poverty line into poverty.2


' According to the 2008 Living Standard Measurement Survey.           Poverty is measured by household
consumption.
 Recent Bank research is indicative o f this effect. For example, rising food prices during the period M a y
2007-May 2008 is estimated to have increased the headcount poverty rate in Honduras by 4.0 percentage
points and by 1.O percentage points inGuatemala (Demombynes et al., 2008).

                                       Box 1. Poverty and Inequality in Panama
Despite being a fast-growing upper-middle income country Panama has high levels o f poverty and inequality. Broadly
speaking, the population can be divided into three different socio-economic groups: those with access to the dynamic
services sector (urban residents), those who depend on less competitive, lower growth sectors like agriculture (rural
areas excluding the protected areas, or cornarcas) and those who are geographically isolated from modem economic
activity (indigenous people residing in cornarcas). Poverty is almost universal amongst comarca residents whose
consumption level is eight times lower that o f urban residents and four times less than rural dwellers.

About a third o f Panama's population is poor and one in every seven persons have insufficient resources to meet basic
nutritional needs (the extreme poor). The extraordinarily high growth rates since 2003 lead to reductions in poverty
and extreme poverty despite Panama's low poverty elasticity o f growth and the food price crisis o f 2008. Income
inequality (measured by the Gini coefficient, 48.5 in 2003) is among the highest in the region and the world, and
considerably higher than the average for countries with similar per-capita income levels. The Panama and Colon
provinces, where the Canal economy i s concentrated, account for more than eighty percent o f total output, but only
about 60 percent o f the population. The concentration o f the economic boom inthe service sector suggests that income
inequality inthe 2003-08 periodmay have increased.

There are also marked differences in social indicators across income, regions and ethnic groups and Panama tends to
lag behind in international comparisons in these areas. Primary school enrolment is universal in Panama and the
average years o f schooling have increased. Urban children, however, spend six years more in school compared to
children from indigenous families.      Similarly, 85 percent o f children from non-poor households are enrolled in
secondary schools, compared to only 32 percent o f the extremely poor youth. These disparities are also present in
health andnutrition outcomes and inaccess to health services. Child and maternal mortality rates in Panama are among
the highest inthe group o f upper-middle income countries in the region. Moreover, close to 21 percent o f children less
than five years are chronically malnourished - one o f the highest rates in countries with similar per capita income inthe
region. Inthe comarcas, the prevalence rate o f chronic malnutrition i s 56 percent - a rate comparable with that ofpost-
conflict countries such as Burundi. Similarly, in 2003, while about 84 percent o f non-poor children were immunized
against measles, only 74 percent o f poor children and 71 percent o f extremely poor received immunization. Finally,
while access to safe water is universal in the urban areas, one in five rural households (including the cornarcas) do not
have access to safe water. Halfof the rural population does not have access to adequate sanitary facilities compared to
close to 90 percent o f urbandwellers.

These results are not likely to be solely a result o f low social spending. Panama spends almost 17 percent o fits GDP in
the social sectors compared to 14percent inLatin America. This suggests that improvingthe targeting, efficiency and
effectiveness o f social spending is crucial if Panama is to achieve poverty reduction. Poverty reduction policies should
thus be formulated to reduce the depth o f poverty by targeting the extreme poor who reside primarily inthe indigenous
and rural areas. As explained elsewhere in this document, the Government o f Panama has made good progress in
expanding access to basic social services during the past five years, especially in the rural and indigenous areas. The
Protecting the Poor under Global Uncertainty DPL supports such policy measures recently adopted by the
Government.


10.        Panama also avoided the costs of foreign exchange volatility experienced by
other countries due to its special currency regime; the U S dollar has been the legal
tender since 1904. Nonetheless, while full dollarization eliminates foreign exchange risks,
it also means that there is no lendero f last resort or independent monetary policy functions
of a centralbank to buffer the economy's exposure to external shock^.^

11.        Panama's CPI inflation accelerated rapidly in 2007 and 2008, reaching levels
not seen since the oil price shocks of the 1970s and 1980s. Year-on-year CPI inflation

  The absence o f a central bank and the lender of last resort function expose Panama to bank runs, although
fiscal resources can b e used as means to partially backstop the banking sector.

 peaked at 10.0 percent in September 2008 driven by food and oil prices and strong
 aggregate demand. Food prices (accounting for a third of the consumer basket) rose by
 15.4 percent in the same month compared to 2.4 percent in January 2007. To address the
 higher cost o f living for the poor, the government took several measures, including:
 (i) increasing the size o f the conditional cash transfer in its Red de Oportunidades program
 (see Section IV); (ii)    reducingthe income tax o f low-income earners; and (iii)                  lowering the
 importtariffs on selected food and intermediateitems.

 12.       Public finances have strengthened remarkably in recent years as revenues
 surged and spendingwas kept under control. The nonfinancial public sector balance,
 excluding the Panama Canal Authority (PCA), turned from a deficit o f about 5 percent o f
 GDP in2004 into a surplus o f 0.4 percent of GDP in2008. This outcome was the result of
 a number o f factors including: (i)a tax reform package adopted by the Torrijos
 Administration in 2005, (ii)higher fiscal transfers from the PCA, (iii)containment o f
 current expenditures, including a reduction in the number o f public sector employees, (iv)
 more effective tax collection efforts, and (v) one-time events that boosted tax                        revenue^.^
 Improvements in the fiscal stance are notable, especially given the major increases in
 public investments which have risen from 3 percent o f GDP in 2005 to nearly 5 percent in
 2007, and to over 7 percent o f GDP in2008.

 13.      The positive fiscal results along with the strong economy have been reflected
 in a markedreductionin publicdebt (excl. PCA) from a peak of 62.2 percent of GDP

   One-time events explain approximately one percentage point of the increase inthe revenue-to-GDP ratio in
 2006 and 2007, including capital gains tax generated from the acquisition by HSBC (an international bank)
 o f Banistmo (a local bank) in 2006 as well as the tender for the duty-free concession at the Tocumen Airport
 in2007.

in 2004 to 37.6 percent of GDP in 2008. Prudent management o f public debt over the
past 3-4 years has resulted in a smooth redemptionprofile and a reduced need to rollover
short-term debt in the medium term. In 2008, the improved fiscal and debt position
contributed to a Standard & Poor's upgrade o f Panama's long-term foreign and local
currency ratings from BB to BB+, while Fitch affirmed Panama's rating at BB+ and
revised the rating outlook to positive. The Panama Canal Authority, which had originally
planned to raise financing from commercial markets by the amount o f US$2.3 billion for
the canal expansion project, decided to borrow exclusively from multilateral institutions
because o f the global financial crisis, including US$300 million from the International
Finance Corporation (IFC).

14.       On the external front, Panama's current account balance is estimated to have
reached a deficit of 12.1 percent of GDP in 2008 up from 4.9 percent in 2005. This
was the result o f two main factors: higher oil prices during 2008 and increased capital
goods imports associated with the canal expan~ion.~The current account deficit has been
financed by foreign direct investment-mainly in the financial, commerce and housing
sectors-averaging        more than 9 percent o f GDP annually since 2004.

B. MacroeconomicOutlook inthe Context of the Global Crisis

15.       The global economic crisis will likely lead to a significant slowdown in
Panama's services-export oriented economy. Although the direct effects o f the global
financial crisis have been modest to date and the financial system has remained stable,
Panama's economy has been negatively affected by the indirect impact in the form o f a
contraction in credit growth, reduced trade financing and a halt in new real estate
construction lending. Moreover, the global economic recession, particularly inthe United
States, i s leading to reduced demand for Panamanian trade-based economic services, real
estate, goods and tourism. The planned investment arising from the Panama Canal
expansion project currently underway is expected to provide a substantial fiscal stimulus
that will partially offset the negative impact, but overall economic uncertainty has
increased substantially.

16.       Credit growth is contracting with important effects on medium-term growth.
While Panamanian banks have so far only experienced limited capital losses as a result o f
the crisis, including low exposure to toxic assets, banks are currently hoarding liquidity
and exhibit strong caution in extending credit.6 Credit growth slowed substantially in the
last quarter o f 2008 (see Annex 2) and local businesses began to report difficulties in
accessing credit and the cancellation o f previously agreed credit lines. A.contraction o f
consumer credit i s also expectedto slow domestic demand. Moreover, banks have become
much more selective in extending supplier's credit, particularly in the Colon Free Zone
(CFZ), as declining export demand resulted ina 38 percent reduction innet CFZ re-exports
in 2008.      As banks focus credit on the larger clients with well-established business
relations in the CFZ, the small- and medium-scale business will have much more limited
access to credit.


  The Canal expansion project i s estimated to contribute around 2.5 percent o f GDP to the current account
deficit, according to the IMF (2008 Article IV Staff Report).
  Less than 0.1 percent o f total banking sector assets in Panama were linked to U S subprime mortgages and
troubled financial institutions, according to the Banking Superintendency.

17.      The real estate sector is expected to experience a slowdownduring2009 owing
to financingconstraintsandreducedforeign demand. The Panamanian housingmarket
has experienced a construction and price boom in recent years fuelled by growth in the
economy, access to credit, tax incentives, and strong foreign demand.'                      Construction
activity was growing at very highrates prior to the onset o f the U S financial crisis. Owing
to uncertainty in the strength o f future demand, most large banks have decided not to
finance new high-end projects, although they continue to finance ongoing projects8 The
growth rate inthe value o f construction and maintenance fell from 33.9 percent in2007 to
18.7 percent in 2008, according to the General Controller's office, including a 14 percent
decline for the fourth quarter. This trend i s expected to continue throughout 2009. There
are currently about 200 high-rise buildings with approximately 19,000 new apartments
under construction in Panama with a total project value of about US$4,300 million-only
62 percent o f which i s being financed. Half o f the apartments under construction have
already been pre-sold to Panamanian and foreign buyers. Lendingto the real estates sector
has been much more conservative in Panama, requiring a 30 percent down payment and
caps on property valuations. Nonetheless, while the real estate sector is unlikely to pose a
systemic risk for the financial sector in Panama (about 9 percent o f bank assets are in
housing loans and another 3 percent are in construction loans), declines in values may
impact a few local banks.           The excess supply o f housing units will exert downward
pressures on prices and construction activity will eventually wane as existing projects are
completed.      A subsequent rise in unemployment among construction workers is also
expected.'

18.      The liquiditypositionof the bankingsystem remains comfortable, on average,
although there is dispersionin liquidity ratios across banks. The liquidity position of

7 In 2004-07, the construction sector accounted for 4.4 percent of GDP, contributed by 6.3 percent to
economic growth and accounted for 5 1percent o f total fixed capital investment.
8 Construction activity for domestic low-income housing i s expected to continue, inpart buoyed by a US$50
million loan extended by IADB to the largest domestic bank, Banco General.
  Employment in the construction sector rose by close to 33,000 workers between 2004 and 2007,
representing around a quarter o f total jobs created over this period. The real estate market i s only one
segment o f the construction sector.

the InternationalBanking Sector (CBI) and the National Banking System (SBN) banks has
remained fairly stable over time, and has even increased in the fourth quarter of 2008 (see
Annex 2). Private Panamanian banks (which hold 45.8 percent of the national banking
system assets) are less liquid than foreign and public banks. The liquidity ratio (liquid
assets plus investments over total deposits) of this group fell from 50.5 percent in 2006 to
40.6 percent in 2008 (4th quarter figures) - including a slight increase relative to the third
quarter o f 2008.''         There are differences in liquidity ratios even within this group,
however. Foreign banks and the two public banks (Banco Nacional de Panama and Caja
de Ahorros) are the most liquidbanking groups, with 55.8 and 61.9 percent respectively,
andthey also registerednoticeableimprovements inthe final quarter of2008.

                                        Box 2. Panama's Financial Sector

Panama's financial sector is an important offshore financial and business center with financial intermediation
dominated by the banking sector-the largest inCentral America. As of mid-2008, there were 2 state-owned
banks; 43 general license banks, which can operate locally and internationally; 32 international license banks
that operate internationally, but can only participate in the domestic interbank market; and 14 licensed
representation-offices of foreign banks.       Banks that operate internationally form what is called the
International Banking Center (CBI), created with the Banking Law of 1970, which aimed at promoting the
physical establishment in Panama of prestigious international banks attracted by the country's absence of
capital controls, bilingual market, modem telecommunications system and dollarized economy. Banks that
operate in the local market, including the two public banks, form the National Banking System (SBN). The
consolidated assets of the banking system represent around 250 percent of Panama's GDP. Recent mergers
and acquisitions have increased the role of international conglomerates, such as HSBC and CitiBank, and the
share of bank assets owned by foreign banks is close to 60 percent. The net loan portfolio to assets ratio
stands at 60 percent. Domestic capital markets are comparable in terms of market capitalization to countries
of similar size. Financial intermediation services played an important role in Panama's recent economic
boom, contributing around 9 percent of 2007 GDP.

Panama's financial sector i s relatively well positioned going into this global financial crisis, thanks to
prudent policies, but the downside risks are high. Banking system soundness indicators were strong in 2008,
despite some liquidity ratio fluctuations due to the rapid consumer and housing lending growth. Maintenance
of high liquidity is critical for Panama's banking sector stability, even more so than in other countries,
because there i s no formal lender of last resort or deposit insurance. Asset quality was also relatively good
with non-performing loans constituting 1.4 percent of total loans and a ratio of provision to non-performing
loans of around 130 percent (see Annex 2). Credit growth has been relatively strong in recent years as the
economy has expanded with net credit growing around 18 percent in 2007. The recent consolidation of the
regional and domestic banking market also raises exposure to cross-border supervisory concerns, which may
require stronger collaboration and information-sharing among supervisors. Bank supervision exhibits a high
degree of compliance with the Base1 Core Principles reflecting generally satisfactory implementation
combined with an adequate legal and regulatory foundation (according to the 2006 FSSRA). Improvements
are needed in non-bank financial supervision, the institutional framework for insurance and securities, and
anti-money laundering practices. The Panamanian authorities recently made a request to the IMFto conduct
a Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP), which is planned to be carried out inFall 2009.



19.      The globaleconomic recessionis slowingshipping traffic through the Panama
Canal. Activity at the Panama Canal fell by 2.3 percent in 2008 owing to reduced trade
between Northeast Asia and the U S East Coast-the                    most important trade lane of the
Canal. Revenues from the Canal, however, increased by 12.5 percent due to increased



loNote that these are end-of-quarter liquidityfigures. The legal requirement for all banks i s based on weekly
data and includes liabilities and assets up to 186 days. For the banking system as a whole, the weekly
liquidity ratio has remained above 60 percent since the week of November 21, 2008, and was about 61
percent as o f the week o f March 17,2009. The weekly legal requiredliquidityratio i s 30 percent.



                                                       8

tolls. The ACP expects canal traffic to fall by a further 4 percent in 2009 and 3 percent in
2010. Despite expectations o freduced transits and no toll increases for 2009, the operating
surplus o f ACP (before transfers to the Government) i s expected to remain constant in
2009 owing to cost savings measures implemented in response to expected decline in
revenue growth. Container traffic growth at Panamanian ports i s also falling for related
reasons. The growth rate in container movement fell from 38 to 15 percent in the year to
November 2008.

20.     The Colon Free Zone (CFZ) and tourism sectors are slowing as Panama's
largest trading partners experience declining growth. Demand for CFZ re-exports is
contracting because some o f the free zone's larger regional clients, including Colombia
and Venezuela, have been hard hit by the global slowdown and lower commodity prices
(Figure 2). Moreover, Ecuador (in an attempt to deal with its mounting trade deficit)
recently introduced import tariffs which affect key CFZ re-exports. The free trade zone i s
also negatively affected by non-tariff barriers imposed by Colombia. In addition, tourism
revenue growth has fallen marginally, and i s expected to slow further as foreign consumers
cut back travel spending. Tourist arrivals from the United States, Colombia and Venezuela
remain Panama's most important sources o ftourism receipts.

21.     While the current account deficit is expected to remain relatively high,
peaking at 12.6 percent of GDP in 2010, this increase is primarily due to capital
imports by the canal expansion project, which are largely pre-financed with
multilateralloans. The external deficit will widen as exports o f goods andservice decline
in 2009-10 and capital imports associated with the canal expansion increase (peaking in
2010). This trend will reverse once the canal project nears completion in 2014 and the
effects o f the global downturn diminish. Excluding the impact o f the canal expansion, the
current account deficit is expected to remain relatively stable at around 6-7 percent o f GDP
over the next 4 years. In the unexpected event of financing shortfalls, the current account
balance will adjust through a reduction o f imports given that Panama is a fully dollarized
economy.

22.     Growthis expected to slow substantiallyover the comingyears, but Panamais
relatively better positioned to weather the crisis compared to most countries in the
region. Untilrecently, Panama was expected to grow around 8 percent in2009 and 2010
due to strong fundamentals and high public and private investment.             These growth
projections have been revised downwards on several occasions as global economic
prospects continued to deteriorate. While uncertainty over the growth trajectory is high,
conservative projections suggest that Panama will experience a decline in growth to 3
percent in2009 and rise slightly to 4 percent in2010. A number o f sectors that contributed
to the economic boom in prior years will likely experience substantial slowdowns,
including the construction sector, the Colon Free Zone and the Canal, and overall
unemployment will rise from the historically low current level. Nonetheless, the pre-
financed stimulus from the canal construction project (estimated to contribute around one
percentage point to GDP growth annually) will partially offset the impacts o f the sharply
deteriorating global environment. Growth i s projected to recover to 6 percent in 2011, as
the global economy recovers (see Table 1). Foreign direct investment i s expected to fall as
the sectors which have been driving past inflows contract, especially the housing and
financial sectors.



                                             9

23.       Despite global economic conditions and the forthcoming political transition,
Panama is expected to continue to pursue a sound medium term macroeconomic
policyframework. Onthe fiscal front, revenues are expected to slow due to lower growth
and the overall fiscal balance is projectedto move from a surplus o f 0.4 percent o f GDP in
2008 to a deficit about 1 percent in 2009. The projected deficit is consistent with the
recently approved Social and Fiscal Responsibility Law (SFRL), which allows for a
maximum deficit o f 1percent o f GDP, except under specified circumstances (see Box 3).
If fiscal revenues fall more than expected, the Government has the option of delaying
planned infrastructure investment (which has grown significantly in recent years) as a
means to adhere to the deficit ceiling without reducing social spending.                          The canal
investment project-which            lies outside the government investmentbudget-will provide a
combined `fiscal' stimulus o f about 9.2 percent of GDP in2009 and 2010 compared to 2.1
percent in 2008."         Inflation in 2009 i s expected to return to 2007 levels owing to falling
fuel and food prices.

                                 Box 3. The Social and Fiscal Responsibility Law

Panama's Social and Fiscal Responsibility Law (Law No. 34 o f June 5, 2008) became effective on January
1, 2009 thereby replacing the previous Fiscal Responsibility Law adopted inMay 2002. The law contains
important provisions to help increase fiscal stability and transparency.

A key feature o f the SFRL is a fiscal rule which imposes limits onthe NonfinancialPublic Sector (NFPS)
fiscal balance, excluding the PCA. Specifically, the NFPS deficit must not exceed 1percent o f the Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) inany given year. The Government, with the approval o f the NationalAssembly,
can only deviate from this rule under special circumstances, including: (1) natural disasters, (2) a national
state o f emergency, or; (3) if the country experiences an economic recession - defmed as a GDP growth
rate o f 1percent per year, or less. Insuch cases, the NFPS canreachno more than 3 percent o f GDP inthe
first year o f adjustment, 2 percent inthe second year, and, 1percent inthe third. The SFRL also stipulates
a target for the net debt o fthe NFPS o f 40 percent o f GDP by 2015.

The Law also contains important fiscal transparency provisions, such as clearer definitions to the
components o f fiscal accounts, and the requirements to prepare and publish the medium-term fiscal
framework, sector strategies, a multi-annual financial and public investment program, and periodic reports
on compliance with the Law, including a specific report on accounts payable.

The SFRL was approved after a series o f intensive consultations across a wide political spectrum - a
process initiatedas a part o fthe national dialogue for development. The World Bank and the IMFprovided
technical inputs to the drafting o f the Law. The SFRL was supported in the Competitiveness and Public
Financial Management DPLpresentedto the Board on 16 December 2008.



C. Debt Sustainability

24.       A debt sustainability analysis, prepared by the Bank in the context of the
proposedoperation, suggests that Panama'spublicdebt is on a sustainabletrajectory.
Inthe baseline scenario, thepublic-debt-to-GDPratio ofthe NFPS (excluding the Panama
Canal Authority, PCA) i s expected to fall from 45.7 percent in 2007 to 28.8 percent in
2013. The trajectory o f public debt (as a share o f GDP) i s declining even under the most

pessimistic alternative scenario.l2 These conclusions hold for most shocks, even when
including debt o f the Panama Canal Authority-which         i s not explicitly guaranteed by the
Central Government. This analysis uses the latest available macroeconomic projections (as
presented in table l),      which incorporate the expected impact o f the global financial
turbulence on the Panamanian economy and the recent downward revisions o f GDP
growth in the US. The limits on public deficits and debt introduced by the Social Fiscal
Responsibility Law are expected to further strengthen debt sustainability.

25.     Debt projections of the Bank are consistent with those of the IMF which
suggest that public debt falls to 33.7 percent of GDP in 2010 and to 26.4 percent by
2013. Even when usingthe broadest measure o f public debt (including the PCA), the M F
analysis finds that debt i s sustainable.    Thus, although Panama's growth outlook has
deteriorated, the country's overall macroeconomic framework i s consistent with the
government's development objectives.

26.     In sum, the Panamanian economy is entering a substantial downturn due to
the severe global economic crisis with significant risks to the near-term outlook.
Nonetheless, Panama's macroeconomic policy framework is deemed adequate for this
proposedWorld Bank development policy loan.


 IV.     THE GOVERNMENT'S PROGRAMAND KEY ISSUESINPROTECTING
                           THE POORUNDERGLOBAL UNCERTAINTY

27.     President Torrijos assumed office in September 2004 with a strong political
mandate that gave his party's coalition a majority in the Legislative Assembly. In
early 2005, the Government launched its ambitious medium-term development strategy
(see Box 4), which gives renewed attention to poverty reduction and reinvigorates the
structural reform program initiated during the 1990s. This comprehensive development
program encompasses policies aimed at reducing poverty and improving the income
distribution, fostering economic growth and employment creation, reorganizing public
finances, developinghuman capital, and modernizing the state.

28.     The Torrijos Administration has taken a range of reform steps which were
supported in prior DPL operations. Inthe context o f its strategic development plan, the
Government has taken some major steps to strengthen the overall foundations for sustained
broad-based economic growth, including the passage during 2005 o f the fiscal reform
package and the politically difficult pension reform, together with measures to increase
fiscal transparency, improve budget management and modernize public procurement.
These reforms were supported by the Bank through the Public Finance and Institutional
DPL (FY07) and the programmatic Competitiveness and Public Financial Management
DPL (FY08, FY09). The programmatic DPL also supported the complementary agenda o f
reforms so that Panama can take advantage o f recent Free Trade Agreements into which it
has entered, as well as a pendingU S Agreement awaiting the approval o f the U S Congress.

               Box 4. GOP StrategicVision of EconomicandEmploymentDevelopmentTowards 2009

 The Strategic Vision is comprised o f five pillars:
 Pillar I Reduce Poverty and Income Inequality encompasses four dimensions: stimulate growth and expand
           -
 employment opportunities, especially for youth; build human capital of the poor; pioneer a flagship conditional cash
 transfer program(Red de Oportunidudes) which brings together efforts to improve education, health, nutrition and basic
 infrastructure access, targeting the poorest areas; and invest inproductive activities in rural areas, including land tenure
 security
 Pillar I1 Foster Economic Growth and Employment focuses on efforts to open the economy to international
            -
 competition and promote export-led growth, including through free trade agreements, development o f export
 infrastructure (roads, ports, etc.), removal of distortions and unfair sector incentives, and targeted complementary
 investments in Canal expansion, irrigation, and urban transport.
 Pillar I11 ReformPublicFinance includes actions to reduce public debt, achieve fiscal sustainability and modernize
            -
 public financial management, including fiscal and pension reform, measures to improve the accuracy and transparency
 o f national accounting systems, modernization o f procurement and tax administration, and improvements in budget
 management.
 Pillar I V  - Develop Human Capital seeks to improve the competitiveness of Panama's labor force and reduce
 inequality through investments in education and health. Initiatives will support national curriculum reform, expanded
 coverage o f preschool and secondary education, effective worker training, preventative and occupational health
 programs, and expanded health, water, and sanitation infrastructure inrural and indigenous areas.
 PillarV Reformand Modernizethe State supports activities to help the public sector andpublic institutionsbecome
          -
 better facilitators o f countrywide development.       Measures will be taken to reduce corruption, improve private
 participation in infrastructure, increase competition inthe electricity and transport sectors, and foster decentralization o f
 service-delivery.


A. Mitigatingthe Impactof EconomicSlowdownon the Poor

29.       The economic slowdownis expected to have a negativeimpacton poverty. To
address this concern, the Government is harnessing its social safety nets and other social
programs to target assistance to the poor and vulnerable population. The economic
deceleration i s expected to lead to an overall rise in unemployment and a reduced rate o f
poverty reduction. Beyond potential short term effects, the coping mechanisms o f the
poor-including          distress sale o f productive assets, increased supply o f child labor, and
reduced health care take-up-are               often detrimental to their long-term livelihood prospects.
The government i s helping to mitigate the impact on the poor with social support
interventionsthat directly target the most vulnerable groups.

30.       In 2008, the Government took important steps to help mitigate the negative
impact of external shocks on Panama's poor population. The Panamanian authorities
adopted a three-pronged response to the external economic shocks which have buffeted the
poor since the economic slowdown began in 2008. First, social programs have been
strengthened through an increase in the size o f the conditional cash transfer to beneficiary
families o f the Red the Oportunidudes program and an improvement in the targeting o f
other social programs.                The use o f effective mechanisms to identify the poor and
vulnerable enables the government to better cushion them against negative impacts.
Second, the quality and coverage o f health and nutrition services to the extreme poor have
been strengthened.            Mechanisms to monitor and improve the nutritional status are o f
utmost importance during an economic slowdown. Third, the Government is committed to
maintaining levels o f social spending during the economic deceleration. This i s important,
because such spending i s typically vulnerable to budget cuts when fiscal pressures arise in
a downturn.




                                                            12

Harnessing Social Programs to Respond to the Crisis

31.       The amount of the conditionalcash transfer program(Red de Oportunidades)
to beneficiaryfamilies has been increased. As a part o f its response to the global food
price crisis in mid-2008, the Government effectively harnessed the conditional cash
transfer (CCT) program to mitigate the impact on the poorest households in the country,
thereby helping them to protect their human and productive capital (See Box 5).                                        The
monthly transfer amount was increased from B./35 to B./50 for all beneficiaries and no
additional conditions were i m p ~ s e d . ' ~

                     Box 5. Red de Oportunidades-the Government's Flagship Poverty Program

In early 2006, the Government launched the Red de Oportunidades (RdO), a program targeted to extreme poor and
vulnerable households with children in Panama and aiming to improve their living standards and their access to basic
social services. The multi-sectoral Red de Oportunidades program seeks to lower both demand and supply barriers
impeding access to basic social services. The program involves five main elements: (a) a conditional cash transfer
program, (b) supply of basic services linked to co-responsibilities (education, health and legal identification of
beneficiaries), (c) support to beneficiary families to boost their demand for these services, (d) rural infrastructure(public
works, housing, agriculturaldevelopment), and (e) programmanagement, monitoring and evaluation. The CCT program
aims not only at transferringresourcesto the mostvulnerablesections of the population but also at breakingthe cycle of
povertyby linking these transfers to investmentsinthe educationandhealthof the childrenofthe beneficiaryfamilies.

As highlighted in the Panama Poverty Assessment (2007), the relatively high levels poverty in Panama are not due to
lack of social spending, but rather to inadequate targeting, efficiency and effectiveness of government programs. The
creation and subsequent expansion of the RdO is an important step forward in this respect. The program is very well
targeted, currentlycovering 367,378 people (1 1 percent of the population). This effectiveway of targetingbeneficiaries
i s a result of the combined use of regional targeting and the application of a Proxy-Means Test to estimate the
vulnerability and eligibility of households, differentiating between urban, rural, and indigenous areas. In fact, other
social programs are increasingly making use of the householdregistry and management information system developed
for the CCTprogramto reachtheir beneficiaries.

Over the past two years, the Government of Panamahas progressivelyexpanded the Red de Oportunidadesto cover all
regions and indigenous areas. A comprehensivestrategy to improve the effectiveness of the conditional cash transfers
intervention has also been implemented. This strategy provides the RdO management team with adequate tools and
mechanismsto target the poorest groups, ensure timely paymentsof transfers, verify compliancewith co-responsibilities
inhealthhutritionandeducationandsupport families to take advantageofthe programandother social services.

The IADB andthe World Bankhave helped developthe RdO andwill support the implementationof components(b), (c)
and (e) with two operations. The GOP is fully funding the cash transfers (component a) with its own resources. Before
the increasein the transfer amount, the cost ofthe programwas estimatedat US$207million over a seven year period, of
which US$162 would be financed by the GOP, US$21 million by the IADB and the remaining US$24 by the World
Bank.


32.       The Government has used the household registry and management
informationsystem, originally developedfor the CCT program, to improvetargeting
of other social programs. TheRed de Oportunidades program and its householdregistry
and management information system are useful tools that can be deployedintimes of crisis
to scale up transfers, channel additional programs, identify additional beneficiaries, reach
the poorest, and diagnose areas with the most pressingneeds. Even in a non-crisis context,
the registry of beneficiary families and other vulnerable families has already been used by
other social programs to identify beneficiaries, thereby improving targeting efficiency.
The social programs that currently use this targeting mechanism to identify beneficiaries
include: (a) income generating activities for disabled people; (b) agricultural training
programs executed by INADEH; (c) a housingimprovement program for the poor.



l3 The real value o f the original transfer amount had fallen by around B./5 since 2006.



                                                             13

Improving quality and coverageof health and nutrition services to the extremepoor

33.      The Government has included a comprehensive nutrition component in its
packageof basic healthservices deliveredto poor andisolatedcommunities,as a part
of a new nationalplan to combat child malnutrition. The Ministry o f Health and the
NationalNutrition Secretariat (SENAPAN) have published a new National Planto Combat
Child Malnutrition (2008-15). A key action o f the Plan i s the inclusion o f an integrated
package o f nutritional services in the basic package o f preventive and promotion health
services (Paquete de Atencion Integral de Sewicios de Salud, PAISS) provided by the
Coverage Extension Strategy, Estrategia de Extensidn de Cobertura (EEC).14 This health
package i s currently being offered, through mobile teams o f health providers, to poor and
isolated rural communities without access to a health facility.                  Previously, the health
package included only a few nutrition services. With the new national plan, nutrition
services will include growth promotion and monitoring at the community level following a
strategy known as AIN-C (Atencidn Integral a la Niiiez en la Comunidaq. This strategy
has been successful in significantly improving the nutritional status o f children in other
countries, including Honduras and Madagascar. The strategy is very useful in times o f
economic downturns, and functions as an early warning system, through its monitoring o f
children's growth.

34.      The Ministry of Health has expanded the geographicalcoverage of the health
service package deliveredin isolated and poor areas through a more comprehensive
inclusionof previouslyunderserved areas. The targeting mechanism of the Estrategia
de Extensidn de Cobertura (EEC) program has been improved. Previously, the program
targeted communities that were more than one hour away from any health facility and that
were also classified as poor. However, since some health centers do not have all the
required personnel, the criteria have been changed. Now the package o f services will be
expanded to communities that are more than one hour away from a health center that has,
at a minimum, one doctor and one nurse. Inthe indigenous areas (Comarcas), the Ministry
o f Health proceeded to identify the communities where the package will now be offered
and to assign a provider to each o f the newly identified communities. As consequence, it
i s estimated that an additional 60,000 people in the Comarcas will benefit from this health
care service. In 2008, more than 400,000 families benefitted from the health package in
rural areas, including the indigenous Comarcas.

Maintain levels of socialprotection spending during economic downturns

35.      The NationalAssembly has approved legislationto implementtheAcuerdos de
la Concertacidn Nacional, which sets goals for key social expenditures. In 2006, the
Government initiated a national dialogue around priorities for the country and its
development agenda. The objective o f this dialogue was to improve equity and reduce
poverty inPanama. The outcome o f the process i s summarized inthe document Acuerdos
de la Concertacidn Nacionalpara el Desarrollo o f October 2007. Representatives from a
broad range o f social, political, religious, professional, and social organizations
participated inthis process and endorsed the agreement^.'^ The financing o f activities and
programs stipulated in the Agreement i s expected to come partly from the increased fiscal


14 The EEC i s offered in coordination with the CCT program to ensure that its beneficiaries can comply with
the health co-responsibilities.

revenues arising from the Panama Canal expansion. The Government has taken several
steps to translate these broad agreements into policies and programs. It has created a legal
framework for their implementation that includes:


a     Law 20, which creates mechanisms to verify and monitor the agreements and
      objectivesof the Concertacidn Nacional. The Law establishes the legal basis for the
      National Council for the National Development Dialogue, the Presidential Secretary o f
      Goals and the Social Cabinet. The Council and the Secretary are responsible for
      verifying the implementation and goals o f the Concertacidn Nacional, while the
      Social Cabinet is responsible for the coordination o f all social agencies in the
      implementationo f the Agreements.


a     Social and Fiscal ResponsibilityLaw (Law No. 34). The Law intends to ensure that
      fiscal accounts remain under control, as described inBox 3.

a     The 2009 BudgetLaw (Law No. 69). The budget law ensures spending inthe social
      sectors prioritized by the Agreements: education, health, and social protection. In
      addition, in anticipation o f a potential economic slowdown, the 2009 budget has
      allocated sufficient resources to ensure the continuity of the Red de Oportunidades in
      its current form, and to expand the program, if necessary, both in the transfer amount
      and inthe scope of its beneficiaries.

B. PromotingFinancialStability

36.      Maintenanceof financial sector stability is a necessarycondition for economic
growth and poverty reduction. As current international circumstances demonstrate,
financial sector instability and the ensuing possibility o f a collapse inbank credit may lead
to lower consumer spending and investment, and, hence, to slower economic growth, loss
o f jobs, and increases in poverty.               The policy measures taken by the Panamanian
authorities to strengthen the financial sector will contribute to ensure the solvency and
liquidityo fthe banks andhence to maintaincredit flows.

37.      The Government has taken important measures to mitigate the impact of the
global financial crisis on Panama's banking sector. The Panamanian authorities have
adopted a two-pronged approach to ensure banking sector stability. First, the national
regulatory and supervisory framework i s being strengthened, moving toward a risk-based
consolidated supervision approach. Second, regulations have been issued to protect the
solvency and liquidity o fbanks.

38.      A new Banking Law has been enacted that strengthens financial sector
regulation and supervision on a consolidated basis.                        The National Assembly has




15 Many o f these agreements relate to the social sectors, including: (i) into effect the implementation of
                                                                         put
the free education law from pre-school to middle school; (ii) into effect the implementation o f the
                                                                   put
obligatory middle school education; (iii)  update curricular content; (iv) increase and target the coverage o f
initial education in indigenous, rural, and urban-marginal areas; (v) improve access and quality of health
services, particularly in rural areas; and (vi) guarantee the conditional cash transfers to families in extreme
poverty.

approved a revised version o f the 1998 Banking Law.I6 The new law contains all the
relevant elements of a modern banking law. The law was changed in response to the
challenges posedby the increased integration o f Panama's financial sector to the rest o f the
region, particularly to Central America, and the need to comply with international best
practice. The effects o f the new law are therefore long term in nature. While the goal is
long-term stability, some o f the new provisions in the law will allow Panama to better
respond to the challenges from the international financial crisis and help boost confidence
in the banking sector. The subsequent paragraphs highlight some of the most important
provisions o f the 2008 Banking Law.

39.     The regulatoryand supervisorypower of the Superintendency of Banks(SBP)
has beenextendedto supervise and regulatefinancialconglomerates.The International
Banking Center (CBI) includes operations o f foreign bank subsidiaries with headquarters
in Panama. The extension of banking regulation and supervision to the operations o f
foreign and local conglomerates was therefore necessary to adequately monitor and
manage risks. The new law broadens the reach o f the regulation and supervision activities
o f the SBP to cover all entities that are part o f a bankinggroup, including financial as well
as non-bank and non-financial associates.           This follows the concept o f consolidated
regulation and supervision o f all the activities that pose a risk to third party resources
managed by banks.           The law allows the SBP to sign agreements for consolidated
supervision with foreign supervisory agents. It also expands the SBP supervisory and
regulatory powers to cooperatives and savings and loans associations.

40.     Capital requirement provisions of banks have been strengthened to ensure
that banks hold capital reserves appropriate to their risk exposure. The new law
strengthens the capital adequacy framework on a consolidated basis and authorizes the
SBP to require corrective measures if the capital adequacy ratio (CAR) o f a bank falls
below the minimum regulatory requirement. The law stipulates that the CAR cannot fall
below 8 percent o f the total weighted assets and off-balance sheet operations that represent
an irrevocable contingency, weighted in proportion to their risks, and that the total CAR
will be calculated on a group basis. The law allows the SBP to modify the ratio, if
required, given the risk profile o f a bank, and to include other risks (market, operational
and country risk) in the valuation o f the capital requirement. The C A R is extended to
banks with international licenses over which the SBP is the supervisor o f origin.

41.     Auditing standards have been improved thus giving the SBP a better
understanding of the impact of the international financial crisis on Panamanian
banks. The law strengthens external auditing standards by requiring compliance with
accounting norms approved by the SBP.                   Auditors must provide their opinion
independently o f whether the financial statements provide a true and reasonable
description o f the banks' situation and financial performance. The SBP has the authority
to reject the hiring o f external auditors that fail to meet standards o f independence and



16The 1998 Banking Law had created the Superintendency o f Banks o f Panama (SBP) as a state organization
independent o f the political sphere, and supported a regulatory framework consistent with the main
recommendations o f the Basel Committee. Evaluations made in 2001 and 2005 concluded that Panama was
incompliance with 23 out of 25 Basel Core Principles as well as with the recommendations of the Global
Financial Action Group (GAFI) about compliance with the 40 + 9 recommendations against money
laundering and terrorism financing.

experience as well as reject audit reports that have not been elaborated according to the
law.

42.     New proceduresfor addressingtroubled banks (includingreorganization and
liquidation) have been introduced. A clear and effective bank resolution mechanism is
crucial to allow the SBP to minimize the cost and time involved in resolving troubled
banks, to reduce the possibility that a bank failure may affect other banks in the system
negatively, and to boost confidence in the financial sector.           Such a mechanism i s
particularly relevant in the current environment o f increased financial sector risks. The
new procedures range from taking preemptive corrective measures, taking administrative
and operational control o f a bank, to reorganization and/or liquidation o f a bank.

43.     The new law strengthens the SBP institutionally and improves the legal
protection of its officials. The SBP has been granted more autonomy to administer its
human and financial resources and the career o f Bank Supervisor has been created as a
specialized profession with professional standards and clear rights and obligations. Legal
and institutional protection for the Superintendent o f Banks and members o f the Board in
the exercise o f their functions has also been established. This includes preventingthese
decision makers from being fired inthe event o f a legal suit against them until the case has
been decided, and the assumption by the SBP o f the legal expenses incurred in defending
the officials from legal charges against them. This provision allows the SBP to take the
required measures to protect the solvency o f the banking system unencumbered by the
threat o f legal action from affected parties.

44.     Aside from the approval of a new Banking Law, the SBP has issued several
important regulationsto protect the liquidity and solvency of the financialsystem in
the contextofthe globalfinancialcrisis. These regulationsinclude:

     Valuation of collateral to cover credit risk.          Directive No. 2-2008 establishes
    parameters and basic general guidelines regarding the uptake o f collateral for
    mitigating credit risk. The norm establishes collateral valuation procedures taking into
    account the cash value o f the collateral and the bank's ability to liquidate it to ensure
    that the collateral i s and continues to be highlyrealizable.

    Liquidily management. Directive No. 4-2008 stipulates new conditions regarding the
    banks' policies, procedures and control systems needed for an effective management
    o f liquidity risk and compliance with liquidity requirements. The n o m establishes the
    responsibilities o f the boards o f directors to set up policies and strategies for the daily
    management o f liquidity, to oversee the actions o f the general manager's office with
    respect to liquidity management, and to establish contingency plans to manage
    potential liquidity needs.      The norm also requires that banks have liquidity risk
    assessment manuals with policies and procedures for the valuation o f the liquidityrisk
    adequate to the structure and complexity o f their operations. The norm establishes the
    minimumo f 30 percent weekly legal liquidity requirement that most banks must keep
    at all times and o f 20 percent for those banks that keep an interbank deposit quarterly




                                               17

     greater than 80 percent o f their total deposits." The norm establishes which assets and
     debentures are accepted as liquidassets.

      Capital standardsfor credit risk. Directive No. 5-2008 establishes the criteria for the
     calculation o f the CAR on a consolidated basis in accordance to the new Banking
     Law.      The norm defines the main elements that have to be considered for the
     calculation of primary and secondary capital and the deductions that apply. It also
     updates the general criteria for asset risk classification and the risk weights applied to
     each category.

45.      The authorities have taken temporary measures to reduce the negative impact
of extraordinary global financial volatility on bank's equity position. Securities held
by banks under the `available-for-sale' category are reported at fair value (current market
price for the instrument, or similar) and thus the value o f these securities are affected by
price fluctuations. `Held-to-maturity' securities, in contrast, are reported at amortized cost
and are not affected by market fluctuations. The loss o f asset values during the current
financial crisis i s likely to have reduced the value o f banks' investments under the
`available for sale' category, with negative effects on their equity position. Directive No.
8-2008 stipulates that the SBP may allow some investment instruments currently held as
`available-for-sale' securities to be transferred, at a bank's request, to the `held-to-
maturity' securities category.          These securities include: (a) obligations issued by the
Panamanian state; (b) Treasury Bills and Notes o f the USA; and (c) sovereign debt
obligations o f Latin American governments.                The provisions o f this Directive follow
similar measures inthe United States and the European Union.'*

46.      The government has announced the creation of a US$1.1 billion fund
(Prograrna deEstirnulo Financiera, PEF) to help facilitate credit expansion and foster
economic growth.            The program aims to offer banks access to medium-term credit in
order for them to increase their lending activities to productive sectors. While the details
o f the fund remain to be determined (such as interest rate and maturity of credits) the
sources o f the fund are the Andean Development Corporation (CAF, US$210million), the
Inter-American Development Bank (IDB, US$500 million), and the National Bank o f
Panama (BNP, $400 million), which will also act as the fund's manager. Given that local
banks remain well capitalized, the government has stressed that the PEF would not
constitute a program o f subsidies, bank liquidity support, or financial rescue, but rather
would be a preventive measure to counteract the negative impact of the global economic
recession on the Panamanian economy. To facilitate the fund's usage, the authorities will

17 For the banking system as a whole the actual liquidity ratio was about 61 percent for the week o f March
17, 2009.
  The United States has taken a similar provision under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act o f 2008
which gives the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) the authority to suspend the application o f the
accounting regulation (FAS 157) o n fair value measurements if the SEC determines that this i s in the public
interest and protects investors.   Although mark-to-market accounting generally gives an accurate picture o f
the market value o f assets, it may sometimes give a misleading picture of a bank's viability if the asset is not
expected to be sold in the near-term or ifmarkets are extremely volatile. A risk inallowing banks to transfer
assets from one category to another is that banks may switch assets back and forth between categories to
meet regulatory requirements and mask l o w capital adequacy ratios. However, the risks o f this measure are
mitigated in Panama by the fact that only sovereign debt obligations can be transferred from the `available-
for-sale' to the `held-to-maturity' categories, and that the transferred securities have to be accounted at
market value as part o f liquid assets.

need to develop transparent operational details for disbursement as well as a mechanism to
monitor the program's success.


                              V.     THE PROPOSEDLOAN

A. Link to the CountryPartnershipStrategy

47.     The proposed DPL supports poverty reduction and economic stability policy
objectives of the Panama Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 2008-2010. The CPS
aims to provide selective, demand driven, technical, financial, analytical and capacity
building assistance that deepens the Panama-World Bank partnership in support o f four
objectives which are aligned with the pillars and goals o f Panama's 2004-2009 Strategic
Vision (Table 3). The CPS lending envelope o f $390-465 million over FY08-10 aims at a
balanced program with about half o f new lending to be channeled through Development
Policy Loans, and the remainder devoted to poverty-focused investment projects and a
policy reform TA loan.        This DPL for US$80 million was originally envisaged for
FY2010; however, preparation o f the DPL has been accelerated to FY09 due to the
deteriorating global economic environment and the urgent need for the government to
respond to mitigate the adverse impact on the poor.

B. LoanDesign

48.     The Protecting the Poor Under Global Uncertainty DPL is designed to support
the implementationof the Government's medium-termdevelopment strategy and is
part of the Bank's multi-year engagement with Panama. The primary development
objective o f the DPL i s to support government's efforts to protect the poor and buttress the
financial system in the context o f the current global financial crisis and economic
slowdown. The government has taken actions to improve targeting and coverage o f social
sector programs, including health and nutrition, as well as measures to ensure that
spendinginthese areas are prioritized inthe nationalbudget. The proposed operation also
supports selective and critical actions in maintaining economic and financial stability.
Government actions inthis area contribute to continued macroeconomic stability, which is
a foundation for sustained economic growth and poverty reduction. Areas supported by
the DPL form an integral part o fthe Government's economic and social development plan,
the Bank's Country Partnership Strategy, and complement the actions supported in the
prior Competitiveness and Financial Management DPL series. Table 2 shows the CPS
program objectives and the selected programs supported by the Bank, including this
operation (marked in bold) as well as areas supported by the prior D P L series. This
operation supports near-term objectives that could be attained by March, 31,2010.

49.     The proposed operation has strong links with other Bank investment
operations,particularlyin the social sector. The Bank has provided technical assistance
and financial support to Red de Oportunidades through the Panama Social Protection
Project, PSPP, (US$24 million, FY07) as well as the health sector through the Health
Equity and Performance Improvement Project, HEPI, (US$40 million, FY09).                   The
monetary transfers o f the CCT program are financed by the Government's own resources,
while the Bank provides support to the program's management information system and to
the supply o f social services linked to co-responsibilities, particularly health and nutrition



                                              19

services in the indigenous areas. The HEPI project complements these efforts through
financial support to the provision o f a basic package o f health and nutrition services in
poor and isolated rural areas outside the indigenous areas. Finally, the Bank i s preparing
anAccess to Finance Project for Panama inFY10. Access to financial services (including
payments, savings, credit and possibly insurance) represent the intersection o f the two
areas supported inthis DPL.

50.    The DPL supports policy actions to mitigate the impact of economic shocks
on the poor through improvedtargeting and coverage of social sector programs as
well as measures to enhance financial market stability. The policy actions involve
expanding benefits o f the CCT program, improving targeting o f social programs,
increasing access o f the extreme poor to health and nutrition services, protecting social
spending and enhancing financial sector risk management and banking supervision and
regulation. Areas o f support and expected results are identified in the policy matrix in
Table 3.

51.     The social sector policy actions supportedby this operationwill contributeto
the mediumterm outcomes of the First and FourthPillar of the CPS. The effects o f
an economic deceleration on the poorest and most vulnerable sections o f the population
can result inhigher poverty and increased prevalence o f malnutrition. The actions taken
by the Panamanian authorities to increase the benefits o f the conditional cash transfer
program and harness its beneficiary registry and information system to target other social
programs aim to mitigate this impact. The adoption o f the AIN-C strategy o f growth
promotion and monitoring seeks to reduce the negative effect o f lower economic activity
on child malnutrition and contribute to the more general goal o f reducing Panama's
currently high levels o f malnutrition, particularly in the indigenous areas. Similarly, the
expansion in the number o f beneficiary communities o f the EEC aims at increasing the
poor's access to health services. Finally, by puttinginplace the mechanisms that would
implement the National Dialogue Agreements, the Government is helping to ensure the
achievement o f these Agreements' social expenditure goals. Byprioritizing and targeting
social expenditure on health, education, and social protection, the Government intends to
avoid any reduction in human capital investments during the expected economic
slowdown.

52.     The financial sector policy actions supported by this operation will
contribute to the medium term outcomes of the Second Pillar of the CPS. The
proposed DPL supports a number o f policy actions adopted by the Panamanian
authorities to ensure financial sector and economic stability at a time o f international
financial turmoil. The policy actions involve strengthening regulation and supervision o f
the banking sector moving towards a risk-based consolidated supervisory approach,
regulations issued to protect the solvency and liquidity o f banks, and enhanced
monitoring efforts by the regulatory authority.

53.     The indicative outcome indicators of the policy actions to strengthen the
financial sector have been established taking into account that some of the
regulatory and supervisory reforms will take some time to be fully implemented.
For example, the full implementationo f the risk-based consolidated supervision approach
will require time for the SBP to: (i) the members o f the financial conglomerates,
                                      identify
(ii)elaborate a new manual o f risk-based consolidated supervision that will allow the
SBP to evaluate and follow up on the financial and non-financial risks that apply to the
supervised entities, (iii)elaborate risk profiles for the supervised entities, and, (iv) carry
out the in-situ supervision o f the entities involved.       The banks also need time to
implement the new risk management and liquidity management norms and provide the
SBP with the required information. While fully implementing enhanced regulatory and




                                             23

supervisory reforms may take time, the current capacity and authority o f the SBP i s
adequate to intervene and address potential bank concerns should they arise.

54.       The DPL operation is also expected to help Panama obtain stable financing
for itspublicborrowingsand diversifyoptions for finance. Indeed, while Panama i s a
creditworthy country with access to world capital markets under normal circumstances,
the current global financial crisis has increased the cost o f and constrained access to
finance. IBRDfinancing, therefore, would help Panama maintain adequate financing for
poverty reduction efforts and other public services.

55.       Analytical Underpinnings. The actions supported by the DPL have been
assessed through analytical work o f the Bank and the IMF. The substantial body o f
analytical work has provided the basis for an in-depthdialogue with the government and
has supported the design o f the DPL. Table 4 shows the links between the prior actions
included inthe DPL and the recommendations included inrecent analytical work.

C. Collaboration with the IMF,Other Bank Operations, and Other Donors

56.      The Bank's country team has been collaborating very closely with the IMF.19
This cooperation includes the review o f macroeconomic developments (Annex 3) and
Reports on the Observance o f Standards and Codes (ROSC). Most recently, the Fund
collaborated with the Bank in the preparation o f two Policy Notes on inflation and the
financial sector.         The proposed DPL program is consistent with IMF policy advice
regarding financial sector supervision and public debt management. In fact, the IMF
provided technical assistance to the Government o f Panama in the preparation o f the
revisedBanking Law.

57.     Comprehensivemultilateralassistance for Panamahas been providedby the
IADB, the Bank and the UNDP, followed by more modest and targeted support
from bilateralaid agencies. Interms o f lending and technical assistance operations, the
Bank and the IADB are supporting several complementary areas o f the Government's
development strategy. Ingeneral, as part o f the consultations for preparation o f the CPS,
the Bank and IADBwent through the CPS program to identify areas o f potential synergy
and agreed on collaboration approaches inboth lending andnon-lending activities.


D.LessonsLearnedfromPriorDPLsinPanama


58.     Three main lessons from the Competitiveness and Public Financial Management
DPL are relevant and have been incorporated into the design o f the Protecting the Poor
under Global Uncertainty DPL. These include:


0   Previous DPL operations in Panama successfully incorporated lessons from
    adjustment loans extended to Panama during the 1990s and best practice for
    well performing middle income countries. This included (a) emphasis on upfront
    actions instead o f ex-ante conditionality, and (b) support o f a reform program rather
    than isolatedconditionalities.

0   Ownership of reform is criticalfor a successful outcome. This suggestion is not
    novel, but nevertheless deserves emphasis as it is well-illustrated by previous
    operations. The satisfactory outcome o f previous DPLs is to a large extent a
    consequence o f exclusively supporting government-led initiatives. The legal and
    regulatory framework underpinning reform was initiated and developed by the
    Administration itself, with technical input from the Bank. The government made
    substantial progress also in areas that were not monitored by the Bank.            DPL
    objectives were strategically aligned with the government strategy (procurement
    reform i s a good example). Inthe public financial management components, the core
    DPL objectives were linked to the Government's reform and strategy. Two critical
    entities, the Ministry o f Finance and General Controller's Office, shared the same
    objectives to strengthen fiscal transparency, and coordinated their complementary
    efforts to their pursuit.

0   Strong analytical underpinningsand links to Bank investment lending provide
    the foundation for a well-designeddevelopmentpolicy operation. The key pieces
    o f Economic and Sector Work (ESW),            the PER and the Country Financial
    Accountability and Procurement Assessment Report ( C F M C P A R ) contributed not only
    to the design o f the previous DPL operations, but also helped inform the reform
    efforts o f Government and supported a fruitful policy dialogue.


59.     The lessons learned through the Bank's previous engagement in Panama, as well
as the latest thinking on Development Policy Lendingfor well performing middle income
countries (see Box 6), have influenced the design o f this DPL.




                                             26

                                      Box 6. Good PracticePrincipleson DPLs

             Principle 1: Reinforce Ownership. The operation is based on the GOP's medium-term development
  strategy, Strategic Vision of Economic and Employment Development Toward 2009, which results from Panama's
  engagement ofdemocratic processesinthe developmentofpublic policy. The DPL, as part of the CPS, respondsto a
  GOP requestto support Panamaduring the financialturmoil and global economic slowdown. The operationsupports
  specific programs and areas which reflect the outcome of the nationalpolicymaking processes. The administration
  has a good track record o f policy implementationas attestedby the passage of a fiscal reform package, a politically
  difficult pension reform, and modem legislation for public procurement and fiscal responsibility. The process
  developed with the GOP to select the focused areas of DPL support responds, in large part, to the strong policy
  dialogueundertakenrecentlyaround extensiveanalyticwork.
             Principle 2: Agree up front with the government and other financial partners on a coordinated
  accountability framework The Bank's support is summarizedin a brief and focused policy matrix, agreed with the
  GOP, which provides the accountability framework for the operation. The DPL is consistent with IMF's policy
  advice.
             Principle 3: Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country
  circumstances. The MEF has indicated that it intends to fill its multilateral `budget support' needs through the
  proposedDPL operation, complementingthe investment lendingportfolio of other donors and the Bank The selected
  policy areas covered by the DPL program are derived from the GOP's medium-term development strategy.
  Accordingly, the specific actions and intendedoutcomes also enjoy technicaland political support in their respective
  sectors. The relevanceand soundnessof said actions havebeenassessedthroughBank analyticalwork and follow-up
  activities.
             Principle4: Choose only actions criticalfor achieving results as conditionsfor disbursement. The prior
  actions form part of an agreedaccountabilityframework that focuses on the GOP's critical actions for achievingthe
  programobjectives, as assessedthroughBank analytic work. The operationsupportstwo complementarypolicy areas
  and the policy matrix has been limited to a number of actions considerednecessaryto maintain coherence of policy
  dialogueandbenefitfrom complementaritiestowards the intendedoutcomes.
             Principle 5: Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based
  financial support. The approachandthe timing of planneddisbursementrespondto the GOP's stated financial needs.
  The MEFwill exerciseleadership incoordinatingthe monitoring andevaluationarrangements.


E. Consultation,Distributional,andEnvironmentalAspects

60.        The DPL supports the Government's developmentprogram, which has been
consulted with a broad range of stakeholders. The GOP has made use o f various
consultation fora to develop reforms and reach agreement. Recent examples include the
national referendumon the Panama Canal and the National Dialoguefor Development.20
The consultations done for the CPS stressed issues contained inthis DPL, particularly: (i)
the importance o f promoting broad-based economic growth as a way to reduce poverty
and promote employment creation; and (ii)                   the importance o f strengthening access to
education and health services for the poor.

61.        Within the context of the Bank's analyticaland investment lendingsupport
for social protection, an environmental and social assessment, as well as an
indigenous peoples plan, have been completed.*' Understanding the social, cultural,


2o The main goal of this national dialogue - the "Concertacion Nacional Para el Desarollo" -has been that
ofprioritizing the use of additional revenues to be generated by the expansion of the Panama Canal, in the
context o f the overarching objective o f eradicating poverty in Panama. The process, facilitated by UNDP,
had the participation o f representatives from Government and a wide range of civil society and private
sector organizations. The Government's programs on Economic Growth and Competitiveness, Fiscal
Stability, and Institutional Strengthening were among the focal areas discussed by the working groups.

and economic context o f indigenous communities (where poverty is close to universal) is
key to the success o f projects targeting the poor. In the context o f the Bank's Social
Protection Project, a broad consultation process was undertaken to evaluate how the
implementation o f the Red de Oportunidades can be tailored to best achieve its intended
result o f transferring money to those most in need and ensuring that recipients comply
with their co-responsibilities. The outcome o f this consultation was an Indigenous
Peoples Plan, which is currently being implemented by the Government.             Poverty
reductionpolicy actions supported by the DPL are consistent with this plan.

62.      The policy actions supported by this DPL are not likely to have a significant
negative distributional impact. The DPL complements on-going government and Bank
supported investment projects, including the Panama Social Protection Project, that
directly and indirectly target poverty reduction through the government's conditional
cash transfer program, Red de Oportunidades. Policy actions to support these social
programs are expected to have a significant positive distributional impact, particularly in
poor and isolated rural areas o f the country, including indigenous comarcas.

63.      Measures to enhance financial sector prudential regulation are expected to
have an indirect positive impact on poverty reduction. By reducing the risk o f a
systemic financial crisis, which have large costs in terms o f lower economic growth and
job losses, as well as strain government finances, the supported measures help ensure that
growth and the government's program on poverty reduction are sustainable.

64.      Specific actions supported by this DPL are not likely to have significant
effects on the environment, forests, or other natural resources. In terms o f the
environmental impact o f expanding health coverage, the environmental assessment
prepared for the Panama Social Protection Project determined that the legal framework
for management o f healthcare waste (an environmental concern) is appropriate and
consistent with international guidelines. The government is taking measures'to reduce
the risk o f environmental impact due to increased demand and supply o f basic and
preventive health care services.

65.      Panama has made positive efforts to combine forest conservation with the
social dimensions of the poor living in forested areas.           Although policy actions
supported by this DPL are not likely to have any significant impacts on forests or the
environment, it is worth noting that the government i s fostering a socially equitable
process to provide positive incentives for reducing green house gas emissions from
deforestation and forest degradation (REDD). Given the prominence o f indigenous
populations in forest areas, and the high prevalence o f poverty in indigenous areas, it is
essential to include indigenous peoples in the conservation efforts. Indigenous peoples
are already taking part in the national and international negotiations on REDD, and this
has created sense o f empowerment and new opportunities for environmentally sustainable
development (including seed grants for capacity buildingfrom the World Bank and other
institutions).

                            VI.       LOANIMPLEMENTATION

A. Implementation,Monitoringand Evaluation

66.     The Ministry o f Economy and Finance (MEF) is responsible for the
implementation o f the DPL operation as well as for coordinating the actions among the
concerned agencies, including the Superintendency o f Banks (SBP), the National Bank o f
Panama (BNP), the Ministry o f Social Development (MIDES), and the Ministry o f
Health (MINSA). Together with MEF and the National Institute o f Statistics (INE), these
institutions collect the necessary data for the identified monitoring indicators. The MEF
and the Bank have agreed to monitor the progress inthe program supported by the DPL
and its evaluation will serve to inform preparation o f a new Country Partnership Strategy
(programmed for fall 2009).

B. FiduciaryAspects

67.     In general, the public financial management and public procurement systems are
adequate for this operation. The Bank recently prepared a C F M C P A R to document the
current state o f public financial management in the country, including the actions taken
by the current administration to further increase transparency. While challenges remain,
the Government i s moving ahead to further strengthen its public fiduciary control
framework. Public financial management processes have been supported by the Bank
through both o f the previous DPL operations. These operations have included actions to
improve management and control o f government transactions, particularly payments,
through the launch and implementation o f document tracking and management systems.
The Bank is also engaged in policy dialogue with the Government to follow up on
priorities identified inthe C F M C P A R .

C. Disbursements

68.     The Bank would make the single loan disbursement to the MEF's Treasury Single
Account.      Since this account centralizes government revenues for financing o f
government spending, upon its deposit the DPL disbursement will become available to
finance budgeted expenditures. The account is denominated in U S dollars, which has
legal tender in the country, and i s held in the National Bank o f Panama (BNP), the
financial agent o f government. Based on the review o f external audit reports and the
experience with special accounts for investment lending, the banking control
environment into which the loan proceeds will flow i s deemed adequate.22 Upon the
Bank's request, the MEF would provide the Bank with a written Confirmation o f the
described transaction. N o additional fiduciary arrangements (e.g., dedicated accounts
subject to audit) are deemed necessary for this DPL.




22An unqualified ("clean") audit opinion was issued by external auditors on BNP's financial statements as
o f December 31, 2007, which was prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards.




                                                  29

D. Risks andRiskMitigation

69.     The DPL loan i s subject to two main risks: economic andpolitical.

70.    Economic risks. On the economic front, the main risk derives from the ongoing
global financial crisis and possibility o f a deep and prolonged global recession. While
Panama i s not expected to fall into recession in 2009 and beyond, the current global
situation i s anticipated to adversely impact growth as private sector credit contracts and
foreign demand for Panamanian services, real estate and products weaken. Should the
global slowdown be more protracted than anticipated, ongoing financial sector reforms
may be delayed.        Risks o f economic slowdown have been incorporated into the
macroeconomic projection and the Bank and the Fund are maintaining an on-going
dialogue with the authorities on macroeconomic policy issues. In case o f unanticipated
financial sector developments, both institutions would be available to provide
consultation and support to the authorities as deemedappropriate.

71.     Political and institutional risks. The current Administration will complete its
term o f office on June 30, 2009. Under Panama's Constitution, the President may not be
elected to a consecutive term. Traditionally, new administrations have, upon taking
office, made changes within the civil service and line ministries.        While all major
presidential candidates support the broad D P L objectives, the government transition may
slow the implementation o f the country's reform program. Staffing changes can make an
orderly transition challenging and can be disruptive to on-going programs, including
those supported by this DPL operation. The Bank is supporting the continuity o f
development policies over the political transition through ongoing dialogue with all key
political parties and the preparation o f policy notes for the incoming administration.
Moreover, country dialogue and supervision o f other Bank operations, including the
Social Protection Project and the Health Equity and Performance Improvement Project
should serve to mitigate institutional capacity risks to the proposed operation.

11. La Conduccion Macroeconttmica
La estrategia financiera seguida desde el inicio de la actual administracibn, en
septiembre de 2004, apunt6 a afianzar la estabilidad de la economia, fortaleciendo el
entorno de las inversiones mediante el saneamiento y un manejo prudente de las
finanzas poblicas, privilegiandoademas la atencibn a la inversi6n social.
La estrategia consistib en la generacidn de ahorro corriente para financiar una porcibn
cada vez mayor del programa de inversiones lo que permiti6 reducir la dependencia del
endeudamiento al utilizar el ahorro corriente generado para financiar las mismas. Otro
elemento de la estrategia se orient6 a la estabilizacibnfinanciera y actuarial de la Caja
del Seguro Social, mediante las reformas implementadas a traves de la Ley No.51 y la
Ley No.6 de febrero de 2005, "que implements un programa de equidad fiscal, /a cual
incluyd un programa de reduccidn de gastos y /a reestructuracidn de/ sistema
tributario".
AI cierre del aTio 2008, el monto absoluto de la Deuda Pliblica se redujo en
aproximadamente US$31.0 millones respecto al aAo 2007 y la cifra acumulada del
ahorro corriente del atio 2006 al 2008 fue de aproximadamente US$2,852.0 millones,
cifra muy similar a 10s US$2,904.0 millones de desembolsos para inversiones, lo cual
demuestra el &xitode la estrategiafinanciera seguida.
Es importante resaltar que se han             logrado superar las metas macro fiscales
establecidas en la Estrategia Econ6rnica de Gobiemo para el perio         2004-2009, que
consistieron en reducir el dtificit fiscal, aumentar el ahorro corriente, orar el perfil de
la deuda y la reduccidndel dbficit financier0 y actuarialde la Caja de Seguro Social.
En consecuencia la economia de nuestro pals ha respondido adecu
medidas estrategicas adoptadas y a 10s estimulos de las politicas pliblicas
implementadas, logrando un crecimiento de 11.5% en el 2007 y estimandose un
crecimientode aproximadarnente 9.0% para el aAo 2008. Estos niveles de crecimiento
se han fundamentado, primordidmente en el sector extemo, a travks del fuerte
incremento en las exportaciones de sewicios de sectores tales como banca, turismo,
puertos, el Canal de Panama y la Zona Libre de Colbn, asi como el crecimiento en el
sector domestico, en particular la construccion. Por otro lado, se ha logrado una
reduccibn en el lndice de desempleo abierto, el cual pas6 de 9.2% en el 2004 a 4.2%
en el 2008. Las perspectivas para 10s aiios venideros, a la luz de la crisis financiera
intemacional, son alentadoras, debido a la existencia de mega-proyectosde inversibn,
entre ios cuales se encuentran 10s trabajos de un tercer juego de exdusas para la
modernizaci6ndel Canal.
Nuestras metas al final del periodo de Gobierno consisten en la transicibn ordenada y
transparente de las finanzas pliblicas en cumplimiento de la ley No.34 de
Responsabilidad Social Fiscal, la cual continuarA apoyando la sostenibilidad
macroeconbmica del pais.

111. La pobrezaen nuestro pak
Con la finalidad de apoyar a la igualdad de oportunidades y el crecimiento econ6mico
del pais el Gobierno ha desarrollado varias iniciativas focalizadas en la reducci6n de la
pobreza siendo el Programa Red de Oportunidades uno de 10s mas importantes. Este
programa est& dirigido a personas de pobreza extrema en hogares vulnerables con el
fin de mejorar sus estAndaresde vida y el acceso a 10s servicios socialesbasicos.
La creacidn y puesta en rnarcha del programa Red de Oportunidades ha sido un
importante paso por parte del gobierno en busca de mejorar 10s niveles de pobrera en
nuestro pais. Este programa actualmente ofrece cobertura a 367,378 personas (1IYO
de la poblacibn) y la base de datos creada a traves de este prograrna estA siendo
utilizada por otros programassocialespara llegar a un mayor nirmerode beneficiarios.
A pesar de 10s esfuerzos puestos en 10s diferentes programas de inter& social y del
crecimiento alto y sostenido de nuestra economla, la pobreza extrema, principalmente
presentada en grupos indigenas localizados en Breas rurales, no parece dar tregua y
se debe primordialmente a que nuestro factor de crecimiento es un resultado de las
actividades del sector de servicios 10s cuales utilizan mano de obra con altos
estgndares y niveles de conocimientos.


IV. Objetivosy Componentes del Programa
En este contexto, consideramos Irnportante el apoyo del Banco Mundial a traves del
Programa Social de Proteccidn a 10s Pobres en tiempos de Incedidumbre Global, con la
finalidad de apoyar las pollticas pOblicas adoptadas por el GdP para mitigar el impact0
de la desaceleracibnecondmica mundial en 10s sectores mAs pobres:
          Reforzamiento de 10s programas sociales a traves de un aumento de
          US$35.00 a US$SO.OO en 10s montos de las transferencias en efectivo
          condicionadas a lasfamilias beneficiarias;
           Fortalecimientode la calidad y cobertura de 10s serviciosde salud y nutrici6n
          a grupos en extrema pobreza rnediante la inclusibn de un paquete integral de
          servicios nutricionales en et paquete bBsico de prevenci6n y prornocidn de
          servicios de salud (Paquete de Atencidn Integral de Servicios de Salud,
          PAISS);   .

          Expandir la cobertura geogr5fica de la entrega del paquete de servicios de
          salud, lo cual traerla corn0 consecuencia un aumento de aproximadamente
          60,000 personas beneficiadasdentrode las Comarcas;
          El gobiemo a traves del documento Acuerdos de la Concertacidn Nacional
          para el Desarrollo de Octubre 2007, se compromete entre otras cosas a
          mantener 10s niveles de gastos sociales durante la desaceleraci6n
          econbmica. La importancia de este cornpromiso radica en que durante
          tiempos de crisis este rengl6n se vuefve vulnerable a recortes
          presupuestarios;
                                                                          ...I5

     (v) Mantener la estabilidad del sector financier0 es una condicion necesaria para
          el crecirniento y la reduccion de la pobreza por lo cual las autoridades
          Panameiias han fortalecido su apoyo a este sector para as1 garantizar la
          solvencia y iiquidezde 10s bancos y por tanto mantener el flujo de cr6ditos en
          el pais.

Ref.: Letter of DevelopmentPolicy for the Protecting the Poor Under Global Uncertainty Development
Policy Loan.


Dear Mr.Zoellick:

From its first days inoffice, this administration announced its priorities: fiscal discipline,
the fight against corruption, poverty reduction through job creation, achieving a society
with greater opportunities, transparency in public administration and undertaking a
program o fpublic investment to sustain economic growth.

Since 2004, the Government launched an ambitious medium and long-term strategy that
paid special attention to reducing the level o f poverty through four dimensions: (i)
stimulating growth and expanding employment opportunities, (ii)            building the human
capital o f the poor, (iii)
                          initiating a program o f conditional cash transfers entitled Red de
Oportunidades which unites efforts to improve education, health, nutrition and access to
basic infrastructure, and (iv) investment in productive activities in rural areas, including
land titling.

In addition, the Government has strengthened other programs that offer basic health
services to the poor in rural and isolated areas, as well as broadened and accelerated
activities aimed at improving the quality o f and access to education services in
indigenous areas.

In the context of the current financial crisis and world economic deceleration, the
Government i s making efforts to protect the poor and backstop the domestic financial
system. To do so, the Government has implemented new policies such as mitigating the
economic impact on the poor by, on the one hand, improving coverage and targeting o f
social programs, and on the other, reducing the risk o f a banking crisis through improved
risk management and strengthened regulation and supervision. The Government actions
in these areas have contributed to continued macroeconomic stability, which is the
foundation for sustainable growth andpoverty reductioninthe country.




                                                36

I.TheGovernmentStrategy

The governing programo f the current administration is basedon five strategic pillars, the
objectives and actions ofwhich are discussed below.

    1. Poverty reduction and improved income distribution via a program o f direct
        subsidies targeted at those most in need and the implementation o f programs to
        strengthen the productive capacity o f the economy, through the inclusion o f
        previously excluded groups.
   2. A policy o f economic growth and job creation based on: (i)       developing a model
        focused on external markets, which includes the signing of free trade agreements,
        especially with the United States; (ii) promoting a market economy, with neutral
        incentives and freedom in various markets; (iii)     maximizing the development
        potential o f the country's geographic position through the expansion and
        modernization o f the Panama Canal; and (iv) executing a program o f public
        investment for development.
   3. Placing public finances on a permanentlyhealthy foundation-a         precondition for
        sustainable development-with      responsible management o f public finances inthe
        short term and structural reforms in the long term. These reforms will be
        accompanied by a strict control o f current expenditure, with the aim o f generating
        public savings to finance an important part o fthe public investmentprogram.
   4. Development o f human capital through reforms and modernization o f the
        education system that incorporate English language training, IT, business studies
        and career development.
   5. Reform and modernization o f the state that guarantees transparency and helps
        eradicate public sector corruption. Moreover, the government planning system
        will be restructuredto increase the role o f the private sector inpublic investment
        projects.


11.Macroeconomic Policy

The macroeconomic policy pursued since the beginningo f the current administration, in
September 2004, has been aimed at ensuring economic stability, strengthening the
investment climate through a healthy and prudent management o f public finances, and
prioritizing social investment.

The strategy has consisted o f generating current savings to finance an increasingly large
portion of the investment program, which permitted a reduced dependence on debt
creation. Another element in the strategy i s oriented toward the financial and actuarial
stabilization o f the Social Security System, through reforms implementedvia Law 51 and
Law 6 in February 2005 "that implement a program offiscal equity, which includes a
program of reduced expenditures and a restructuring of the tributary system."

At the close o f 2008, the stock o f public debt was reduced by approximately US$31
million comparedto 2007. At the same time, the amount o f current savings from 2006 to




                                             37

2008 was approximately US$2.85 billion, very close to the US$2.9 billion spent on
investments, which demonstrates the success o f the financial strategy.

It is important to highlight that the macro-fiscal targets established in the Government
Economic Strategy for 2004-2009 have been exceeded. These targets include reducing
the fiscal deficit, increasingcurrent savings, improving the debt profile, and reducing the
financial and actuarial deficit o fthe Social Security System.

Our economy has responded well to the strategic measures adopted and the stimulus o f
public policies, achieving a growth rate o f 11.5 percent in2007 and an estimated growth
o f 9 percent for 2008. These growth rates have been based mainly on strong exports by
service sectors such as banking, tourism, ports, the Panama Canal and the Colon Free
Zone, as well as growth inthe domestic sector, particularly construction. Moreover, open
unemployment has declined from 9.2 percent in 2004 to 4.2 percent in 2008. The
prospects for the coming years, inlight o f the international financial crisis, are reasonably
good due to the existence o f mega investment projects, including the construction o f a
third set oflocks o fthe PanamaCanal.

Our goals at the end o f the administration consist of an orderly and transparent transition
in public finances, in keeping with the Social and Fiscal Responsibility Law, so as to
continue supportingmacroeconomic sustainability.



111.Poverty

With the aim o f supporting equal opportunities and economic growth, the Government
has developed various targeted poverty reduction programs, with the Red de
Oportunidudes conditional cash transfer program being one o f the most important. This
program is directed to people in extreme poverty in vulnerable households, and aims to
improve their living standards and access to basic social services.

The creation and implementation o fRed de Oportunidudes has been an important step in
the effort to lower the level o fpoverty. The program currently covers 367,378 people (11
percent of the population) and the database created by the program is being used by other
social programs to improve the targeting o fthese.

Despite efforts by the different social programs and the high and sustained growth o f our
economy, extreme poverty-principally          among indigenous groups located in rural
areas-remains     very high. This is mainly due to the fact that our growth is largely the
result o f service sector activities that utilize labor with high standards and levels o f
knowledge.

IV. Objectives andComponents of the Program

In this context, we consider the support of the World Bank through the Protecting the
Poor Under Global Uncertainty Development Policy Loan to be important. The aim o f
the loan is to support public policies adopted by the Government to mitigate the impact o f
the world economic deceleration on the poorest sectors, through the following actions:

     1. Strengthen social programs through an increase the amount o f conditional cash
        transfers to beneficiary families from US$35 to US$50per month.
     2. Strengthen the quality and coverage o f health and nutrition services to groups in
        extreme poverty via the inclusion o f an integrated package o f nutrition services
        into the basic package o f health promotion and prevention services (Puquete de
        Atencidn Intregral de Servicios de Sulud, PAISS).
     3. Expand the geographic coverage for the delivery of the health services package,
        which would result inan increase o f approximately 60,000 beneficiaries.
     4. Government commitment, through the National Agreement for Development of
         October 2007, to maintain the level o f social spending during times o f economic
         deceleration. This commitment i s important as social spending can become
        vulnerable to budget cuts during an economic downturn.
     5. Strengthen the support o f Panamanian authorities to the financial sector to
         guarantee and solvency and liquidity o f the banking system and in this way
        maintain financial sector stability and the flow o f credit inthe country, which are
        necessary conditions for growth and poverty reduction.

For the above reasons, the Government of the Republic of Panama requests the approval
o f the program.

Yours sincerely,




Hector E.Alexander H.
Minister

ANNEX 3. IMFSTATEMENT ON THE MACROECONOMIC SITUATION




                              Panama-Assessment Letter to the World Bank
                                                (March 6,2009)

       1.      The weak global environmentwill dampen Panama's near-term growth outlook.
       Real GDP growth i s projectedto slow from an impressive 10 percent per annum during
       2006-08 to about 4-5 percent in 2009-10. The expansion o fthe Panama Canal and a strong
       public investment program are expected to mitigate the effects o f the global slowdown on
       economic activity. Nevertheless, the growth outlook is subject to considerable risk and the
       depth and length o f Panama's slowdown will depend on the magnitude and duration o f the US.
       recession, the resilience of foreign direct investment, and the absence o f adverse shocks to
       confidence. After reaching a peak o f 10 percent in September 2008, the 12-month rate o f
       inflation declined sharply following the drop in world food and oil prices, and is projected to
       fall below 4 percent during 2009. The external current account is projected to remain around
       12-14 percent o f GDP, mainly due to higher imports relatedto the Canal expansion.

       2.      A strong fiscal position will enable the governmentto add some fiscal stimulus.
       After three years of budget surpluses, the government has room to partially absorb weaker
      revenues and achieve its budget deficit target o f 1 percent o f GDP-the    limit stipulatedinthe
       Social and Fiscal Responsibility Law approved in2008-by        containing capital spending. The
      public sector debt-to-GDP ratio i s projected to remain stable at about 38 percent o f GDP by
       end-2009, even after including the new borrowing associated with the Canal expansion.

       3.      The banking system has fared relatively well during the global financial crisis.
      Periodical assessments by the Superintendency o f Banks have not revealed exposure to
      complex structured assets. As in many other countries in the region, banks' access to foreign
      credit lines became more problematic starting inOctober 2008, but bank deposits and credit
      outstanding have remainedbroadly stable. Banks are vulnerable to additional external shocks,
      particularly given the importance of foreign depositors and the large presence of foreign banks.
      Inaddition, theoutput slowdownislikelyto deteriorate somewhat thequality ofbank assets.

      4.       The government has responded proactivelyto the new risks. In October 2008, the
       President formed a high-level committee to monitor the impact o fthe global crisis on Panama,
      the Superintendent o f Banks increased it scrutiny o f financial institutions, and the National
      BankofPanama(BNP) established a collateralized lineofcredit for on-lendingto banks. In
      January 2009, the government announced a stimulus package for a total of US$I.1billion,
      including increased resources for on-lending. The government's rapid action with regard to the
      Stanford Bank has helped prevent major repercussions on the rest o f the banking system.

               ANNEX 4. PANAMA: DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

1.       The debt sustainability analysis presented in this annex i s based on the
macroeconomic framework summarized in Table 1, which incorporates the expected impact
o f the global economic crisis incorporating the most recent downward revisions o f U S
economic growth.        The analysis applies two different concepts o f public debt: (1) Non-
Financial Public Sector (NFPS) debt, excluding the accounts o f the Panama Canal Authority
(PCA); (2) NFPS debt including debts o f the PCA.23 Both definitions define debt on a net
basis by excluding public debt instruments held by the Fiduciary Fund and the Institute o f
Social Security (CSS) from gross public debt.

2.       The impact o f the global crisis will be most noticeable in 2009 with growth
moderatingto 3 percent compared to a projected 8 percent growth rate prior to the crisis. The
economy i s expected to recover to a growth rate of 7 percent by 2012.                 In the baseline
scenario, the fiscal deficit of the NTPS, excl. PCA will remain below the 1 percent o f GDP
stipulatedinthe Social andFiscal ResponsibilityLaw. GDP inflation is expected to fall to 3.5
percent (from 9.3 percent in2008) inthe medium-term as commodity prices decline.

3.       Table A4.1 presents the evolution o f the stock o f NFPS debt (excl. PCA) from 2005 to
2007, providing a breakdown by credit for the stock o fnet debt and the average terms o f gross
debt. Panama's public debt is mainly external (82 percent oftotal debt), o fwhich most is held
inbonds (65.7 percent of total debt). Domestic debt corresponds to 18 percent of total debt.
The majority o f gross debt i s held in U S dollars (96.4 percent). In addition, most o f NFPS
debt i s heldwith interest rates between 6 and 9 percent (63.2 percent of total gross debt).

4.       The baseline scenario for NFPS debt (excl. PCA) is presented in Table A4.2.                     It
indicates that an average primary surplus o f 1.8 percent o f GDP between 2008 and 2013
would result ina gradual decline inthe public debt-to-GDP ratio from 45.8 percent o f GDP in
2007 to 28.8 percent o f GDP by 2013. This primary surplus i s consistent with an overall
public sector deficit averaging 0.5 percent o fGDP duringthis period.




23The Panama Canal Authority is an autonomous agency with fiscal accounts separate from that of the Non-
Financial Public Sector. ACP debt has an investment grade rating while Central Government debt has a rating
one notchbelow that. ACP debt i s not explicitly guaranteed by the sovereign.

potential implications o f these risks, Table A4.3 presents projected debt dynamics for the Non-
Financial Public Sector (excl. PCA) under more pessimistic alternative scenarios:

         Under a less optimistic growth scenario (3.9 percent over 2008-2013) compared to the
         baseline (6.0 percent over 2008-2013)-scenario                    Al-the       public debt-to-GDP ratio
         would be 4.3 percentage points o f GDP higher than under the baseline scenario in2013.24

         Assuming a looser fiscal policy-scenario               A2-with       an average primary surplus o f 0.9
         percent of GDP over 2008-2013 instead o f the assumed 1.8 percent o f GDP under the
         baseline scenario, the public debt-to-GDP-ratio would be 5.3 percentage points o f GDP
         higherthan underthe baseline scenario in2013.25

         Considering tighter financial market conditions reflected in higher real interest rates for
         public debt over 2008-2013-scenario              A3-projected        debt indicators for 2013 would be
         1.9 percent higher than underthe baseline scenario.26



24The GDP growth stress scenario (implyingan annual growth rate o f 3.9 percent per year for 2008-13) represents a
permanent one-half standard deviation shock (-1.7 percent) to GDP growth o f the 10-year historical average (5.6
percent).
25The looser fiscal policy scenario (a primary balance o f 0.9 percent o f GDP for 2008-2013) assumes a permanent
one-half standard deviation shock (1.2 percent o f GDP) to the primary balance of the 10-year historical average (2.1
 ercent o f GDP). Inthis scenario, the impliedoverall balance exceeds 1percent o f GDP.
  The real interest rate rises by halfa standard deviation (0.6 percent) to 6.0 percent compared to the historical 10-
year average o f 5.4 percent.




                                                          49

    o Undera scenario o fcontemporaneous shocks inwhich GDP growth, the primarybalance,
         and real interest rates are affected-scenario             A4-the    public debt-to-GDP would reach
         42.5 percent in2013, or 13.7 percentage points higher than inthe baseline scenario.

    o Assuming a potential one-time materializationo fcontingent liabilities equal to 10percent
         o f GDP in 2009 (which could occur as a result o f a bailout o f local banks by the central
         government)-scenario A5-public                 debt would reach 39.2 percent o f GDPby 2013.

    o The final set of scenarios examines the evolution of public debt to GDP when key
         variables are fixed at historical averages. Results vary considerably depending on
         whether historical averages are based on the last 5 or 10 years. This difference i s due to
         the notable improvement in economic growth and the fiscal stance in recent years.
         Scenario A 6 i s based on average data for the last five years. Under this assumption,
         public debt to GDP would reach 25.7 percent by 2013, approximately 3.1 percentage
         points lower than under the baseline.                 Alternatively, a 10 year historical average-
         scenario A7-would           result in a public debt to GDP ratio o f 29.0 percent in 2013, 0.2
         percent higher than inthe baseline.

6.       The second part o f the analysis incorporates the accounts o f the Panama Canal Authority
and the canal expansion borrowing schedule for the period 2009-2013. The PCA i s an
autonomous entity which has fiscal accounts separate from the rest o f the Panamanian public
sector. Nonetheless, the PCA has close ties to the public sector, and has contributed to the
annual revenues o f the NFPS by an average o f 3.3 percent o f GDP during 2004 - 2007. Until
2008, the PCA had no debt on its books and had maintained an overall average annual surplus
equal to 0.8 percent o f GDP between 2004 and 2007, contributing to accumulation o f assets
totaling US$4.1 billionby the end o f the 2007 fiscal year. However, due to the expansion o f the
Panama Canal, PCA debt will increase noticeably over the next five years.

7.       The debt sustainability analysis for the NFPS, including the PCA (Table A4.4), indicates
that an average primary surplus o f 0.2 percent o f GDP between 2008 and 2013 would lead the
debt-to-GDP ratio to gradually decline to 38.4 percent of GDP by 2013. This figure is 9.6

percentage points o f GDP higher than the NFPS debt excluding the PCA.27 Figure A4.2
illustrates the alternative scenarios. The most severe test, which assumes a combined shock on
the growth rate, interest rate and primary balance for the entire forecast period leads to an
increasing debt-to-GDP ratio, which reaches 51.1 percent by 2013.28 A realization o f contingent
liabilities totaling 10 percent o f GDP would also bring the debt-to-GDP ratio higher than under
the baseline (51.1 percent). However, it i s noteworthy, that the projected debt-to-GDP ratio
declines under all other stress tests.

8.        Over the past years, the PCA has shown a very sound financial performance. Annual
revenue growth averaged 17.6 percent between 2003 and 2007, and the net profit margin
increased steadily over the same period. Current assets have also grown substantially, due
mainly to the increase in appropriated and unappropriated retained earnings, and total assets
nearly doubled duringthis period, reaching US$4.1 billion in2007.29

9.        The US$2.3 billion in credit resources required for the expansion o f the Canal have been
acquired with five multilateral institutions at a term o f 20 years and a grace period o f 10 years.
Duringthe first 10years o fthe project, the PCA will only payinterest andwill beginto amortize
the loans thereafter. Disbursements are scheduled to beginin2009.

''The   baseline assumptions o f real GDP growth, interest rates, and inflation are the same for both scenarios
(including and excluding the PCA). The primary deficit assumptions differ noticeably because the analysis including
the PCA incorporates the expected additional spending carried out by the PCA.
28 The shock to the primary balance (when including the PCA) i s applied to the average o f the projected values o f
the primary balance for the period 2008 - 2013 rather than the historical average (the template default). This was
done because the historical fiscal performance when including the PCA was extraordinarily strong.
29 Appropriated earnings refer to those assigned in the budget as reserves for future Canal expansion, contingency,
and working capital purposes. Unappropriated earnings represent surplus inrespect o f the previous fiscal year that
is to be transferred to the Treasury o f Panama.
