PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF YEMEN
APPRAISAL OF A HIGHWAY PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        The People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (Democratic Yemen),
which achieved independence from the United Kingdom in 1967, has depended
for its livelihood on oil refining, bunkering, and entrepot trade in the
port of Aden, the most highly developed part of the country. More re-
cently, the closure of the Suez Canal, withdrawal of the British mili-
tary garrison, and cessation of British budgetary support have resulted
in severe financial difficulties for the Government.
ii.       A Bank economic mission visited Democratic Yemen in February/
March 1970 and concluded tba t the country should move from its Aden-
oriented economy to one where agricultural commodity production mould
play an important role. To date, agriculture has accounted for about
22% of GNP (cotton, fruit ana vegetables, wheat, sorghum, and millet are
among the crops grown), but it has been handicapped by a lack of surface
water and poor transportation links with the port of Aden, the natural
export route to world markets.
iii.      At present, the country has 2,760 mi of road, of Which only 260 mi
are paved.  The remainder consists mainly of poor tracks that are negotiable
only during the dry season. With the departure of expatriate staff from the
Public Works Department (PWD) of the Ministry of Public Works and Communica-
tions following independence, the existing organization has been incapable
of carrying out a road maintenance and construction program without outside
technical assistance. A first step for fature lending in the transportation
sector, therefore, will be to assist in reorganization of the PWD, and to
carry out feasibility studies of high priority roads followed by detailed
engineering of those found economically justified.
iv.       The proposed project includes technical assistance, by con-
sultants, to the PWD for reorganization and improvements in highway
operations; feasibility studies, by consultants, of about 498 mi of
apparently high priority roads; and redesign and detailed engineering, by
consultants, of about 150 mi expected to result from the feasibility studies.
It also includes procurement of spare parts for existing highway maintenance
equipment, as well as workshop and communications equipment, and overseas
scholarships for training PWD local staff.
v.        The total project costs, including contingencies, are US$2.7 mil-
lion. The foreign exchange costs, corresponding to 80% of the project costs,
are US$2.1 million. The Government is requesting an IDA credit of US$1.6
million to cover the foreign exchange costs of the feasibility studies,
detailed engineering, and procurement of spare parts and workshop and com-
munications equipment; the local costs will be met by the Government. The

Government is also requesting a grant of US$0.7 million from the United

will be the first Bank Group lending operation to the People's Democratic
Republic of Yemen.

PEOPLE'S DEMICRATIC REPUELIC OF YEMR
APPRAISAL OF A HIGHWAY PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      As a result of a visit of a Bank Group economic mission to the
People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (Democratic Yemen) in February/March
1970, the Government asked the Association to help finance a highway pro-
Ject. Subsequently, a Highway Appraisal Mission (August 1970) and a pre-
negotiations mission (January 1971) visited Democratic Yemen. During nego-
tiations in early March 1971, agreement was reached on the Government's re-
quest to the Association to help finance a highway project consisting of:
(a)  technical assistance, by consultants, to the Public
Worlcs Department (PWD) for reorganization and improve-
ment of highway operations;
(b)  feasibility studies, by consultants, of about 498 mi of
apparently high priority roads;
(c)  redesign and detailed engineering, by consultants, of
about 150 mi of roads resulting from (b);
(d) procurement of spare parts for existing highway main-
tenance equipment, together with workshop and communica-
tions equipment; and
(e) overseas scholarships for training PWD local staff.
The project cost is about US$2.7 million. The proposed credit of US$1.6
million is for the foreign exchange costs of items (b), (c), mad (d). The
Government is requesting a grant of US$0.7 million frcm the United Nations
Development Programme (UNDP) to finance the foreign exchange costs and some
local costs of items (a) and (e).
1.02      This will be the first Bank Group lending operation in the
People's Democratic Republic of Yemen.
1.03      The project was a praised by Messrs. A. Bergan (Consultant)
and Mr. M. Rowat (Economist) in August 1970. This report was written
by Messrs. B. Kennedy (Engineer) and R. Rafloski (Economist); it was
edited by Mrs. P. Valad.



ITI  BA? YKXwZD
A. General
2.01      The People's Democratic Republic of Yemen, formerly known as
the Federation of South Arabla and augmented by the Eastern Protectorate
States, achieved independence from tne United Kingdom in November 1967.
Located in the southermaost part of the Arabian Peninsula (see Map) and
encompassing an area approxi>mately 112,000 sq mi, the country is about
the same size as Italy. It is bordered by the Yemen Arab Republic to the
northwest, Saudi Arabia to the north, Oman to the east, and the Gulf of
Aden and the Indian Ocean to the south.
2.Oe      With the exception of the coastal plain, ranging fros 4 xi to 40
mi in depth, the country is quite mountainous with rugged and forbidding
terrain punctuated by deep gulleys. The land is arid ana over half is
completely barren. Arable land makes up less than 1% of the total.  The
agricultural potential is limited by the shortage of rainfall and lack
of surface water. Except in the wnter season (November-March), the
coastal areas are humid with high temperatures and little rainfall. The
inLterior mountainous regions, however, have lower temperatures and greater
rainfall.
2.03      The populaticn, about 1.4 million (Table 1), is growing at a
rate between 2% ancd 3% p.a. Politically, the country is divided into
six governorates (see Map) withi tne largest population concentration
(3491,000) in Aden and its immediate surroundings.
2.o4      Historically, economic development was concentrated in the city
of Aden because its port was used for oil refining, bunkering and entrepot
trade.  Since the  Suez Canal was closed, the British military garrison
was withdrawn (1967), and United Kingdom budgetary support was terninated
(:L968), economic development in Democratic Yemen has suffered. Gross
National Product (GNP) fell from  YD77 million in 1966 to YD54 million in
19?68, but increased slightly to YD56 million in 1969 for a per capita GNP
of approximately US$100.
2.05      Agriculture accounted for about 22% of GNP in 1969 and employed
80% of the population. The main agricultural export crops are raw cotton,
hides, and skins. Over half the cultivated area is devoted to cereals,
such as sorghum and wheat.  Fruits and vegetables are the most important
i&mestic cash crops; coffee, tobacco, and sesame are also grown in some
areas. An adverse balance of agricultural trade exists, with imports
aoIunting to YD13 million in 1969 compared to exports of YD2 million.
Although there is considerable potential for the Yisheries' sector along
the 750 mi coastline, its use, at present, is modest.



2.o6      The small industrial sector (9% ol' GNP) is confined to the city
of Aden and its imediate surroundings, where the large British Petrolemu
oil refinery (7 million tons annual output) and some small industries are
situated.
2.07      With the nationalization in late 1969 of nearly all foreign firms
engaged in banking, trade, insurance, port services  and petroleum distri-
bution, the Economic Organization for the Public Sector and National Plan-
ning was established to manage the country's economy. It is too early to
predict the economic effects of this change.
2.o8      In general, Democratic Yemen must move aia  from its historical-
ly based service economy centered in Aden, which is in a more advanced
state than the rest of the country, toward a ccmmodity-prodicing agri-
cultural economy. The development of a good road network linking the
agricultural areas with market centers, primarily Aden, will facilitate
this transition.
B. The Transport Sector
2.09      The present transport network reflects the historical, economical,
and political developments of the coun-try. Aden, the center, is isolated
frcm the hinterland, formerly a collection of small feudal states which
discouraged the development of an adequate communication system. Conse-
quently, at the time of indevendence in 1967, the transport network consisted
of a few good roads and a well-developed port in Aden, with limited air
connections and coastal shipping. Since then, little has been done to
improve the road network, local air connections have deteriorated, and
activity in the port of Aden has declined. Because of its difficult
budgetary situation, the Government has not yet been able to invest size-
able funds to improve the transport network.
2.10      Transport demand is primarily for movement of agricultural com-
modities. "Up traffic" from the port of Aden to other governorates is
essentially made up of imported wheat, flour, sugar, rice, ghee, and tea.
"Down traffic" to Aden is primarily fruit and vegetables, hides and skins,
cotton lint, and cotton seed. In addition, Aden is the source of re-export
traffic (principally cereals, clothing, anct equipment spare parts) to the
Yemen Arab Republic. By contrast, the Yemen Arab Republic exports qat,
(a narcotic leaf popular with the Yemeni people), fruit and vegetables,
and coffee to Damocratic Yemen. Aside from the traffic between the two
Yemens, "up traffic" exceeds "down traffic", but accurate figures are not
available.
C. Highways
2.11      Roads are the principal transport means in Democratic Yemen. At
present there are 2,760 mi of roads, of which 260 mi are paved (40% in
Aden). Most remaining roads are merely poor tracks. Little maintenance
has been carried out since independence. The highway system is discussed
further in Chapter III.



-4-
D. Ports
2.12      Democratic Yemen is served by two main seaports   Aden and Al
Mukalla. Aden is a large bunkering port with predominantly international
traffic and "free port" status, bIt Al Mukalla is an inefficient lighterage
port of only local significance.
2.13      Historically, the Aden Port Trust has been a well-run, profit-
making institution, except in 1967-68 when it incurred a loss of YD400,000
as a result of the closure of the Suez Canal (Table 2). The total number
of ships calling at the port fell fro m 6,246 in 1966 to 1,382 in 1968
(Table 3), but in the past two years traffic has begun to recover and
will probably be 1,600 ships in 1970.  Given the present unused port
capacity, investment plans have been deferred for the time being.
E. Airports
2.14      Democratic Yemen is served by an international airport at Aden
and 14 airstrips for local traffic, (only six are now used), The Depart-
ment of Civil Aviation, created in 1949, is responsible for airports.
2.151     The international airport at Aden has traditionally been a con-
nec ting point between Europe, East Africa, and the Far East.  After in-
dependence both passenger ana freight traffic dropped to almost half the
previous levels. However, during the last two years, passenger traffic
has grown at about 20% p.a. (Table W), ana the airport is now served by
11 :Lnternational airlines. In June 1970, the UNDP Special Fund made a
grant of about US$750,000 to finance technical assistance, equipment for
Aden airport, and training fellowships. The project is proceeding satis-
factorily.
2.1o      The quality of local airports is poor; they lack paved runways,
air terminal buildings, and proper navigational aids. Before it was
nationalized in September 1970, the Southern Yemen Airlines, which operates
both domestically and internationally, was poorly run ana had incurred a
defLcit. It is still too early to ascertain the effects of nationalization.
F. Transport Policy and Coordination
2.17      Because of the predominance of road transport in the total trans-
port sector, little transport coordination is required or carried out. The
Ministry of Public Works and Communications (MPMC) includes the Department
of IJivil Aviation and the PWD, but no coordinating mechanism exists between
the two. The Aden Port Trust is an independent body and the National Ship-
ping Company, which supervises coastal traffic, is part of the Economic Or-
ganization for the Public Sector. There appears to be no need for concern
about transport coordination issues at this time.

III.  THE HIGHWAT SECTOR
A. The Highway Network
3.01      The network in the six governorates onsists of 260 mi of paved
roads and about 2,500 mi of tracks (see Map); 100 mi of the paved roads
are located in and around Aden, and the remainder radiate from Aden to
the second and third govemnorates. The fifth governorate (Hadramnmt)
has about 100 mL of cobblestone paved roads. The remaining roads are merely
tracks, which can be negotiated by landrovers or light trucks; the tracks
are impassable during flash flooding.
3.02      The 260 mi of paved roads are in fair condition.  A 2 in  bitumi-
nous carpet was laid three to five years ago; despite lack of maintenance
it is still in good condition, probably because of the light traffic carried.
However, surface treatment of most of the carriageway to prevent deteriora-
tion will be needed during the next few years.
3.03      The tracks connecting the main centers of activity in the east
are extremely poor. They never have been maintained and can be negotiated
only at very low speeds during the dry season. The alignment is poor, the
carriageway is narrow and full of potholes and ruts, the grades are
steep, and the curves are sharp. The strain is great on vehicles using these
tracks, and their useful life is substantially reduced. The tracks will be
of limited usefulness as a base for a future highway network.
3.04      The cobblestone paved roads consist of 6-12 in natural stones
placed on a sand-bedding a foot or more thick. The stones are placed by
hand without ramming, leaving large joints of sand between them. Because
of the small size and poor embedding of the stones, tney have a tendency
to come loose, especially under increased traffic or after heavy rains.
The system should be regarded as a purely temporary solution; a substantial
gravel-surfaced road could be built at the same cost as the cobblestone road.
3.05      Shortly before independence, a Lebanese consulting firmn )ar-Al
Handasah) obtained a contract for detailed engineering of about 390 mi
of roads in the Federation of South Arabia. The engineering and con-
struction were to be financed by a grant of 610 million from Saudi Arabia.
At independence, the grant for construction was cancelled, and only the
detailed engineering could be undertaken. At the end of 1969, the Lebanese
consulting firm presented the drawings for the detailed engineering; neither
feasibility studies nor bridge designs were umdertaken as these were not
included in their terms of reference. Mainland China has recently agreed
to finance the total construction cost of about 200 mi of these roads
(para. 3.20).  The present detailed engineering of the remaining 191 mi,
if used as a basis for construction, could result in roads of uneconomically
high standards. The 191 mi of roads have therefore been included in the pro-
posed feasibility studies (para. 4.06).



-6-
B. Highway Administration
3.06       The road network is under the jurisdiction of the PWD with-
in the NPWC; its headquarters are in Aden. Prior to independence,
separate public works departments existed in what are now the fifth and
sixth governorates. Merging these departments into the present organiza-
tcton has created administrative problems which have not yet been solved;
the department in Hadramaut (fifth governorate) still prefers some inde-
pendence and does not always comply with directions from the PWD, and
the small public works office in the sixth governorate has also remained
virtually independent due to its relative isolation.
3.07       Under the MPWC, the Planning and Statistics Department and
the PWD deal both with roads and government buildings.  The first
department is responsible for planning and surveying roads; the second
is responsible for construction and maintenance. Both departments
are understaffed and inefficiently operated due to the loss of foreign
staff after independence.
3.08      In each governorate, a PWD office deals with both roads and
buildings. Office chiefs are seconded from headquarters, while their
staffs are drawn from the local pre-independence organization. PWD
field offices also are understaffed.
3.09       The number of people employed in each section of PWD's
headquarters is shown in Table 5. While the few senior engineers are
well qualified and are fulfilling their tasks adequately, there is a
shortage of intermediate level engineers and technicians experienced in
road construction and maintenance; however, this shortage is being par-
tially alleviated by staff returning from training overseas.
3.10      The workshops in Aden are located in three different places:
the main shop is in Khormaksar and minor shops are in Maala and Ashaab
City. All are poorly equipped. Tools are scarce and the few shop
machines are old and out of date. The workshop management is dedicated
and the mechanics are experienced; given tools ana improved facilities,
operational efficiency could be increased considerably. Several work-
shops for greasing and minor repairs also exist in each of the six
governorates, with a large shop at Al Mukalla; all are insufficiently
equipped and understaffed. Chart II shows Aden workshop organization
and staffing.
3.11      Of the road construction and maintenance equipment, more than
40% is out of order due to lack of spare parts (Table 6). Spare parts,
which are in critically short supply, are urgently needed for equipment
both out of order and in working condition. All equipment in need of
parts to be financed is of Western make.

C.  Characteristics and Growth of Road Traffic
3.1      Including all Government vehicles, Democratic Yemen had a fleet
of over 31.000 vehicles in 1969. The rate of growth per year fell fzpm
8% in 1965-66 to 4j in 1968-69, with passenger cars8 declining from 9T to 2%
(Table 7).  In 1968, the bulk of the vehicles (60%) waa registered in the
first governorate, which includes the city of Aden (Table 8).
3.13      Net imports of vehicles were cut to about a quarter of their
normal level following independence, but have recovered somewhat since
then, totaling about 1,200 in 1969 (Table 7). The National Company for
Foreign Trade controls all vehicular imports, distribution, and servicing.
The Government has banned imports of luxury cars to conserve foreign ex-
change.
3.14      Prior to the Appraisal Mission in August 1970, no traffic counts
were available in Democratic Yemen, exceDt those for other purposes at
customs points along the Yemen Arab Republic border. Since the mission,
the Government has initiated a program of regular traffic and traffic
data collection in order to develop a viable road development program.
Traffic counts will be expanded and developed with the assistance of the
traffic engineer who will be a member of the technical assistance team
to the ?WD (para. 4.04).
3.15      Road traffic anct the use of highways are controlled by the
Traffic Central Authority in the Ministry of Interior. In addition, in
May 1970, a Department of Public Transport and Turn Order (DPTTO) was
created as a financially and administratively independent department
within the Ministry of Interior. The job of this new department is to
distribute loads among the present surplus trucking capacity; it assigns
to truckers, on a waiting list basis, "tloads" crossing governorate bound-
aries. The waiting time between trips for large trucks ranges from 10 to
25 days ana only the 1,200 trucks now registered with the Department are
eligible for "loads". The surplus trucking capacity is likely to diminish
in future as a large number of trucks are old and are unlikely to be re-
placed. A similar situation exists for taxis. The large number of check-
points through the country suggests that transport regulation is also, to
some extent, a security control. Trucking and passenger rates are fixed
by the Department; their relationship to actual tranoport costs is doubt-
ful. During credit negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Govern-
ment that, with the aid of the tecnnical assistance tedm (para. 4.04), it
will review transport rates and regulations and, as soon as practicable
thereafter, where necessary, amend the regulations and revise the rates to
ensure that they are reasonably related to transport costs.
3.16      Existing traffic regulations are generally satisfactory.  Over-
all vehicular weight is limited to 24 tons and single axle loads to 8.5
tons, but these limitations are not effectively enforced. During credit
negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Government that it will,
witn the aid o: the technical assistance team (para. 4.0h), introduce
adequate measures to enforce vehi ular weight regulations.



D. Highway Financing and PlanniCg
3.17      From 1965 to 1969, annual highway expenditures fe'.l from YD988,000
to YD364,000 with the largest reduction in the years immediately after in-
dependence (Table 9).  The decline can be attribuited to the withdrawal of
fintancial assistance by the United Kingdom and Saudi Arabia. With the de-
cline in arnural allocations (from YD139,000 to YD12,000) for highway com-
struction over the past flive years, almost all road maintenance funds since
independence (about YD150,000 p.a.) have been diverted and spent on road
cornstruction. It is estimated that 900 min of new tracks were opened during
this time.
3.18      With the declining highway expenditures, taxation receipts from
vehicle use and ownership were more than three t-imes as large as total ex-
penditures in 1969-70, and the Government has agreed to determine an ap-
propriate relationship. Revenues from road users in 1969-70 (Table 10)
amounted to about YD1.2 million, cmposed mainly of excise taxes on fuel
and lubricants (65%), road tolls'/(24%), and license and regisLration
fees (11%). The excise taxes on diesel fuel (US#30/imp gal) and lubri-
can.ts (US¢13/imp gal) were first introduced on February 1, 1969, while
existing taxes on regular and premium petrol were raised from US16 to
US420/imp gal, the latter representing about 40% of the retail price.
Moreover, the Government is considering imposing a general tariff on all
imports into the port of Aden, including vehicles (now duty free), which
would further increase existing revenues from road users. During credit
negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Government that it will,
with the aid of the technical assistance team (para. 4.04): (a) detenmine
the appropriate level of recurrent highway expenditures (particularly for
road maintenance); (b)  determine the desired level of total highway ex-
penditures taking into account the fixture level of road user taxation
receipts, the competing needs from other sectors, ald the fiscal policy
of the Government; ana (c) make appropriations, after March 31, 1972,
from the annual budget so that funds required for highway maintenance
are consistent with the recommendations of the technical assistance team.
3.19      From independence until 1970-71, a large part of all budgetary
resources was devoted to defense and the maintenance of public administra-
tion and services; capital development expenditures were negligible. How-
ever, in 1970-71 the Ministry of Finance establisned an annual Development
Fund separated, for the first time, from the general budget. As part of
the Development Fund, tne Government proposes to allocate YD781,000 for
the highway sector during the next two years, including YD490,000 as the
local corponent of the UNDP-financed construction of the Dtukeim-Kerish
road (22.5 mi) and YD23h,000 for completion of paving of the Aden-Al Kod
road (30 mi). The UNDP project, which was approved by the Governing
Council in January 1971, will include about US$600,000 of equipment and
7T Charges by governorates for use of certain roads within their juris-
diction.



-9-
related spare parts for construction of the Dukeum-Kerish road, US$121,000
for technical asaistance (training and supervision), and US$12,000 for three
fellowships.  The UNDP estimates that construction of the road should take
less than two years, after which time the PWrI could use the equipment else-
where for maintenance and construction. The general budget for 1970-71 had
forecast revenues of YD13 million and expenditures of YD18 million. As in
previous years, the budget will not be finalized until well after the fiscal
year has started, with the result that disbursements are currently being made
on a monthly basis.
3.20       An  overall Three-Year Plan (1971-74) is being finalized by the
Economic Organization for the Public Sector and National Planning, with
technical assistance from the Soviet Union. The highway portion of the Plan
has been completed. The technical assistance team (para. 4.04) will help
expand this highway plan into a five-year highway development program. Aside
from the Association and the UNDP, the only other foreign source of assistance
forthcoming at present in the transport sector will come from Mainland China,
which signed a YD18 million loan agreement with Democratic Yemen in August
1970; anundetermined part of this loan will be used to construct a road from
Amayn through Al Mahfidb to Nigabah. The Chinese are also considering
financing construction of the Shuqrah-Ahwar and Ahwar-Wadi Sabib-Mudiyah roads.
During credit negotiations,the r(overnment advised the Association that there
has been no duplication of efforts regarding the feasibility studies.
E. Highway Design and Construction
3.21      Due to shortages of facilities and trained staff, little highway
design has been carried out by the FWD. Uncier the proposed project, the
technical assistance team will review highway design needs and make appro-
priate recommendations (para. 4.04). No highway oontractors exist in the
country, anu construction by force account has been ccnfined primarily to
improvement of tracks.
F. Highway Maintenance
3.22       Little highway maintenance is carried out in Democratic
Yemen; rectification of this situation will be the principal task of the
technical assistance team (parc. 4.04). The team will assess highway
maintenance needs; draw up a maintenance plan; introduce techniques suit-
able for local conditions; and, as part oI' PWD reorganization, advise on
the setting up of a maintenance section to administer a sound maintenance
program. During credit negotiations, the Government gave assurances that
until the team's agreed recommendations on a highway maintenance progran
and level of investment can be executed (para. 4.04), the Government will
allocate at least YD150,000 (about the present budget amount) for road
maintenance during fiscal year 1972.

IV. THE PROJECT
A. General
4.o0      The project consists of:
(a)  technical assistance, by consultants, to the PWD for
reorganization, with special emphasis on road
maintenance and workshop operations;
(b) feasibility studies, by consultants, of 191 xi of
roads, for which detailed engineering has already
been completed ana a further 307 mi of high priority
roads, for which detailed engineering has not been
completed;
(c)  redesign and detailed engineering, by cansultants,
of about 150 mi o± roads resulting from (b);
(d) procurement of spare parts for existing highway
maintenance equipment, together with woxkshop and
communications equipment; and
(e) overseas scholarships for training PWD local staff.
4.02      The Government is asking the Association to finance the foreig2
exchange costs of items (b), (c) and (d). It is asking the UNDP to finance
the3 foreign exchange costs and some local costo of items (a) and (e), with
the Bank Group acting as Executing Agency.
B. Tecinical Assistance
4.03      The Government recognizes the need to improve PWD organization,
particularly with respect to highway administration and operations, and
has requested technical assistance to help with improvements. A techni-
caL assistance team will advise the Govenument for a period of 24 months.
4.o)4     The team will review the existing organization, budgets, and
techniques of the PWD, make appropriate recommendations to the Govern-
ment, and assist with implementration of agreed recommendations. In
particular, its work will cover: (a) highway planning and expendituves
(para. 3.18); (b) deaign standards and design office organization (para.
3.21); (c) organization and improved techniques for force account teams;
(d) highway maintenance organization, planning ,and techniques, together
with an appropriate level of investment (para. 3.22); (e) management of
highway construction and maintenance equipment, together with organization
and operations oC workshops undertaking equipment repairs and servicing;



- 12 -
(f)  traffic counting, data collection, and interpretation; and (g) cost
accounting procedures. The team will also assist the Government in a
review OI0 existing trans)ort rates and regulations (paras. 3.15 and 3.16).
4.o5      After a first phase of six months, the team will make appro-
priate recommendations to the Government. Agreed recommendations will
be implemented during the remaining 18 months. During credit negotia-
tions, terms of reference for the technical assistance were agreed and
assurances were obtained from the Government that, in consultation with
the Association, it will initiate the implementation of a program in
accordance with the recommendations and conclusions of the technical
assistance team.
C. Feasibility Studies
h.o6      Feasibility studies under the project (Table U1 and Annex A)
will cover about 498 mi of roads as follows:
(a)   he balance of 191 mi from the 390 mi for which
detailed engineering exists (para. 3.05). (This
detailed engineering, if used as the basis for
construction, could possibly result in roads
of uneconomically high standards); and
(b)  307 mi of further roads which are considered to
be of high priority both by the Government and
the Association.
4.07      The studies will be undertaken to establish the economic via-
bility of the roads, together with recommendations on appropriate design
standards and priorities; they will form the basis of a five-year high-
way development program.
h.o8      The consultants appointed to undertake the studies will review
the proposed list of roads during a reconnaissance phase. During credit
negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Government that any pos-
sible amendments to the list will be subject to agreement between the
Government and the Association.
D. Redesign and Detailed Engineering
4.09      It is expected that the feasibility studies (para. 4.06) will
identify about 300 mi of feasible roads, for which construction will be
justified in the near future. About 150 mi of the highest priority roads,
from an economic view point, will be selected for detailed engineering
and preparation of bidding documents under the proposed project; con-
struction of these roads could form the basis for further Bank Group
lending. During credit negotiations, assurances were obtained from the



- 12 -
Goverrment that the list oI' roads to be selected for detailed engineering
rill be subject to agreement between the Government anc the Association.
E. Procurement oI Spare Parts ana Workshop and Communications Eguipuent
4-10      Nearly half the FWD road equipment is out of order due to lack
of spare parts, and spare parts' inventories are extremely low. To re-
habilitate this equipment and to raise the inventories to a normal level,
spare parts will be procured under the project.  Similarly, workshop
machinery and tools are inadequate. Tentative list8 of the most urgently
needed spare parts, tools, and workshop machinery have been agreed with
the Goverment (Tables 12 and 13). After the credit has been signed,
final detailed lists should be prepared by the Government, assisted by
the technical assistance team (para. 4.oL0), to establish the exact spare
parts' requirements for out of order equipmt and for restocking work-
shop stores. All equipment in need of parts to be financed is of Western
origin, and in the absence of appropriate bilateral aid, there does not
appear to be any other source of financing than the proposed IDA credit
for the spare parts.  The radio or other coimications equipment for
the NWD headquarters and regional offices are required to ensure the
establishment of a fully integrated national public works department.
F. Overseas Scholarships
4.11      The Government proposes to send up to eight candidates abroad
for training in special fields related to highway administration and
rperations. These scholarships will be staggered over a two-year period.
The teeimical assistance team (para. 4.04) will assist the Government in
selecting appropriate candidates.

- 14 -
,4.13     The costs of consulting services for technical assistance,
detailed engineering, anu feasibility studies are based on the costs of
comparable assignments in coutries having the same local ccnditions as
Democratic Yemen. An appropriate reduction in costs for detailed engi-
neering has been allowed for those roads for which some detailed engi-
neering exists (paras. 3.05 and 24.09).
24.14     The cost for spare parts is about US$210,000, including local
costs (Table 12); the FWD felt this represents the approximate cost of the
parts needed. The cost for workshop and coxmunications equipment is about
1US$340,000 including local costs. Both amounts are approximate and should
be regarded as a first step in building up the resources of the workshops.
ITuing credit negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Government
that it will continue during each of the next two years to allocate from
the budget at least YD80,000 (the present budget amount), in addition to
the contribution from credit funds, for purchases of spare parts for the
continuing maintenance of road equipment.
4.15      The cost of scholarships for each of up to eight technical per-
sonnel within the PWD is about US$1,200 per month for six months.
24.16     The foreign exchange components of the various items are deter-
mined by different factors. For consulting services, the foreign exchange
CDmponent is based on the cost of foreign experts' salaries, transporta-
tion, equipment, and major imported subsistence elements.  For spare parts,
aad workshop and commumicati-ons equipment, the foreign exchange conponent
is based on c.i.f. landed cost, Aden. The local salaries of PWD staff on over-
seas scholarships will continue, but foreign currency expenditures will be
incurred for transportation, subsistence, and fees; these form the basis
for calculating the foreign exchange component. The 10% allowance for
physical contingencies on spare parts and services is adequate, and the
3% allowance for price on spare parts will cover possible price increases
in supplier coLmtries.
H.  ProJect Finacing and Execution
4.17      The proposed credit to the Government will finance the foreign
exchange costs of consulting services for feasibility studies, detailed
erLgineering, and spare parts and workshop and communications equipment.
ThLe foreign exchange costs and some local costs of technical assisaonce
arld overseas scholarships are proposed for financing by the UDP / The
Gclvernment has indicated that it will meet the balance of the local costs,
and during credit negotiations assurances were obtained to that effect.
1/   The Government has presented an application to the UNDP for a
grant to finance these elements.



- 15 -
4.18      The PWD will be responsible for executing the project,assisted
by the technical assistance team provided by consultants (para. 4.03).
Retention of these consultants under terms and conditions satisfactory
to the Association will be a condition of effectiveness of the proposed
credit. During credit negotiations, assurances were obtained that the
Government will promptly retain consultants for the other expert serv-
ices provided in the project (paras. 4.o6 and 4.09) under terms and condi-
tions satisfactory to the Association.
4.19      Contracts for -&he procurement of spare parts  and workshop and
communications equipment will be awarded on the basis of lowest evaluated
bids, with the advantages of standardization belng taken into account where
appropriate. The Bank Group's guidelines for international competitive
bidding will be followed for procuring the communications equipment, equip-
ment for nearly all workshops, and about one-third of the spare parts
(about US$365,00O). Procurement of the remaining two-thirds of the spare
parts (about US$160,000) will be tied to the make of equipment in use and
will not be suitable for international competitive bidding.
4.20      The technical assistance team should arrive in Democratic Yemen
by mid-1971. Feasibility studies should also commence around that time
and be completed by early 1972. Contracts for equipment spare parts,
tools and workshop machinery will probably be awarded late in 1971. Staff
selected for scholarships will begin overseas training in the third quarter
of 1971 and all training should be complete by 1973. During credit nego-
tiations, assurances were obtained from the Government that,upon comple-
tion of their overseas training, such staff will continue in Government
service for at least two years.
4.21      During credit negotiations the timing of the various elements
of project execution were agreed to the satisfaction of the Association
and the Government.
I. Disbursements
4.22      On the basis of this tentative timing, the estimated schedule of
disbursements is indicated in Annex B. Disbursements of the credit would be
against approved contracts and relevant documentation, as follows:
Consulting services - the foreign exchange costs of payments
to consultants.
Spare parts and equipment - 100% of the c.i.f. landed costs.
4.23      The Association should consider applying any estimated savings
from the credit to financing purchases of additional spare parts, if these
are found to be necessary by the Association. Any surplus remaining in
the Credit Account upon completion of the project would be cancelled.



- 16 -
V. ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. General
5.01      With the poor state of the existing road network, the need for
additional competent staff in the MPWC, the shortage of funds for the trans-
port sector, and the absence of a road development program, there is an
urgent need for measures to build up the highway sector so that the agri-
cultural potential of the country can be developed. To assist with this
build up, the project will provide technical assistance to the PWD, as well
as scholarships for promising trainees, funds for badly needed spare parts,
workshop and communications equipment, and feasibility studies and detailed
engineering of roads which could form the basis for future Bank Group fi-
nancing.  Economic benefits are difficult to quantify in monetary terms at
this stage, and the justification is mainly qualitative; however, some user
savings and some savings in capital expenditures resulting from reduced de-
siign standards are certain.
B. Feasibility Studies and Detailed Engineering
5- 02     The roads listed in Annex A are of sufficiently high priority to
warrant feasibility studies and will form the basis of a five-year highway
development program. In general, the roads link the agricultural regions
in the country with the ports of Aden and Al Mukalla (see Map), from which
produce (mainly cotton, hides ana skins) is exported.  With the improvement
of these roads, savings of about 50% will accrue in vehicle operating costs.
Dmproved road communication will also promote agricultural export and im-
port through Aden, lowering the cost of food in the interior of the country.
Mc'reover, improved roads will, in a number of cases, act as a catalyst for
tLe dormant tourist industry, as well as improve political and social
cohesion by linking the various tribal comminities.
C. Spare Parts for Road Maintenance and Construction Equipment
5.03      Procurement of spare parts is urgently needed in order to get
US$500,000 of potentially useable equipment (Table 6) back into operation.
The equipment is about seven years old and its value new would be about
US$1.5 million. Injection of US$200,000 worth of spare parts will put this
equipment back into working order and will provide equipment expected to
last a further three to four years.  The credit allocation, together with
the yearly budget allocation amounting to YD80,000, will halt further can-
nibalization of equipment aned will provide for a restocking of spare parts
to normal level.
D. Workshop and Communications Equipment
5.04      The workshops are poorly equipped; they lack an adequate number
of hand tools, and some machinery is past its useful life and requires
immediate replacement. The total present value of useable tools and
macninery in the workshops is about US$100,000. With existing facilities,
the workisops are not even able to keep the presently useable equipment
(about half the total equipment)in good working order. The workshop
equipment to be provided unaer the project will enable the workshop staff



- 17 -
to improve the quality of present repairs, increase the effective opera-
tion of equipment, and service the additional road equipment to be rehabi-
litated under the project (para. 5.03). The new machinery will also enable
the workshop to produce some simple spare parts normally imported for the
road equipment. The PWD and its offices in the governorates now lack
satisfactory commmnications, resulting in inefficient operations. The radio
and other communications equipment to be provided for the PWD headquarters
and other regional offices will ensure an efficient and fully integrated
national PWD. The cost of the workshop and communications equipment to
be provided under the project is estimated at US$325,000; this will enable
road equipment (with a replacement cost of over US$3 million) to be ade-
quately serviced and provide much needed communication among the various
offices.
VI. RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      During credit negotiations the Government gave a number of
assurances in connection with the project, the most important of which
are that it will review exlsting road user rates and regulations with
the aid of the technical assistance team; and that it will make appro-
priations from the annual budget funds for highway maintenance and
spare parts for workshops and highway maintenance equipment, consistent
with the recommendations of the technical assistance team.
6.02      A condition of effectiveness of the proposed credit is reten-
tion by the Government of consultants for the technical assistance team
under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Association (paras. 4.03
and h.18).
6.03      Subject to the assurances mentioned above, the project consti-
tutes a suitable basis for an IDA credit of US$1.6 million on the usual
terms.

PEOPLE'S DEMCRATIC REP5BLIC OF YEMEN
HIGCHWAY PROJECT
Project Roads Included for Feasibility Studies (Map)
The following roads are of sufficiently high priority to warrant
feasibility studies. The list has been agreed with the Government in the
light of its recently finalized three-year highway development plan.
Al Mukalla-Say    Road and Connecting Roads in the Hadranaut
Valley, (200 jd
The rich agricultural area around Sayinm in the Hadramaut
(fifth governorate) is linked to the port of Al Mukalla by a cobblestone
road for about the last 100 mi and elsewhere by a tortuous track. Based
on appraisal mission estimates, traffic is about 50 vpd. An improved
road, particularly over the more difficult sections, will result in sub-
stantial savings in vehicle operating costs and time and will link the
Wadi Hadramaut area (where wheat, sorghum, millet, dates are grown) to
the coast. In addition, the new road will greatly enhance the tourism poten-
tial of the area. No detailed engineering exists for these roads.
Al Husn-Nageel-Al Kala - Yemen Arab Republic Border Roadl (95 Mi)
This route is located in the upper Jaffa area of the third
governorate; a track is currently being built by the army and local
people.  Access to the area is now through Amayn, Lawdar, Mukayras, the
Yemen Arab Republic, and Bani Baq. When the Aden-Al Kod road will
have been completed (scheduled for the end of 1971), a paved road will
connect Aden with Al Husn. The population of the area is about 250,000
persons and they are concentrated along the proposed route. The area
has some existing agricultural productivity and its potential is consi-
derable; in addition tourism possibilities exist. An improved road
connecting this agricultural area to Aden should result in generated
export-import traffic between Aden and the upper Jaffa area and the
important Al Baida area in the Yemen Arab Republic north of Bani
Baq. This road was included in the list for feasibility study
following the revisions proposed by the Government in their cable of
December 30, 1970; no detailed engineering exists.
Dhala-Yemen Arab Republic Border Road (12 mi)
This section will complete the Aden-Thumair-Dhala-Yemen Arab
Republic border road. The feasibility study of this road will be im-
portant in determining the feasibility of the Thumair-Dhala road discussed
below. No detailed engineering exists for this road.



ANNEX A
Page 2
As Said-Ataq-Nisab Road (50 mi)
As Said,Ataq,and Nisab are presently connected by an earth track.
As Said is the center of one of the few agricultural regions in tne fourth
governorate, where primarily cotton and millet are produced. Though no
traffic figures are available, an improved road will better link the three
towns to the main export-import route to Aden via Al Mahfidb and Wadi Sabib,
a section which Mainland China has proposed to finance. This improvement
will result in savings in vehicle operating costs, greater agricultural
exports tkrough Aden, and lower prices for imported goods (particularly
food and cl  thing). Detailed engineering of this road has been completed.
A~~aihan Road (96 mi)
Bialhan, the other major agricultural area in the fourth governor-
ate, produces wheat, barley, sorghum, and sesame. An improved road will
Lnk the two agricultural areas with Aden and will result in substantially
reduced vehicle operating costs, once the Chinese-financed roads are built.
Moreover, a road link to Baihan will facilitate the supply of food and
c'Lothing to tne area across the border in the Yemen Arab Republic, which
is virtually cut off from the centers of Taiz and Sana. Detailed engineer-
ing hasi been completed.
Lawdar-ar-thkas (25 mi
Niukayras (a town of about 21,000 including the surrounding vil-
lages. j and Lahej  are the major suppliers of the country's fruit and
vegetaCbles. Mukayras is situated at the top of a 7,000 ft mountain range,
and thus enjoys a favorable climate in the summer while Aden suffers from
excess-ive heat. Consequently, it is a favorite tourism spot for many local
citizens. Lawdar, on the other hand, lies at the base of the mountain and
is joinea to Mukayras by an extremely dangerous track which winds around
the moiounta&iside. The Customs Office at Mukayras estimates that about 70
vehicles use the road every day. Detailed engineering has been completed.
Thumair-Dhala Road (20 ml)
Thumair-Dhala is one of tne major re-export routes from Aden to
the Yemen Arab Republic. Paved roads now exist from Aden to Thumair, but
beyond. Thumair there is only an earth track to the border. Dhala reportedly
is a large population center and, in addition to being a major re-export
rcute, has some potential for ag,ricultural developuent. Detailed engineer-
ing has been completed.
