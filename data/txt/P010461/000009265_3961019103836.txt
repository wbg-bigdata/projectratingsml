INDIA
SECOND MADRAS WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:           India, acting by its President.
Beneficiaries:       Government of Tamil Nadu (GOTN) and Madras Metropolitan Water Supply
and Sewerage Board (MMWSSB).
Amount:              IBRD Loan: US$275.8 million equivalent.
Terms:               Loan repayable in 20 years, including 5 years of grace, at standard variable
interest rate.
On-Lending Terms:  Government of India (GOI) to GOTN: As part of the central assistance to States
for development projects on terms and conditions applicable at the time.
GOTN to MMWSSB: Not less than 13.5% per annum rate of interest with
repayment over 20 years, including 5 years of grace of both principal and
interest.
GOI would bear the foreign exchange risk.
Project Objectives    Madras has the lowest level of water supply of all metropolitan areas in India
and Description:     and great susceptibility to drought. The project's major objectives are to: (a)
provide water from a reliable source within the State to Madras on an urgent
basis; (b) improve the distribution of water within Madras; and (c) strengthen
conservation.
The project would consist of the following: (a) source works at the existing
Veeranam irrigation tank to the south of Madras; (b) a transmission pipeline
from Veeranam to Madras, a distance of 235 km, with associated treatment and
pumping facilities which will supply 180 million liters per day or about 38% of
existing supplies to the city, and resettlement and rehabilitation of persons
displaced on the right of way; (c) continuation of distribution improvements
within Madras being undertaken in the First Madras Water Supply Project (LN
2846/CR. 1822-IN); (d) a water conservation program including physical works
such as leak detection and repairs and tariff increases to encourage more
efficient use of water; and (e) technical assistance in the form of project
preparation and implementation support. Adequate steps would be taken to
ensure people adversely affected benefit from the project where this is possible
and otherwise are made no worse off as a result. To remove possible farmer
resistance to the proposals at Veeranam, a new regime to regulate the flow has



- iv-
been introduced following consultation under which the irrigation flows would
exceed those that would otherwise have occurred.
Benefits:             The major direct benefits of the project would be the provision of: (a) an
improved level of water supply service; (b) a more equitable distribution of
water; (c) improved conservation of water; and (d) financial and institutional
strengthening of the MMWSSB with the result of achieving better management
of services. These direct benefits would yield secondary benefits of health,
convenience to consumers, improved economic performance by the city's
industries and reduced over-exploitation of the shallow aquifers by substituting
piped supplies for private abstractions.
Risks:                The major risks likely to face the project are: (a) the capability of the water
entities in Tamil Nadu to successfully construct the transmission main; (b)
popular resistance to tariff increases that would be necessary to ensure the
satisfactory financing of the project; and (c) additionally, a risk considered
small, of failure of the source in an extremely bad drought year or sequence of
years to provide the planned volume of water. The capacity of the entities would
be addressed by careful engineering preparation using international consultants
and by the decision to assign experienced consultants, also international, to
supervise the construction phase, and by stringent pre-qualification of
contractors. Concerning tariffs, GOTN has been in compliance during the First
Project with financial covenants which have required substantial tariff increases
including an increase of about 250% on April 1, 1994.

INDIA
SECOND MADRAS WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
I. WATER SUPPLY SECTOR OVERVIEW
1.1    Some 217 million people in India live in urban areas (1991 census) and nearly 60% of India's
Net Domestic Product is generated in its towns and cities. Forecasts by the United Nations suggest that
the urban population may grow by over 400 million up to the year 2025. Urban growth is placing great
strain on already under-provided urban infrastructure and services, especially water supply. There is an
urgent need for sustainable modes of delivery which must be compatible with, and meet the requirements
of a market-oriented economy while providing efficient and effective safety nets of protection for the
urban poor.
A.    Water Supply Sector Development and Organization
1.2    Service Levels in Urban India. In 1992 the proportion of the Indian urban population receiving
water supply was 85% with approximately two-thirds served by private connections and one-third by
standposts. Coverage figures alone are an inadequate indicator of the status of the water supply sector,
however, and mask the issues of the level of service. In most Indian cities, supplies to the consumer are
intermittent and are frequently reduced to as little as two hours a day, often at very low pressures. This
has implications for the quality of water received by the consumer and increases the risk of health-
threatening contamination as a result of back-flow in the poorly maintained distribution systems.
Intermittent supplies to industrial consumers also have serious economic implications for production
particularly in water-intensive industries, such as petro-chemicals, which invest heavily in their own
sources, storage and pumping equipment.
1.3    Sector Organization at National and State Levels. Under India's constitution, the primary
responsibility for water supply rests with the states. Central Government influences the sector through
approvals of state development plans and through operations of central level institutions. The central
focal point is the Ministry of Urban Affairs and Employment. Central Government provides technical
reviews of major investment proposals from the states and guidance on design standards, coordination of
training and support for funding institutions such as the Housing and Urban Development Corporation of
India (HUDCO).
1.4    Within the framework set by Central Government, state governments determine the policies for
the water supply sector and influence sector developments through the processes of regulation of sector
agencies and resource allocations from state budgets. It is common for state governments in India to
have established special purpose entities to provide the planning, design and construction of water supply
and sanitation infrastructure. In Tamil Nadu this is with the Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage
Board (TWAD). Municipalities in India are the primary local bodies responsible for providing water
supply in urban areas though for a few of the larger cities, including Madras, special purpose entities
have been established. In Madras this is the Madras Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board
(MMWSSB, sometimes referred to as Madras MetroWater).
1.5    Tamil Nadu is located in the south of India and ranks seventh in state population and eleventh in
area. Madras is the State's capital, and the nation's fourth largest metropolitan area. The population of



the Madras Metropolitan Area (MMA) is 5.9 million (1991 census) which includes the Madras
Metropolitan Corporation (MMC) with 3.8 million and surrounding jurisdictions covering six municipal
areas, three municipal townships, 27 town panchayats, 10 panchayat unions and one contonment board
which together, amount to 2.1 million. Madras is an administrative and commercial center and has a
number of industries including the port, textiles, electrical equipment, machinery and vehicles with
petro-chemical and fertilizer industries in north Madras.
1.6    Existing Sources and Distribution in Madras. Water supply for Madras is currently obtained
from ground water sources, about 13 in number depending on how they are categorized into groups, and
three inter-connected reservoirs at Poondi, Cholavaram and Redhills. A recent survey of consumers has
found that many have their own supplies of groundwater obtained from shallow wells which, for the
domestic sector, are used for washing and cleaning purposes leaving the piped supply for drinking and
cooking. There has been underinvestment in the water distribution system for many years, leading to
poor coverage, inequitable distribution and considerable wastage through leakage and abuse.
1.7   Existing Level of Service in Madras. The maximum availability of water for Madras from
existing sources is about 290 mid which provides an average for areas covered of about 70
liters/capita/day (Ipcd) inclusive of demands by industry and other non-domestic consumers. The
corresponding figures for other cities are Bombay 253, Delhi 220, Calcutta 190 and Bangalore 125 Ipcd,
making Madras the lowest-supplied metropolitan area in India. The average per capita domestic daily
availability in Madras is only 47 liters which is well below the Indian standard of 70-100 lpcd for
individual connections in urban areas and 50 Ipcd for consumers using stand pipes.
1.8   In poor monsoon years, the water supply is reduced to periods of one to three hours on alternate
days. Occasionally this low level of supply for domestic use can only be maintained by diversion of
industrial water supply requiring industries to curtail or even cease their operations. Failure of the
monsoon combined with the practice of overdrawing the reservoir system has in the past resulted in
almost complete depletion of the storage reservoirs.
1.9   TWAD. With the exception of the MMA, the State-wide responsibility for planning, design and
construction of water supply and sewerage systems rests with TWAD. This organization was established
in 1971 for the purpose of regulating and developing drinking water and drainage investments. TWAD
has no responsibility for irrigation which has rested with the irrigation wing of the State Government's
Public Works Department (PWD), reorganized in early 1995 into the Water Resources Organization
(WRO). Generally, after commissioning, TWAD hands projects over to local bodies for operation and
maintenance (O&M). TWAD is the oldest board of this type in the country and has well developed
policies and procedures.
1.10   MMWSSB.   MMWSSB was formed as an autonomous body in 1978, and assumed sector
responsibilities formerly held by MMC. Over time its jurisdiction has extended to the MMA.
MMWSSB is a state agency, with the Chairman and Managing Director appointed by the State
Government. The Secretary to Government for Municipal Administration and Water Supply and other
senior secretaries are its directors. MMWSSB is organized in six separate sections for management
purposes: water supply and sewerage construction; operations; resource planning, project planning and
design; finance, accounting and internal audit; personnel and administration; and, inventory control and
purchasing. The total current labor force is 3,950, which has fallen since 1978 from 6,878. MMWSSB
is generally a well run utility and over the years has expanded its management systems to include
performnance budgeting and cost centers. MMWSSB has also computerized its billing and collection,
budgeting and planning. As at August 1994, there were 220,000 consumers of which 10, 000,



-3 -
predominantly industrial and commercial consumers, were metered. There are 7,554 stand pipes in the
city serving 1.8 million people.
B.    Strategies of Governments
1.11   Central Government. A national water policy document produced by the GOI's Ministry of
Water Resources in 1987 provided clear guidelines in the allocation of priorities, stating that drinking
water would be top priority in the planning and operation of water systems. It stressed that with the
increasing scarcity of water, "optimal, economical and equitable use has become a matter of the utmost
urgency". Consistent with this approach, strategies identified in India's Eighth Five Year Plan (1992-97)
include: (a) management of water as a commodity, as with any other resource; (b) the need to charge
appropriate tariffs to cover O&M and development costs where appropriate; (c) encouragement of the
private sector to develop water supply projects; (d) reduction of pollution by provision of appropriate
treatment facilities for waste and sewage; and (e) separation of the water supply and sanitation budget
from general municipal budgets for better planning, monitoring and control. Water resource
management has become an emerging feature of Central Government's strategy since the start of the
Eighth Plan. However, there is still a major gap between strategy and practice on the ground.
1.12   State Governments. While many States recognize the importance of adopting Central
Government strategies for the sector, these still need to be addressed with appropriate policies and
actions. Significant reform in the sector is taking place in only a few states, including Tamil Nadu. A
State Water Policy paper was issued by GOTN in 1994 which is consistent with GOI's paper. Tamil
Nadu was the first state to prepare such a paper. Major sector issues which need to be addressed in the
context of the project are indicated below.
C.    Sector Issues
1.13   Water Resource Management. There is a need for coherent state water resource policies
incorporating planning of river basins and covering all uses, as spelt out in the Bank's policy paper,
Water Resources Management (1993) which was discussed by the Board in May, 1993. State agencies,
including the irrigation departments, special agencies like TWAD and the municipalities need to have
greater regard to improvements in financial, managerial and technical performance; more autonomy, and
increased user involvement in management matters. A proposed Bank project, the Tamil Nadu Water
Resources Consolidation Project, would support initiatives in the State to introduce multi-sectoral water
plann;ng based on river basins, and to strengthen the State's institutional and technical capability in
water development, management and planning. It would build on the Tamil Nadu Drinking Water
Supply Sector Plan Study which has just been completed under the Tamil Nadu Water Supply and
Sanitation Project (see para. 1.20). It is recognized that growing needs of urban centers are likely
increasingly to dominate investment choices. The importance of these choices is reflected in the
establishment of an apex "Water Resources Control and Review Council" as the State's most senior
body, chaired by the Chief Minister and with three other key Ministers as Vice Chairmen. TWAD and
MMWSSB are represented in the Council.



- 4 -
1.14   Water Conservation. The demand for additional urban water supply infrastructure and
services arises from the accommodation of growth and from existing deficiencies in either coverage or
service levels, or both. In most urban areas there is an overriding need to increase the quantity of piped
water to consumers in order to reduce intermittent supplies and low pressures. This requires additional
sources and strengthened and enlarged distribution systems. Such improvements require a combination
of superior organization to facilitate these changes, better mobilization of resources to pay for them,
greater attention to the quality of construction, operation and maintenance of assets, and measures to
conserve water including appropriate tariff structures and levels. The proposed project addresses these
concerns and has a component which reflects these requirements for conservation of water including
metering, leak detection and repair and progressive introduction of tariff reforms.
1.15   Cost Recovery and Institutional Strengthening. Inadequate cost recovery is a major
constraint to improved sector performance. Raising the level of cost recovery requires the establishment
of effective systems of charging for water and sewerage. Such charges will only be effective if based on
the volume of water consumed, with proportional charges for sewerage. Linked to a system of
continuous supply at acceptable pressures, it becomes technically possible to organize the charging
system on a volumetric basis and while this principle is widely accepted in India these systems of
charging do not exist fully in any of the larger Indian towns or cities. A fully metered system of supply
would permit greater control over leakage, waste and other forms of unaccounted for water, encourage
effective conservation and would reduce operating costs. Financial strengthening is one element of
institutional strengthening, and is important for preparation of entities for corporatization. Improved
engineering, accounting and management procedures are also required. Again, the proposed project
builds on actions already being unidertaken to support these requirements by incorporating progressive
metering, a move to full volumetric charging and substantial tariff increases.
1.16   Construction Quality. Througlhout the sector, the quality of construction of new works is
extremely poor. Many local authority staff are insufficiently qualified or experienced for the tasks.
Relationships between local authority engineers and contractors are invariably strained and the use of
qualified consultants is limited. Poorly managed procurement procedures for goods, works and services
remain a major problem throughout the sector. Preparation of tender documents and evaluation of
tenders are slow. The common practice of fragmentation of works into a large number of contracts is
wasteful in administrative time and r esults in difficulties of coordination and management. The
proposed project would include major project components and would bring international expertise to the
tasks of their design and supervision.
1.17   Links to Environmental Sanitation. The provision of sanitation arrangements must go hand in
hand with water supply. Increasing the supply of water will have a consequential impact on the disposal
of wastes. In most Indian cities there is a wide gap between the level of water service and the even more
serious situation with inadequate sanitation and the outcome has been a segmental approach. As a result,
the discharges of waste leads to pollution, health risks and environmental degradation. These problems
are exacerbated by poor maintenance of drainage channels where much of the waste is routed. Although
the proposed project does not have a sanitation component, this is an important part of MMWSSB's
investment program under the existing Bank First Project (see para. 1.20), and under a future project
proposal (see para. 2.2).

D.    Lessons Learned from the Bank's Involvement in the Sector
1.18   Bank's Prior Experience in India. The Bank Group began supporting urban water supply and
sanitation projects in India in 1974 and through to the end of FY1994 had approved twelve projects,
which account for US$814 million in IDA Credits and US$173 million in World Bank Loans. Most of
the further eleven urban development projects accounting for US$990 million and US$69 million
respectively Credits and Loans, have contained substantial components of water supply and sanitation
investments. A schedule of these projects is in Annex 9. Of the twelve urban water supply and
sanitation projects, five have been single city projects mainly in the metropolitan cities.
1.19   Experience has been that the physical works financed by the Bank Group have been
implemented in a satisfactory manner although some implementation delays have been experienced in
most cases. Past projects have been less than fully successful in achieving institutional, financial or
economic improvements, which have focused on management information systems, accounting and the
achievement of full or substantial cost recovery. Failure to implement agreed initiatives within projects
has contributed to inefficiencies, inadequate cost recovery and insufficient financing of O&M. The
institutional reforms have not always been thoroughly developed or properly presented. Realistic
schedules have not always been planned, nor coordinated with the training and other technical assistance
needed to facilitate the changes. Nevertheless, there is growing acceptance by the Government of India
(GOI) and many state governments of the fundamental objectives incorporated in the Bank's sector
program. The main lessons learned are the need for: (a) use of legal covenants where the action is
critical to project success; (b) greater flexibility and use of operational action plans to be revised in the
light of changing conditions; (c) greater attention to project preparation prior to project effectiveness;
(d) persistent supervision; and (e) the active participation by central and state governments and agencies
as policy intermediaries for biringing about the necessary reforms in the sector framework.
1.20   Bank's Prior Experience in the Sector in Tamil Nadu and Madras. The Bank is funding one
on-going water supply and sanitation project in Madras, (the First Madras Water Supply and Sanitation
Project (LN. 2846/CR. 1822-IN) or the First Project) and has funded the recently completed Tamil Nadu
Water Supply and Sanitation Project (CR. 1454-IN). CR. 1454-IN in the amount of US$73 million
equivalent (Board date of March 1984 and final closing date of December 1994) met its development
objectives with substantial compliance of major covenants. There was a need for design changes and
project restructuring in 1990 because of prolonged drought which extended the original closing date from
June 1990 to December 1994. The First Project in the amount of US$69 million equivalent, for which
the Board date was June 1987 with a closing date of December 1995, should meet its development
objectives with the exception of a full 35% increase in the supply of water for Madras. Less than full
supply arises from delays in the construction of some check dams and lower than expected yields from
existing well fields due to the impact of the drought which has affected the region since the early 1980s.
Implementation has been satisfactory and legal covenants, including financial performance, are in
compliance.
E.    Bank's Sector Role
1.21   Bank support to the urban water supply sector is dependent on commitments by central and state
governments to reform. In the medium term, Bank lending would be in areas where progress has been
made in dealing with sector constraints and where there is clear sign of reform effort. The Bank's
strategy has been to seek: (al) the efficient utilization of resources through appropriate technology
choices and sound engineering design and construction; (b) an improvement in institutional capacity;
(c) pricing policies which ericourage conservation of water yet which render services affordable to the



- 6 -
poor while ensuring adequate financing of current expenditures and the production of internally
generated funds for further investment; (d) the development of water resource planning; and (e) in the
medium term, the "commercialization" of water utilities and the involvement of the private sector. The
proposed project would be consistent with all these strategic aims.
II.    THE PROJECT
A.    Project Origin and Rationale for Bank Support
2.1    Proposed Sources of Supply. The water shortage in Madras will continue until large sources of
supply are developed. The severity of the water shortage is apparent when comparing theoretical water
demand with quantities of water that are available or likely to become available in the foreseeable future.
The main new sources are the proposed Project, which is based on the Cauvery River as a source to the
south of Madras, and the development of a source of supply based on the Krishna River located in the
State of Andhra Pradesh to the north. Works are currently underway (not financed by the Bank) to
provide water by new canal and dam investments from the Krishna River which will supply the Madras
reservoir system. Krishna water will feed into Redhills from late 1995 or early 1996, where a treatment
plant is under construction under the First Project, and the water will enter the Madras distribution
system directly from the Redhills treatment plant. The estimated "theoretical" requirement for the
metropolitan area is some 1750 mld sometime after the turn of the century assuming demand of some
200 lpcd. The current project will supply 180 mid and the Krishna project is expected to supply about
400 mld in the first phase rising later to 930 mld. The overall availability is summarized in Table 2. 1,
which shows that, even after the proposed supply augmentations, there will remain significant overall
shortfalls, exceeding some 600 mid.
Table 2.1: Estimated Water Requirements & Supplies'
Estimated Net Theoretical Demand  =  I170SAlm
Current Sources                 =   290 mid
Veeranam Project                =   180 mid
Krishna - I st phase                400 mld
Krishna - later phases              530 mld
1400 mld
Less losses in distribution at 20%    = 280 mld
Remaining Overall Shortfall     =   630 mld
At about the time that the proposed project will be completed, after year 2000.
2.2    The Investment Program for Madras Water Supply. The ongoing First Project is resulting in
strengthening of the distribution system in the city and reducing waste. The priority now is to provide
more water while continuing with the distribution improvements and waste reduction. This Second
Madras Water Supply Project (the Second Project) is seen by the GOTN as an "interim" project to supply



- 7 -
much needed additional water through a 235 km long pipeline from the Veeranam irrigation tank to
alleviate the chronic shortage and to continue the work of distribution strengthening. It is proposed to
complete the work of the First and Second Projects to strengthen the distribution system, undertake
conservation measures and improve waste management in a Third Project which is under preparation.
Thus, the present Second Project must be viewed as part of a continuum of work, linking together the
First and Third Projects. From Table 2.1 it is clear that although Veeranam is a modest component of the
long-term supply, it adds 38 percent to current supply. Annex I provides descriptions of the First and
Third Projects.
2.3    There was an earlier scheme (not financed by the Bank) to bring water to Madras from the
Veeranam tank in the 1970s but this was abandoned shortly after the start of implementation due to
technical difficulties arising from the design. The current project uses basically the same transmission
concept as this earlier scheme and, for this reason, is sometimes referred to as the New Veeranam
Project. However, there are important design and implementation management changes to ensure
successful completion.
2.4    Rationale and Link to the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). Following the achievement of
many of the objectives of structural reform at the Center, priority of the CAS (draft of March 14, 1995, to
be reviewed by Board in June 1995) places priority on implementing state-level sector reforms and
improving state finances. These are essential if state governments are to play their key role in the
provision of critically needed infrastructure. The lending strategy should reflect the requirements and
characteristics of individual states. The proposed project is consistent with this priority. Through
increasing the supply of water to the city of Madras, the opportunity for sector reform is increased. The
project enhances the drive for financial strengthening of MMWSSB and the program of water
conservation. The project improves the framework and environment for private sector-led economic
growth by strengthening the public sector's effectiveness in providing an essential service.
B.    Objectives
2.5    The proposed Second Project would increase the supply of water to Madras and would lead to
significant improvements in distribution and conservation with consequential benefits for the population,
economy and the environment. The Bank's involvement would be to assist with the financing of the
works and development and of providing the stimulus for needed conservation measures and financial
discipline. The project would safeguard the interests of persons adversely affected by the project.
2.6    The major project objectives are to:
(a)    provide water to Madras on an urgent basis;
(b)    improve the distribution of water within Madras; and
(c)    strengthen conservation of water through physical means such as leakage detection and
repair and the introduction of revised water tariffs and other measures.
C.    Project Description
2.7    Overview of the Project. The Second Project would exploit part of the yield of an existing
agricultural water source, the Veeranam tank, which is a shallow balancing reservoir formed by earth
embankments on the Cauvery River system. The Veeranam tank is supplied from the Mettur Reservoir



- 8 -
located on the Tamil Nadu side of the border with Karnataka through a complex series of channels and
weirs and from its own and other catchment areas. Infrastructure would be constructed under the project
to increase the capacity of the Veeranam tank which, with additional releases from Mettur and a new
operating regime at Veeranam, would remove any impact of withdrawing water from the irrigation
system which serves local farmers. From the Veeranam tank raw water would be pumped and
transported by pipeline to a treatment plant at Vadakkuthu some 20 km away. Thereafter, the treated
water would be transported by pipeline to Madras to a terminal reservoir to be provided at Porur, in the
south-west of the city. The overall distance from Veeranam to Porur is about 235 km. 192 mid will be
withdrawn on a continuous basis from the Veeranam tank, of which 180 mid would reach Madras with
about 4% used in operating the treatment plant and 2% losses along the transmission line. From Porur
the treated water would be pumped to the city's distribution system. A project component is included to
continue the improvement of the distribution system which is underway using Bank assistance under the
First Project and also using HUDCO's financing. To the extent financially and technically feasible,
distribution system improvements in the proposed project would be targeted at lower income areas of the
city. In addition, water conservation improvements would be achieved by MMWSSB through revisions
of water tariffs linked to a metering program and physical works which are part of a distribution system
strengthening strategy.
2.8    Component 1: Source Works (US$22.1 million; 6.8 percent of base cost). Veeranam tank is an
ancient source of irrigation water for the surrounding region. The bund has been formed by a three to
four meter earthen embankment nearly 16 km long and a foreshore bund which is 9 km long. Its present
3                                          2
storage capacity is 27.7 Mm  and the water surface area of the tank is 20.8 km . The proposed major
engineering works include: raising the Veeranam bund by about 0.6 m by excavating accumulated silt
from the floor of the tank, and transporting, placing and consolidating this material to form new
embankments or to repair existing embankments; the construction of a parapet wall and other works for
prevention of wave erosion; restoration of the existing bunds; construction of a short length of new
foreshore bund to prevent submergence of land due to the raising of the reservoir, and the necessary
modifications to weirs and the spill-way. Additionally, there will be lining improvements to the
principal canal which serves the tank, the Vadavar Channel, and minor irrigation works as part of the
effort to safeguard the interests of local farmers. There will be limited displacement of population on the
embankments and nearby for which a program of compensation and reinstatement has been agreed (see
Annex 6).
2.9    Component 2: Water Transmission, Treatment and Resettlement (US$229.4 million: 70.4
percent). Construction is proposed of: a raw water intake and pumping station; rehabilitation of existing
underground storage facilities and construction of an additional storage tank; and, the laying of a
transmission main for the raw water from the tank to the treatment plant of 180 mid capacity at
Vadakkuthu. The structure for the treatment plant, constructed as part of the 1970s scheme but
abandoned, would be renovated and new mechanical and electrical equipment installed. Thereafter there
would be the laying of a single transmission main between 1525 and 1875 mm in diameter to convey the
water to Porur. The clear water would be pumped from Vadakkuthu to a high level transmission
reservoir at Kadam Pulliyar Ridge from where it would flow by gravity. There will be displacement of
encroachers on the right of way, and on road margins in Madras. As for the Source Works, a
compensation relocation and rehabilitation program has been agreed so as to ensure the restoration or
enhancement of their standard of living up to or above levels enjoyed by them prior to the
commencement of the implementation of the project (Annex 6). Operationally the project treatment of
resettlement will be as an integral part of the transmission works, but given the nature of the
expenditures to be incurred the costs are included under Component 5 of the project cost tables (Annex
13). A map showing the location of transmission and treatment proposals is provided at IBRD 26858.



2.10   The transmission pipeline will not be used for the supply of water to communities along the
right-of-way. It would not be economic to serve local communities as the water in the transmission main
will have been raised to high pressure in order that it will reach Madras, which would be too high for
water supply systems for small communities. TWAD, in association with local bodies, will be
undertaking a number of small water supply schemes in parallel with thie construction of the pipeline for
these communities which is a more economical solution. To remove as far as possible the chances of
disruption of supply due to illegal interference, and to maintain access to lands behind road margins, it is
proposed to lay and cover the pipeline in a trench for virtually its whole length. It will be supported
above ground at river and other crossings and in marshy areas.
2.11   Component 3: City Distribution (US$32.5 million; 10.0 percent). A terminal reservoir and
pumping station would be constructed at Porur. The works associated with improvements to the
distribution system will continue those of the First Project. The works would involve improvement to
the Porur-Volluvar Kottam distribution main and development of six distribution centers as part of a 16
zone system.
2.12   Component 4: Water Conservation (US$31.5 million; 9.7 percent). There will be a clearly
defined program for the successive rehabilitation of the distribution zones including leak detection and
repairs, replacements, strengthening and bulk and consumer metering. There would be progressive
introduction of comprehensive coverage of domestic metering in each zone. The program of water
conservation will include tariff increases to bring about more efficient use of water by consumers,
particularly domestic consumers who are not presently metered. The tariff increases will be required to
satisfy the financing plan and, specifically, MMWSSB's need to generate funds for its share of the
investment financing requirements (see D below). A map showing the location of distribution and
conservation measures in the city under Components 3 and 4 is provided as IBRD 26865.
2.13   Component 5: Technical Assistance for Project Preparation and Implementation Support
(US$10.5 million; 3.2 percent). The project would include preparation work and supervision of
construction for the transmission mains and other facilities, studies for and supervision of the relocation
and rehabilitation of displaced persons (see the description for Componenit 2) and preparation studies for
the Second and Third Projects relating to distribution, conservation and environmental sanitation. No
training is envisaged. The technical assistance will not include policy support or institution building in
this project.
D.    Project Cost and Financing Plan
2.14   Cost estimates for the project are summarized in Table 2.2 and presented in more detail in Annex
13. Total project costs are estimated at US$421.0 million (Rs. 16,380.37 million), including US$64.1
million for physical contingencies, US$31.0 million for price contingencies and US$28.6 million for
duties and taxes. The foreign exchange component is about US$107.8 million or 25.6% of the total
project cost.
2.15   The cost estimates are based on the findings of consultant-assisted project preparation studies.
The foreign exchange component estimates rely on the consultants' judgment based on experience and
include both direct and indirect elements of foreign exchange. The physical contingencies allowances
throughout are at the rate of 20% for works and equipment and 10% for services. Assumptions regarding
price escalation are provided in Annex 8 and include international and local inflation rates by calendar
year and movements in the US$/Re. exchange rate over the project period.

Technical assistance would be for project preparation and implementation support only. No policy support on institution
building is envisaged.
2.16   Project Financing. An IBRD Loan of US$275.8 million is recommended for the proposed
project. This would provide about 70.0% of total project costs, net of taxes and duties, or about 65.5%
including taxes and duties. It would finance all the foreign currency costs. The Loan would be made
available to the GOI, who would make the proceeds available to the GOTN in accordance with GOI's
standard arrangements for developmental assistance to the states of India. The balance of the financing
will be in the form of a GOTN grant to MMWSSB of about 17.2% of total project cost and MMWSSB
internally generated cash of 17.2% of total project cost. Justification for the GOTN grant is, in part, to
finance some items of the project which are not the direct responsibility of MMWSSB, and as such
should not be a charge to the Madras consumers, such as irrigation works and the village water schemes
on the pipeline route. The financing plan is provided in Table 2.3.

pn principal and interest. The MMWSSB contribution through internally generated cash would be yearly
throughout the project period. In order to generate sufficient cash to meet this financing requirement,
MMWSSB will adjust tariffs each year and take other actions to enable sufficient funds to be generated.
Aareement was reached at negotiations for MMWSSB to p2rovide to the Bank by the end of December of
the year preceding the relevant fiscal year, a report outlining the steps to be taken to ensure that its
contribution will be generated.
E.    Procurement

2.19   Civil Works. The project includes about US$387.4 million in civil works. Civil works
estimated to cost the equivalent of about US$276.6 million would be carried out on the basis of
international competitive bidding (ICB), in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines on Procurement,
January 1995, representing primarily the transmission mains. These works would be awarded using the
"Supply and Lay" type of contracts. In view of the large value of this component, contractors would be
prequalified before inviting them to submit their bids. The civil works at the source (estimated to cost
US$27.7 million) will be undertaken by national competitive bidding (NCB) following bidding
procedures satisfactory and acceptable to the Bank. As this work at the source is limited to a few months
each year during the non-irrigation season, it would be implemented by awarding about 12-15 contracts
each year for four years and therefore would not be of interest to foreign contractors. City distribution
and water conservation works estimates to cost US$83.1 million would also be awarded under NCB
procedures. For all civil works contracts awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding, local
contractors will be eligible for a margin of preference as allowed under the Bank's Guidelines.



- 12 -
2.20   Goods. The project includes about US$2 1.3 million for goods. The pumping stations (about
US$6.2 million) would be procured following ICB procedures, using the "Supply and Erect" type of
contracts. The water treatment plant (about US$2.9 million) where the work consists mainly of
replacement of mechanical and electrical equipment in the existing structure constructed under the 1970s
project and abandoned (including some rehabilitation of the civil works) anid the city distribution and
water conservation components as described in Ann1ex 4 would be procured following NCB procedures.
The project supports expenditures on equipment and materials for maintenance also, including vehicles.
Heavy equipment and smaller equipment in packages aggregating to US$ 1.00 million would be procured
through ICB in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines. All major goods and equipment supply contracts
which are awarded on the basis of ICB in accordance with Bank Guidelinies would give a preferential
margin to local suppliers equal to 15% of the c.i.f. costs of the competing imports or the existing rate of
customs duty, whichever is less. Other equipmenit available locally would be procured unider NCB
procedures satisfactory to the Bank. However, vehicles consisting of four-wheel drive, maintenance
trucks and cars for supervision up to a value of US$1.00 million would be procured in batches over the
project period following national shopping by obtaining quotationis from at least three reputed suppliers.
2.21   Consultants Services. Detailed engineerinig and supervisioni services (US$12.2 million) would
be carried out by consultants for purposes of project preparation and implemenitation support whose
qualifications, experience and terms and conditionis shall be satisfactory to the Bank. These will be
selected in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines: Use of Consultanits by World Bank Borrowers and by
the World Bank as Executing Agency (August 1981). The contract for the detailed engineerinig design of
the transmission main system to be financed ulider the First Project was signed with Acer Consultants
Ltd. of the United Kingdom in association with Shalh Teclhnical Consultants Pvt. ILtd. of Bombay in
February 1995. It is expected to finish by October 1995 with over 50%1/o of the work completed by June
1995. Submission of final designs and tender documents satisfactory to the Bank and incorpora
recommendations of an independent engineerinlg reviewv would be conditionis of Loan effectiveness.
2.22   The GOTN has agreed to employ international engineering conIsultanits to supervise construction
of the transmission main and would appoint them following selection procedures as per the Banik's
Guidelines. The role of the consultant would be defined in the Bidding DoctIMnetits and the conistruction
contract between TWAD and the construction coiitractor ultimately selected for the work as well as In
the contract to be finalized between TWAD and the consultant selected to supervise the constructioln
work. Agreement was reached at negotiationis that: the construction supervision consultanits would be
appointed before award of the transinission main constructioni contract: TWAD will submit final designs
and tender documents for rural water supply along the right of way satisfactory to the Bank by June 30,
1996: and the WRO would submit a program satisfactory to the Batik for the moderizationi of the
Veeranam Command system including designs. tender docutiiemits aiid schedules by December 31. 1995.
2.23   All civil works contracts in excess of US$500,000, all goodIs package contracts in excess of
US$200,000 and all consulting contracts in excess of US$ 100,000 for firms, US$50,000 for individuals,
will be subject to prior review by the Bank. With respect to all consulting contracts, irrespective of
value, prior review will continue to be required for: (a) terms of reference; (b) single source contracts
regardless of value; (c) all consultant contracts anid assignmenits of a critical nature (for exaniple, because
of environmental safety or public healtlh considerations) regardless of value; and (d) contract
amendments valued at more than US$ 100,000 equivalent, or those that raise the total contract value
about US$100,000 equivalent. All Prequalification Documents would be subject to the Bank's review
prior to inviting prospective applicants to prequalify. The Bank would also review prequalification
evaluation reports before the borrower notifies the successful applicants.



- 13 -
2.24   The Bank's latest Stanclard Bidding Documents for Works (including Prequalifications), Goods
and Consulting Services will be used during the implementation of this project. Contractors will be pre-
qualified for the major and complex works such as the transmission mains. For city distribution and
water conservation, contracts would be single responsibility contracts whereby contractors will be
responsible for the supply of materials. The consultant acting as the Engineer to supervise construction
will be appointed under the same general conditions of contract as used by the Municipal Corporation of
Greater Bombay for the marine outfalls in preparation for the proposed Bombay Sewer Outfalls Project.
2.25   Procurement Management. At negotiations, assurances on the following tightened procedures
for procurement were recorded:
(a)    as a minimum., all bid invitations would be advertised in newspapers with national
circulation ancd shall contain in summary form the post-qualification requirements. Bid
documents shalil be provided promptly upon request, upon payment of the prescribed fee,
and shall be sent by mail upon request;
(b)    bids shall be evaluated, contract award approvals sought and granted and contracts
signed, all within the bid validity period, and a justification for any exceptions shall be
forwarded to the Bank;
(c)    at time of bid opening, implementing entities would appoint (or retain) a suitably
qualified individual (the Evaluator) to prepare a signed and dated Bid Evaluation Report
(BER), following a format and content acceptable to the Bank. The BER will be
prepared as expeditiously as practicable;
(d)    GOTN have appointed an Empowered Committee with a constitution acceptable to the
Bank, which is authorized to recommend, and up to specific limits, to award contracts.
The BER shall be submitted to the Empowered Committee within seven working days of
its completion. The Committee members would sign dated minutes of their proceedings,
recommendations and decisions which would be kept on file, for possible review by the
Bank, and, where required, also furnished promptly for approval along with the BER;
and
(e)    regular (quarterly) monitoring reports to the Bank would contain summarized
procurement data including for each contract, the dates of bid invitation, receipt,
evaluation, approval and signing, and the names of contractors bidding, offer prices and
firm awarded the contract.
F.    Disbursements
2.26   The proceeds of the Loan would be disbursed against:
(a)    64% of expenditures for civil works ($245.3 million of Loan amount);
(b)    100% of foreign expenditures for goods which are imported and 100% of local
expenditures (ex-factory) for goods which are manufactured locally; and 80% of
expenditures for goods procured locally off-the-shelf ($18.3 million of Loan amount);
and

(c)    100% of expenditures of consultants services ($12.2 million of Loan amount).
Disbursement against civil works contracts with a value of over US$500,000 and against equipment
contracts over US$200,00 equivalent would be fully documented, as would disbursements for
consultants services with firms for contracts over US$ 100,000, and individuals over US$ 50,000.
Disbursements against other expenditures would be made against statements of expenditures (SOEs).
Supporting documentation for SOEs would not be submitted to the Bank but would be retained by
TWAD and be made available to Bank staff during supervision.

2.28   Special Account. To facilitate project implementation and to reduce the volume of withdrawal
applications, a Special Account will be established in US dollars with an authorized allocation to the
Reserve Bank of India of up to US$ 12.0 million, which is equal to the estimate of four-monthly average
disbursements, apart from very large contracts. Replenishment would be made quarterly or whenever the
special account is drawn down by about 50% of its initial deposit, whichever comes earlier. Agreemen



- 15 -
was reached at negotiations that the Special Account will be audited annually by auditors acceptable to
the Bank and accounts and audits would be provided within nine months of the end of the fiscal year.
2.29   Retroactive Financing. GOTN have requested the Bank's retroactive financing for works at the
Veeranam tank and for priority distribution works. It is recommended that retroactive financing of up to
US$8.60 million is made for expenditure incurred after November 1, 1994 for priority distribution works
(valued at US$8.00 million) in the city of Madras and initial source works (valued at US$600,000) at
Veeranam tank. Retroactive financing would apply only where procurement is carried out in accordance
with Bank guidelines.
G.    Operation and Maintenance (O&M)
2.30   When completed, the entire project works from the Veeranam tank off-take will form an integral
part of the MMWSSB's water supply system. The works will be shown on the balance sheet of
MMWSSB which will have full responsibility for O&M. As the major part of the transmission system is
outside the jurisdiction of MMWSSB, the tasks of operations and maintenance may be entrusted under
appropriate agreements to third parties, which could include TWAD. The tank itself will remain
primarily a facility for irrigation and as such will continue to be operated and maintained by the WRO.
H.    Dam Safety
2.31   Veeranam Tank. The Veeranam tank storage capacity is to be raised by financing provided
under the project. Under Bank guidelines for dam safety. a panel of experts would be appointed to
review the safety of the embankment. The task of the panel of experts should be greatly eased by
recently completed geotechnical investigations of the existing structure. The State's Dam Safety
Directorate inspected the tank in February, 1995.
2.32   Mettur Dam. No works are proposed at the Mettur Dam under the proposed project but this
does provide source water for the Veeranam tank. The PWD has provided the Bank with the last
inspection report by the State Dam Safety Directorate in November 1994. The report of this inspection is
being reviewed by the Bank's dam safety specialists.
I.     Environmental Assessment
2.33   The project activities during the pre-construction, construction and operational phases will have
both positive and negative impacts on various elements of the environment. Environmental mitigation
and monitoring plans have been prepared that address the potential adverse impacts and are presented
along with a summary of the findings of the Environmental Assessment (EA) undertaken by the National
Environmental Engineering Research Institute of Nagpur in Annex 14.
2.34   Positive Impacts. The most significant impact will be the improvement expected in public
health through the increased quantity, quality and reliability of water supply in the MMA. Augmentation
of the city's water supply is expected to reduce abstraction from the shallow aquifers in and around the
city, helping to reduce over-exploitation and possibly saline intrusion.
2.35   Negative Impacts. Increased supply will, of course, lead to increased wastewater volume.
Madras is one of the few cities in India to have invested on a large scale in secondary treatment of
wastewater as well as reuse of treated effluent. Expansion and upgrading of wastewater collection and
treatment systems are not included in this project as they are already components of the First Project and



- 16-
are proposed, along with low cost sanitation, as components of the Third Project. Annex I provides
further information on environmental sanitation arrangements in the First and Third Projects.
Construction of bunds at the Veeranam tank, transmission mains and related infrastructure will result in
the loss of some agricultural land for which there will be appropriate compensation and rehabilitation
and resettlement of project affected persons. There will be adequate mitigation measures to minimize
soil erosion due to the excavation of trenches for transmission pipelines. There will be some
concentration of dust and noise nuisance during construction activities for which, again, there are
mitigation measures in the plan. Normal traffic flow will be interrupted during construction particularly
along stretches of national and state highways. The conclusion of the environmental assessment for the
project, however, is that the environmental impact will on balance be significant and positive.
2.36   Assurances were received at negotiations that all involved agencies will receive adequate
numbers of copies of the Environmental Mitigation and Monitoring Plan and include the mitigation and
monitoring measures in their designs, tender documents, construction supervision procedures and
operating procedures, as appropriate. In particular, in preparing terms of reference for consultants to
supervise the construction of the transmission main, TWAD will be required to define explicitly the
consultants' responsibility to monitor and enforce implementation of mitigation measures that are the
contractor's responsibility. Once augmented by these consultants, TWAD and MMWSSB and WRO
have adequate staff and equipment to supervise implementation of mitigation measures during
construction. Some specialized training may be required. Each agency currently has its own training
center and on-going training programs for its managerial, administrative and technical staff and where
appropriate, the programs will be adjusted to cover environmental topics which are pertinent to this
project. TWAD's laboratory has capability to perform the standard water quality analyses recommended
in the environmental management plan. TWAD will contract with qualified agencies for more
specialized testing and for the recommended air quality and noise monitoring during construction.
2.37   Assurances were obtained at negotiations that TWAD would make arrangements for public
contact offices to provide information to and receive questions and complaints from the public during
construction activities. MMWSSB already has a public relations office which could serve this purpose.
The District Collectors' offices, which will be playing a key role in coordinating road closures, will be
provided with advance information on the nature of and schedule for planned construction activities.
Annex 14 reports on the public consultation and disclosure activities conducted as part of the EA
preparation.
J.     Safeguards for Farmers
2.38   The Veeranam tank will have increased capacity following the source works under Component I
of the proposed project which will be used to store additional releases at certain times from Mettur. The
supply available to local farmers for irrigation purposes will exceed the supplies currently received in
normal, bad and very bad years. Thus the interest of the farmers are safeguarded despite the offtake for
Madras. However, during public consultations carried out as part of the project environmental
assessment, the farmers in the Veeranam command area stressed the need for formal operating rules at
the Veeranam tank. As a result of these discussions the GOTN has issued operating rules and a
contingency plan in a Government Order in October 1994. Government also has mechanisms in place
throughout the State to deal with and compensate for crop failure caused by drought which would apply
to the Veeranam irrigation command area. GOTN agreed at negotiations to continue the process of
public consultations with the affected farmers using a Non Governmental Organization (NGO). the
farmers associations and local governments, to ensure that full consensus continues to be achieved in the
application of the operating rules.



- 17-
K.    Relocation and Rehabilitation
2.39   The number of project-affected persons is 168 and project affected encroachers is 1,261, a total
of 1,429. Of these, 521 will require only resettlement, 864 will require only rehabilitation and 44 will
require both resettlement and rehabilitation (R&R). An R&R policy has been prepared, which is similar
to the proposed Tamil Nadu Water Resources Consolidation Project, along with an R&R action plan.
These are incorporated into a Government Order which has been reviewed by the Bank for consistency
with the relevant Operational Directive (OD 4.30). Implementation of the R&R policy will reflect the
progress of the project, with displacement to be undertaken as needs arise. Implementation will be
GOTN's responsibility working through District R&R Committees under the District Collector, and
NGOs will be used to facilitate the process, for example, by finding alternative sites and undertaking
training. Most displacement will be along the pipeline right-of-way where there is scope for many of the
affected persons to be re-settled at their pre-existing locations following the works. TWAD will
undertake monitoring and evaluation of implementation and will report findings to the PMG. The action
plan is estimated to cost Rs 9.9 million (US$0.3 million), but assurances have been received that
additional funds would be made available if required. Implementation of the R&R action plan would be
a covenant in the legal agreements. Details of the R&R policy and action plan are provided in Annex 6.
L.    Land Acquisition
2.40   The transmission right-of-way and land for associated facilities is already in TWAD ownership.
Additional small quantities of land currently held by GOTN will be required to allow construction of
four distribution zone headworks in Madras.
2.41   TWAD have obtained agreements in principle from the relevant highway authorities to allow the
transmission main to be constructed in the highway reserves in the outskirts of Madras between
Kelambakkam and Porur.
M.    Status of Preparation
2.42   Detailed engineering designs, satisfactory to the Bank, have been completed for at least 50% of
total project costs. Prior to effectiveness. TWAD would submit final designs and tender documents for
the transmission main, pumping stations and treatment plant satisfactory to the Bank. incorporating the
recommendations on an independent engineering review. It would be covenanted that by December 31.
1995 MMWSSB award a contract to consultants acceptable to the Bank for preparation of final designs
and tender documents for the initial phase of work for the distribution system component. and that
documents satisfactory to the Bank would be submitted by December 31. 1996.
N.    Accounts and Audits
2.43   MMWSSB has developed its entity accounting and management information systems under the
ongoing First Project. The accounts are produced according to commercial accounting procedures and
are produced in a timely fashion and without substantial audit comment. Both MMWSSB and the GOI
have complied with audit covenants under the First Project. The entity accounts are audited by an
auditor acceptable to the Bank within nine months of the end of the fiscal year and assurances would be
sought at negotiations to continue this arrangement under the proposed Second Project.



- 18 -
2.44   PMG (para 3. 1) will make reimbursement claims, submit SOEs and maintain separate project
accounts. Agreement was reached at negotiations that SOEs and project accounts will be audited by an
auditor acceptable to the Bank and provided within nine months of the end of the fiscal year.
2.45   Under the financing arrangements for the project (para 2.16) MMWSSB will be required to
generate about 17.2% of the annual investment program by internal cash generation. Agreement was
reached at negotiations that a plan acceptable to the Bank will be submitted by the end of December of
the year preceding the commencement of the relevant fiscal year providing details of the steps to be
taken by MMWSSB to generate the required funds.
0.    Insurance
2.46   Agreement was reached at negotiations that MMWSSB and TWAD will take out and maintain
with responsible insurers, or make other provision satisfactory to the Bank, adequate insurance consistent
with appropriate practice.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A.    Management Arrangements
3.1    Three agencies are concerned with the implementation of the project, MMWSSB, TWAD and
the WRO, the former irrigation wing of PWD. A Project Management Group (PMG) chaired by the
Secretary, Municipal Administration and Water Supply and consisting of technical, administrative and
finance staff deputed from all three agencies has been established by GOTN to oversee the
implementation of the project. TWAD is the agency responsible for the construction of the pumping,
transmission and treatment systems. MMWSSB is responsible for implementation of the distribution
and conservation component. WRO is the agency responsible for all source-related works.
3.2    An updated operational action plan (OAP) for implementation of the project was discussed at
loan negotiations. All items in the preliminary draft OAP are being satisfactorily addressed. Agreemen
was reached at negotiations that the MMWSSB and TWAID would carry out the project in accordance
with the implementation program (Annex 11).
B.    Supervision and Monitoring
3.3    The PMG will be responsible for the day-to-day management of the project. The OAP would be
updated annually or as circumstances require. The OAP will include a detailed implementation schedule,
monitoring indicators and allocation of budgets according to sound project management procedures and
analyses. It is proposed to use project management software for tracking progress and revising schedules
according to optimizing procedures which would be shared by the PMG and Bank supervision team
members. Additionally, at negotiations agreement was reached concerning the content of regular.
quarterly monitoring reports to be submitted to the Bank. The time required for project supervision by
Bank staff and consultants is not expected to be substantially different from the average for water and
sanitation projects in the Region, which is currently about twelve weeks per year. The proposal is for
two supervision missions annually. One to report on covenant compliance and sort out problems will be
longer in duration, and the other to be concerned with monitoring progress will be shorter. As
supervision efforts for this project will be undertaken in parallel with the supervision of the remaining



- 19 -
phases of the First Project, and the preparation and initial phases of supervision for the Third Project, it is
likely that there will be some significant supervision cost sharing between these projects and that
supervision costs will be below average for the proposed project. A supervision plan is provided in
Annex 16.
3.4    Monitoring Indicators. During negotiations it was agreed that the indicators which appear in
Annex 5 would be reviewed on a quarterly basis except for the source works which would be reviewed
annually in July. These indicators cover physical implementation, water conservation and key financial
indicators related to the project.
C.    Implementation Schedule
3.5    Table 3.1 provides schedules for the design, procurement, construction and commissioning of the
project components involving works. The project is scheduled to be completed by December 31, 2001
and the Loan would close June 30, 2002. Commissioning of the augmentation of water supply through
the transmission pipeline is expected towards the end of year 1999 or early 2000.

D.    Role of Bank During Project Implementation
3.6    Procurement documents, following standard bid documents for India agreed December 1993, for
the major project components, are subject to Bank prior review. Progress of the engineering works will
be closely monitored and corrective actions recommended, as appropriate, to avoid undue delays in
implementation. Attention of Bank staff will also be directed towards monitoring progress by
MMWSSB in water conservation improvements and the associated revisions of water tariffs, an
improved water metering program and distribution system improvement strategy. Close attention will be
given to the R&R aspects of the project and to the implementation of provisions to safeguard the
irrigation rights of farmers in the Veeranam Command area. Agreement was reached at negotiations that
a mid-term review of the project would be carried out by GOTN, MMWSSB. WRO and TWAD by
September 30. 1998 and that a report would be prepared by about March 31, 1998, under terms of
reference satisfactory to the Bank, which would provide the foundation for the mid-term review. A
Supervision Plan is provided in Annex 16.
IV. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
A.    MMWSSB: Recent Financial Performance
4.1    Actions which have been undertaken as part of the First Project have significantly improved the
overall performance of MMWSSB including its financial performance. Financial Statements covering
the Income Statement, Balance Sheet and Sources and Applications of Funds are to be found in Annex
8. The Income Statements are summarized in Table 4.1 for the years 1991/92 to 1994/95 (provisional).
The net income of the entity has transformed from a deficit at the start of this period to an expected profit
of Rs. 229 million last fiscal year. This improvement has occurred despite the significant problems
encotintered with the drought which led to substantial increases in operating expenses for which there
was, in 1993/94, an exceptional Government operating subsidy.

4.2    Tariff Increases. There was a major water tariff revision effective April 1, 1994 which largely
accounts for the expected increase of net income for 1994/95. Domestic flat rates were increased from
Rs. 12 per month to Rs. 30 per month, while industrial rates were increased from Rs. 12 per m3 to Rs. 30
per m3 with similar increases for all other consumer categories. The tariff revision and changes which
have occurred in the property tax assessments are expected to increase MMWSSB's projected internal
cash generation to Rs. 223 million in 1994/95, from Rs. 20 million generated in 1993/94. This projected
internal cash generation is more than sufficient to meet the OAP target cost recovery as covenanted for
the current fiscal year under the First Project. As part of project preparation a comprehensive tariff study
has been undertaken which provides substantial and reliable data on the use and affordability of water in
Madras, including evidence of the water obtained by consumers from sources other than MMWSSB.
B.     Water Conservation
4.3    The proposed project will continue the work started under the First Project to improve the
conservation of water. A water distribution and conservation strategy has been prepared and details are
provided in Annex 7. Agreement was reached at negotiations that the water distribution and
conservation strategv would be adopted and implemented in order to realize the full benefits from
reducing leakage, wastage and unaccounted for water generally.
4.4    The strategy for water conservation has three main elements: equitable distribution; metering;
and, a program of leak detection and rectification. More equitable distribution will be achieved through
the component of the project which provides for strengthening the distribution system. These distribution
works would include pumping mains and trunk mains; distribution stations each comprising a ground
level reservoir, pumping station and elevated reservoir to serve each zone; and, zonal distribution
networks. These distribution improvements will ensure that the pressure will be better maintained and
that tail-end areas do not suffer from very low pressure.



- 22 -
4.5    Metering.    Meters are not fully effective under a low pressure and intermittent supply. At
the present time metering is restricted to high volume consumers. It is proposed to implement a metering
program for all consumers sequentially, in zones covered by the project, and to move as quickly as
practicable to a volumetric charging system for all but the stand-pipe consumers during the course of the
project.
4.6    Leak Detection and Rectification.    Studies were carried out in 1989/90 covering about 10%
of the city's water supply distribution system to identify sources of unaccounted for water and to evolve
a sequential program for carrying out detection and remedial actions. MMWSSB is undertaking a
program of replacement of mains. Mains of sizes 200 mm and below which are more than 50 years old
have been replaced during the last ten years. Work will continue with appropriate identification and
rectification measures including removal of illegal connections, improved billing performance, metering
and water repairs. Savings would certainly increase with the quantity of water distributed within the
system with the proposed project and with the arrival of Krishna water. About 20% of the city's water
distribution system has been covered by a program of unaccounted-for water reduction and a further 15%
would be covered by the First Project. At present bids are being invited in respect to works covering
60% of the city area.
4.7    Some additions to the water conservation strategy were agreed at the time of negotiations: (a)
inclusion of a public awareness program for the conservation of water; (b) introduction of completion
targets at semi-annual dates for the physical components of the water conservation plan; and, (c)
introduction of progressive volumetric tariffs as the metering program is expanded. Implementation of
the water distribution and conservation strategy would be a dated covenant in the legal agreements.
C.    Water Tariffs and Project Financial Analysis
4.8    The significant increase in tariffs introduced on April 1, 1994 (para 4.2) puts MMWSSB in a
strong position to move forward to implement the proposed project. Additionally, it has been agreed that
there shall be at least 10% annual increases in tariffs over the project period. However, the requirement
of the financing plan that 17.2% of the cash requirements for investment should be internally generated
by MMWSSB will mean that the tariff increase will need to significantly exceed 10% in some years.
Financial projections have been performed for MMWSSB which appear in Annex 8. On the assumption
that the Krishna water does not enter the system and the Third Project is not implemented (that is,
assuming a stand-alone Second Project), the domestic charge per connection will need to rise from Rs.
30 to about Rs. 50 in the year 2000 and the tariff for industry will need to rise from about an average of
Rs. 25 per m3 to about Rs. 40 per m3 in the year 2000 which is consistent with the 10% annual increase.
Thereafter, there would be significant one-time increase in the year 2001 when tariffs would need to
increase by an additional 30% as the cash requirements to cover the debt servicing of the project
following the five-year grace period start to come into effect. It would be covenanted that MMWSSB
would need to generate its contribution to the financing plan of 17.2 percent from internal cash
generation (para. 2.17) which mainly would arise from tariff increases. The tariff study indicates that for
domestic consumers with private connections increases of this order of magnitude are affordable. Slum
dwellers are shielded from the tariff and tax increases as they receive water from standpipes at no charge.
4.9    Financial projections are conservatively stated as they do not fully take into account
improvements in financial performance because of the implementation of the water conservation
strategy. It is not practicable at this stage to estimate the tariff implications of the proposed conservation
measures but they would be beneficial, increasing as the implementation of the plan extends
incrementally across the whole city. Additionally, the financial projections do not take into account



- 23 -
additional net income from the Krishna River source. Sensitivity analyses have been performed
incorporating the Krishna water and the expected incremental costs of the Third Project. These
sensitivity analyses show that there would be additional sales early on, starting from 1996/97 and
increasing through to about 2001, which would add about Rs. 700 million annually to the net income of
MMWSSB assuming that the 10% per annum tariff increase applies. After about the year 2001 the
additional costs of the Third Project would reduce the net income to a deficit in at least a few years and
some additional tariff increase beyond that projected for the Second Project would be required to meet
the investment cost requirements from internally generated sources. The conclusion of the sensitivity
analyses therefore is that the Krishna water would be beneficial to the financial performance of
MMWSSB during the project period (although not necessarily later on) which adds reassurance that the
contribution to the Second Project investment costs will be forthcoming from MMWSSB.
V.    PROJECT JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
A.    Economic Evaluation
5.1    The major direct effects of the proposed project would be the provision of: (a) an improved level
of water supply service; (b) improved distribution within the city leading to a more equitable outcome;
(c) improved conservation of water; and (d) better management of the services. These direct benefits
would yield secondary benefits. Greater domestic supply would provide health improvements and
convenience benefits to the general public and to the poor. With the shortage of water experienced in
Madras the risk of epidemics is high, and reducing the risk would be a major benefit. The city's
economy is mostly dependent on the public water supply and there would be cost savings from the
improved service. Environmental benefits would arise due to reduced over-exploitation from private
tapping of the shallow aquifers.
5.2    The costs of the project include construction and incremental O&M. The transmission mains
and associated works are dominant for both aspects of costs, with power for pumping being the single
largest item of O&M. Optimization of the pipeline options involved a least cost analysis incorporating
these factors (Annex 4), utilizing the economic costs of power supply.
5.3    Economic Rate of Return (ERR). Calculations have been performed for the transmission
mains and related works only, since estimation of the benefits arising from distribution improvements in
the city would be complicated by their programmatic nature, being part of the continuous upgrading
started in the First Project and continuing with the Third. The principal benefit arising from the
transmission main is the supply of additional water to Madras. The ERR calculations were carried out
using constant February 1995 prices, and the application of a standard conversion factor of 0.9 to all
items valued in Indian currency. 180 mid is assumed to be delivered at Porur from the transmission main
and to enter the distribution system where losses after the year 2000 are assumed to be 20%, following
distribution and conservation improvements.
5.4    The benefits of the incremental water have been calculated using willingness to pay derived from
high cost tanker purchases for domestic consumers, and payments made for water by industrial and
commercial consumers from all sources, including MMWSSB. This evidence was obtained from the
recently completed tariff study. Actual payments will understate the ERR since consumers may be
willing to pay more than they do pay. Moreover, the water will augment the city's supply and there will
be widespread benefit to all consumers, including the urban poor and industries.



- 24 -
5.5    Annex 2 sets out the economic analysis according to basic assumptions and results of sensitivity
analyses. The ERR for the project is calculated to be 13.0 percent. A delay of two years in construction
execution would reduce the ERR to 11.0 percent as a consequence of deferral of the project benefits, and
a three-year delay would reduce the ERR to 10.1 percent. A 10 percent increase in capital costs over and
above the project's physical contingencies, which have been included as basic assumptions, would
reduce the ERR to 11.9 percent. The findings of the economic analysis are that: the ERR is above the
commonly adopted target for infrastructure projects (12.0 percent); compares favorably with other
projects in the water supply sector; and, is robust with respect to assumptions regarding capital costs.
Non-quantified benefits which should be considered in the overall assessment include the significant
reduction in the risks of epidemics and other health hazards in the city of Madras, convenience of
consumers, and the opportunities provided for more efficient utilization of water derived from the
implementation of the water conservation strategy.
B.    Impact on the Urban Poor
5.6    The project will benefit all consumers directly and indirectly. Residents will receive increased
and more reliable supplies. The poor will benefit particularly since they suffer most from the adverse
impacts of health and inconvenience due to inadequate water supply at present. They are less able to
afford the privately owned borewells and without private connections they are unable to store water.
Thus, although benefits of the project will be widely distributed in Madras, there will be particular
benefits to the poor which will be enhanced by the policy of providing supplies free at public standpipes.
The poor will also benefit indirectly through the strengthening of the economy of the city through direct
and indirect employment opportunities.
C.    Environmental Benefits
5.7    The most obvious and significant positive environmental impact of the Second Project will be
improvements expected in public health through increased quality, quantity and reliability of water
supply in the MMA. Additionally, the augmentation of water supply is expected to reduce abstraction of
ground water from shallow aquifers in and around the MMA. Adverse environmental effects of the
project have been safeguarded (paras. 2.33 to 2.36 and Annex 14.)
D.    Project Risks
5.8    The major risks likely to face the project are: (a) the capability of TWAD to
successfully construct the 235 km long transmission main; (b) the popular resistance to tariff
increases particularly around the year 2000 when they may need to exceed 10% annually; and (c)
a small risk that the source may in an exceptionally bad year or sequence of years fail to yield the full
192 mid (Annex 3).
5.9    The risk of inadequate execution capacity by TWAD will be mitigated by careful engineering
preparation using international consultants and also by the decision to assign experienced international
consultants to supervise the construction phase. Stringent prequalification of construction contractors
will also reduce the risk of time and cost overruns. The risk of default by GOTN in granting tariff
increases is not great as covenants relating to cost recovery in the First Project are in compliance and the
Government supports the principles of full cost recovery. A substantial tariff increase took place on
April 1, 1994 without significant incident.



- 25 -
5.10   It is clear that for the purpose of the project it will not be feasible to obtain any form of assurance
from the Government of Karnataka that the release of water from the Cauvery system into the Mettur
dam will continue. Nevertheless, there is a long established arrangement between the States of Tamil
Nadu and Karnataka and there is no indicationi that it would be discontinued. The quantity of water to
Madras represents 1.5% of Cauvery River releases to Tamil Nadu. It is recommended to proceed with
the project since this r isk must be weighed against the advantages in relieving the hardships being
experienced by the people in the MMA. Tlhere are no indications to date that the farmers at Veeranam
will reject the proposals for safeguarding their irrigation interests, but consultations facilitated by an
NGO, the farmers associations arid local governments are underwav, and will be continued in order to
achieve and maintain full consenisus.

INDIA
SECOND MADRAS WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Descriptions of the First Madras Water Supply and Sanitation Project and
Proposed Third Madras Water Supply and Environmental Sanitation Project
1.    The proposed Second Project should be considered as part of a program of actions which will
greatly enhance the water supply of the city and the quality of water management. This Annex outlines
the characteristics of the First Project, currently ongoing, and the Third Project, under preparation, so
that the context for the proposed Second Project can be better appreciated.
The First Madras Water Supply and Sanitation Project
2.    This project is financing about 60% of MMWSSB's investment program and is aimed at
increasing water supply and improving water distribution and sewage services in the MMA. The project
optimizes the use of existing resources and assists MMWSSB with the development of a plan for
managing medium and long-term water supply solutions of larger scope, including the Veeranam and
Krishna supplies. It also strengthens MMWSSB's financial and operational performance and is leading
to significant improvements in its capacity to manage the sector.
3.    The project components are as follows:
(a)    Augmentation of water supply sources (US$ 44.10 million]). This component increases
the amount of water supply to the city by about 102 mid and improves the reliability of
supply in drought years through a program of surface/ground water conjunctive use. It
includes the development of three new well fields, construction of check dams across the
Kortalaiyar River to retain seasonal floods and increase groundwater recharge and the
seasonal transfer of flood waters from the Arani River into the Kortalaiyar River through
a linking canal.
(b)    Improvements to the water supply and distribution system (US$ 11.06 million). This
component is rehabilitating, upgrading and extending the water supply and distribution
system in Madras. The component consists of construction of transmission mains,
ground level storage and pumping stations to distribute the additional water and
strengthening the existing distribution network.
(c)   Improvements to the sewage system (US$ 11.33 million). This component is improving
the effectiveness and extending the existing sewage collection system that provides
services to slums and low-lying areas of Madras. It consists of laying new and
replacement sewers, improving ten sewage pumping stations, and the provision of
collection, transmission and disposal arrangements for sewage.

(d)    Institutional strengthening (US$ 7.60 million). This component consists of the provision
of training, technical assistance and employee incentive program which is: (i)
strengthening the productivity of MMWSSB in three key areas - engineering design
and planning, O&M and financial recovery; (ii) promoting the regulation of groundwater
extraction; (iii) assisting the planning and development of medium and long term water
supply solutions; (iv) providing a low cost sanitation program; and (v) improving policy
formulation, analysis and setting priorities.
4.     The planned area for the First Project is larger in size than the pre-existing water supply and
sewerage areas. These new areas are planned to be serviced in stages. The First Project serves Madras
city where the water, sewerage and sanitation needs are most pressing, and the Manali Industrial Park.
Under the project the area of piped water is being extended from 151 sq. km to about 163 sq. km. and
from about 117 sq. km. for water-borne sewerage services to about 145 sq. km.
The Proposed Third Madras Water Supply and Environmental Sanitation Project
5.     While the First Project is essentially intended to stem the deterioration of the existing water
supply and sewerage systems the scale of the tasks is such that a further program of works and
institutional strengthening is required. However, for the investments to be economically and socially
viable, there needs to be considerable increase in the supply of water to the city. The Second Project
will greatly assist. The investments currently under way to bring water from the Krishna River will also
increase the supply to Madras by a considerable amount. In essence, the Second Project and Krishna
Water will at least quadruple the water available to Madras. In order to utilize the new flows of water
effectively, a rehabilitation and expansion of existing water and sewerage systems, going beyond the
actions under the First and Second Projects, is essential.
6.     Thus, the Third Project has the objectives of further expanding and strengthening the water
supply and sewerage systems to effectively utilize the new flows of water to the city, increase the
cleanliness of the city and its water ways, improve access by the poor to sanitary excreta disposal and to
further strengthen the relevant environmental sanitation and water supply institutions. The area which
the project will cover will include Madras city and adjacent urban areas together totaling 335 sq. km.
7.     The proposed Third Project is expected to have five principal components as follows:
(a)    Water supply rehabilitation and expansion (estimated base cost of US$ 126.47 million).
This component will provide facilities to treat and distribute 400 mid of water to Madras
and adjacent urban areas. It includes the construction of rural and clear water
transmission mains, ring mains, headwork, leak detection and repair and the installation
of water meters.
(b)    Sewerage system improvements (US$ 72.00 million). The sewerage system will be
reinforced to handle the additional flow of sewage and waste. Specifically: (i) the
existing system will be rehabilitated, replaced and extended; (ii) sewer cleaning
equipment will be provided; (iii) new sewage pumping stations and force mains will be
constructed and existing ones improved and renovated; and (iv) the existing sewage
treatment plants will be rehabilitated and expanded.

(c)    Environmental sanitation (US$ 39.2 million). This component will be part of a long
term program to improve sanitation in the Metropolitan Area targeting especially for
vulnerable groups. It will include low cost sanitation, solid waste collection and
disposal, toxic waste collection and disposal and drainage and sullage disposal in
deficient areas within the city which would be served with water under the project. Also
included will be dredging, grading, desludging and filling of major waterways. There
will be a program of community awareness and hygiene education.
(d)    Institutional strengthening (US$ 6.43 million). This component will continue to
strengthen MMWSSB through training and technical assistance in five principal areas:
(i) use of consultants for the design and supervision of construction; (ii) strengthening
management information systems; (iii) contracting out certain O&M operations; (iv)
providing additional training in specific areas.
(e)    Project support and technical assistance (US$ 27.7 million). This component would
include steps necessary to facilitate implementation of the project including consulting
services for project preparation, leak detection, the Project Management Unit and
hygiene education.

SECOND MADRAS WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Economic Analysis
I.    An economic analysis has been performed of the project focusing on the provision of 180 mid of
additional water to the city. The incremental costs of this additional water are the capital costs of source
works, transmission pipelines and related facilities and reception at the sump at Porur on the outskirts of
Madras, and the incremental O&M costs associated with the provision of this water. The benefits are
those arising from the increased supply to the city.
2.    The analysis is contained in the accompanying table. All values are in FLb-95 constant prices.
The project period is assumed to be 30 years from commissioning. Pumps and other equipment are
assumed to be replace in year 15 from commissioning. From Porur there will be losses of water in
distribution which have been assumed at 20% giving a supply to the city consumers of 144 mid.
3.     Benefits and capital and O&M costs (expressed in local (Indian) prices) have been adjusted
using the stanidard conversion factor of 0.9. Benefits are measured using the willingness to pay by
consumers based on their actual payments. Payments used for this purpose are the marginal alternative
supplies from tankers for domestic consumers, who are paying currently about Rs. 32 per m3 from this
source, and from all sources of supply for industrial and commercial consumers, who are currently
paying about Rs. 25 per m3 on average. Evidence for these payments was obtained from the recently
completed tariff study. Benefits have been increased in line with projected tariff increases (in real terms)
to year 2000, and weighted according to consumption quantities between domestic and non-domestic
consumers. On this basis the benefit has been assumed to be Rs. 44 per mi. It is fully recognized that the
use of tanker prices may underestimate the benefits, both directly since consumers may be willing to pay
more, and indirectly through health and other social benefits which are not counted.
4.     On the assumptions made the ERR is 13.0 percent.
Sensitivity Analysis
5.     Sensitivity anayses have been undertaken focussing on the adverse effects on the ERR of
changes to the assumptions on capital costs. Specifically, the ERR has been recalculated assuming:
implementation delays in the execution of the project, and hence in the realization of project benefits and
the incurring of O&M costs, by two and three years; and, increases in the capital costs of 10, 20 and
30%. The following results were obtained:
Change in basic                               Economic Rate of Return
assumption
Two years execution delay                     11.0 percent
Three years execution delay                   10.1 percent
Capital costs increased by 10%                11.9 percent
Capital costs increased by 20%                11.0 percent
Capital costs increased by 30%                10.1 percent

SECOND MADRAS WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Reliability of Yield at the Veeranam Tank
I     The Veeranam tank is a shallow tank formed by an earth embankment 16 km long. The tank
origins date to the 11th Century. The tank now acts as a balancing reservoir for irrigation demands. It is
supplied primarily by the water released from the Mettur Reservoir located close to the Karnataka/Tamil
Nadu State border. The conveyance system to the Veeranam tank consists of a long stretch of the river
Colleroon and an unlined water course called the Vadavar Canal, which is 22 km long and terminates at
the tank. Attached is a schematic diagram of the Veeranam tank conveyance system.
2.     The capacity of the Veeranam tank is 27.74 Mm3 and its water surface area at full tank level is
about 20.83 sq. km. In 1923 its capacity was reported to be 40 .80 Mm3 indicating considerable silting
since that time. The tank supplies irrigation water to an area of 18, 158 ha in the South Arcot district, but
additionally the tank is used to supply irrigation water to a neighboring system, Sethiathope Anicut, at
the time of the latter's shortfall.
3.    The proposed project would increase the storage of the tank to 41.48 Mm3 by raising the level by
0.61 m. In the context of supplying water to Madras, the Government has stipulated that there should be
supplies made available during the irrigation season from July to February by keeping the tank full at the
enhanced storage ievel. From February to June there are normally no relk-a-es from Mett!r. The
additional capacity at Vecianam tank will ensure the Madras supplies at that time.
4.     Analyses have been performed of the potential yield of the tank using historical data. This
historical data has utilized daily flows over a 29-year period from 1965-1993. A simulation model has
been constructed for assessing the dependability of the tank for irrigation and Madras city water supply
under a 100-year scenario.
5.     The historic studies indicate there were six drought years over the period 1983-1990, in 1983,
1985, 1987, 1988, 1989 and 1990 of which the last four were consecutively very bad years. It is a bad
year when the south west monsoon fails and the Mettur Reservoir is not open for irrigation until the end
of July, and a very bad year when along with the failure of the south-west monsoon, the north-east
monsoon also fails.
6.     An investigation has been made of the capacity of the Mettur Dam, considering the contents of
the Dam at the end of February and end of June since 1983, that is, looking at bad and very bad years. It
was found that there will always be live storage present in Mettur even after the releases for the special
supplementation for Madras and to meet the stipulated irrigation requirements for the farmers served by
Veeranam. This was so even in a!l four bad years from 1986 to 1989.
7.     An assessment has been made of the geology and seismicity of the zone. This shows clearly that
even though the region under consideration is not completely aseismic, there is no seismogenic feature
such as a fault line at the location of the tank or nearby. The Veeranam tank has a very wide spread and
reservoir induced seismicity is not applicable.
8.     The conclusions from the historical studies are as follows:



-34-
Annex 3
Page 2 of 3
(a)   the Veeranam tank as it exists today is capable of satisfying irrigation demands with a
reliability of 72% (that is, in 72 years out of 100);
(b)    if the Madras city water demands of 190 mid are also to be met from the tank without
improvement and enlargement, the dependability of the irrigation releases falls to 66%
and the dependability of the supply to Madras would be 79%;
(c)   the reliability of the irrigation releases could be maintained at 72% and Madras
reliability increased to 81% by restoring the tank to its capacity in 1923 through
desilting and by lining the Vadavar Channel; and
(d)   the reliability of the water supply to Madras could be further increased to 95% with the
improvements proposed under the protect to both the tank and the Vadavar Canal, if an
additional average quantity of 10 Mm per annum were made available from Mettur.

Component 2: Transmission, Treatment and Resettlement
3.    Raw water from the Veeranam tank will be drawn through an open channel and will enter a
pumping station at Sethiathope nearby. A system will be provided for pre-chlorination. Transmission
from the Veeranam tank to the pumping station is by gravity main from where the raw water will be
pumped to the treatment plant at Vadakkuthu about 20 km away.
4.    The treatment plant at Vadakkuthu will utilize the existing structure provided for an earlier
scheme in the 1970s. The structure will be rehabilitated and new equipment installed. The existing
treatment plant consist of the following major structures; 4 clarifiers; a filter house; an overhead tank; a

Annex 4
Page 2 of 3
clear-water underground tank; and, a chemical house, administration and laboratory building. In addition
to the existing facilities, a clarifyier sludge/filter back-wash water processing/disposal system will be
provided. Treated water from the filters will be led to the existing treated water storage tank of 8,000
Mm3 capacity.
5.     A new pumphouse will be provided from where the treated water will be pumped to a higher
level reservoir at Kadam Pulliyar Ridge some 8 kms from the treatment plant, from where the water will
flow by gravity main to the terminal reservoir at Porur in the south-west of the city of Madras.
6.     It is proposed to use steel pipes with internal cement mortar lining and external gunniting. It
would be for the contractor to determine the precise mode of supply but most probably these pipes would
be fabricated from mild steel plates on a site using the locations that were adopted in the earlier 1970s
scheme for which there would need to be some clearance of the old fabrication plant and equipment. The
diameters of the transmission pipeline vary according to the sections: intake to the treatment plant at
Vadakkuthu, 1800 mm; treatment plant to Kadam Pulliyur Ridge, 1775 mm; Kadam Pulliyur Ridge to
Aringiar, 1875 mm; Aringiar to Porur, 1525 mm.
7.     The right-of-way mostly follows highway reserves and margins. In six places there are runs
across country, mostly across paddy. There will be displacement of people along the right of way, for
which provision has been made to ensure the restoration or enhancement of their standard of living up to
or above levels enjoyed by them prior to the commencement of the implementation of the project
(described in detail in Annex 6). The treatment of displacement of population will be as an integral part
of Component 2 but given the nature of the expenditures to be incurred, costs for resettlement are shown
against Component 5, Technical Assistance and Support in the project cost tables (Annex 13). There are
eighteen river and stream crossings for the pipeline for which seven pipe bridges are in existence from
the earlier scheme. There are seventeen major road crossings with fifteen culverts already constructed
and four railway crossings with three culverts already constructed and with the possibility of using an
existing culvert for the fourth crossing.
8.     Four alternative schemes were shortlisted and investigated for the water transmission, treatment
and pumping system. These four alternatives varied according to the location of the treatment plant and
the dimensions of the steel pipe for different sections. The optimization was based on a least cost
analysis incorporating the construction costs and power tariffs costs and interest rates over a range of
altemative assumptions. The preferred scheme was the one with an evaluated cost which was the lowest
which also provide for the greatest reliability of supply.
9.     Only a single transmission main is proposed. The pipe will be underground for its length except
at river and stream crossings where the pipe will be on bridges, and in marshy areas where it will be on
saddles. Pipes that are buried will be provided with RCC jacketing in deep cuts and below minor road
crossings.
10.    At Porur land has been acquired sufficient to provide an underground storage reservoir of 8000
Mm capacity, the same as at the treatment plant at Vadakkuthu. In addition a pumphouse will be
provided for pumping the water into the transmission system.
Component 3: City Distribution
11.    The terminal reservoir and pumping station at Porur is included in this component.



-38-
Annex 4
Page 3 of 3
12.    There is an immediate need, for which retroactive financing has been requested, for
improvements to the distribution system costing some Rs.250 million. These works form part of the
overall master plan. They include pipelines, pumps and accessories relating to a clear water transmission
main from the Redhills treatment works to the junction of Arcot Road and the inner ring road in Madras
and extensions to the system to the southern headworks at Valluvarkottam and strengthening supply to
the Adyar Zone. Additional works for retroactive financing under the Project include replacement of old
pipes at the Adyar River crossing, additional pipelines from the junction of Sardar Patel Road and
Gandhi Mandapan Road to the Pallipettu headworks, additional pump sets at Pallipettu, and additional
works at a number of other pumping installations.
13.    After the first stage of distribution improvements which are scheduled to be completed during
1995, a further program of works will be undertaken. These additional works will be the subject of
feasibility studies and detailed engineering design still to be undertaken.
Component 4: Water Conservation
14.    There will be a clear defined program for the successive rehabilitation of the distribution zones
including leak detection and repairs, replacements, strengthening and bulk metering. Also involved
would be progressive introduction of comprehensive coverage of domestic metering in each zone. The
program of water conservation will include tariff increases to bring about more efficient use of water by
consumers, particularly domestic. The tariff increases will be required to satisfy the financing plan and,
specifically, MMWSSB's need to generate funds for its share of the investment financing requirements.
Component 5: Technical Assistance for Project Preparation and Implementation Support
15.    The project would include: preparation work and supervision of construction for the transmission
mains and other facilities; studies for and supervision of the relocation and rehabilitation of displaced
persons, the costs of which are included in this component, and also preparation studies for the Second
and Third Projects relating to distribution, conservation and environmental sanitation.

SECOND MADRAS WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
The Relocation and Rehabilitation Plan
I.    An R&R policy has been prepared which is similar to the Bank's Proposed Tamil Nadu Water
Resources Conservation Project, with an action plan to implement the policy. Implementation of the
R&R will reflect the progress of the Project, with displacement occurring ahead of the works. There is
scope for many displaced persons to be resettled at their pre-existing locations following temporary
relocation during the works and this will be achieved as far as possible. The policy and action plan were
found to be in conformity with the Bank's requirements as defined in OD 4.30. The main objectives of
GOTN for the policy are:
(a)   to minimize displacement as much as possible and avoid displacements altogether
wherever possible by adopting alternative plans;
(b)    wherever resettlement is unavoidable, ensure that the displaced persons gain greater
social benefit than hardship as a result;
(c)    provide community benefits which clearly exceed the disbenefits to the project affected
families (PAFs);
(d)    provide the PAFs with a share in the project benefits wherever practicable including
improved income and employment opportunities, land, infrastructure, roads etc.
(e)    provide appropriate personalized attention to the PAFs during the resettlement period;
(f)    provide proper compensation to the PAFs for their losses at full replacement costs;
(g)    give support during the physical movement of belongings and personnel;
(h)    ensure restoration or improvement in prior income levels;
(i)    for poorer sections, provide new development programs to improve standards of living;
and
(j)    encourage community participation in planning the implementation of the resettlement
program at all stages using where appropriate, existing social and cultural institutions.
Project Affected Persons (PAPs) and Activities
2.     The R&R issues arise from land displacement at the source and of encroachers along the right-
of-way of the transmission line. At the source some 22.56 ha of patta (private) land have been acquired
and 2.09 ha of Government land. 68 families are affected but not displaced. These are mostly farmers
with land holdings that are not viable for income generation even prior to acquisition. Ninety-one
families would be displaced from the tank bund.



-42-
Annex 6
Page 2 of 3
3.     Between the Veeranam tank and Kelambakkam, a distance 190 km there are 641 encroachers on
the transmission right-of-way owned by TWAD consisting of 465 houses (which include 42 living in the
pipes of the earlier 1970s scheme), 145 shops and 31 agriculturists. Not all of these will need to be
displaced. About 75% of the houses will be lost and 22% of the shops. Where there has been
encroachment of agricultural land holdings, the encroachment is less than 10% of these encroachers total
land holdings.
4.     From Kttambakkam to Porur, a distance of about 46 km there are 64 families that are
encroaching on Highway Department land to be evicted. 43 of these consist of a house only and the
others include shops.
5.     Considering all categories, there were found to be 1,429 PAPs consisting of 168 project affected
persons and 1,261 project affected encroachers. Of these, 521 will require only resettlement, 864 will
require only rehabilitation and 44 will require both resettlement and rehabilitation. Details of the
classification of the PAPs and their entitlements are provided in paragraph 7 below.
6.     Other structures will be affected by the transmission pipeline which number 61 in all, including
bus shelters and wells.
Classification of Project Affected Persons
7.     The plan categorizes the PAPs into twelve as follows:

Responsibilities
8.     GOTN will be responsible for implementation of the RAP, working through District R&R
Committees headed by the District Collector who has financial powers. Implementation will be
facilitated by the appointment of NGOs, for example, to identify alternative lands and assist with training
for alternative vocations. The involvement of NGOs will provide valuable assistance in the endeavor to
ensure viable communities. The Development of Women and Children in Rural Areas (DWCRA)
program will be extended to cover all the PAPs. There would be local committees to hear grievances and
take necessary actions. TWAD will carry out monitoring and evaluation of the RAP implementation,
and will report to the Project Management Group on indicators of progress.
Costs
9.     The estimated cost of the R&R plan is Rs. 9.9 million (US$0.3 million) made up as follows: (a)
land, wells, plots and structures - Rs 3.7 million; (b) resettlement grants, transportation grants,   0
rehabilitation loans and grants, and maintenance allowances - Rs 3.0 million; (c)training - Rs 0.9
million; (d) civic amenities - Rs 0.4 million; (e) project management and monitoring expenses and NGO
oosts - Rs 0.5 million; and. (f) consultations and studies - Rs 0.5 million, plus contingencies at 10% - Rs
0.9 million. GOTN has provided a written undertaking to allocate additional funds for R&R, including
maintenance allowance, should the need arise.

SECOND MADRAS WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Water Conservation Strategy
1.    MMWSSB has adopted a strategy for water conservation with three primary objectives:
(a)    to ensure a more equitable distribution of water;
(b)   to introduce and make effective metering for all consumers in a phased program; and
(c)   to continue with the program of leak detection and rectification, extending from the 20%
of the city already completed to 100%.
2.     Equitable Distribution. Supply is intermittent with restricted hours and parts of the
system with zero pressure. The intention is to increase the number of distribution stations from 4
at present to 16 eventually in order to reduce the distance of the tail-end areas from the reservoir thereby
increasing the pressure to the remoter parts.
3.     Metering. The effectiveness of meters is low when the pressure in the system is low and
supply is intermittent. Accordingly, the metering installation program must go hand in hand with
the distribution strengthening and increases in supply. As the zonal improvements take place so the
conservation strategy requires that all consumers become metered. Charging on a volumetric basic
would encourage consumers to reduce waste.
4.     At present all the non-domestic consumers are metered. More than 80% of revenue is collected
through these metered connections. No domestic consumers are metered and the charges are on a flat-
rate basis. The meters presently available operate where the velocity of water is measured in a rotating
vane and converted to a volumetric measure which is registered on the dial. These meters are not
suitable for intermittent supply. Inquiries are taking place to identify meters which can work reliably
under intermittent supply and which are expected to work for extended periods. It is proposed to have a
consultancy for the metering program during 1995 to investigate the options and work out a program for
metering installation. It is anticipated that the metering program would be completed by September
1997.
5.    Leak Detection. 20% of the city has been completed and rectification undertaken and the leak
detection program will continue until there is 100% coverage.
6.     Much of the distribution system is more than 100 years old but mains of sizes 200 mm and
below which are more than 50 years old have been replaced over the last ten years. Studies were carried
out in 1989/90 on a pilot basis covering 10% of the city in order to study the distribution system and
identify possible areas and zones where leak and waste detection programs could be carried out. The
study also evolved a program for carrying out the surveys of leak and waste detection and a
quantification of the water lost. A methodology was established for studying unaccounted for water
suitable for Madras and 14,600 connections in 215 field tests were covered and rectification works were
carried out. The economics of the actions taken were found to be favorable.

Annex 7

7.     As part of a continuous program, another 10% of the distribution system under a second phase
was awarded to the consultants and work is under progress. It is proposed to continue with this work
eventually to cover the entire city. Currently, bids are being called for a further 60% of the area. It is
hoped that the full program may be completed by December 1997.

SECOND MADRAS WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Financial Projections and Tariffs
I.    During the First Project MMWSSB has considerably strengthened its finances. In 1986/87
internal cash generation by MMWSSB was nil but was Rs 26 million in 1993/94 and may rise to Rs 247
million in 1994/95. Over the same period water charges and water/sewer tax collection efficiencies rose
from 50% and 40% to 82% and 78% respectively. Financial cost recovery covenants have been
achieved, despite difficult operating conditions with the drought. Improving the finances is important for
cost recovery and as part of the long term aim to corporatise the entity. Financial strengthening is part of
the overall strengthening of the institution. MMWSSB is already in a position to privatize some of its
operations such as the sewage pumping stations, sewer cleaning (on a pilot basis), sewer connections and
O&M of handpumps. The intention is to sustain the financial strengthening under the Second Project
through a continuous program of institutional improvements leading to efficiency gains, and to maintain
upward pressure on tariffs to recover costs and encourage conservation.
2.     The water from the Veeranam source will be costly, and probably will constitute the most
expensive source of supply. Cost recovery requirements will dictate continuing increased in tariffs and
control over costs. A major tariff study has been completed as part of project preparation and it is
intended that this study will be the basis for tariff reforms during the course of the project. MMWSSB
must contribute a share of the total project cost equal to about 17.2 percent out of internal cash
generation. This will require substantial tariff increases. In order to explore the implications of the
project for the finances of the entity a financial analysis has been performed by the Finance Department
of MMWSSB which is reported below. MMWSSB produces accounts on the commercial (accruals)
basis. Three sets of statements have been prepared, the Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Sources
and Applications of Funds, with associated performance ratios.
Recent Financial Performance and Financial Issues
3.     The statements provide actual outturns for FY92 to FY94. During this time there were
exceptional drought conditions. Despite these conditions net income rose from Rs -65 million to Rs 11
million. A substantial tariff revision on April 1, 1994 of about 250 percent is expected to lead to a net
income in the current FY of about Rs 229 million. Thus there has been considerable improvement in the
overall financial position of the entity.
4.     Nevertheless, MMWSSEI remains inefficient when compared with water utilities in other
developing countries. Manning levels are high. For example, the volume of water sold is about 17,000
m3 per employee per annum, but 100,000 m3 would be reasonable. Staff costs are a high proportion of
operations costs, at around 60 percent, but 40 percent would represent an efficient level based on
experience elsewhere. The tariff structure needs revision. At the present time industrial consumers are
using about 25 percent of the volume supplied and are paying about 75 percent of the total revenues.
There is a need to move to volumetric charging for all consumers with private connections with a shift in
the relative contributions of consumers to the domestic sector and away from the industrial.
Additionally, sewerage revenues comprise 20% of water revenues for consumers with an access to a
sewer, but sewerage costs are much higher relative to water charges than this relative position implies.

Projections
5.    Key Assumptions. Projections have been made to the end of the project period in FY2002, and
beyond to FY2005. The following inflation and exchange rate assumptions have been used both in the
financial analysis and also the preparation of the cost tables in the main text of this SAR:
Calendar   External       Indian      Exchange
Year      Inflation    Inflation       Rate
(%)          (%)         Rs/US $
1995        1.5          9.0           32.3
1996        1.8          8.5           34.8
1997        2.6          8.0           37.4
1998        2.5          7.0           39.8
1999        2.5          6.0           42.0
2000        2.5          6.0           44.3
2001        2.5          6.0           46.7
2002        2.4          6.0           49.3
2003        2.1          6.0           51.2
2004        2.1          6.0           53.1
6.    Investments included in the financial projections include the First Project, other investments
being undertaken by MMWSSB which are largely being financed by HUDCO as well as the proposed
Second Project. These projections do not include the effects of the proposed Third Project which is,
however, subject to sensitivity analysis.
7.    Revenues. These have been projected to increase by 10 percent annually except for those years
where they need to be higher when it is not possible to achieve the cost recovery and financing targets of
17.2 percent contribution to Total Project Cost. The need for additional revenue beyond that generated
by a 10% annual increase in tariffs occurs about FY99-2000 when the grace period on principal and
interest for the Second Project comes to an end.
8.    The average revenue per m3 consumed will increase from about Rs 8.26 in 1995 to Rs 25.00 in
2002. Increased revenues will derive from the tariff increase and the additional quantity of water
supplied, and the benefits from the program of water conservation which includes metering and
reduction in unaccounted for water.
9.    Operating Expenses. In making the projections the number of employees is maintained at
current levels, about 3,950, but with increasing volume of water sold this will mean significant efficiency
gains. Unit charges for salaries, power and other items are projected to increase with the rate of
inflation. From the year 1999 there is a significant increase in power costs due to pumping and other
requirements due to additional water flow from Veeranam.
10.   Interest and Depreciation. Depreciation is assumed to be 2.8% of gross fixed assets which
represents MMWSSB's weighted average of depreciation applied to all categories of assets. Interest is
charged on market borrowing, project loans following the five year grace period, and the GOTN loans
for both existing and new projects.



-48-
Annex 8
Page 3 of 7
I1.    Findings. On the basis of the assumptions made, the rate of return on fixed assets will be
positive throughout the project period and in the range 1-9% pa. The Operating Ratio, the ratio of
operating revenues to operating expenses plus depreciation, is well over 1.00, and mostly over 2.00
signifying generous cost recovery margins. The most critical time in the forecast period is about the
years 1999-2000 when MMWSSB starts to bear the significant capital charges for the Second Project,
although this is the time when the water from Veeranam becomes available for sale. The principal
finding is that MMWSSB is able to achieve its cost recovery and financing targets whilst still making
water affordable.
Sensitivity of Findings to the Third Project
12.    During the implementation of the Second Project, water is expected to arrive at the Madras
reservoir system from the Krishna River source. The city distribution system will not have capacity to
absorb all the flows immediately, but as the distribution strengthening takes place under both the on
goinig First Project and the Second Project there will be additional water for sale which will greatly assist
with revenue generation. During this time it is anticipated that the Third Project will also be
implemented which will lead to a completion of the distribution strengthening and water conservation
measures throughout the City. The main costs for the Third Project would be incurred after the year
2000 on the assumption of a five year grace period for principal and interest. Accordingly, the Third
Project will increase MMWSSB's revenue position during the Second Project period and will have
significant cost implications well after this period. The Third Project will assist with the financial
strengthening of MMWSSB and may mean a lower level of tariff increases than is implied in the

SECOND MADRAS WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
Environmental Assessment Summary
A.    The Environmental Assessment Process
1.    The environmental assessment (EA) for the project was undertaken by National Environmental
Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) under contract to Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage
Board (TWAD), beginning in January 1994. The EA report was prepared in accordance with the
provisions of World Bank OD 4.01, Environmental Assessment, applicable to Category A projects.
2.    In many respects, this project could have been handled as Category B. The transmission main
right of way (ROW) had already been acquired, as had the sites that were being considered for the water
treatment works. A treatment plant had already been constructed at one of them, but never placed in
operation. There were no significant environmental issues associated with these aspects of the project.
Much of the background information and baseline data on the Madras Metropolitan Area (MMA) had
already been assembled in an EA prepared by NEERI in 1991 for the Water Supply Project then being
considered as the Second Madras Water Supply Project but now likely to become the Third.
Consequently, the EA Terms of References focused the bulk of the consultant's effort on a few particular
topics in which complex and significant adverse impacts were possible: (i) the potential impacts the
allocation of water for public supply from Veeranam Tank would have on farmers currently depending
on the tank for irrigation; (ii) safety issues associated with increasing the height of the bund at Veeranam
Tank and constructing and operating the treatment works, pumping stations, and transmission main; (iii)
ecological and land use impacts in the vicinity of Veeranam Tank; and (iv) water quality effects of
increased wastewater flows from Madras. Other areas of emphasis were: (i) impacts of water treatment
plant operation; (ii) any alternatives that should be considered at this stage of project development; (iii)
the opinions and concerns of affected persons, particularly in the Veeranam Command Area and along
the ROW; and (iv) development of an Environmental Managenient Plan for the project. The consultant
was directed to update and supplement the information in the 1991 EA as necessary, to conduct
reconnaissance to verify conditions along the transmissionl main right of way, to identify any other
significant issues that might not have been anticipated, but to otherwise limit collection of new field data
beyond that needed to address the main issues.
3.     The Final Report was completed in October, 1994 and made available for public inspection and
comment at multiple locations in the study area in accordance with BP 17.50, Disclosure of Operational
Information. It was officially submitted to tlhe Bank by Department of Economic Affairs, GOI in
February, 1995.
B.    Baseline Environmental Conditions
The Study Area
4.     The study area encompasses the Madras Metropolitan Area (MMA); areas presently irrigated
from the Veeranam Tank; land surrounding Veeranam Tank: the routes of the water supply canals which
transport water to Veeranam and need to be rehabilitated; the routes of the transmission main from
Veeranam to the proposed distribution storage reservoir site at Porur: and the sites of the proposed water
treatment plant, pumping stations/booster stations, and distribution reservoirs.

Physical Environment
5.    Madras city is located on the coast of Bay of Bengal at latitude 130 04' N and longitude 0800 15'
E. The terrain is generally low-lying and flat with an average slope of less than 1:1500. Most parts of the
city are within 4 to 5 m above mean sea level. The city is traversed by two small rivers, the Cooum and
the Adyar. In addition, the Buckingham Canal passes through the city parallel to the coast. The climate is
tropical with a mean annual temperature of about 300C and relative humidity ranging between 65% and
80%. The city experiences a southwest monsoon from June to September, and a northeast monsoon from
October to December. The northeast monsoon brings a large share of the annual rainfall which averages
about 1300 mm.
6.    The topography along the proposed alignment of Veeranam pipeline (ROW) is undulating and is
crossed by rivers, drainage channels, railways, and state/ national highways. The Veeranam Tank and its
watershed are situated in the rain shadow region for the southwest monsoon. The 50 year average rainfall
of the area is about 11 00mm.
7.    The existing surface and groundwater resources in MMA have been strained to the maximum
with no scope for their further development to meet the needs of the city. Over-extraction of groundwater
in some areas has already produced signs of saline water intrusion in the aquifers near the sea. Based on
the population projections and the per capita supply rate for various categories of users, the present total
water requirement has been estimated as 1750 mid.
8.    The city is divided into five major zones for sewerage service, each comprising a large number
of collection areas. Each area is served by a sewage pumping station. There are presently 83 such
pumping stations with 10 more auxiliary ones discharging into the main pumping stations. Each zone has
independent collection, conveyance, treatment and disposal facilities. However, the major waterways in
MMA are highly polluted due to discharge of wastewater from public and commercial buildings not
connected to the sewerage systems and sewage and sullage from the squatter settlements.
Biological Environment
9.     The MMA borders the Coromandal coast of Tamil Nadu. Natural vegetative cover is poor, with
tremendous pressure from developmental activities and agriculture. However, efforts are being made to
increase cover through aforestation, protection of natural habitats such as sanctuaries and national parks,
and social forestry. Most of the land that would be traversed by the transmission main is not in natural
cover; it is either developed for residential use or used for agriculture or silviculture. Cashew plantations
are very common in South Arcot district, one of the districts along the ROW. There are nevertheless a
few patches of natural forest and reserve forest. Many aquatic weeds have been recorded from the area
around Veeranam Tank, and the shallow parts of the tank support substantial weed growth.
10.   The major surface water resources in the study area include Kortalaiyar River, Cooum River,
Buckingham Canal, Cholavaram Reservoir, Redhills Tank, and coastal marine waters with considerable
fisheries potential.
11.    Environmentally sensitive areas in the region include Guindy National Park, Anna Zoological
Park, Vedanthangal Water Bird Sanctuary, Karikili Bird Sanctuary, Madras Snake Park, Adyar Estuary
and isolated patches of protected forest.

Annex 14
Page 3 of 13
12.    Among the species of mosquitoes reported in and around Madras area are Anopheles stephensi
and A. culcifacies, vectors for malaria, and Culex quinquefasciatus which transmits filaria.
Socio-cultural Environment
13.   The MMA has witnessed rapid growth during the last few decades, with increased population
density in the already crowded central urban areas and strip development along the major transportation
corridors leading into Madras. The population of Madras city has grown from 0.55 million in 1901 to
3.84 million in 1991. The population in MMA (excluding the city) has grown from about 0.44 million in
1951 to about 1.47 million in 1991. The overall population densities in MMA are low with the maximum
being less than 100 persons per hectare. The predominant land use in the central urban areas is
residential, with a relatively even distribution of service-oriented commercial activities. Most of the large
industries are located along the major transportation corridors.
14.    There are many temples and important architectural monuments in and around Madras.
However, the project activities will not have any adverse impact on cultural properties. The study area
also does not have any distinct tribal communities which are likely to be affected due to the project.
15.    There has been a general increase in the incidence of diarrheal diseases, cholera and malaria in
the project area over the last two to three years, and a declining trend in incidence of filaria. The
incidence of Japanese encephalitis is highest in Villupuram Ramasamy Padayatchiyar district.
D. Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Project
Overall Impact
16.   The most obvious and significant environmental impact of the project will be the improvement
expected in public health and quality of urban life through increased quantity, quality and reliability of
water supply in the MMA. In addition, the augmentation of surface water supply sources should allow
reduction in the abstraction of groundwater from the shallow aquifers of the river basins in and around
the MMA. This would lower the risk of both saline water intrusion into the aquifers and the incidence of
water-borne diseases caused by consumption of contaminated water from shallow wells.
17.   The proposed withdrawal of 192 mld of water from Veeranam Tank for supply to Madras will
not affect the traditional irrigation rights of farmers in the area irrigated by the Tank due to the proposed
increase in the storage capacity of the tank that will be provided in the project and the additional release
of 11.4 million cubic meters of water annually from Mettur storage.
18.    Activities related to the raising of reservoir bunds, laying of transmission main and construction
of pumping stations and storage reservoirs will result in the conversion of small amounts of agricultural
land. The transmission main construction will affect normal traffic flow and cause temporary but
unavoidable congestion in different parts of the city and along certain stretches of the national and state
highway between Kelambakkam and Porur. Consequent inconvenience to the public and commerce
could be minimized by proper planning, advance notification, accurate scheduling and efficient
management of construction activities and regulation of traffic. This can only be accomplished through
good coordination among all concerned agencies.



-63-
Annex 14
Page 4 of 13
19.    Environmental impacts of the proposed project have been evaluated using the Battelle
Environmental Evaluation System (BEES). Forty-eight parameters relevant to the project have been
identified under the categories of ecology, environimenital pollution, aesthetics and human interest. They
were used to compare the environmenital implications of implemilenting the project as originally designed,
implementing the project together with the Environimenital Management Plan (EMP) elaborated in the
EA, and not implementing the project at all. A summary of the evaluation is presented in Table 1. The
net change in environmental quality resulting fiom the proposed project compared to "no action" is
positive, even with no measures to mitigate potential adverse impacts. The improvement becomes larger
still when implementation of the EMP is assumed.
Potential Impacts During Construction
20.    Most of the construction phase impacts are of short duration and temporary. The construction
would lead to localized increases in dust and suspended particulate matter in the ambient air. Noise
impact on nearby communities will not be significant. However, transmission main installation in or
along the highways between Kelambakkam and Porur is likely to seriously disrupt vehicle traffic,
pedestrian access and commerce. Careful management can partially mitigate this impact, but some
disruption is unavoidable.
21.    Vegetative cover (i.e. forest, avenue trees, and agricultural land) is likely to be reduced. Natural
drainage in the area may be affected due to earthwork excavation and construction activity. Movement of
heavy machinery for pipe-layilg activity may cause a narrow strip of agricultural land along the
transmission main ROW to become uncultivatable temporarily, and compaction may alter the natural
properties of the soils. The overall effect on agricultural production will not be significant.
Potential Impacts During Operation
22.    With the augmentation of water supply by 180 mid from Veeranam, the per capita water supply
for the various categories of consumers in Madras city will increase. The need for augmenting individual
household supplies through private wells or commercial vendors will be reduced, with attendant savings
in time, labor and money. With the increase in water supply and consequent increase in wastewater flow,
the functionality of the existing sewerage system and the waterways water quality will improve.
23.    With increased water supply from Veeranam, the general health status and well
being of the people of Madras city will be significantly enhanced. The augmentation of water supply in
the project area will trigger an all round increase in developmental activity such as housing,
transportation, education and culture which would have a considerable impact on the life style of the
population. In sum, the overall impact of the project on the socio-economic environment is expected to
be beneficial and positive:
(a)    With the increased availability of water, the duration of water supply will increase and
the distribution network will remain charged with water under pressure for a longer
duration. This would reduce the chances of contamination in the water mains and
associated public health risks leading to reduced incidence of diseases, improved health
and productivity, and economic well-being of the community.
(b)    Another significant impact intrinsic in keeping the system charged for a longer duration
is the reduction in the potential for internal corrosion of distribution pipe lines.



-64-
Annex 14
Page 5 of 13
(c)    As for the people in the area irrigated by Veeranam Tank, no socio-economic impact is
expected as there will be no reduction in their traditional irrigation water rights.
24.    Construction of the proposed straight cut to Godavari drain will significantly improve the
drainage of the surrounding area which is presently affected due to water logging and attendant reduction
in crop yield.
25.    The treatment plant will produce wastes in the form of clarifier sludge and filter backwash water.
While not hazardous, these can cause pollution of water or soil if not properly managed.
26.    Due to the storage of water in Veeranam Tank throughout the year and the associated vegetation,
micro-climatic changes would occur especially in and around the reservoir site. Increase in the
groundwater table in the area surrounding the Tank will have beneficial effect on vegetation and the
grazing fields. Social plantations will be successful to a large extent. Diversity of plant species will
increase showing healthier environment.
27.    The year round availability of water due to storage in the Tank may help to increase the number
of clean water flora and fauna such as diatoms. The potential for fisheries would also increase with the
availability of water in the reservoir throughout the year.
28.    Deweeding activity and increase in water level would bring about a change in the aquatic weed
growth which will not only reduce water loss due to transpiration but also the associated disease vectors,
especially mosquito larvae. The water quality may also improve.
29.    Bird migration to the Veeranam Tank may take place due to availability of water throughout the
year with possible increase in nesting sites/habitats. This will result in improving the diversity of animal
species in the project area.
30.    Use of fertilizers and insecticides in the catchment is relatively low. Should fertilizer come to be
applied excessively, nuisance algae blooms could occur in the tank and raw water quality could
deteriorate.
31.    Changes in soil quality may occur during construction mainly due to clearing of vegetative cover
along the right of way thereby causing soil erosion resulting in turbidity in surface runoff. The clearing
of forests and field habitats would result in destruction of terrestrial organisms.
32.    Due to storage of water in Veeranam Tank all through the year, the groundwater potential in the
surrounding area is likely to increase. This may improve the prospects of raising additional crops in the
area.
33.    Due to the project activities there is a great potential for employment both during construction
stage (short term) and during the post construction/ operation stage (long term). This, in turn, will have a
positive impact on the economy of the population, both local and regional.
34.    The proposed construction of a terrace along the foreshore bund in Suthamalli village with lawn
facilities using a part of the soil to be taken out from within the Tank is expected to improve the
aesthetics of the area with the potential for tourism promotion.

E. Analysis of Alternatives
35.   Three alternative transmission main alignments were considered for the section from
Kelambakkam to Porur in the region of Madras. The original right of way alignment of the 1970s
scheme was rejected to reduce the extent of involuntary resettlement. From the standpoint of potential
impacts, the route Vandalur, Pallavaram, and Alandur has been recommended.
36.   Two treatment plant locations were considered. Neither site-Vadakuthu or Mangalam-poses
significant environmental constraints. Use of Vadakuthu would involve less expenditure of resources
since treatment works already exist there and can be refurbished.
37.   The M.S. pipes with cement mortar lining inside and outside, proposed to be used as
transmission main will be safe from corrosion in the context of Veeranam water quality and the
characteristics of the soil along the pipeline ROW.
F. Environmental Impact Mitigation and Monitoring Plans
38.    Table 2 is a consolidated summary of the measures proposed for mitigating potential adverse
impacts and for monitoring changes in the environment during construction and operation of the project.
I. Revisions to the Environmental Assessment as a Result of Appraisal
39.    The appraisal mission did not identify any technical areas in which the assessment needed to be
modified. Improvements to the distribution system were added as a project component after the EA had
been completed, but there are no significant environmental impacts associated with the planned work.
Adherence to accepted design and construction practices, traffic management and worker safety procedures
should be sufficient environmental safeguards for the component. MMWSSB, which will be responsible
for the designs, will include the relevant mitigation measures from Chapter 8 of the EA and the worker
safety provisions of EA Annex 8.1 in tender documents.
40.   The mission reviewed arrangements for implementation of the Environmental Mitigation and
Monitoring Plans contained in the EA and determined that the arrangements are adequate. The WRO,
which is responsible for the design of the works at Veeranam, and design consultant for the transmission
main and treatment works have been given the EA and directed to incorporate design features that
respond to the EA recommendations for environmental protectien, including chlorine safety, clarifier
sludge and filter backwash water disposal, corrosion control, and landscaping. The designers will review
draft documents with the EA team prior to producing final versions. The designers will also incorporate
the recommended mitigation measures to control construction-related impacts and protect workers.
Environmental management training for construction supervisors will be added to the curricula at the
training centers already operated by PWD, TWAD and MMWSSB. The Terms of Reference for the
consultant that will supervise the transmission main construction will require provision of specialized
training in construction supervision to any TWAD personnel assigned to supervise this component.
41.   PWD, TWAD and MMWSSB report that they have sufficient staff and laboratory facilities to
undertake their construction management and operation, maintenance and monitoring responsibilities.
NEERI concurs.



-66-
Annex 14
Page 7 of 13
42.    On the particular topic of management of transmission line construction in congested areas to
minimize disruption of traffic, access and commerce, TWAD proposes to provide advance information
and updates to the District Collectors, who are well positioned to coordinate road closings, traffic police,
public information, and response to complaints. MMWSSB will undertake the same functions itself in
the distribution system improvements component. MMWSSB already has a Public Relations Cell, and
citizens are also able to bring complaints and questions to any of its depots (approximately 100) in the
metropolitan area.
J. Public Information and Consultation
43.   In order to identify any new issues in the implementation of the project, three public meetings
were organized in the project area by the project proponents with the assistance of NEERI. Six major
issues were raised by participants.
(a)    No objection to the project aimed at augmenting the water supply to Madras city
provided the withdrawal of 192 mid of water from Veeranam does not affect the existing
irrigation rights.
(b)    Need for a formal agreement between the Government and the agriculturists'
associations to safeguard their existing agricultural rights and to formulate operational
procedures for withdrawal of water from Veeranam tank for water supply to Madras.
(c)    Priority for completion of all works related to source improvement before commencing
drawal of water to Madras.
(d)    Concerns regarding compensation, and rehabilitation and resettlement of the project
affected persons in some cases.
(e)    Stress on employment opportunities to the extent possible to the local people.
(f)    An appeal to the project proponents to consider the possibility of providing water supply
from the transmission pipeline to the needy habitations en route.
44.    All these issues have been addressed during project preparation. Most significant was the
issuance of Government Order NO. 1084 dated October 26, 1994. The Order establishes operating rules
for Veeranam Tank that protect the irrigation rights of the farmers in the ayacut (command area) in bad
and very bad years (failure of one monsoon and both monsoons, respectively).
45.    GOTN has continued public consultation on the irrigation rights issue. On February 4, 1995,
PWD organized a meeting of farmers in Cuddalore to publicize the new operating rules and solicit
comments. The meeting attendees passed resolutions expressing their satisfaction with the operating
rules as sufficient to protect their rights, and their support for the New Veeranam Project. GOTN plans
further consultation activities: (i) publication of a Tamil-language brochure on the operating rules; and
(ii) a series of additional meetings (with the assistance of an NGO) so that a sample of farmers and farm
laborers that fully represent the ayacut can discuss the rules and express their opinions.
