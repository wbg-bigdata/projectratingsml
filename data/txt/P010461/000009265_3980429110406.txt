FOREWORD
In order to mitigate the chronic drinking water shortage in Madras city, the
Govemment of Tamil Nadu is considering, as an urgent and emergency measure,
an additional source of potable water, viz. Veeranam lake for implementation with
World Bank assistance. The project envisages, after augmentation of Veeranam
storage capacity, drawat of 190 mid of raw water from the lake, complete
conventional treatment and conveyance of treated water bypumping over a distance
of 230 km to Madras city for distribution. To ensure that the developmental options
under consideration in the New Veeranam project are environmentally sound and
sustainable, and that any environmental consequences are recognised early, the
Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage (TWAD) Board, in concurrence with the
World Bank, retained the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute
(NEERI) in January, 1994 to prepare the environmental assessment of the project
The report presents the baseline status of the major environmental
components of the project area, and the requirements for environmental
assessment of such projects at international, national and state levels. Public
meetings were organised to obtain the views of local NGOs and project affected
people and to identify any new issues to be addressed in the design and
implementation of the project. Significant potential impacts during
pre-construction, construction and operational phases of the project have been
identified, predicted and quantified wherever feasible, and evaluated. An
environmental management plan (EMP) for mitigating adverse impacts and
maximising beneficial impacts has also been delineated.
The co-operation and assistance rendered by the officials of TWAD,
MMWSSB and PWD in the completion of the study is gratefully acknowledged.
Thanks are also due to the officials of a number of organisations who readily
furnished information for the study.

1.    INTRODUCTION
1.1    Preamble
In order to relieve the chronic drinking water
shortage experienced by the city of Madras, the Madras
Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (MMWSSB)
proposes to develop, as an urgent and emergency measure, an
additional source of potable water for the city, viz.
Veeranam lake situated at a distance of 220 km from Madras.
The project envisages drawal of 190 mld (nominal) of raw
water from Veeranam lake, complete conventional treatment
and conveyance of treated water by pumping, with
intermediate booster stations, to storage reservoirs in the
metropolitan area for distribution. The MMWSSB, the Tamil
Nadu Water Supply and Drainage (TWAD) Board, and the Public
Works Department (PWD) of Govt. of Tamil Nadu have been
identified as implementing agencies for various water supply
components falling within their respective areas of
responsibility.
The MMWSSB has approached the World Bank for
financial assistance in the implementation of the project.
The World Bank policy guidelines stipulate that



Environmental Assessment of major developmental projects
would form an integral component of the feasibility study so
as to fulfill the Bank's requirements for project appraisal.
In keeping with this requirement, the TWAD Board, one of the
implementing agencies of the project, retained, in
concurrence with the World Bank, the National Environmental
Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) to prepare the
Environmental Assessment of the proposed New Veeranam
project.
The TWAD Board issued the work order to NEERI to
undertake the Environmental Assessment of the New Veeranam
Project vide their letter No.0107/F.20552/93/AE-5 dated
January 5, 1994. An Inception Report presenting the
objective and scope of study, the situation analysis, and
delineating the approach to environmental assessment and
proposed action plan thereof was submitted to TWAD Board in
January, 1994. An Interim Report on the progress of
environmental assessment was submitted in February, 1994. In
keeping with the TOR, the draft final report on EA was
submitted to TWAD in April, 1994, under NEERI Letter No.

2. POLICY, LEGAL AND
ADMINISTRATIVE FRAMEWORK
FOR ENVIRONMENTAL
ASSESSMENT



2.     POLICY, LEGAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE FRAMEWORK FOR
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
2.1   General
The purpose of Environmental Assessment (EA) is to
ensure that the development options under consideration are
environmentally sound and sustainable, and that any
environmental consequences are recognised early in the
project cycle and taken into account in project design. EAs
identify ways of improving projects environmentally, and
minimizing, mitigating, or compensating for adverse impacts.
EAs enable project designers, implementing agencies,
and  borrower  and  funding  agencies  to  a)  address
environmental issues in a timely and practical fashion,
(b) reduce the need for project conditionality because
appropriate steps can be taken in advance or incorporated
into project design, and (c) help avoid costs and delays in
implementation due to unanticipated environmental problems.
EAs also provide a formal mechanism for inter-agency
coordination and for addressing the concerns of affected
groups and local non-governmental organizations (NGOs).  In



addition, they can play a major role in building
environmental capability in the country.
2.2    World Bank Guidelines
The World Bank have brought out policy guidelines,
notes, operational directives and procedures for
environmental assessment of investment programmes and
projects which provide a framework for action by both the
borrowers and the Bank. Of direct relevance to the context
of the project are the following
i)    World Bank 1991, Operational Directive (O.D.) 4.01
Environmental Assessment' and Annexes A to F thereto
ii)    World  Bank  Technical  Paper  No.139,   1991,
Environmental Assessment Sourcebook', Vol I.,
Policies, Procedures, and Cross-Sectoral Issues,
Environment Department
iii)   World  Bank  Technical  Paper  No.140,   1991,
Environmental Assessment Sourcebook', Vol II.,

World Bank Guidelines for water supply and sanitation
projects are not yet published. However, most of the
pertinent environmental issues are covered under the
Sectoral Guidelines related to a) Land and Water Resources
Management; b) Dams and Reservoirs; c) Wastewater
Collection, Treatment, Reuse and Disposal Systems and d) Oil
and Gas Pipelines.
2-2



2.3    National Policy Guidelines
At the national level, the environmental clearance to
development projects is subject to implementation of
stipulated safeguards under the provisions of Environment
(Protection) Act, 1986, Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980 and
other rules and regulations in force.    The projects in
various sectors, which have so far been brought under the
purview of such a procedure, include the following
1. Major irrigation projects (covering 10,000 hectares and
above)
2. River Valley Projects
3. Hydel Power Projects
4. Thermal Power Projects (using coal, lignite, gas and
other feed stock) including atomic power stations
5. Mining Projects
6. Industries
7. Ports and Harbours
8. Human settlements including proposals relating to FSI/
FAR, new towns and cantonments
9. Tourism projects including beach resorts
10. Projects in coastal areas
11. Projects in ecologically fragile areas (e.g. Doon
Valley, Andaman and Nicobar and Lakshadweep Islands)
12. Communication projects
The Ministry of Environment and Forests (MEF), Govt.
of India has brought out the EIA notification, 1994 (as
amended on May 4, 1994) under the Environment (Protection)
Act, 1986 making environmental clearance mandatory for
expansion or modernization of any activity, if pollution
load is to exceed the existing one, and also for new
projects listed in Schedule-I of the notification (Table
2.1).
The New Veeranam Water Supply Project does not fall
under any of the project categories identified in Schedule-I
of the aforementioned EIA notification, 1994 and hence does
not require environmental clearance of the MEF, Govt. of
India.

2.4    Tamil Nadu State Environmental Committee
The Tamil Nadu State Environmental Committee is the
apex advisory body constituted by the Government (G.O.
Ms.No.10 dated December 12, 1983) in the matter of
protection of environment in the state. The Hon'ble Chief
Minister is the Chairman and the Hon'ble Minister for Health
is the Vice Chairman of the Committee. The Secretary to
Government, Environment and Forests is the Member Secretary
of the Tamil Nadu State Environmental Committee. The
Committee reviews developmental projects costing over Rs. 50
million from environmental angle (GTN G.O. Ms. No.161 dated
September 26, 1988). There are five sub-committees to assist
the Environmental Committee. The Tamil Nadu Pollution
Control Board processes the proposals on developmental
projects and makes assessment of their impact on
environment, for placing the projects before the sub-
committees and then before the Environmental Committee for
review.
2.5   Madras Metropolitan Groundwater Act
In keeping with the recommendations of a UNDP study
(1975) and the Geological Survey of India (GSI) findings
regarding the use of groundwater in the coastal zone between
South Madras and Kovalam, the Govt. of Tamil Nadu, passed
the Madras Metropolitan Groundwater Act 27 of 1987 in order
to regulate and control the extraction, transport and use of
ground water in any form and to conserve the same in the
City of Madras and certain revenue villages in the
Chengleput District.
2.6    Statutory EA Requirements
As per World Bank O.D.4.01-Annex E (October, 1991),
developmental projects are classified depending on the type,
location, sensitivity, and the scale of the proposed project
as well as the nature and magnitude of its potential
impacts, into one of the three categories as under
2-6



Category A       A Full EA is required
Category B       Although a full EA is not required,
environmental analysis is required
Category C       No EA or environmental analysis is
required
The World Bank has classified the New Veeranam
project under category A requiring full environmental
assessment.
Being a developmental project costing over Rs.50
million, the project has to be reviewed from environmental
angle and cleared by the Tamil Nadu State Environmental
Committee.
In the implementation of the New Veeranam project,
acquisition of private lands is involved for construction of
some of the project components. Such acquisition of land
will be governed by the provisions of the Land Acquisition
Act of 1894 / the Tamil Nadu Requisitioning and
Acquisitioning of Immovable Property Act of 1956. A critique
of these statutory provisions is at Annexure 2.1.

3. DESCRIPTION OF THE
PROPOSED PROJECT



3.     DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT
3.1    Background
Madras, the capital of Tamil Nadu state, is the
largest city in South India with 3.84 million people in the
city and 5.31 million people (1991 census) in the Madras
Metropolitan Area (MMA). The MMA admeasuring a total area
of 1178 sq.km comprises the city of Madras and its outlying
urban and rural areas which consist of 5 townships, 4
municipalities, 23 town panchayats and village panchayats.
The limits of the city were extended in 1978 by way of
adding 12 panchayats, and the total present area is 170
sq.km. The adjacent urban areas (AUA) and distant urban
area (DUA) of MMA are of 165 sq.km and 142 sq.km
respectively.
The existing water supply to the city is dependent
mainly on three interconnected impounded reservoirs, viz.
Poondi, Cholavaram and Redhills and on groundwater from the
Arani-Kortalaiyar aquifers. Raw water is drawn from the
Redhills reservoir and conveyed to treatment plant situated
at Kilpauk in the city. Treated water is distributed to the
city from three major distribution points. This is



supplemented with groundwater from the well fields. These
sources meet the requirement of the city only to the extent
of 290-350 mld. However, the present water requirement of
Madras city and the Metropolitan area is estimated at
1750 mld (Draft Feasibility Report on Source Yield, Tata
Consulting Engineers, February, 1994).
The rapid growth of population, industry and commerce
in the metropolitan area has placed a severe strain on the
meagre water resources of Madras city. As a result, the
city has suffered chronic water shortage for several
decades, despite substantial efforts on the part of the
State and Central Governments to alleviate the situation.
A Master Plan for Water Supply and Wastewater
Management for Madras   was formulated by Engineering
Science, Inc., USA, in 1978. The Master Plan has been
updated in 1991 on the basis of current area development
plans for MMA and prospective source augmentation under the
Krishna Water Supply Project. The First Madras Water Supply
and Sanitation Project, which began in December, 1987 and
extends to 1993/1994, is aimed at effecting systematic
improvements in the existing water supply and wastewater
systems in order to meet the long term requirements of the
city.
3.2    The Second Water Supply Project - New Veeranam
The present water requirements of Madras city and
Metropolitan area (1750 mld) are met only partially to the
extent of 460 mld (maximum) from the existing surface and
ground water sources. The Krishna water supply project,
which is now under implementation, will provide an
additional supply of 930 mld for Madras, 400 mld of which
will be available in the first phase. Even after this
project is completed, there will still be a shortage of
water to meet the needs of the MMA. As a major step towards
supplementing the city water supply, the Government of Tamil
Nadu proposes to develop an additional source of water based
on the Veeranam lake.
3-2



A previous project in which 180 mld of water was to
be conveyed from the Veeranam lake to Madras, a distance of
about 220 km, was partially implemented in the 1970s but was
subsequently abandoned. Under that project, it was proposed
to pump water from Veeranam lake to a water treatment
facility at Vadakuthu, located at about 20 km from Veeranam.
After treatment at Vadakuthu, the clear water was to be
pumped to a reservoir in the southern area of Madras, from
where it would be distributed throughout the city. A raw
water pumping station near Veeranam lake, a treatment
facility and a treated water pumping station at Vadakuthu
were constructed. These facilities remain unused although
in a deteriorated condition.   Many prestressed concrete
pipes, which were proposed for the transmission main, were
manufactured and remain unused near the pipeline right of
way (ROW).
3.2.1  Components of New Veeranam Project
The major components of the New Veeranam project
consist of the following :
i)   Source (Veeranam lake) improvements
ii)   Raw water intake and pumping station at Sethiathope
iii)   Storage tank and pumping station at Vadakuthu
iv)   Storage tank and intermediate booster pumping station
at Chendur (LS 80.3 km)
v)   Water treatment plant and pumping station at Mangalam
vi)   Transmission main from Sethiathope to Porur
i)     Veeranam Lake
Veeranam lake (Fig.3.1), the raw water source is a
shallow lake formed by an earthen embankment, and dates back
to the eleventh century. The salient features of the lake
are summarised in Table 3.1. Under the proposed project, the
lake would act as a balancing reservoir receiving water from
the Cauvery River which is supplied primarily by water
released from the Mettur Reservoir (Fig.3.2). During the
irrigation season water released from the reservoir to the

Cauvery River is then diverted to Coleroon River and finally
reaches the Veeranam lake through the Vadavar channel,
supplementing the lake's own catchment area of 427 sq.km.
The ayacut (Tamil word for cultivable command area) of
Veeranam lake is 18152 ha. The prime irrigation season
commences from third week of June and closes during first
week of February.
The capacity of Veeranam lake estimated in 1991 is
27.72 M Cu.m (979 Mcft) and water spread area at its full
tank level of 13.86 m (45.5 ft) is about 38.85 sq.km. In the
year 1923 its capacity has been reported to be 40.80 M Cu.m
(1441 Mcft), which indicates that the lake has silted up
considerably over the last 68 years. The lake supplies
irrigation water to an adjacent area of 18,152 ha in the
South Arcot district. In addition, the operation rules
necessitate Veeranam lake to supply to neighbouring
Sethiathope Anicut System at times of latter's shortfalls.
In the context of approving Veeranam lake as a source for
drinking water supply to Madras, the Govt. of Tamil Nadu
(vide government order (GO) no. 1430 of October 1993) has
stipulated monthly irrigation and water supply demands, and
provides that water supply requirement be treated as an
additionality during the irrigation season from July to the
subsequent February (8 months period) and for the remaining
period (4 months) by keeping the lake full, the requirements
of Madras city should be met in full. The GO specifically
approves raising of full storage level by 0.61 m for
augmenting the existing capacity in order to meet the
demands during non-irrigation season.
Recent (1993) studies on siltation of Veeranam lake
undertaken by the Institute of Hydraulics and Hydrology,
Poondi, PWD, Tamil Nadu have shown that the trap efficiency
of Veeranam lake in the year 1923 was 90.7% and in the year
1991 it had reduced to 88.4%. The rate of siltation is
0.471% per year. Accordingly, the useful life of the lake
has been estimated to be 206-253 years by various methods.

Historic simulation of LCA - Vadavar - Veeranam lake
system performed for the years 1965-1993 by TCE (The Draft
Feasibility Report on Veeranam Source Yield - Addendum Note,
Sept. 1994) have established the following
Under the present pattern of demand and supply as
obtaining in the LCA Veeranam System, spills
capturable at LCA make it possible to realize
irrigation reliabilities as high as 80% even with the
proposed 192 mld draw off for water supply to Madras.
Thus, the proposed water supply project would not
adversely impact on the first user irrigation rights.
The resulting water supply reliability of 80% can be
increased to 95% by harnessing a nominal amount of
11.4 MCM from Mettur storage on an average every
year.
The augmented Veeranam lake in conjunction with a
lined Vadavar channel is a reliable source of water
supply to Madras city.
Source Improvement Works
In order to enable drawal of 190 mld of water from
Veeranam lake for augmenting the supply to the city of
Madras and to restore the storage capacity of the lake, the
project envisages the following works
a)     Improvements to Vadavar Channel  through desilting
and lining

vi) Transmission Main from Sethiathope to Porur
A single transmission main (with intermediate
pumping/ booster stations) 230 km long, 1525 mm ID and made
of steel plates of 10 mm thick with 12.5 mm thick internal
cement mortar lining and 40 mm thick gunniting for external
surface will be laid underground all along except at
drainage crossings where the pipe will be on bridges, and in
marshy and low lying areas where the pipe will be on
saddles. Buried pipes will be provided with RCC jacketing
in deep cuts and below minor road crossings.
3.3    Alternatives Evaluated
i)     Transmission Line ROW
The 230 km long transmission main traverses through
four districts viz. South Arcot Vallalar District,
Villupuram Ramasamy Padayachiyar District, Chengai- M.G.R.
District and Madras District of Tamil Nadu State.
The alignment of Old Veeranam transmission main
commences from the existing Veeranam Headworks near
Sethiathope, runs cross-country and after crossing Vellar
river skirts along Kumbakonam-Madras (Vadalur-Panruti) road
upto Vadakuthu. From Vadakuthu, the alignment runs cross-
country and along the state Highway over certain reaches,
crosses Gadilam river, railway line near Panruti, Penniar
river, railways near Kolianur and runs along the highway
(Vikravandi-Tindivanam, Thozhupedu).
Near Thozhupedu the alignment detours from National
Highway and traverses along Boodur, Vallipuram and Mudaiyur
3-11



and terminates at the proposed treatment plant at Mangalam
(about 3 km from Thirukazhukundram). The clear water
transmission main from Mangalam traverses cross country and
joins the Highway at a distance of 8 km from
Thirukazhukundram. The alignment then detours from the
Highway to rejoin near Manapathy, traverses along old
Mahabalipuram Road viz. Kelambakkam, Navalur, Semmanjeri,
Sholinganallur, Khandanchavadi. The alignment traverses
cross country and reaches near the rear side of Indian
Institute of Technology Campus (Taramani) and passes via
Gandhimandapam, Kotturpuram Road, Chamiers Road, Mount Road,
Thomas Road, Giriappa Road and Bala Vihar (near Gurunanak
Temple) and terminates near the Southern Headworks of Metro
Board.
The pipeline ROW for the Old Veeranam Project has
been encroached upon in a number of places especially in the
stretch along the Old Mahabalipuram road to the Southern
Headworks. Keeping in view the difficulties envisaged in
clearing these encroachments as also the rehabilitation and
resettlement of the affected population, the following
alternative alignment was considered under the feasibility
study.
The alternative corridor considered for the
transmission pipeline from Kelambakkam to Porur is via
Vandalur upto Pallavaram along the National Highway No.45.
Thereafter, two alternatives were considered. i) along the
G.S.T. Road upto Nehru Statue, Alandur and then to Porur via
Kanchipuram-Bangalore Link Road and ii) from Pallavaram to
Porur via Anakaputhur-Kunrattur villages (Fig. 3.3). The
transmission pipeline alignment recommended by the
feasibility study is shown in Fig.3.4.
ii)    Transmission, Treatment and Pumping
Three alternative schemes have been short-listed for
water transmission, treatment and pumping system. The
parameters of these three alternatives are presented in
Table 3.2.

3-15



On the basis of techno-economic considerations, the
feasibility study recommends Alternative III. The
recommended scheme, consists of one pumping station at
Sethiathope, one at Vadakuthu, one boosting station at
80.3 km chainage from the intake and one at Mangalam. The
existing treatment plant at Vadakuthu will be completely
bypassed and a new treatment plant is proposed to be
constructed at Mangalam.
For the transmission main, steel pipe with internal
diameter of 1525 mm and 10 mm thickness is recommended as
this is the lowest economical size satisfying all design
criteria.
3.4    Project Cost
The Veeranam source improvement works are estimated
to cost Rs.600 million. This provides for escalation charges
at 5% between the two closure periods.
The estimated cost of pumping, treatment and
transmission is Rs.6085 million with a production cost of
Rs.18 per m3. This cost is inclusive of all taxes and
duties, but does not include any physical contingency,
escalation and interest during construction. Thus, the total
estimated project cost is Rs.6685 million.
3.5    Project Implementation
The source improvement works are proposed to be
implemented in a period of two closure periods. The minimum
estimated time (as per feasibility study) for implementation
of pumping, treatment and transmission works is 30 to 32
months subject to the completion of activities related to
i) land acquisition, ii) clearing of encroachments along the
pipeline, ROW, iii) removal of machinery and other items in
the existing pipe fabrication factory, iv) removal and
stacking of PSC pipes lying along the route of the
transmission main, v) removal of all electrical and
mechanical equipment in the existing pump houses at
3-16



Sethiathope and Vadakuthu, and vi) acquiring the ROW for
laying transmission main from Kelambakkam to Porur in the
early stages of the project.
3.6    Useful Life of the Project
The useful life of Veeranam lake estimated based on a
siltation rate of 0.471% per year as determined by the
studies in 1993 by the Institute of Hydraulics and
Hydrology, Poondi, ranges from a minimum of 206 yrs to a
maximum of 253 yrs as obtained by various methods.
Both the foundation and the embankment structure of
Veeranam lake are strong and have withstood floods for
several centuries proving their safety, and the bund has a
negligible permeability of 10-6 cm/sec. Further, the
geotechnical studies undertaken by TCE have confirmed the
adequacy of safe bearing capacity of embankment foundation.
The increase in the water head by 0.61 M is not likely to
cause any increase in seepage through embankment. The check
on stability of embankment in existing condition and with a
maximum water level of 16.8 M have shown that the embankment
is safe under all conditions. Even excessive floods can be
discharged safely through the age old surplus arrangement
structure which have withstood the test of time. There are
sufficient flood carriers to conduct the flood safely from
the Veeranam lake to sea even in the case of extraordinary
floods without causing damage to life and property
downstream.
The proposed transmission main of MS pipe 1525 mm dia
has been designed based on the latest available knowledge on
the subject as laid down in National /International codes
of practices. In order to minimise corrosion, the pipe will
be coated inside and outside with cement mortar lining and
thus, the life of the transmission main is expected to be 50
to 100 yrs. Large diameter Ms pipe lines laid above ground
have been in use in Bombay Water Supply Project for over 50
yrs now. All the associated civil structures of the project
including the treatment works are expected to have a life
3-17



span of 50 - 100 yrs excepting mechanical equipments, which
may have a life span of 25-50 yrs. However, the life of
pumping machinery may range from 15-20 yrs.
3.7    organisational Aspects
The Madras Metropolitan Development Authority (MMDA)
is the agency responsible for planning and overall
development of the MMA. The main organisations responsible
for maintaining water supply and wastewater systems in the
MMA are
a)  Madras Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage
Board (MMWSSB)
b)  Tamilnadu Water Supply and Drainage (TWAD) Board
c)  Irrigation Branch of Public Works Department
(PWD), Government of Tamilnadu
The MMWSSB constituted in 1978 has the statutory
responsibility for planning, design, construction, operation
and maintenance of water supply and wastewater systems in
the city as also the development of groundwater sources in
the MMA.
The TWAD is responsible for the design and
construction of water supply and wastewater systems outside
the city of Madras. The water supply system in the MMA
outside the city is currently operated and maintained by
local authorities with technical assistance from TWAD.
The PWD is incharge of maintenance of source water
reservoirs and associated works.

4.     DESCRIPTION OF THE ENVIRONCENT
4.1    Preamble
Madras is the capital city of Tamil Nadu State and is
located at the hub of an extensive network of land, sea and
air transportation facilities serving South India. It is the
fourth largest city in India and its relatively high
(81.6 %) literacy rate, extensive cultural and educational
facilities, mark it as a major centre of Indian culture. It
is the largest commercial, administrative and industrial
centre of the state. Industries in and around the city have
been a major factor for the growth of the city.
The baseline environmental status of the study area
is presented in this chapter with emphasis on parameters
which are likely to be affected by the project activities.
4.2    Study Area
4.2.1 Madras City
Madras, one of the major metropolitan cities in
India, is situated on the East coast of India at latitude



130041N and longitude 80015'E adjacent to the Bay of Bengal.
The city covered an area of 128 sq.km until 1978 when the
limits were extended to include 12 panchayats in the
periphery of the city and the area increased to about
170 sq.km. The city is now divided into 150 corporation
divisions which include the erstwhile panchayats.
The Tamil Nadu Government constituted the Madras
Metropolitan Development Authority (MMDA), a regional entity
with powers to control land use and implement development
programmes for the metropolitan area covering 1178 sq.km.
The MMDA has developed a master land-use plan for the
metropolitan area, together with zoning plans and
regulations.
4.2.2 Veeranan Lake and its Ayacut
The Veeranam sub-basin falls in Kattumannarkoil,
Keerapalayam and Kumaratchi blocks of Kattumannarkoil taluk
of South Arcot district. It is bounded in the North by the
Vellar river basin, in the South by the Coleroon sub-
basin I, in the East by Vellar river basin and Coleroon
sub-basin I and in the West by the Vellar river basin and
Udayarpalayam taluk of Trichy district. The total
geographical area of the sub-basin is 15849 ha. The Veeranam
lake is located in the South East corner of South Arcot
district and lies between 79025 E and 79050 E longitude and
11015'N and 11025'N latitude.
The Veeranam lake forms part of the Cauvery system in
Tamil Nadu. It functions as a balancing reservoir, receiving
flows from Lower Coleroon Anicut (LCA) through Vadavar
channel and supplementing irrigation of a part of
Sethiathope anicut command in addition to its own.
The Veeranam lake is a major irrigation source in
Chidambaram taluk of South Arcot district of Tamil Nadu
constructed during Chola's regime in the 11th century and
renovated in the first decade of 19th century. The lake
receives water from the Cauvery river and from its own
4-2



catchment area. The surplus water in the Cauvery river flows
into the Coleroon river at Upper Anicut. The Lower Anicut
near Chidambaram is the last Anicut in the Coleroon
Irrigation System. From the Lower Anicut, a channel called
the Vadavar Channel takes off to feed the Veeranam lake. The
Vadavar channel is 22.5 km long and has a carrying capacity
of 56.63 cu.m/sec. (2000 cusecs).
The Veeranam lake with a catchment area of 427 sq.km
(165 sq.miles) has a water spread area of 25.9 sq.km and a
maximum width of 5.64 km. The closure period of the lake is
from mid May to mid June each year. The lake has an ayacut
of 18152 ha. 54 villages of Chidambaram and 74 villages of
Kattumannarkoil taluk of South Arcot district are benefited
by the irrigation system of Veeranam lake covering an area
of 8625 ha and 9497 ha respectively. The total population
benefited is 1,64,387.
In the ayacut and non-ayacut areas of Veeranam lake,
two crops of paddy are raised. A third crop is also raised
in some areas using groundwater tapped through borewells and
dug-cum-bore wells. The first crop (mainly paddy) period is
September to December (N-E monsoon period). During the
second crop season, paddy is accompanied by groundnut. The
third crop is a dry crop, usually pulses and millets. The
normal crop yields in the ayacut area are presented in
Table A.4.1.
In the non-ayacut areas, dry crops are mainly raised
during rainy season. Casuarina groups are often seen on
these areas. Paddy, kuruvai, thaladi (double crop), samba
(single crop); blackgram, greengram, sugarcane, banana are
the major crops on the ayacut areas. The crop yields are 2-
3 tons/ha for paddy,  0.3 tons/ha for pulses,  about
50 tons/ha for sugarcane.
The major crops grown in the catchment area of
Veeranam lake are groundnut, paddy, gingelly', 'cumbu',
sugarcane and cashew (Table A.4.2). Agricultural chemicals
are used in the catchment area for raising crops. The
4-3



fertilizers and pesticides are not applied to the crops
during rainy season and the quantities for pesticides range
from about 300-1000 ml/ha and 0.12-30 kg/ha depending upon
the type and concentration of the active ingredient
(Table A.4.3). The residues from these chemicals and
fertilizers are readily retained in the soils.
4.2.3 Pipeline ROW
The 230 km long transmission main from Veeranam lake
to Madras city traverses through four districts viz. South
Arcot Vellalar district, Villupuram Ramasamy Padayachiyar
district, Chengai- M.G.R. district and Madras district of
Tamil Nadu State.
The alignment of Veeranam transmission main commences
from the existing offtake point near Sethiathope, crosses
Vellar river, and skirts along Kumbakonam- Madras road upto
Vadakuthu. From Vadakuthu, the alignment runs cross-country
and along the State Highway over certain reaches, crosses
Gadilam river, railway line near Panturi, Penniar river,
railway line near Kilianur, runs along the Highway and
terminates at the proposed treatment plant at Mangalam. The
clear water transmission main from Mangalam traverses cross
country and along the Highway to Kelambakkam and then to
Porur via Vandalur upto Pallavaram along the National
Highway No.45, Nehru-Statue, Alandur and Kanchipuram-
Bangalore link road.
4.3   Physical Environment
4.3.1 Geology
The city of Madras is, by and large, located on the
micro-alluvium. However, the area in its neighbourhood
encompasses varieties of rocks from the Archeans to the
Recent, with the stratigraphical succession given in
Table A.4.4.
The Veeranam sub-basin has the following general
geological succession :

Recent and sub-recent : Top soil, sand, clay, clayey
sand and river Alluvium
Tertiary               : Lateritic sandstone, clay,
sand, pebbles etc.
The Alluvium consisting of black cotton clay occupies
a small portion of the sub-basin in its Western part,
whereas the major portion of the sub-basin is occupied by
Cuddalore sandstone tertiary formations. Minor lineaments
are noticed having North East-South West and North West-
South East trend.
The geological formation of the taluks along the
proposed pipeline corridor is tertiary/ alluvium
(Kattumannarkoil),  alluvium  (Chidambaram),  sedimentary/
tertiary (Cuddalore), alluvium/ tertiary (Panruti),
alluvium/ crystalline hardrock (Villupuram), crystalline
rock (Tindivanam) and Alluvium (Saidapet).
4.3.2 Topography
The MMA is extremely flat with almost no hills. The
average slope within the city of Madras is less than one
metre per 1,500 metres, a factor which presents numerous
difficulties in providing wastewater drainage facilities.
The city is traversed by three major rivers, the Cooum, the
Adyar, and the Kortalaiyar. In addition, the Buckingham
canal, a navigable body of water, passes through the city
parallel to the coast. Numerous small streams traverse the
area, and these, together with a series of swampy areas
located primarily north and south of the city limits, serve
as the receiving waters for overflows from the existing
sewerage system and flows from unsewered areas. The
urbanised portions of the MMA and surrounding rural areas
are dotted by dozens of small shallow tanks which store
water from the monsoonal runoff for use in crop irrigation,
primarily rice paddy. The four major tanks of significance
to the Madras water supply system are Poondi, Cholavaram,
Redhills, and Chembarambakkam.
4-5



The area irrigated by Veeranam lake is a flat terrain
which extends to Bay of Bengal and weakens 32 km East to
West and 40 Km North to South along sea coast.
The topography along the proposed alignment of water
supply pipeline (ROW) is undulating with RL ranging from a
low of 4.4 m to a high of 82.09 m and is crossed by rivers,
drainage channels, railways and State/ National Highway.
4.3.3 Soils
The major soil types encountered in MMA are fine
loamy to coarse loamy with a wide range in colours : pale
yellow, brown strong brown; in depth-shallow to very deep.
The soils are gradually well drained with level to slightly
sloping land surfaces. These soils are suitable for crops
such as paddy, pulses, millets, groundnut, coconut, and tree
species.
Major soil types and characteristics in the region
covered by Veeranam lake are presented in Table A.4.5. Data
on major soil types, geology and depth of water table
encountered along the pipeline corridor is presented in
Table A.4.6. Information on classification of soils along
the pipeline corridor is presented in Table A.4.7.
Information available from PWD on soil characteristics
indicates that the soil along the corridor is noncorrosive
except a 10 km stretch from Sethiathope towards Vadakuthu,
and at chainage 101.7 km.
Many villages in the Veeranam sub-basin also have
non-ayacut areas and are cultivated dry or rainfed or using
the groundwater supply.
4.3.4 Climate and Meteorology
The Madras urban area enjoys a tropical climate with
a mean annual temperature averaging above 300C. The weather
patterns are dominated by the North-West monsoons, which
normally occur during October through December and the South
4-6



West monsoons, which occur between June and September. The
average annual rainfall is 130 cm. Almost all the rainfall
normally occurs during the monsoonal periods, with the
North-East monsoon contributing the larger share. The
hottest and driest part of the year occurs during April and
May, during which time temperatures range up to 450C, and
humidity is usually between 65 to 80 percent. The impact of
the high temperatures and humidity which prevail throughout
most of the year is softened considerably by the cooling
sea-breezes during every day of the year.
Generally, like Tamil Nadu, Veeranam lake area and
its watershed are situated in the rain shadow region for
South West monsoon. It has got sub-tropical climate.
Veeranam lake is situated nearer to the seashore i.e. about
30 km from Bay of Bengal. Hot weather prevails in the months
of March to June, and the maximum temperature varies from
300c to 380c. Because of its proximity to the sea-shore,
cyclones hit the sea shore during North East monsoon,
resulting in heavy rains. Two rainfall stations are situated
in Veeranam lake; one at its right flank i.e. Kattumannar
Koil and another at the left flank i.e. Sethiathope. The 50
year average rainfall in these stations is 1010 mm and
1198 mm which is more than the state average of 950 mm. The
months of October to December account for nearly 57 % of
annual total rainfall. But, due to the vagaries of North
East monsoon, Veeranam lake has to depend on water from
Mettur dam often. The 'potential evapotranspiration (PET)
values for Veeranam catchment is about 810-1100 mm with air
temperature ranging from 240 to 310C.
4.3.5 Air Quality
Ambient air quality survey was carried out along the
pipeline ROW at Tindivanam, Mangalam and Madras to determine
the background air pollutant concentrations, viz. SPM, SO2,
NOX in the pre-project environment. Air sampling was
carried out at Mangalam to assess the baseline air quality
at proposed water treatment site as also at a site away
from the National Highway. The results are summarised in
4-7



Table A.4.8 alongwith air quality data generated by M/s.
Neyveli Lignite Corporation for Vadakuthu and air quality
data of Neyveli (which is in the vicinity of the pipeline
ROW) generated by Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board at NLC
Complex where Thermal Power Plants and Fertilizer Plants are
running round the clock. The pollution levels are very much
below  the  CPCB  standards.    The  SO2'  NOX  and  SPM
concentrations at Madras will not alter much during the
project activity. The SPM concentration of 169 Ag/m3 is less
than the standard for commercial zone.
The predominant wind directions of NLC were East and
South and the mean wind velocity was 3.5 km/hr. The dominant
wind directions at Vadakuthu were South West and North East.
Most of the time the wind velocities were in the range of
0.5-5.4 kmph. The wind rose at Tindivanam shows 60.3% calm
condition, the dominant direction was North East, other
directions being East, South East, North East and West in
the frequency range of 2.1 to 4.2%. Typically at Tindivanam
the wind velocities never increased beyond 2.9 kmph.
Therefore, the carry over of the SPM   during project
activity will also be minimum. The wind rose at Madras is
depicted in Fig.4.1. The proposed pipeline laying activity
may not appreciably disturb the existing air environment.
4.3.6 Noise Levels
A survey of noise pollution in the project area was
undertaken to measure background noise levels and to assess
the impact of noise that will be generated during
construction of pipeline, proposed intake at Veeranam,
pumping/ booster station(s) and, water treatment plant. The
results are presented in Table A.4.9 through A.4.13
The noise arising from the construction of large
diameter pipe line from Veeranam to Madras will be complex
in nature as it will be from multiple sources. This noise
will be of a temporary nature. The post construction
activity will generate continuous noise from the pumping
stations, booster station(s) and at water treatment plant.

The main sources of noise will be water pumps of capacity
700-1000 HP.
The general noise pollution status due to traffic,
industrial and commercial activities was monitored along the
pipeline ROW from Madras to Lalpet at locations in human
settlements adjoining the pipeline, roads, railway crossings
and river crossings.
In the villages surveyed, the noise levels were in
the range 38-46 dBA. However, in urban localities noise
levels  were  in the  range  of  46-52  dBA  except  at
Thiruvanmiyur. Noise levels in the sensitive areas were in
the range of 42-52 dBA. The noise levels in the vicinity of
various industries within the study area varied from 50 to
58 dBA.
The traffic activity on road from Madras to Veeranam
lake adjoining the route of the proposed pipe line is high.
Noise levels due to vehicular traffic on roads, river
crossings and railway crossings in the study area are in the
range of 52-76 dBA (Leq for one hour). The other source of
traffic is the network of meter gauge railway tracks from
Madras to Vridhachalam.
In general, the results show that day and night noise
levels measured at these locations are well within the
standards (Table A.4.14) prescribed by Ministry of
Environment and Forests, Government of India notification
1986 except at sensitive receptors monitored in the study
area.
4.3.7 Surface Water Hydrology
The important rivers in the vicinity of MMA, starting
from the North are Araniyar, Kortalaiyar, Cooum, Adyar and
Palar, all discharging into the Bay of Bengal.
Araniyar river is the northernmost river of Tamil
Nadu State, and naturally of Chengleput district as well.
4-10



After originating in Andhra Pradesh the river meets the sea
near Ponneri. In Andhra Pradesh a reservoir of 53 Mcum
capacity has been constructed near Pichattoorin to support
irrigation of about 2000 ha. Surattapalle anicut diverts
water to fill in a chain of tanks in Tamil Nadu. Two more
smaller anicuts have been added to this downstream at
Annappanaichenkuppam and Lakshmipuram.   Of the total
catchment of 1450 sq. km, 700 sq. km lie in Andhra Pradesh
where it is fully utilised, while surplus water to the
extent of about 50 MCum flows down annually in heavy floods
to be utilised through several small tanks for irrigation in
Tamil Nadu.
Kortalaiyar river is the next easterly flowing river.
An anicut was constructed on the river at Tamarapakkam much
before independence to link the storages in the existing
irrigation tanks of Cholavaram and Redhills, formed
originally by the Cholas and the Pallavas, with both upper
and lower supply channels. From the Redhills reservoir an
open channel was dug up to the City limits, with timely
improvement and strengthening of the reservoirs in 1912. In
1914, the system was qualitatively improved by installing a
proper intake (Jones Tower) in the Redhills lake and
conveying the same to the Kilpauk Water Works, where water
was treated before distribution. All this was planned to
meet the water supply of 32000 m3/d for a population of
just 4.7 lakhs.
With rising demand of water supply to the City in the
forties another anicut was created by constructing the
Poondi Regulator and a reservoir of that name on the river,
30 km upstream of Tamarapakkam of capacity 77.2 M Cu.m,
thereby raising the potential by almost 5 times to
159000 m3/d. Later, when the scarcity was felt in the
sixties, the full tank levels of Cholavaram and Redhills
were raised by 1.22 and 0.61 m respectively along with the
exclusive irrigation rights of their command area totaling
to 3000 ha. In 1973, a separate head sluice was provided in
the Poondi reservoir with a lined channel to draw 100 cusecs
of water for direct flow of the Tamarapakkam anicut by
4-11



avoiding river losses. Presently, the river has no
irrigation commitment, except down below under the Vallur
anicut, close to its confluence with Bay of Bengal. Now
Tamarapakkam is the last point of utilisation on the river
for water supply diversions with Red Hills Lake serving as
the terminal tank. This arrangement has stood for the whole
of seventies and for the major part of eighties through
floods, surplus years and as well for non-surplus and acute
scarcity years. It is now proposed to raise the full supply
level at the Redhills Lake permanently by another 0.6 m to
receive the water of the Telugu Ganga for water supply to
the Madras Metropolitan Area.
The water balance for Poondi, Cholavaram, Redhills
and Chembarambakkam reconciled from the water balances based
on 20 year records (1963-83) are presented in Table A.4.15.
The salient data of existing reservoirs is summarised in
Table A.4.16.
The easterly flowing Cooum river is 65 km long with
a catchment area of 290 sq. km and meets the sea south of
the Madras harbour. Adyar river is still another easterly
flowing stream further south, 42 km long with a catchment
area of 860 sq. km, of which 300 sq. km lie in the
Chembarambakkam sub-basin.  However, both these rivers are
presently not being tapped  for City water supply, and  the
former is, in fact, serving as the sewage drain of the
Metropolitan City.
In addition to the above, there are 2877 shallow
tubewell hand pumps and 5304 India Mark II hand pumps within
the city area installed by MMWSSB. Also, individual
households have open wells and borewells in their premises
to supplement water requirements. The water resources
potential from these areas for Madras city is presented in
Table A.4.17.
The hydrologic studies of the Arani, Kortalaiyar and
Palar rivers revealed that the surplus flow to the sea
averages 94 M Cu.m and 398 M Cu.m respectively. The surplus
4-12



flow in the Arani river can easily be diverted through a
canal to the Kortalaiyar and thus into the Madras city water
supply system. The average annual ground water recharge of
the Arani-Kortalaiyar basin is about 450 M Cu.m. This
includes recharge from rain, infiltration in river beds and
irrigation return. Average pumping from this basin (mostly
for irrigation) during 1980-1984 was approximately
350 M Cu.m. In years of normal or above normal rainfall,
recharge exceeds discharge.
4.3.8 Groundwater Hydrology
In Veeranam sub-basins, both Alluvium and Tertiary
formations have good aquifer zones which are present in
deeper levels. These zones are under hydrostatic stress.
Based on dugwell pump test conducted in Kurungudi and
Palayamkottai villages, transmissivity of Kurungudi is
computed as 1118 gpd/ft. The seepage study conducted in an
irrigated paddy field at Nangudi village, gave a daily
seepage rate of 5.90 mm/day. The tank seepage study
conducted in the Kanur and Vattathur villages yielded a
seepage rate for the two locations as 2.73 mm/day and
0.92 mm/day respectively.
Based on topography and land use the sub-basin has
been classified into Ayacut and non-Ayacut areas. In the
Ayacut area, there are 221 borewells, filter points and
dugwells of which dugwells are very limited. The depth of
filter points ranges between 6 m and 14 m with Alluvium in
the top and lateritic formation at the bottom. The filter
points generally give copious supply of water, irrigating
1-2 hectares. The depth of dug wells varies between 8 m and
10 m. The water level reaches ground level in winter and in
normal rainfall years. During summer, water level ranges
from 7 m to 9 m below ground level. Recharge is mainly from
rainfall infiltration, seepage from surface water bodies and
seepage from applied water both surface and sub-surface. The
quality of water is generally good.
4-13



In the Non-ayacut area, there are 825 wells which
include borewells, filter points and a limited number of
dugwells. Generally, the depth of wells varies from 10 m to
19 m. The water level reaches ground level during winter and
normal rainfall years. During summer, the water level ranges
from 8 m to 13 m below ground level.

is given below

Geophysical depth probe at a few sites resulted in
low resistivity indicating presence of alluvial formation
extending to 80 m at places. A borewell drilled at Lalpet to
a depth of 412 meters yielded 1936 1/m. The formations
encountered in the borehole were sandstone and shale (0-
150 m) and fine to coarse sand including lignite (150-
412 m).
Studies using aerial photography (without field
checks) have shown a number of lineaments trending North-
East to South-West and North-West to South-East in the
Veeranam Kumavachi and Chidambaram areas. Existance of
geological facets/ seismic conditions is not reported.
4.3.9 Water Quality
The major water supply to Madras city is from Kilpauk
water works. Raw water quality at Kilpuak water works for
the years 1991, 1992 and 1993 is presented in Table A.4.18.
Groundwater quality (Table A.4.19) in MMA indicates high
electrical conductivity, hardness and chlorides. Treated
water quality at Kilpauk pumping station shows that the
4-14



water is soft with negative Langelier Index. Groundwater
quality data for years 1992 and 1993 from a number of
borewells in the villages along the proposed pipeline ROW in
South Arcot district is presented in Table A.4.20.
The Veeranam lake is traditionally being used as an
irrigation water source. Since water from this lake will be
used for Madras city water supply, detailed analysis of
water samples including for heavy metals and pesticides was
undertaken by NEERI and the results are presented in
Table 4.1. The sampling locations are depicted in Fig.4.2.
Data on water quality assessment of Veeranam lake carried
out by the Directorate of Public Health and Preventive
Medicine, Guindy, Madras is presented in Table A.4.21. A
summary of the physico-chemical water quality of Veeranam
lake for the period 1968 - 1978 is presented in
Table A.4.22. A perusal of the above data indicates no
significant variation in quality over the years. TNPCB has
monitored the Veeranam lake water quality for pesticide
concentration and the summary data is presented in
Table A.4.23. The results indicate that pesticide
concentration is below detectable limits and that the
presence of heavy metals is also below permissible limits as
per BIS 10500. Thus, the quality of Veeranam Lake water
indicates that the water source falls under class C as per
BIS 2296 (1982) Tolerance Limits for Inland Surface Waters'
and that the source can be considered for public water
supply after complete conventional treatment followed by
disinfection.

4.4    Biological Envirorunent
The properties of plant and animal communities can be
utilised to assess the impact of the project on flora and
fauna of the region which are important components of land
and aquatic ecology. Conservation strategies can be followed
if the baseline condition of the area is studied and
understood.
The Veeranam pipeline alignment skirts the national/
state Highway and also runs cross country through natural
vegetation and agricultural fields. The sensitive
ecosystems in the nearby areas are Arignar Anna Zoological
park, Vedanthangal Wild Life Sanctuary, Karikili Bird
Sanctuary and Guindy National Park. Observations on the
flora and fauna of the region were made by dividing the
entire area into the following sectors :

4.4.1 Terrestrial Ecology
Natural Flora
The nature and extent of forest vegetation in this
area is determined by dry weather and interference of man
through clearing of forest, grazing, shifting cultivation,
4-19



and increasing population. The flora consists of drier,
harsher and deciduous species. The percentages of forest
area to land in Chengleput and South Arcot districts are 6%
and 11% respectively. However, very less natural vegetation
cover is present around the alignment (Figs 4.3 and 4.4).
Rest of the area is occupied by agricultural fields,
plantations and open scrub forests. The list of trees,
shrubs recorded from the various sectors of study area is
given in Table A.4.24.
Avenue plantation along the alignment is dominated by
Tamarindus indica. Prosopis sp.. Acacia sp., Palm trees,
Eucalvytus sp. etc. The nearby areas and the road sides are
occupied by open thorn forests of Prosopis and Acacias,
agricultural fields of crops and sugarcane, plantations of
Casuarina. Palmyra. Eucalyvtus and cashew nut. Cashew nut
plantations are very common in South Arcot district. Many
aquatic weeds have been recorded from the area around
Veeranam lake.
Natural Fauna
Major portion of the study area along the alignment
consists of inhabited land or agricultural land. There are,
however, patches of natural forest, reserve forest and
agroforest. The fauna is, therefore, limited to grazers
viz. cow, goat and sheep which are domesticated. Larger
mammals and reptiles are present only in the National Parks
and Wildlife Sanctuaries. In the open terrestrial area,
amongst the natural vegetation the avifauna constitutes a
significant portion of the terrestrial fauna.
Birds
The common bird species recorded from visual
observations made in the study area are the little

eater, mynahs, babblers, white wagtail, redvented bulbul,
jungle crow and weaver bird. The list of birds present in
the area is given in Table A.4.25.
The indigenous birds can be categorised broadly as
cormorants, dartors, egrets, herons, ibises and other birds.
Depending on their migratory and nesting habits the birds of
the area may be classified as
i.     Migrants and other birds visiting the area for feed.
These are ducks, teals, pintail, pelicans, coots,
ring plovers, herons, river terns and spoonbills.
This category is mainly present in the water bird
sanctuaries viz. the Vedanthangal, Karikili and
Arignar Anna Zoological Park.
ii.    Birds noticed on trees and tank bunds e.g. parakeet,
myna, king crow, king fisher, blue jay, cuckoos.
iii.   Scavengers and predatory birds: e.g. Kites, eagles,
falcons, house crow, Harrier & Scavenger vultures.
Kamials
Only domestic animals were observed in the study area
other than the zoological parks and sanctuaries.   These
include cows, goats, sheep, pigs, horses and buffaloes.
However, a variety of common, rare and endangered mammals
which include Indian antelope, spotted deer, white buck,
bonnet monkey, small civet cat, jungle cat, jackal,
porcupine, will ass, zebra, gaur, red sheep, hippopotamus,
camel, elephants are present in the Arignar Anna Zoological
Park, Vandalur.  List of exotic species in Arignar Anna
Zoological Park, Vandalur is given in Table A.4.26. The
status of collection of mammals in this park is given in
Table A.4.27 and the list of animals including the
endangered species in the park is given in Table A.4.28.

Reptiles
Reptiles in the study area were not observed
excepting the garden lizard Calotes versicolor. The Guindy
National Park has within it the Madras Snake Park with a
reptile research centre and the Arignar Anna Zoological Park
has a collection of reptiles as indicated below.

The important reptile species present in these parks
are snakes viz. Cobra, Krait, Russels viper, sand boa,
pythan; the Indian crocodile, sharial, tortoises,
chamaleons, Alligator and monitor lizard.
Veeranaz Lake
Many permanent weeds are growing in the shallow basin
of the lake. Water spread area of the lake was reduced due
to growth of weeds. About 20-30 percent of the lake is
covered with aquatic weeds. The upstream portion was also
occupied by aquatic weeds and a large number of trees. The
dominant weeds in the lake were Potamoceton sp. and Iponoea
SD    Apart from these weeds other weeds are Hydrilla and
Vallisnaria. The bird population in Veeranam area is
represented by little grebe, Indian pond heron, Indian
moorhen, kingfisher, open billed stork and white breasted
kingfisher.
Vadavar Channel
The Vadavar channel which feeds water to Veeranam
lake is infested at places by dense growth of aquatic weeds
such as Ipomoea SD., Hydrilla sF., Ipomoea aauatica etc. on
its banks.

Forests
Chengleput district shows some patches of natural
vegetation in the nearby areas around the alignment. These
patches are of dense forests, sparse forests, dense scrub,
sparse scrub and plantations. In dry evergreen forests, a
complete canopy consisting mostly of small evergreen trees
with coriacous leaves was formed. The climbers were
numerous. Bamboos were rare. Grasses were not conspicuous.
Chief tree species in these forests were Manilkara hexandra,
Mimusops elengi, Diospyros elsenum, Strychnos nux-vomica,
Eugenia sp., Drypetes sepiaria and Memecylon edule.
The thorn forests in Chengleput and South Arcot-
districts were degraded type of forests. The species found
in these forests were varieties of Acacia, chief Zizvphus
and fleshy Euphorbia and other useful species such as
Chloroxvlon swietenia, Albizzia amara, Acacia chundra.
Acacia ferruginea. Azadirachta indica. Canthium diocum.
ErvthroXvlon monogynum. Zizvphus mauritiana. Zizvphus
zyropyrus. Atlantia monophylla.
4.4.2 Aquatic Ecology
Mostly the upstream and downstream portion of the
Veeranam lake is infested by aquatic weeds and marshy
terrestrial vegetation. The siltation is very high and water
spread area is very small.
Aquatic Weeds
Veeranam lake is extensively infested by Ipomoea sp.
and Vallisnaria sp. The Ipomoea has formed a permanent
vegetation along the banks. Once these plants are
established, they can grow well and tolerate partial
submergence of water. Again the water level is fluctuating
and the lake becomes dry in surmier season. So the plants get
suitable environment to grow and spread in the lake basin.
Other weed species are Ipomea palmata, Hydrilla. Potamoceton
ap. etc. In the upstream portion of the lake a dense
4-25



vegetation of phreatophytes or marshy plant is observed
which has been described in terrestrial vegetation.
Planxkton
Composite water samples were collected from four
stations in Veeranam lake : I Near offtake point, II A Near
Radha Sluice, II B 10 km upstream of intake point, and III
Vadavar channel.
Phytoplankton
The results of phytoplankton analysis are shown in
Tables A.4.29 and A.4.30. The total algal count varied from
2.4 x 103 to 4.4 x 104 (September 1993) and 8.5x103 to
3.8x104 (February 1994) algae/100 ml in Veeranam lake and 7
34
X 10 (September 1993) and 3.6x104 (February 1994) algae per
100 ml in Vadavar channel. The count is not very high and is
comparable to the rivers with optimum nutrient enrichment.
The algal count is less in the samples collected from
upstream portion (station No.II) while the algal count shows
increasing trend in the downstream portion with dense
macrophytic growth. These downstream samples showed release
of nutrients from organically enriched sediment due to death
and decay of these macrophytes in summer season. Vadavar
channel also showed higher algal count on account of release
of nutrients from organically enriched sediments.
The composition of phytoplankton population showed
that the bacillariophyceae is more at upstream sampling
point in Veeranam lake with 40% green algae and 20% blue
green algae. Bacillariophyceae being the indicator of clean
water quality, the water quality of Veeranam lake at
upstream point is good but shows optimum enrichment of
nutrients in the river. However, in the downstream portion
of Veeranam lake the bacillariophyceae decrease in its
quantity and greens and blue greens show more or less equal
dominance showing higher level of nutrient enrichment, the
water quality is good. Euglenophyceaen member is also
4-26



recorded at downstream water intake point showing slight
organic pollution in water.
The above observations are supported by the values of
Palmer's Pollution Index. The Palmer's Pollution Index
values are low in upstream area and more in downstream area
showing higher enrichment at downstream stations. However,
these values are less than 15 showing absence of organic
pollution in the lake water.
Chlorophyll-a values (mg/l) are shown in
Table A.4.31. These values are less in upstream area and
more in downstream area showing higher productivity of algal
biomass due to increase in nutrients released from enriched
sediments. Vadavar channel also showed higher chlorophyll-a
content indicative of nutrient enrichment. Observations on
phytoplankton community of Veeranam lake are presented in
Table A.4.32.
Zooplankton
Results of zooplankton analysis are presented in
Tables A.4.33 through A.4.35. The total zooplankton count
varies from 700-1340/m3 of water in Veeranam lake. In
Vadavar channel, the count was lower i.e. 180-600/m3. The
higher count of 1340/m3 near Radha sluice can be attributed
to increase in nutrient level due to human activity at this
point. The zooplankton species recorded in the Veeranam lake
and Vadavar Channel represented by species of Protozoa,
Rotifera, Cladocera, Copepoda and Ostracpda which are
components of normal lake plankton in India. Presence of
ciliated protozoa Prorodon sp. and early life stages of
Chironomus tendipediformis indicate eutrophic condition of
the lake at station No.II and III. Shannon Weaver Index of
community diversity calculated from zooplankton data
indicate higher values i.e. 2.5 and 2.81 at station I both
in September as well as March, 1994 samples indicating
comparatively better water quality. At stations II, IIB and
III on the other hand the diversity is reduced as is evident
4-27



from TableA.4.34 which indicates eutrophic condition of the
lake at these sites.
Fishery of Veeranan Lake
Veeranam lake is traditionally used for irrigation
and fishery activity is secondary. Major variety of fish
that are autostocked are Cirrhina reba, Labeo kalbasu. The
varieties of fish stocked in the adjoining Lalpet hatchery
are Catla catla, Cirrhina mriqala and Labeo rohita.
Fishing activity is undertaken only for 4-5 months.
Fish seed is given to the fishermen (a society formed by
1000 fishermen) free of cost. Main type of fishing is by use
of gill net and cast net for which a nominal sum is levied
by the state fishery department. A hatchery at Lalpet
undertakes induced spawning of carps.
The record of fish landing during 1989-90 and 1990-91
is as follows
Year      No.of  seeds  stocked        Fish landing (kgs)
1989-90         15,00,054                   13,705
1990-91          5,71,297                   15,104
* Fry of 1-2 cm size approximately.
Coxnercial Fisheries of Madras Region
Information on the fisheries of the region can be
broadly divided into inland fisheries and marine fisheries.
The inland fisheries and fresh water fisheries include
riverine fisheries, reservoirs, ponds, and tank culture. The
marine fishery includes coastal fishery, and estuarine
fishery.
A)   Inland Fishery
i)   Poondi Reservoir : The indigenous fishery of this
reservoir comprises mainly of the catfish Wallago attu
Notopterus sp. The introduced fishes like Cirrhina mrigala,
4-28



Labeo rohita Labeo calbasu and Tilapia mossambica show good
growth.   Etroplus suratensis and Cirrhina reba are also
present in this reservoir.
ii) Chetput Swamp : This is located in Chetput division of
Madras City. The swamp has a water spread area of about
4 hectares and its depth ranges from 0.5 to 3.0 m. It has
overgrowth of vegetation like Hydrilla and Vallisnaria.
Frogs, water snakes, tortoises and predatory fishes viz.
Anabus testudienes Ophiocephalus punctatus, Sacchotoranchus
fossils, Notoplerus notoplerius etc are common. The major
fish species of this swamp include Tilapia mossambica (82%),
Catla Catla, Ophicoephalus striatus, Cirrhina reba, Labeo
striatus, Labeo rohita, Cyprinus carpio, Electorplus
suratensis, Chanos Chanos etc.
iii) Fishes of some Madras ponds    Almost all the ponds
maintained by the state fisheries department have been
stocked with Tilapia mossambica along with carps and Chanos
chomos Tilapia a fish with high growth rate, large
reproductive capabilities  and palatable enough for human
consumption. However, they compete with finer carp
varieties and restrict their growth. The general yield of
Tilapia is reported to be 500-1000 kg/ha. Some of the ponds
yielding Tilapia in the project area are listed in
Table A.4.36.
iv) Cooun River : The river is heavily polluted and
possibility of fish existing in the river is remote.
However, presence of some variety of fish is indicated from
occasional catches made by local fishermen. The fishes and
macro crustaceans reported from the Cooum river are Ambassis
nama, Anabus scanders, Chanos chanos, Etroplus maculatus,
Megalops cyprenoides, Mugil sp.,  Ophiocephalus striatus,
Penaeus indicus, Therapon jarbua, and Sillage sihama.
Tilapia was unable to establish itself in Cooum river.
4-29



B)     Marine Fishery
i)   Coastal Fishery : Between Madras harbour and Covelong,
about 29 km of the coastline is shallow and sandy and is
exposed to heavy surf throughout the year. The city of
Madras extends northwards along the coast for about 16 km
from the mouth of the Adyar river. The Cooum, a small and
sluggish river, flows through the city and joins the sea
about 3.5 km north of the Adyar river mouth. The Cooum river
mouth is closed by sandbar throughout the year except for a
few days during rainy season. The inshore waters within the
20 fathoms contour is rich in prawns. The catch effort is on
an average 34 kg/hr during the peak season. Prawn trawelling
and processing is therefore an important industry in the
coastal areas of Madras and Chengleput districts.
Marine fishery is divided into Pelagic variety (caught
by netting) and Demersal variety (caught by trawellers).
The important varieties from commercial point of view are :
Pelagic   : Oil sardines, Lesser sardires, Hilsa,
Caranx, Mackerel, Seer, Tunnies, Mugil, Anchoviella
Deuersal  : Sharks, Skates and Rays, Perches, Red
Mullets, Sciaenids, Pomfrets, Lactarius, Penaeid Prawns, Non
Penaeid Prawns, Crabs, Cephalopods, and Leignathus. The
list of common marine fishes, is given in Table A.4.37. A
study undertaken by Zoological Survey of India, marine
biological station, Santhome, Madras in the coastal waters
of the region during 1980-87 has indicated heavy metal (Cd,
Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn) contamination of both shellfish and finfish
exceeding the permissible limits.
ii)    Estuarine Fisheries : Chengleput district in Madras
state with an area of about 7500 sq. km. has a sea coast of
about 115 km. The district has the following estuaries that
are important from fisheries point of view
Pulicat Lake       40 km to the north of Madras city
Ennore Estuary      16 km to north of Madras city
Cooum Estuary      situated in Madras city and enters
the sea adjacent to the Madras
Fort St. George
4-30



Adyar Estuary      situated in the Madras city is
5 km   to the  south  of Cooum
Estuary.
Pulicat Lake
It is the second longest stretch of backwaters in the
east coast of India forming an important source of fish and
prawn supply to the markets of Madras city. The lake extends
for a distance of 59 km with a total water spread area of
178 sq. km. About 1/3 of the total area of Pulicat lake,
rich in fisheries, lies in the Chengleput district of Tamil
Nadu. The rest 2/3 area lies in the Nellore district of
Andhra Pradesh.
The major species of commercial importance in Pulicat
lake are prawns and mullets. The fishery of Pulicat lake
largely depends on the Bay of Bengal for enough supply of
larvae and juveniles of fish, prawns, crabs and edible
molluscs. The commercially important fish species in
Pulicat lake are Mugil cephalus, Mugil macrolepis, Mugil
parsia, Mugil cunnesius, Nematalosa nasus, Sillago sihama,
Penaeus indicus, Penaues monodom, Metapenaeus monoceros,
Metapenaeus dobsoni, Neptunus pelagicus, and Scylla serrata.
Ennore Estuary
This estuary 16 km north of Madras city is 3 km long,
one km wide; and the depth varies from 1.5-2.5 m.
Kortalaiyar river forms the main channel for this estuary,
besides Buckingham canal and Redhills surplus channel.  The
estuary is having a number of oyster beds and mussel beds.
Prior to the dredging, the estuary was undisturbed and
regular fishing operations were carried out.  Now, due to
the establishment of thermal power station, huge quantity of
water is drawn from the estuary for cooling purposes. For
this, the mouth of the estuary is kept open by dredging
operation.
4-31



In Ennore estuary the fish landings were mainly
represented by mullets and prawns. Commercially important
species are Mugil cephalus, Mugil cunnesius, Mugil
macrolepis, Mugil tada, Acentogobius cannius, A. Globiceps,
Ctenogobius criniger, and Glossogobius biocelatus and the
prawn sp. viz. penaeus indicus, panaeus monodom, Metapenaeus
monoceros, M. doboni. Oyster beds are also exposed during
the low tides, and the main species is crassostrea
madrasensis. Oyster shells are used for preparing lime and
poultry feed.  Other important molluscs are Mytilus viridix
and Meretrix casta.
Pest Species and Disease Vectors
Species of mosquitoes viz. Anopheles stephensi and
Anopheles culcifacies causing malaria, and Culex
ciuinauefasciatus causing filaria have been reported in the
city of Madras. In Chengleput and South Arcot districts,
having paddy fields, the presence of mosquitoes has been
reported to be more. The rice fields and fresh water bodies
are the breeding places for mosquitoes viz. Culex vishnui
and Culex tritieniorhyncus which cause brain fever.
In the Veeranam lake, snails belonging to genus
LYmnaea sp. and Indoplanorbis sp. are observed. These
gastropodes are reported vectors of Schistosomiasis
(helminth infection) which cause allergy and kidney
infection by helminth Schistosoma sp. and Schistosoma
haematobium. Stagnation of water bodies promotes mosquito
breeding which will not occur at Veeranam lake if the depth
is increased by desilting and deweeding. Deweeding will help
in controlling the gastropod vectors of Schistosomiasis
which have been reported sporadically in some areas of Tamil
Nadu.

4.4.3 Sensitive Areas
Arignar Anna Zoological Park
This park is developed in Vandalur Reserve Forest
area. It was opened for the public in 1985. This is one of
the biggest zoos in South East Asia extending over an area
of 510 ha. A special feature of the park is that it has
been entrusted with the specific task of breeding and
rearing of the endangered lion-tailed macaques Macaca
silenus in an endeavour to preserve and conserve this
endangered mammal.   This park is also the black buck
breeding centre. The fawns are specially hand reared to add
to their growing population.
The park has the distinction of housing animals in
their natural habitat. This is achieved by providing open
moated enclosures enriched with suitable vegetation that
give the animals a feel of their natural wild environment.
The zoo is also provided with Quarantine Veterinary facility
and a fodder bank. Important species worth mentioning are
Indian antelope, black buck, white buck, spotted deer,
bonnet monkey, porcupine wild ass, red sheep, elephants,
white ass, red sheep, zebra, camel, tigers, slender loris,
black bean, otters, an aviary with 86 species of birds and a
Reptile section which has gharials, tortoises and turtles.
Endangered species of mammals (17) birds (4) and reptiles
(4) are protected and conserved in the park.
Most important and dominant flora of this park are as
follows:
PonQamia pinnata. Azadirachta indica. Bauhinia sp..
Delonix regia, Albizia lebbeck. Dalberaia s., Tamarindus
indica, Bamboos, Tectona crandis, Cassia sp., Acacia sp..

Vedanthangal Water Bird Sanctuary
Vedanthangal water bird sanctuary is situated 80 km
from Madras off National Highway No.45. It is one of the
oldest water bird sanctuaries in India. The sanctuary has
been declared as a reserved land. The government of Tamil
Nadu has prohibited the shooting of birds within 20 km
radius of the sanctuary under the Wildlife & Animal
Protection Act. The mixed "Heronayzy" is said to be the most
spectacular of its kind in India and several birds visit
Vedanthangal for nesting and breeding. The number of birds
vary from year to year depending on the rainfall. The birds
include the following major categories:
Regular nesting birds e.g. little cormorant, darter,
shag, egrets, pond heron, grey heron, open billed
stork, spoonbill, white ibis and little grebe
ii.    Non-breeding indigenous birds eg. pelicans, coots and
black winged stilt
iii.   Distant migrants eg. sandpiper, grey wagtail and
garganey teal
iv.    Brilliantly plumaged song birds eg. golden oriole,
kingfisher, weaver bird, blue jay, cuckoos and robins
Though the nesting period and duration are dependent
on the rainfall, normally November to January is the period
when birds abound the area.
Many trees and plants similar to that  found in
Guindy National parks are recorded here. To improve these
resources, the Forest Department has been earnestly
implementing several schemes. In Vedanthangal and nearby
Karikili tanks, new saplings of Barrinctonia acutancula.
Acacia nilotica and bamboo bushes are planted to replace
dead wood and to augment the breeding homes of birds. A
grove is being raised with such species of thorny trees like
Carissa carandas. Zizyphus mauritiana and Acacia leucophloea
4-34



whose twigs the birds use to build the nests. For the food
supply of the peripheral fruit eating birds, a garden of
various species of fruit bearing trees is being raised.
Karikili Bird Sanctuary
This sanctuary is located in Chengai Anna district
and was established in 1989. Situated to the west of
National Highway 45 it is close to the Vedanthangal bird
sanctuary. Karikili has a tank of 61 ha and a belt of 5 km
width around. The forest type is dry evergreen scrub. This
sanctuary is famous for its breeding "Heronary".  Many
migratory and resident birds are present in the area. Other
features are similar to that described under Vedanthangal
water bird sanctuary.
Guindy National Park
The year of formation of this park is 1959 and it was
established as national park in 1978. It has 270.5 ha. area.
Most common plants in this park are Polyathia lonaifolia.
Capparis SD., Flacourtia sepiaria, Ferronia elephantum.
Citrus sp., Azadirachta indica, Zizvphus sp.. Manaifera
indica. Sapindus emarainatus. Butea frondosa, Caesalpinia
coriaria, Delonix regia. Cassia sp.. Tamarindus indica.
Acacias, Albizzia lebbeck, Eugenia sp.. Svzigium cumini.
Carissa sp.. Lantana sp Ficus sp., Palm trees etc.
The Guindy National Park has the Madras Snake Park
situated within it which houses around 400 reptiles
belonging to 30 species. This park houses some important
mammals viz. cheetal, black buck, bonnet monkey, jungle cat,
civet cat and mongoose. As many as 130 bird species are
supported in this park amongst the lush vegetation and
diverse habitat provided by two tanks situated inside.

4.5    Socio Cultural Environnent
4.5.1 Population
The population of Madras city has grown from 0.55
million (5.53 lakhs) in 1901 to 5.5 million (55 lakhs) in
1991.  The population in MMA (excluding the city) has grown
from about 0.44 million (4.42 lakhs) in 1951 to about 1.29
million (12.9 lakhs) in 1981.  The trend in population
growth of the city is presented in Table A.4.38. The overall
decadal growth in population for the city was found to be
the highest (42.87%) during 1961-71.  The highest decadal
growth (about 90%) for 1971 population in individual parts
are observed in Perambur and Nungambakkam.
The population breakup in MMA for the year 1981 is
presented in Table A.4.39. The population densities in MMA
are observed to be low with the maximum being less than 100
persons per hectare. The growth has been particularly high
for the main urban centers. The population projection made
by MMDA is presented in Table 4.2. The population of MMA is
expected to reach 9.5 million in 2011 and 11.5 million in
2021.
The census statistics for the districts which fall
within the study area along with that of Tamil Nadu state is
given in Table A.4.40. The distribution of population
between urban and rural for the project area is presented in
Table A.4.41. The density of population of the three
districts is comparable to that of the state (429 per sq.km)
while that for Madras city is 22077 per sq.km. The decadal
(1981-1991) growth rate for Chengleput-MGR district has been
highest at 28.68% when compared to that of the state (15-
39%), Madras city (17.24%) and South Arcot district
(16.10%). The percentage of urban population to total
population is also maximum at 44.87%, next only to Madras
city (100%).

4.5.2 Land Use
The MMDA is the sole agency for planning and
promotion of the land development in the MMA. The city has
been divided into 16 planning divisions and the remaining
MMA into 14 planning divisions for the purpose of land use
planning. The land use maps prepared during the detailed
land survey of 1974 have been updated from time to time by
MMDA. Land use categories include primary residential,
mixed residential, commercial, industrial, institutional,
open spaces & recreational, non-urban and agricultural. The
built-up area within Madras city limits is very dense in
Tondiarpet-Kilpauk-George Town triangle, Triplicane-
Royapettah belt and around Mylapore. Industrial areas are
distributed around Kodungaiyur- Manali- Ennore belt in the
North and Avadi- Ambattur belt in the West. Major green
patches within MMA are plantations on Redhills and East of
Tambaram-Vandalur, the reserve forests of Guindy National
Parks and the thick vegetation in the catchment area of
Chembarambakkam lake.
The corridor for the New Veeranam-Madras pipeline ROW
comprises essentially agricultural and forest land already
acquired by the Government. The area around Veeranam lake
is primarily agricultural, and the residential area
constitutes a very small fraction.
4.5.3 Domestic Water Supply
The city of Madras is supplied with 293 mld of water
during the years of normal rainfall from the existing
surface and ground water sources to meet the city's domestic
and industrial needs. Information on domestic water supply
service for Madras city is given in Table 4.3. During normal
years when the rainfall is satisfactory, the per capita
water supply is about 70 lpd which is hardly 1/3 of the
supplies made at Delhi or Calcutta. The supply is further
reduced drastically (<45 lpcd) during drought years.
Particularly during the last few years, the city had to
resort to transport and supply of water through tankers. In

addition, the industrial water supply which is around 50 mld
also gets disrupted. Consequently, the industrial,
commercial establishments, hotels etc. are forced to buy
water through private agencies by tanks. A tanker load of
10000 liters of water costs Rs.280. Due to unprecedented
drought during the summer of 1993, water supply to the city
had to be arranged from Neyveli, a distance of over 200 km
through tankers by road.
4.5.4 Distribution System
The city water distribution network commissioned in
1912 was extended from time to time, and eventually led to
the establishment of zonal system of distribution in 1954. A
map showing the supply areas as served from various
headworks within Madras city and outside Madras, and the
zones proposed for strengthening of distribution system,
trunk mains and feeder mains is given in Fig. 4.5. The
overall length of distribution mains as per the layout
drawings available from MMWSSB works out to about 1440 km.
The total number of house service connections (as of 1989)
is about 1,46,000 of which 39,750 connections are metered.
Though the city limits were extended in 1978 to
include 12 Panchayat areas, nearly half of these panchayats
have their local sources for supplying water through public
stand posts with no provision for house service connections.
The house service connections generally fall into two
categories.   In the first category, the service line
terminates in a sump constructed within the premises of the
property which is pumped to the rooftop cistern for internal
distribution. In the second category, the service
connection is extended to one or two taps in the premises.
On account of low pressures, hand pumps are used extensively
by the consumers in an attempt to draw more water.
4.5.5 Industrial Water Use
Most of the major water consuming industries in
Madras are located North of the city and include Madras

About 46 mld of water is being supplied to the industry
during the last few years against the requirement of about
108 mld. The water supply to industrial sector during 1987
to 1991 and the water demand of major industries are
presented in Table A.4.42 and Table A.4.43 respectively.
With the anticipated industrial growth, the shortfall in
water supply to the industries is expected to go up.
4.5.6 Water Quality
The raw water drawn from the network of lakes/
reservoirs in and around Madras is provided with
conventional treatment including post chlorination at the
Kilpauk water works before supply to the city. The treated
water quality as it leaves the water works is presented in
Table A.4.44 for the years 1991-93. The results indicate
that 100% of the samples collected from the treatment works
are bacteriologically safe. Information on quality of water
in the distribution system based on the results of analysis
carried out by Tata Consulting Engineers during the year
1990 is presented in Table 4.4. The results indicate that
contamination of water in the distribution is taking place.
The quality of water supply from the well fields at Panjetti
and Minjur and Tamarapakkam (Table A.4.19) shows high
electrical conductivity, hardness and chlorides. A survey of
groundwater quality  in MMA undertaken by Tata Consulting
Engineers. (February, 1991) has indicated gross
bacteriological contamination of the shallow groundwater
aquifer which serves as a source of individual household
water supply.
4.5.7 Wastewater Kanagenent
For wastewater collection, the city has been divided
into five drainage zones with independent collection,
transmission, treatment and disposal systems. The wastewater
collection system (WWCS) consists of about 1425 km of sewers
of 150 mm to 1200 mm diameter. Because of high groundwater

table, the sewers cannot be laid at depths exceeding 6-7
metres. This has necessitated installation of large number
of intermediate pumping stations to convey sewage to various
treatment works by a relay system of pumping. Presently
there are 83 sewage pumping stations in the city.
There are five major wastewater treatment plants, one
for each of the wastewater zones, serving Madras city
presently (Table 4.5). In addition, there is a small aerated
lagoon and stabilization pond system at Villivakkam treating
the wastewater from part of zone II. All the plants are
operated and maintained by the MMWSSB.
The alternate day water supply to the city for
several years in the past resulted in reduced wastewater
flows and consequent low self cleansing velocities in the
collection system causing siltation and non- transport of
accumulated silt. This also increased the septicity of the
wastewater. The total length of stormwater drains is only
400 km as against 1425 km length of sewers. This has
resulted in numerous interconnections between the surface
drains and sewers causing considerable ingress of grit into
the system. Thus, the existing WWCS, though designed as a
separate system, often functions as a combined system.
New  sewer  systems  for  the  added  areas  viz.
Virugambakkam, Kolathur and Velachery are at various stages
of construction. Similarly, new sewer systems for the added
areas to the city viz. Taramani, Kodungaiyur, Erukkanchery
have been proposed. All the components are designed to meet
the needs in the year 2002. The wastewater flows from the
collection systems of the added areas will also be
discharged into the nearby existing treatment works. Hence,
no new treatment facility has been planned under this
project except to increase the capacities of existing plants
suitably. The remaining areas in the MMA will be covered
later on in stages based on growth rate and techno-economic
feasibility.

Improvements to existing sewage collection system,
pumping stations and force mains in old city; augmentation
of sewage treatment facilities at Kodungaiyur (I & II),
Koyambedu, Nesapakkam and Perungudi; and extension to added
areas (pumping stations, force mains and collection system)
are contemplated under this project.
Under short term improvements programme, works aimed
at cleaning of masonary gravity arch sewers and pipe sewers,
procurement of sewer cleaning equipment, improvements to
priming and grit removal system in pumping stations, and
treatment plants, improving working environment in sewage
pumping stations, and conversion of one trickling filter to
activated sludge at the Koyambedu sewage treatment plant
have been implemented. These have resulted in considerable
improvement in the functionality of the wastewater
collection and treatment system.
4.5.8 Planned Ongoing Development Activities
The Third Madras Water Supply and Environmental Sanitation
Project
The project is aimed at expanding and strengthening
the water supply and sewerage system of Madras to utilize
new flows available upon completion of the Krishna Project;
improving access of the poor to water supply and human waste
excreta disposal; increasing the cleanliness of the city and
its waterways; and strengthening the relevant environmental
sanitation, and water supply institutions.
The Krishna Project
The Krishna Water Supply Project envisages the
delivery of 12 TMC (930 mld) of water excluding the
transmission losses of 3 TMC at the Tamil Nadu border over a
period of 8 months in a year. Krishna water would be
conveyed through an open canal from the Tamil Nadu border to
the Poondi Reservoir. From the Poondi Reservoir water would
be delivered to the Chembarambakkam Tank through a link
canal and to Redhills Lake through a feeder canal for
storage purposes. The general layout of various water
supply components of Krishna project is depicted in Fig.4.6.

To receive and store the Krishna water, the full
reservoir level (FRL) of the Poondi Reservoir, Redhills Lake
and Chembarambakkam Tank would be raised by 0.61 m each.
Later, two more new reservoirs across Kortalaiyar, one at
Ramanjeri upstream of Poondi and another at Thirukandalam
downstream of Poondi, would be constructed to provide
additional storage capacity.
A total quantity of 600 mld of water (200 mld of
existing potential and 400 mld of Krishna water in the first
stage) will be drawn from Redhills reservoir. The raw water
(300 mld) drawn through Jones tower will be conveyed through
the existing roughing filters to a treatment plant of
300 mld capacity to be located near the foreshore of
Redhills reservoir. Treated water will then be pumped and
conveyed through a transmission main to Porur Headworks for
underground storage. The balance quantity of 300 mld of raw
water drawn through the new intake tower will be conveyed to
Kilpauk Water Works through the existing masonry conduits.
This supply will be treated at Kilpauk utilising the
existing facilities.
Treated supply of 600 mld received at the four
Headworks as well as 50 mld of ground water received
(through existing transmission main) at Anna Poonga
Headworks will be pumped into the Ring Main grid for
distribution. The ring mains will be laid along the
periphery of the Madras city. Eight numbers of elevated
reservoirs with a total capacity of 72.2 million litres will
be provided on these ring mains to serve as balancing
reservoirs.
The development of the wastewater system in the old
city will be in general consonance with the existing system.
Wastewater management will be improved in the old city and
sewerage system will be provided afresh in the added areas.
All the components are designed to meet the demand in the
year 2002. The wastewater flows from the collection system
of the added areas will also be discharged into the nearby
existing treatment works. Hence, no new treatment facility
4-49



has been planned under this project except to increase the
capacities of existing plants suitably.
The environmental sanitation component of the project
would -provide for a long term programme to improve
sanitation generally in the MMA with focus on the low income
groups whose health is most endangered by sanitation
problems. This component envisages low cost sanitation;
solid waste collection and disposal; storm water drainage;
and dredging of waterways.
The project also envisages strengthening of
institutional infrastructure for improving the effectiveness
and monitoring of the programmes.
To comply with the statutory requirements, the MMDA
is currently engaged in the preparation of a proposal for
the Second Master Plan for the MMA for which 2011 has been
fixed as the horizon year. The MMDA commissioned the Times
Research Foundation (TRF) to organise a time-bound research
programme on Madras 2011. This programme commenced on
October 1, 1989 and climaxed with a seminar during November,
1991. In keeping with the imperatives for immediate action
for managing the future urban growth of MMA, an agenda for
action addressing metropolitan economy, infrastructural
development, housing and land, development strategy, and
management has been prepared (Annexure 4.1). This plan is
expected to have a far reaching impact on the future
development on the MMA.
4.5.9 Employment
Relevant data on employment in MMA is presented in
Tables A.4.45 through A.4.48. The present participation rate
i.e. the proportion of main workers to the population in MMA
is 295 and is low. Even at this rate, 44000 new jobs will
have to be created every year. In the absence of this, more
households will be added to the urban poor, with
unemployment level shooting up. At present, the organised
sector annually adds on an average 4000 new jobs in MMA. In
4-50



order to achieve an improvement in income levels, it is
necessary to increase organised sector job generation to
atleast 13000 new jobs every year. Such an increase in
organised sector job generation could be through industries,
trade and commerce, banking, services sector, exports and
tourism (Ref : Policy Imperatives, An Agenda for Action,
Madras- 2011, MMDA, October, 1991).
4.5.10 Education
Madras city, apart from its being an important centre
of economic activity for the state, is also a major centre
for education from primary to the most advanced professional
courses including engineering, medical and management. The
literacy level for Madras city is 81.6% while that for
Chengleput- MGR district is 66.38% and that for South Arcot
is 52.86%. The literacy level for Tamil Nadu state as a
whole is 62.66% (Table A.4.49).
4.5.11 Housing
Housing conditions in Madras are reflected in the
increase in its slum population, inadequacy of urban
services, over crowded living conditions and other such
facets. Relevant statistics are presented in Tables A.4.50
through A.4.53. The trend in housing stock in Madras Urban
Agglomeration (MUA) has shown a tremendous increase in the
number of residential census houses from about 0.2 million
in 1981 to about 0.8 million in 1991. The annual requirement
of houses for all economic categories of population is about
18,800, nearly equally divided between ownership and rental
accommodation. As against this, the average annual housing
supplies in MUA is only 14,000.
4.5.12 Income Distribution in lKA
A recent market survey of incomes in the metropolitan
cities in India, undertaken by Operations Research Group,
shows that Madras is the poorest of the four large
metropolitan cities. The proportion of low income households
4-51



is higher in Madras than even some of the smaller
metropolitan cities like Pune, Bangalore and Jaipur. The
structural composition of earners and information on
households by monthly income are presented in Tables A.4.54
and A.4.55 respectively. The structural composition of
earners shows that the majority of the non-slum households
(over 70%) in Madras city and MUA are engaged in tertiary
sector followed by secondary sector (24-27%). The population
of earners engaged in primary sector constitutes less than
1%. As for household monthly income, nearly 60% of the
population is in the income group of Rs.801 to 3000.
A research study based on a primary survey of 15000
sample households has shown that in non-slum areas, about
79% of the unemployed in the working age group have less
than higher secondary level of education. The survey also
indicated that for these households, food, fuel, and
lighting account for 61% of the total consumption
expenditure. The situation among slum households is more
acute, with 94% of unemployed having low education level and
74% of consumption expenditure being on food and fuel
(Ref.Policy Imperatives, An Agenda for Action, Madras- 2011,
Seminar Theme Paper, MMDA, October, 1991).
4.5.13 Water Based Recreation
Not much information is available to highlight the
water based recreational activities in Adyar river. The only
recreational activity in the waterways is rowing by the
members of the boat club. As such, no major fishing activity
goes on in the waterways of Madras city in an organised
manner. However, there are three important Inland Fishing
and Training Centres in the city.
4.5.14 Public Health
Information on registered vital rates, incidence of
diarrhoeal and cholera diseases, malaria, Japanese
encephalitis and filaria cases in the project area and state
of Tamil Nadu is presented in Tables A.4.56 through A.4.60
4-52



respectively. The registered infant mortality rate for
Madras district has been consistently higher (41.83-51.35)
than for the other two project districts viz. Chengai-MGR
(17.37-21.12) and South Arcot (30.95-40.18). The birth rate
(26) is higher in Madras district than in the other two
districts which are comparable with a value of around 15.
The death rate, however, ranges from 5 to 10 in all the
project districts. It could be seen that there is a general
increase in incidence of diarrhoeal, cholera and malaria in
the project area especially in the last 2-3 years. The
incidence of Japanese encephalitis has been maximum in
Villupuram Ramasamy Padayatchiyar district. There is a
general declining trend in the incidence of filaria cases in
the project area.
4.5.15 Accidents and Occupational Safety
For purposes of water and sewerage operations, the
entire metropolitan area is divided into 6 areas and 99
depots. The area engineers are responsible for all the works
under their jurisdiction as also the occupational safety of
the Metrowater employees under them.
In Madras city sewer cleaning operations, during the
year 1975 within a period of 6 months, two fatal accidents
occurred resulting in the death of 3 persons in Circle IX
and another one in Circle V. An enquiry committee
constituted to go into the cause of the death of the sewer
workers indicated that the deaths occurred due to
asphyxiation and that the workers did not use any safety
rope while at work.
Similar fatal accidents have been reported in
(i) Fakir-Sahib street, Division-88, (ii) Pumping Station at
Lock Nagar, (iii) Purasawalkkam Pumping Station and
(iv) Greams Road Pumping Station resulting in the death of
3,4, 1, and 2 workers respectively. The deaths were caused
due to sewer gas or drowning of the workers while removing
obstructions.
4-53



During 1986-1990, eight fatal cases of accidents have
been reported (Table A.4.61). on enquiry, the field officers
ascertained that all the workers were engaged in the sewer
cleaning operations and that the deaths were caused due to
asphyxiation.
4.5.16 Cultural Properties
The Mylapore Tank area, can be called a Heritage zone
so also the Triplicane temple area. The Triplicane area
includes the houses where the poet Subramania Bharathi and
the mathematical genius Ramanujam lived. There are, in all,
16 protected monuments in the Fort St. George. The other
important cultural/ Heritage properties, include San Thome,
Governor's house, Rajaji Hall, George Town, Pantheon, etc.
However, none of these historically/ architecturally
significant monuments and any Heritage area is likely to be
affected by the proposed project activities.
4.5.17 Tribal People
The study area does not have any distinct tribal
community. The tribal population in Madras and adjacent area
constitutes less than 2% of the total population as given in
Table below. As such, determining the impact of the project
on the tribal community in particular does not merit special
consideration.

4.5.18 Customs, Aspirations and Attitudes
As part of the EA study, a sample survey of the
population in the project area was undertaken in order to
assess their educational and economic status, their
awareness and attitude towards the New Veeranam Project and
their aspirations. Data on the socio-economic profile of the
sample population was collected through a questionnaire
(Annexure 4.2). The study area included 64 villages in 5
taluks of South Arcot district and 52 villages in Chengleput
district. The sample consisted of 120 people selected at
random from 7 villages in 6 taluks in the project districts.
Of the sample surveyed, 21% were illiterate, 66.5%
had education upto secondary school level, and only 12.5%
had college education. The salient findings of the survey
are i) Each village has a primary school, if not so within 3
km distance; ii) Medical facilities are available within 2
km distance through primary health centers and private
medical practioners. All the villages are provided with
potable water supply, communication, transport and other
infrastructural services.
The  major  occupation  of  the  population  is
agriculture, 26% of the people were engaged in business
while 25% were in services and 21% were labourers. More
than 90% of the population live in their own houses, 55% had
cattle usually kept in the backyard. 55% of the sample had
their income below Rs. 500 p.m. Only 30% of the population
had latrines/septic tanks while the rest resorted to open
field defecation.  Dysentery, malaria, infectious hepatitis
worm infestations and scabies are the main diseases/ailments
reported from the villages. The villages are provided with
electricity. More than 90% of the population was aware of
the new project, partly due to the eviction of the
encroachments and through media. More than 90% of the
population were in favour of the project and expected to get
more job opportunities, increase in local business leading
to improvement in their economic status.

5. IDENTIFICATION OF
IMPACTS



5.     IDENTIFICATION OF IMPACTS
5.1   General
The major step involved in the process of
environmental assessment is the identification of impacts as
it leads to other steps such as quantification and
evaluation of impacts. In order to identify and evaluate the
impacts associated with the project, it is necessary to
establish a general checklist and describe the existing
environmental quality in the area under development, and the
activities of the project which may cause environmental
impacts.  Although the impacts have been identified  in
general while describing the existing environmental status,
it is necessary, at this stage, to identify for the various
environmental components the significant impacts that are
likely to arise due to the New Veeranam Project.
While a number of techniques are available for
identification of impacts, in the present case, the "Network
Method" which involves understanding of the cause-
condition- effect relationship between an activity and
environmental parameters, has been adopted. This method has
been basically advantageous in recognizing the impacts that



would be triggered by the proposed activities and provides a
"road map" type of approach for the identification of second
and third order effects. The purpose is to account for the
project activities and identify the type of impacts which
would initially occur. The next step is to select each
impact and identify the secondary and tertiary impacts which
will be induced as a result. This process is repeated until
all possible impacts are identified. The major advantage of
this type of approach is that it allows identification of
the impacts by selecting and tracing out the events as they
are expected to occur.
5.2    Impact Networks
In the backdrop of data collected during the site
visits, information provided by the concerned authorities
and the list of project activities described earlier in this
report, the cause-condition-effect' networks have been
generated for the various components of the project and
presented in Figs. 5.1 through 5.5. In these illustrations,
the lines are to be read as "has an effect on".
Pre-construction activities are those taken up prior
to start up of the actual construction of the project and
include land acquisition, and rehabilitation and
resettlement. They may not have any direct impact on
environment as such but may lead to socio-economic impacts
from the local inhabitants who are likely to be displaced
and relocated.
Construction activities cause land alterations in
accordance with the project design and a variety of
physical- chemical, ecological, aesthetic and socio-economic
impacts of varying duration and magnitude. Physico-chemical
changes occur during construction mainly due to clearing of
vegetative cover at the site thereby causing soil erosion
resulting in turbidity in surface runoffs.   Ecological
impacts occur due to removal of forests and field habitat
which result in destruction of terrestrial organisms.
Socio-economic impacts that occur during construction relate

Operation involves various activities and includes
reservoir filling, spillage operation, flood control and
other functions such as pumping, conveyance and treatment of
water, all of which can cause impacts on water quality,
ecology, aesthetics, socio-economics and health.
5.3    Major Potential Environmental Impacts
The main components of the New Veeranam Project are
works related to source improvement;  construction of
transmission main including associated drainage, river, road
and railway crossings; construction of. pumping and booster
stations, water treatment plant, clear water storage
reservoirs; and creation of necessary infrastructure such as
housing and other facilities for 0 & M personnel.
The major environmental impacts due to the proposed
project activities are broadly identified as under :
Impact due to land acquisition, compensation thereof,
resettlement and rehabilitation of project affected
persons
Impact  on  ecology  of  Veeranam  lake  and  its
surrounding areas due to source improvement works
Impact on surface water quality due to improved
Veeranam feeder system and soil erosion
Impact on terrestrial flora and fauna due to site
clearance, laying of transmission main, construction
of water treatment plant and pumping stations
Impact on air quality due to construction activities
and traffic
Impact on community noise levels due to traffic
congestion and infrastructural services
Impact on occupational noise levels due to operation
of pumping stations
5-8



*      Impact arising from disruption of normal flow of
traffic, commercial activities, and community life,
due to transmission main laying
*      Impact on landuse pattern and land availability
*      Impact on community due to increased water supply,
employment generation, housing etc.
*      Impact on waterways due to increased wastewater flows
*      Impact  on archaeological sites, cultural properties
and sensitive areas
5.4    Significant Impacts
5.4.1 Socio-economic Impacts
For source improvement works, at the infall points of
Sengal Odai and Papakudi drain 24.65 ha of land (22.56 ha of
private land and 2.09 Government land) has to be acquired
from the following four villages in the catchment area of
Veeranam lake.

Source : Project affected families of the New Veeranam
Scheme - A Study by Economic Perspectives,
Madras, June, 1994
Sixty eight families would be affected due to land
acquisition. The average size of the family is 4.5. When
the acquisition takes place, about 85% of the project
affected families (PAFs) will lose part of their land, and
5-9



15% will lose all their land. As for their preference for
compensation, except two individuals, everybody opts for
only cash compensation. Of the other two, one wants land and
the other a job.
Part of the land to be acquired (about 5 ha) is
fallow land (not cultivated) while in the rest of the area
crops such as paddy, sugarcane, groundnut, kambu (pearl
millet) and saesamum are grown. An estimate of the
agricultural crop (single crop in a year) loss due to the
acquisition of land based on the assumptions summarised in
Table A.5.1 is of the order of Rs. 76,000/- per annum. This
will constitute an irreversible impact due to the project.
No rehabilitation and resettlement of people is involved due
to land acquisition. The annual income from crops of PAFs
ranges from Rs. 5,000/- to Rs. 20,000/-.
The work for raising of the bund level of Veeranam
lake by 0.61 m would result in eviction of 91 families who
have constructed huts/houses on the slope of the bund. Most
of the families work as agricultural labour and are
uneducated. All of them except two have indicated their
preference for compensation. In addition, a portion of the
house sites of three families living in the
Paripurananatham village will have to be acquired.
All along the 165 km stretch of pipeline ROW from
Sethiathope to Kelambakkam, a total of 202 ha of land has
been acquired by the Govt. during 1969-70 under the old
Veeranam Project. A major part of this is agricultural land.
However, this stretch of ROW has been encroached upon in a
number of places as the land was unused. There are 641 cases
of encroachments - 465 houses, 145 shops, and 31
agricultural land. Out of 465 losing their houses, 42 live
inside the abandoned pipes of old Veeranam project. The
average size of the family is 4.5.
5-10



Information on the nature of encroachments is
presented in Table below. Most of these encroachments are
reported to have since been cleared leaving only a few to be
cleared. Land and cash are reported to be the most preferred
forms of compensation by the PAFs.

Along the ROW for the transmission main from
Kelambakkam to Porur, there are 64 families which require
eviction, and two families from whom agricultural land has
to be acquired, if their claim of ownership is confirmed.
All of them have encroached the land belonging to highway
department/TWAD Board. The nature of encroachments is
summarised in the following Table.

For the proposed booster pumping station at Chendur
(Ch.80.3 km) an area of 2.70.5 ha of dry land is proposed to
be acquired. The land is owned by three persons who are
willing to give the land for the construction of the booster
station. They own other lands also for their livelihood and
hence the land acquisition does not involve any
rehabilitation and resettlement. Details regarding the
extent of land required and the availability of land for
location of clear water reservoirs at Porur are yet to be
firmed up.
There are other structures which may have to be
removed during the laying of transmission main from Veeranam
to Porur as listed in Table A.5.2.

5.4.2 Socio-economic Impacts in the Veeranam Irrigation
Command Area caused by allocation of 85 M cu.m/yr.
(3000 MCft/yr.) to Madras for public water supply
Historic simulation of LCA - Vadavar - Veeranam lake
system performed for the years 1965-1993 by TCE (The Draft
Feasibility Report on Veeranam Source Yield - Addendum Note,
Sept. 1994) have established the following
*      Under the present pattern of demand and supply as
obtaining in the LCA Veeranam System, spills
capturable at LCA make it possible to realize
irrigation reliabilities as high as 80% even with the
proposed 192 mld draw off for water supply to Madras.
Thus, the proposed water supply project would not
adversely impact on the first user irrigation rights.
*      The resulting water supply reliability of 80% can be
increased to 95% by harnessing a nominal amount of
11.4 MCM from Mettur storage on an average every
year.
*      On the basis of the above, the reliability of
Veeranam lake for supplying 192 mld to water supply
stands confirmed.
From the above findings, it may be concluded that the
proposed allocation of 85 M Cu.m/yr of Veeranam water to
Madras city would not have any adverse socio-economic impact
on the irrigation command area.
5.4.3 Potential risks from failure of bund and transmission
main
A geo-technical study undertaken by M/s Tata
Consulting Engineers in Veeranam lake has shown that (i) the
tank bund, as it exists, is in a stable condition and could
be taken up for. increasing its height as proposed under the
project; (ii) the tank bed material is of a quality suited
for raising of the existing main embankment and foreshore
bund construction; (iii) the stability of embankment with a
maximum water level of 16.8 m is safe; and (iv) raising the
5-13



bund level upto 17.4 m could be undertaken with 2:1 upstream
slope / downstream slope with assured stability.
The Veeranam area falls under Zone-I of seismic
activity which is lowest as per IS-1893. Further, the
embankment is so low that the effect of earthquake will not
be felt and therefore, the seismic factor does not warrant a
detailed consideration.
The transmission pipeline has been designed in
accordance with relevant standards/codes of practices. In
addition, a corrosion allowance of 2 mm has been provided.
Necessary corrosion protection measures through gunniting of
the pipe surfaces have been proposed as also anode type
cathodic protection as a backup measure. Also necessary
provision has been made in the design for incorporation of
surge tanks and air release valves at appropriate locations
along the transmission main. In view of the above, the
probability of transmission main failure and the associated
hazards such as flooding etc. are expected to be negligible.
All through the transmission pipeline, manually
actuated butterfly valves will be provided at intervals of
2 km. In the event of a burst or failure of pipeline, the
pump operator will inform on wire less /telephone (upstream
/down stream) operators to isolate the pipeline by operating
the butterfly valves. This would minimise the extent of
flooding and possible damage to property particularly along
the stretches passing through built up areas.
Simultaneously, the scour valves provided at all low points
along the pipeline will be operated to drain off the water
into the natural drainage courses.
During times of normal repairs, the section under
repair will be isolated with the help of isolation valves
and the water in the pipeline could be drained off using
the nearest scour valves provided in the pipeline.

5.4.4 Potential impacts of alternative pipeline alignments
between Kelambakkam and Madras
The 230 km long transmission main traverses through
four districts viz. South Arcot Vallalar district,
Villupuram Ramasamy Padayachiyar district, Chengai- M.G.R.
district and Madras district of Tamil Nadu State. For
pipeline ROW, from Kelambakkam to Porur, three alternatives
were considered as under
i) Old Mahabalipuram road via Taramani-
Gandhimandapam- Mount Road to Southern
Headworks of Metro Board
ii) Kelambakkam to Vandalur along the State Highway
(21km), Vandalur - Pallavaram - Nehru statue
near Alandur along GST road and then to Porur
via Kanchipuram - Bangalore link road
iii) Kelambakkam to Vandalur along the State Highway
(21 km), Vandalur- Pallavaram along GST road,
Pallavaram to Porur via Anakaputhur- Kunrattur
villages
In evaluating the alternatives for selection of
pipeline ROW, the following criteria were considered.
Shortest distance with minimum number of bends
Avoidance of ecological and otherwise sensitive
areas
Land use pattern
Avoidance of forest / agriculture land
Avoidance of water bodies and wet lands
Minimum rail, road and river crossings
Avoidance of populated areas / encroachments
Avoidance of disruptions to infrastructure
services like telephone, electricity etc.
The pipeline ROW along the old Mahabalipuram road
upto Adyar has been encroached upon in a number of places
with shops, pucca buildings, fencing, walls etc.   These
encroachments  are  difficult  to  remove,  and  the
rehabilitation and resettlement of the affected people could
5-15



be a difficult task. This area has also developed
industrially and the road is narrow with heavy traffic.
Keeping in view the difficulties envisaged in clearing the
encroachments as also the heavy traffic on the road, this
alternative is not recommended.
The 21 km stretch of the pipeline alignment from
Kelambakkam to National Highway No. 45 (GST road) near
Vandalur zoo passes through a lot of vegetated area on
either side of the road. In some stretches of the road,
acquisition of agricultural land may be necessary.   The
width of the existing corridor along the road in possession
of Highway Department, and the location of private
properties with respect to road would decide the exact
location of pipeline alignment.  This stretch is straight
with minimum bends and undulations. A number of trees and
bushes will have to be cleared during construction activity.
In this stretch, a HT line also crosses the alignment at
three places. The pipeline alignment near Vandalur railway
crossing passes very close to the Anna Zoological Park.
From Vandalur to Pallavaram, the pipeline is along
the NH 45 and has to cross one drainage, a Highway and a
railway. The nearest culvert available for the rail / road
crossing is approximately 2 km from Vandalur.   From
Pallavaram, which is a very busy area, the two alternatives
considered are indicated in red and green along with the old
alignment shown in blue. (Fig.3.3).
The alignment (marked red) along the NH 45 will have
to pass through a lot of built up areas especially in places
like Meenambakkam. The need for land acquisition for laying
the pipeline has to be ascertained. The Pallavaram -
Chrompet - Tambaram stretch of the alignment will be in a
busy area with heavy traffic as also public activity. It
may also involve cutting of trees along the Highway and
relocation of electric/telephone poles to facilitate laying
of the pipeline.
5-16



The other alignment (marked green) proposed along the
Anakaputhur-Kunrattur road is tortuous with numerous bends.
The portion of the alignment passing through Muthtamil
Nagar, Pammal, etc. the road is very narrow with densely
built up areas on either side which may involve land
acquisition. In this area traffic diversion may also be
extremely difficult. In order to accommodate the pipeline,
it may be necessary to go in for considerable land
acquisition resulting in possible displacement of people as
also requiring acquisition of built up properties and
agricultural lands.  The extent of acquisition of land/
built-up property would also depend upon as to on which side
of the road, the alignment is proposed. This alignment
also involves crossing of the river Adyar as also another
waterway. Ecological disturbances may be much more compared
to the alignment along the NH 45.
In keeping with the above environmental
considerations, the pipeline alignment from Kelambakkam to
Porur via Vandalur, Pallavaram and Alandur (Fig. 3.4) would
be a better choice than the other two alternatives.
5.5    Potential impacts of alternative sites for Water
Treatment Plant (WTP)
The feasibility report on water transmission, pumping
and treatment considered three alternatives as under for
location of the water treatment plant:
Alternative - I : Rehabilitation of only a part of the
existing treatment plant (only the clariflocculator) at
Vadakuthu to get partially treated water (turbidity < 20
NTU) and providing the final treatment plant at Mangalam.
This final treatment plant will consist of only gravity
filters to give the required treated water quality
(turbidity < 2 NTU) and quantity (180 Mld).
Alternative - II : Complete rehabilitation of the existing
treatment plant at Vadakuthu to get the required treated
water quality (Turbidity < 2 NTU) and quantity (180 Mld).

Nrro  Roa adArcluaLadAogRWNaAnkptr



There will be no further treatment downstream except
chlorination.
Alternative - III : Providing a completely new treatment
plant consisting of clariflocculators and gravity filters at
Mangalam to get the required quantity and quality of treated
water. In this alternative, the existing treatment plant at
Vadakuthu will not be used.
At both Vadakuthu and Mangalam, land has already been
acquired by the Tamil Nadu Government in 1969. At Vadakuthu
the conventional water treatment plant of 180 mld
constructed under the previous Veeranam project is in disuse
for the past 20 years. Refurbishment of Vadakuthu treatment
plant will involve less construction activity. The cost of
rehabilitation, however, has not been estimated. If the
Mangalam site is decided, the existing factory for PSC pipe
manufacture has to be dismantled and the buildings and
temporary sheds have to be removed before the construction
of the WTP, which is estimated to cost Rs. 177.8 million.
It is generally considered good engineering practice
to treat raw water at a place as close to the source as
possible and then pump it to the demand centres for
distribution. This would minimise the quantity of raw water
to be pumped over long distance with attendant savings in
energy cost. This would also help in the better maintenance
of the interior of the rising main.  However, when long
distance pumping of treated water is involved, as in the
instant case, there could be a slight impairment in water
quality and may require booster chlorination in order to
ensure microbiological safety of the delivered water with
attendant increase in cost of treatment.
From treatment considerations, the location of the
treatment site will not make any difference, as the Veeranam
water will require complete conventional treatment followed
by post chlorination to give the required treated water
quality. The waste (filter backwash and clarifier sludge)
generated from the WTP will be low in quantity due to low
5-18



suspended solids in raw water all through the year and as
such will not pose any serious problem for disposal.
The major source of supply of chemicals required in
water treatment such as, alum, acids, alkalies and chlorine
is Madras. If the treatment plant site is at Vadakuthu, the
distance of transporting these chemicals either by road or
by rail will be longer by about 130 km with attendant higher
(3-4 %) cost than if the treatment plant is located at
Mangalam. Bulk transport of these chemicals by rail should
be preferred to transport by road since the potential risks
of accidents with associated hazards could be much less.
Necessary infrastructure, such as, residential
accommodation, water supply, etc. for 0 & M staff has
already been created at Vadakuthu, while these have to be
provided afresh if Mangalam site is decided. Further, the
pipeline alignment for the transmission main has to detour a
distance of 700 m (additional length) if the treatment plant
is located at Mangalam and retrace the distance before
joining the original alignment. This may also involve land
acquisition, the details of which are not known. Thus, from
environmental considerations either of the sites may be
considered suitable.   However, economic considerations,
details of which are not fully available, will govern the
final choice of treatment site.
5.6    Other impacts
Approximately 82 MCM of silt is required for raising
of foreshore bund of Veeranam lake to augment its storage
capacity. To this extent silt/sediment will be removed from
within the lake. Neither additional quantity of material is
required to be brought from outside nor extra silt is to be
deposited on the land. Thus, the sediments dredged from the
lake will not have any impact on the land environment around
the lake.
The water spread area at FTL of the existing veeranam
lake is 38.85 sq. km. Due to the proposed increase in the
5-19



FTL by 0.61 m with a bund slope of 1:2, the increase in
water spread area will be approximately 5% only. To that
extent the increased area will contribute to increased
evaporation losses. On the other hand, the increase in
area will add to the aesthetics of the environment and also
provide a larger habitat for water fowls.
A task force constituted by the Government of Tamil
Nadu, after a careful examination of various alternative
pipe materials, such as, mild steel (with cement mortar
lining inside and outside), pre-stressed concrete, ductile
iron pipe and the status of available technology for pipe
manufacture, laying and jointing, and cost aspects decided
in favour of mild steel pipeline with welded joints and
cement mortar lining inside and outside for the transmission
main.  The chemical characteristics of the Veeranam water
indicate that the Langelier Index is positive (+0.63 to
+0.76). Hence, the mild steel pipe with cement mortar
lining could be used safely for transmission of water.
External corrosion of the pipeline is not of any serious
concern as the characteristics of the soil along practically
the entire stretch of the pipeline ROW is non-corrosive.
The laying of the 1525 mm transmission main from
Veeranam to Porur would involve considerable earthwork
excavation.   After the installation of the pipe, the
disposal of surplus earth will not pose any serious problem
over a large stretch of the alignment except in the built up
areas of the city. For this purpose, appropriate sites/ low
lying areas have to be identified and proper scheduling of
construction activities ensured to minimise disruption to
normal flow of traffic and movement of public and business.
Due to inadequate sources, water supply in the Madras
Metropolitan Area has been intermittent with supplies even
on alternate days during severe drought years. A significant
aspect of intermittent water supply, which is common in many
developing countries, relates to the potential public health
risks. During non-supply hours when the system is not under
pressure or under negative pressure, extraneous
5-20



contamination of sewage origin through leaky joints and
corroded  pipelines  is  a  common  phenomenon.  Such
contamination of water supply poses a serious hazard to
public health.
The water quality control department of Metrowater
has a regular programme of water quality monitoring by
collecting samples at the sources, treatment works and from
distribution system. The samples are analysed for physico-
chemical and bacteriological quality of water supply. A
review of available reports indicates that the water quality
in the distribution system does not always satisfy the
prescribed bacteriological standards.
With the inflow of Veeranam water to the Madras city,
the available water supply will be increased by 180 mld.
With this additional flow, the per-capita water supply for
the various categories of consumers is also expected to
increase. With the increased availability of water, the
duration of supply will increase and the distribution
network will remain charged with water under pressure for a
longer duration. This would reduce the chances of
contamination in the water mains and associated public
health risks leading to reduced incidence of diseases,
improved health and productivity and economic well-being of
the community. Another significant impact intrinsic in
keeping the system charged for a longer duration is the
reduction in the potential for internal corrosion of
distribution pipe lines.
A recent survey, by Tata Consulting Engineers (TCE),
of unaccounted for water in ten percent of Madras city water
distribution system, has shown that with only six hours of
supply at 5 m of water pressure, over 30 % of the supply
will be lost through leakages from the distribution system.
In view of this, it would not be feasible to keep the system
under pressure to facilitate 24 hr water supply, possibly
even for a part of the service area.
5-21



5.7    Issues Identified through Public Meetings
In order to identify any new issues in the
implementation of the project, three public meetings were
organised by the project proponents with the assistance of
NEERI. One meeting was held at Lalpet to cover the area
presently irrigated by the Veeranam lake and a stretch of
the pipeline ROW. The second meeting was held at Tindivanam
to cover the area along the pipeline ROW between Vadakuthu
and Mangalam. The third meeting was organised at Porur to
cover the rest of the project area including MMA. Meeting
notices were sent to NGOs, agriculturists associations,
local self government (Panchayat) officials, the press and
the general public in the project areas. The objective and
the scope of New Veeranam project and the details of the
proposed activities were presented by the project
proponents.  The likely environmental consequences of the
project were also brought out at the meeting.   From the
interaction that followed, the main issues that emerged are
as under
*     In all the three meetings there was no
objection to the New Veeranam project aimed at
augmenting the water supply to Madras city
provided the withdrawal of 190 mld of water
from Veeranam does not affect the existing
irrigation rights.
*    The need was brought out for a formal agreement
between the government and the agriculturists
associations to safeguard their existing
agricultural rights and to formulate
operational procedures for withdrawal of water
from Veeranam lake for water supply to Madras
city.
*    The need for priority to complete all works
related to source improvement before commencing
drawal of water to Madras was stressed.
5-22



*     Concern was expressed regarding inadequate
compensation, and rehabilitation and
resettlement of the project affected persons in
some cases.
*    The participants wanted that employment
opportunities must be provided to the extent
possible to the local people.
*     An appeal was made by the participant public to
the project proponents to consider the
possibility of providing water supply from the
New Veeranam project to the needy habitations
enroute.
The project proponents furnished clarifications on
the points raised by the participants and assured them that
the issues brought forth by the public in the meetings would
receive due attention by the Govt. for action. With regard
to the public demand for water supply to villages enroute,
it was clarified that the Govt. has specific plans /
proposals to meet the requirements.   Information on the
water supply facilities available for enroute
towns/villages,    and    proposed    measures    for
improvement/augmentation are given in Annexure 5.1. In view
of the above, the New Veeranam Project has been specifically
formulated only to meet the shortfall in water supply to the
public of Madras city and no intermediate tapping has been
proposed from the Veeranam - Madras transmission main.

6. PREDICTION OF
IMPACTS



6.     Prediction of Impacts
6.1    General
Prediction of impacts is the most important component
in environmental assessment studies. Many scientific
techniques and methodologies are available to predict impact
on physico-ecological and socio-economic environment. Such
predictions are superimposed over the baseline (pre-project)
status of environmental quality to derive the future (post-
project) scenario of environmental conditions. The
prediction of impacts helps to identify and implement
Environmental Management Plan (EMP) during and after the
implementation of the project to minimise the deterioration
of environmental quality.
Mathematical models attempt to describe
quantitatively the cause and effect relationships between
the sources of pollution and different components of the
environment viz. air, noise, water, land and socio-economic.
There are also various scientific techniques/ methodologies
available to predict the environmental impacts
quantitatively as well as qualitatively, wherever
mathematical models are not yet available.



The New Veeranam water supply project aims at
augmenting the existing water supply to the city of Madras
by 180 mld to mitigate the chronic water shortage
experienced by the city. The project envisages improvements
in carrying capacity of the Vadavar feeder channel,
desilting part of the lake to raise the bund level for
increasing the storage capacity, pumping, treatment and
conveyance of treated water through a 1525 mm diameter
pipeline over a distance of 235 km to the ground level
storage reservoirs at Porur for distribution. In this
section, the most probable impacts on various components of
the environment due to the proposed activities are predicted
based on available information and using scientific
knowledge and techniques.
6.2    Air Environment
During the construction phase of the project, the
major activities will involve earth work excavation,
embankment  formation,  transport  of  materials  of
construction, handling, laying and jointing of pipelines,
building of structures such as pumping stations, treatment
plant, bridges, culverts and ground level reservoirs. These
activities would cause a general increase in the
concentration of dust and suspended particulate matter in
the ambient air. However, this increase in concentration
would be of temporary nature and localised. Due to the
plying of trucks and other transport vehicles, and use of
construction machinery, marginal increase in the levels of
oxides of nitrogen and sulphur is likely to occur, which
again will be of a temporary nature.
The air pollution impact will be more appreciable in
urban and industrial areas in comparison to other areas. The
background air pollution levels near the Highway have been
assessed and are found within acceptable limits. In the
absence of any information   on the type of vehicles/
machinery to be employed for the work, it is not possible to
predict the resultant pollutant levels during the project
6-2



activities. However, in view of the fact that the pipeline
passes through urban areas over short distances only, the
resultant air quality would not be in violation of the
prescribed ambient air quality standards (Table A.6.1).
Due to the raising of bund level of Veeranam lake and
the consequent increase in water surface area and associated
vegetation, micro-climatic changes would occur especially in
and around the reservoir site.
6.3    Noise Environment
Noise levels were measured in and around the sites of
proposed project activities and in the human settlements
around such activities. Noise levels were also measured at
several locations in Madras city, and at the existing water
pumping stations and treatment facilities.
The noise levels measured at the existing water
treatment plant and sewage pumping stations in metropolitan
area are presented in Table A.6.2. For prediction of noise
levels due to the proposed plants, the noise sources in
these plants are assumed to be similar.
The noise level outside the premises of the water
treatment plant, predicted based on hemispherical sound wave
propogation model, varied from 52 dBA to 60 dBA. While at
the sewage pumping stations, it varied from 50 dBA to
75 dBA, the variations being mostly due to difference in
background noise levels. Noise levels inside and outside the
pumping stations depend upon their layout. Any change in
their structure can change the noise levels.
The    equivalent    noise   pressure   level   due
to transportation activities on a typical road at a distance
10 m from the road has been estimated using Federal Highway
Administration model and was found to vary from 50 dBA to
70 dBA depending on the time and location. Due to congestion
of traffic, the noise levels are estimated to increase by
6-3



upto 5 dBA. The expected noise sources and noise levels at
construction sites are presented in Table A.6.3.
6.3.1 Impact on Community
Equivalent sound levels averaged over 24 hours,
Leq(24 hrs),and  day-night sound levels, (Ldn), are used to
describe community noise exposures. WHO recommends day time
outdoor equivalent noise pressure levels upto 55 dBA and
night time equivalent noise pressure levels upto 45 dBA to
avoid community annoyance and sleep disturbance. The Indian
Standard (IS :54-1968) recommends acceptable outdoor noise
levels of 25-35 dBA in rural residential areas, 30-40 dBA
in suburban and 35-45 dBA in urban residential areas. For
industrial and business areas, noise pressure levels upto
60 dBA can be acceptable. Corrections of -10 dBA to -15 dBA
are recommended for night time noise pressure levels.
There will not be significant direct impact on the
communities due to the proposed activities since the pipe
laying and other construction works are one time activities
and treatment plant and pumping stations are isolated, and
noise outside the premises is not more than background
levels elsewhere in the city. The impact will be temporary
and for a short period only, at any location. The increments
in the noise levels are expected to be marginal.
The noise level due to peak traffic close to the
roads (65 dBA to 75 dBA) is already higher at a few places
than that recommended for urban settlements, particularly at
peak traffic hours. However, the increment due to the
proposed activities will be negligible, except during pipe
laying activities. With expected improved piped water
supply, the large number of water tankers transporting water
to the city could perhaps be reduced, with consequent
marginal reduction in traffic noise.
6-4



6.3.2 Impact on Occupational Health
Equivalent sound pressure level averaged over
8 hrs, Leq (8 hrs), is used to describe exposure to noise
in workplaces. The damage risk criteria for hearing ,as
enforced by OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health
Administration, USA) and other organisations, to reduce
hearing loss, stipulate that noise levels upto 90 dBA are
acceptable for eight hour exposure [Leq(8 hrs)] per day. The
Ministry of Labour, Government of India also have
recommended similar criteria vide Factories Act, Schedule
No.XXIV (Government Notification FAC/1086/CR-9/Lab-4,Dated
8-2-1988).
Pumps of 400-600 KW will be the main sources of
noise. However, recent models of pumps do not generate high
intensity noise. Unprotected staff members maintainino,
operating and supervising pumps can get exposures above
90 dBA near these machines. However, operators do not have
to work close to these machines for long hours.
6.4    Ecology
Baseline data has shown that the ecology of the
project area has been affected by human activity since long
time. The small pockets of forests in the area are nothing
but the biotic forests i.e. forests degraded due to man's
activity all through the years. Likely impacts, favourable
and adverse, on the aquatic and terrestrial ecology of the
project are briefly discussed hereunder
6.4.1 Terrestrial
As a result of construction activity, the vegetation
cover i.e. forest, avenue trees, and agricultural land are
likely to be reduced. Human activity and transport will
increase the noise level which will adversely affect the
birds in the region and wild life in the adjoining Arignar
Anna Zoological Park. However, this impact will be of
temporary nature.
6-5



Natural drainage in the area may be affected due to
earthwork excavation and construction activity. Due to
movement of heavy machinery for the pipe laying activity, a
narrow strip of agricultural land all along the pipeline ROW
will become uncultivable temporarily and also be subjected
to compaction, thereby altering its natural properties. This
will marginally reduce the agricultural produce.
Considerable quantity of earth excavated for
pipelaying will become surplus after installation of the
pipeline and has to be disposed of as spoil dumps. This may
adversely affect the aesthetics of the pipeline ROW and
cause soil erosion.
During the post construction phase the ground water
table surrounding the lake will increase which will be
beneficial to large and medium sized trees/shrubs which
depend upon water table for their water requirement. This
will have beneficial effect on vegetation. Social
plantations will be successful to a large extent. Diversity
of plant species will increase showing healthier
environment. The grazing fields will also increase due to
availability of more ground water. Increase in plantation of
trees, around Veeranam lake and ROW will provide nesting,
food and shelter to the indigenous and migratory birds that
abound the project area. Improvement of lake water quality
will be an added advantage to aquatic birds and resident
fish species in the lake.
6.4.2 Aquatic
Reservoir zooplankton is now dominated by Rotifera,
Cladocera and Copepoda and the phytoplankton by blue-green
algae and green algae. Some pollution indictor species are
found in small numbers.   The year round availability of
water due to storage in the lake may help to increase the
number of clean water flora and fauna such as diatoms. The
potential for fisheries would also increase with the
availability of water in the reservoir throughout the year.
6-6



Deweeding activity and increase in water level would
bring about change in the aquatic weed growth.   Aquatic
weeds growing in shallow water will be eliminated. Clearance
of weed will reduce the breeding of mosquitoes, if any,
which are disease vectors of malaria, filaria, dengue fever
and certain types of encephalites. Possibility of spread of
schistosomiasis through the vectors like Lvmnaea and
Indoplanorbis would be reduced due to destruction of their
breeding places in weeds.
The proposed source improvement works include removal
of part of the shoal and silt from the lead channels within
the lake. This will reduce the existing weeds and the
nutrients available in the silt/sediment. Loss of water
through transpiration is many times more than from weed-free
water surface. This loss of water will be reduced by the
reduction in aquatic weeds. The water quality may also
improve.
The trees in the lake basin generally stimulate the
growth of aquatic weeds. Their removal will also be helpful
in reducing the weed problem.
Bird migration to the Veeranam lake may take place
due to availability of water throughout the year with
possible increase in nesting sites/habitats.   This will
result in improving the diversity of animal species in the
project area. Water fowl is already present in appreciable
numbers in the lake. Therefore, only marginal improvement
is expected since surface area of lake will increase only by
about 5 percent. Increase in depth of water, year round
availability of water, improvement in water quality will be
beneficial to the aquatic birds.
6.5    Water Environment
The average per capita water supply to the city is of
the order of 70 lpd during normal monsoon years, and 45 lpd
or less during water scarcity period. With the augmentation
6-7



of water supply by 180 mld from Veeranam lake, the per
capita water supply for the various categories of consumers
would increase.
With the increase in water supply, and consequent
increase in wastewater flow, the functionality of the
existing sewerage system would be improved. There would also
be a change in the quality of sewage. With the proposed
augmentation of sewerage, sewage pumping stations and sewage
treatment facilities there will be a significant improvement
in the quality and quantity of effluent reaching the
waterways and points of reuse for non-domestic purposes. The
increased flow would also have a very favourable impact on
the waterways water quality, with reduced odour nuisance and
associated public health risks.
With the improved availability of piped water supply,
the need for augmenting individual household supplies
through private wells or commercial vendors will be reduced
with attendant savings in time, labour and money.
The important water quality parameters of the
existing surface and ground water sources for Madras city
and that of Veeranam lake are within the limits prescribed
by CPCB Standards (Table A.6.4) for use as raw water
sources for public water supply. The lake water will be
further treated in the proposed water treatment plant and
hence, further improvement would occur in the quality of
water put into the distribution system.
The present agricultural practices of deep ploughing
and cultivation of dry crops in the catchment area of the
lake can cause soil erosion and consequent increase in
turbidity of runoff. Use of fertilizers and insecticides in
catchment would not have any significant effect on quality
of runoff and subsequent lake water quality because of the
very meagre quantities used and the residue retention in
soils.
6-8



The waste generated from the proposed water treatment
plant will consist of impurities removed from raw water
through various treatment units. It includes the chemical
sludge from the under flow of sedimentation units, and
backwash water produced during the cleaning of filter beds.
The turbidity of raw water reaching the proposed treatment
plant is not likely to be high even during monsoon season
due to storage in Veeranam lake. Considering an average raw
water turbidity of 50 NTU, the estimated alum dose based on
the treatability studies is-about 40 mg/l. Accordingly, the
total quantity of sludge with 0.5% suspended solids
concentration from the proposed treatment plant of 190 mld
capacity is estimated at 3.2 mld. The project provides for
clarifier sludge/ filter back wash water recovery/ disposal
system and the disposal of final residue is not expected to
pose any serious environmental problem. The residue can be
used as a land fill for which low lying areas are available
both at Mangalam and Vadakuthu.
With the increased availability of water, the
duration of water supply will increase and the distribution
network will remain charged with water under pressure for a
longer duration. This would reduce the chances of
contamination in the water mains and associated public
health risks leading to reduced incidence of diseases,
improved health and productivity and economic well-being of
the community. Another significant impact intrinsic in
keeping the system charged for a longer duration is the
reduction in the potential for internal corrosion of
distribution pipe lines.
With the augmentation of water supply from Veeranam,
the extent of ground water (which has been shown to be
heavily contaminated) use in the ptoject area, would
decrease leading to a decrease in the incidence of water
related diseases. This will also reduce the chances of
saline water intrusion in the groundwater aquifers.
6-9



6.6    Land Environment
Improvement works at the infall points of Sengal Odai
and Papakudi drain of Veeranam lake, and construction of
booster station at Chendur entail acquisition of 24.65 and
2.70.5 ha. of land respectively. This will have a permanent
impact in loss of agricultural produce and a change in the
land use pattern, landscape and aesthetics of the area.
Physico-chemical changes in soil quality may occur
during construction mainly due to clearing of vegetative
cover at the site thereby causing soil erosion resulting in
turbidity in surface runoff. The clearing of forests and
field habitats would result in destruction of terrestrial
organisms.
The proposed activity of raising the Veeranam bund to
increase the FTL by 0.61 m will entail the closing down /
diversion of Madras- Kumbakonam road temporarily. This would
cause considerable disruption to normal flow of traffic and
commercial activities. For the increased MWL of Veeranam
lake, the Madras-Kumbakonam road in the ridge near
Solatharam will be affected, requiring the construction of a
retaining wall for a length of 400 m.
The seepage rates for water in the lake are in the
range of 0.9-2.7 mm/d. This, however, will not cause water
logging in the neighbouring areas. Water logging is set in
the peripheral villages away from lake edge on the eastern
side only during periods of heavy rains.
The trap efficiency of Veeranam lake is 88% in
presence of Kattamani' (Ipoemia species) vegetation. When
this vegetation is submerged, the trap efficiency will
reduce resulting in decreased silt load.
Construction of the proposed straight cut to Godavari
drain will significantly improve the drainage of the
surrounding area which is now affected due to water logging
with consequent reduction in crop yield.
6-10



The augmentation of water supply through New Veeranam
Project will lead to a spurt in the overall developmental
activities such as increased housing, transportation,
commercial, industrial etc. which will have a significant
impact on the land use pattern in the project area.
6.7    Socio-Economic Environment
As for the people in the area irrigated by Veeranam
lake, no significant socio-economic impact is expected as
there will be no reduction in their traditional irrigation
water rights. On the other hand, due to storage of water in
Veeranam lake all through the year, the groundwater
potential in the surrounding area is likely to increase.
This may even improve the prospects of raising additional
crops in the area.
Due to storage of water in the Veeranam lake allround
the year, the potential for development of lake fisheries
would increase.
The proposed project activities do not involve loss
or disturbance of sensitive areas and cultural properties to
any significant level. The project area does not have any
distinct tribal community and hence the problem of impact on
tribal community does not exist.
Due to the project activities there is a great
potential for employment both during construction stage
(short term) and during the post construction/ operation
stage (long term). While the employment potential for the
construction activity can not be estimated readily, the
requirement of permanent staff of various categories for
operation of water treatment plant and pumping stations is
estimated at 200. This is in addition to potential indirect
employment due to the project. This in turn will have a
positive impact on the economy of  the population, both
local and regional as summarised in Table 6.1.

The proposed construction of a terrace along the
foreshore bund in Suthamalli village with lawn facilities
using a part of the soil to be taken out from within the
lake is expected to improve the aesthetics of the area with
the potential for tourism promotion.
With increased water supply from the New Veeranam
project, the general health status and well being of the
people in the Metropolitan area will be enhanced to a
considerable extent. The incidences of diseases and
epidemics caused by acute water shortages will be
substantially reduced. The drudgery and time saved due to
the improved availability of piped water will release a
large number of men and women for productive work. A sense
of security and well-being leading to the increased
productivity are all important benefits due to the improved
water supply.
The augmentation of water supply in the project area
will trigger an all round increase in developmental activity
such as housing, transportation, education and cultural
which would have a significant impact on the life style of
the population. In sum, the overall impact of the project on
the socio-economic environment is expected to be highly
beneficial and positive.

7. EVALUATION OF
IMPACTS



7.   EVALUATION OF IMPACTS
7.1    Battelle Environmental Evaluation System (BEES)
The environmental impacts, as a result of the New
Veeranam Project was evaluated based on Battelle
Environmental Evaluation System (BEES). Relevant parameters
were identified under the four environmental categories viz.
ecology, environmental pollution, aesthetics and human
interest. Each parameter was assigned a weight depending
upon its relative importance by an interdisciplinary team of
specialists using ranked pairwise comparison technique. The
resultant weight points (parameter important units) i.e. PIU
are presented in Fig.7.1 by numbers indicated adjacent to
the parameters in parenthesis. The higher the number, the
greater is the relative importance.
The Environmental Quality (EQ) of each parameter is
defined by a value function which has a value between 0 and
1 based on a scale 1 for good quality and 0 for poor
quality. The functional relationships refer to graphical
means for transforming factor measurements (baseline or
predicted values) into subjective evaluations. Using value
function graphs, the environmental quality values for all



the relevant parameters were worked out for the present
(baseline) and future scenarios i) without the project,
ii) with the project but without EMP, and iii) with the
project incorporating EMP and the same are presented in
Tables 7.1 through 7.4.
An index is obtained in Environmental Impact Unit
(EIU), by calculations as shown below, of parameters with
and without the project.
n
EIU  =   (EQ)ij (PIU)i
i=1
in which
EIUj = Environmental Impact Quality for jth
alternative
EQi- = Environmental Quality scale for ith factor and
jth alternative
PIUi = Parameter Importance Unit for ith factor
The difference in Environmental Impact Units between
the two conditions constitutes either an adverse (less in
EIUs) or beneficial (greater in EIUs) impact. The
environmental impact units have been computed and presented
in Tables 7.5 through 7.8. The resultant numerical
evaluation has been described hereunder.
7.1.1 Ecology
The baseline data has shown that the ecology (both
terrestrial and aquatic) in the project area is already
degraded to some extent and may further deteriorate in
future, even without the project, due to increasing human
activities. With the implementation of the project, the
aquatic ecosystem will improve significantly compared to the
terrestrial ecosystem. However, with the implementation of
the EMP, the terrestrial ecosystem can be restored to some
extent with further improvement in aquatic ecosystem.

7.1.2 Environmental Pollution
The present status of water environment in the
Veeranam lake is satisfactory; while the same is far from
satisfactory in the MMA. Urbanisation and industrialisation
in the MMA would further lead to a depletion in the
quantity and quality of both surface and ground water
resources, resulting in poor environmental quality.
With the increase in anticipated water supply
(180 mld) from Veeranam lake and the consequent increase in
wastewater flow, the functionality of the existing sewerage
system is expected to improve.   Augmented with other
measures such as dredging and removal of sand bars at the
river mouths, the quality of waterways and their potential
for recreation and navigation would improve.
The air quality in the project area will not change
significantly with or without the project. However, marginal
microclimatic changes may occur in and around Veeranam lake
due to storage of water all through the year. The
microclimate created by the lake will be characterised by
lower air temperature, high wind velocities and increase in
relative humidity in the area. These meteorological
conditions will be localised and would not influence the
environment surrounding the lake significantly.
The likely change in community noise environment,
althoug': temporarily negative, is insignificant. However,
impact due to occupational noise level, though significant,
can be mitigated by proper EMP. The change in the land
environment due to the change in land use pattern is
negative.
7.1.3 Aesthetics
The topographic features of the project area will be
marginally affected, in and around the veeranam lake,
pipeline alignment, pumping/ booster stations and water
7-15



treatment plant. However, this can be mitigated by proper
EMP. Availability of water throughout the year due to
storage in the Veeranam lake may enhance the aesthetics of
the area and attract tourism. However, due to the project
activities, there will be a slight impairment in lake water
quality, visual air quality and noise level which can be
mitigated by proper EMP. The project will not affect the
environmentally sensitive areas and archaeological sites to
any significant level.
7.1.4 Human Interest
Due to improved availability of protected water
supply coupled with improved sanitation/ personal hygiene,
the health status of the community will be significantly
enhanced. The project will also contribute to employment
generation during construction and operational phases,
increased economic output, income levels and social well
being. In general, the impact on parameters of human
interest will be positive.
7.2    Overall Impact Evaluation
The net environmental impact of the New Veeranam
project on ecology is positive.  The positive impacts are
mainly due to increased vegetation, species diversity and
availability of water in the reservoir throughout the year,
reduced eutrophication, and commercial fisheries.
The net environmental impact of the project with
respect to environmental pollution is positive. This
positive impact is mainly reflected through reservoir water
quality,   surface water hydrology, city waterways water
quality and ground water quality. The positive impact can
be enhanced by proper EMP.
Aesthetic environment shows positive impact due to
landscape, improved visual water quality and a favourable
cumulative effect arising from other components.
7-16



The human interest parameters exhibit significant
positive impact mainly due to increased water supply,
improved sanitation, community health, enhanced economic
output and job opportunities leading to better quality of
life.
A summary of the evaluation of the environment "with"
and "without" project scenarios, gives an overall project
index of 624 and 568.75 respectively (Table 7.9).  With the
effective implementation of the recommended EMP, a further
improvement in the quality of environment to the extent of
114.5 units can be achieved.
7.3    Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)
The impact statement focuses on the project area
viz., the Madras Metropolitan Area (MMA), Veeranam lake and
its ayacut, intake arrangements, transmission main corridor
from Sethiathope to Porur, pumping/ booster stations and
water treatment plant sites and clear water storage
reservoir at Porur. The four basic environmental categories
to be affected ar  Ecology,  Environmental  Pollution,
Aesthetics and Human Interest.
The above environmental categories consist of 48
parameters in the instant case. For each of the above
categories, significant impacts have been identified,
predicted and evaluated through Battelle Environmental
Evaluation System (BEES) using environmental value function
graphs to classify the beneficial and adverse impacts.
7.3.1 Ecology
Baseline data has shown that the ecology of the
region has been affected by human activity since a long
time. About 202 ha. of land was acquired in 1969-72 for the
project thereby disturbing the terrestrial ecology mainly
along the ROW for transmission main. After the transmission
main is laid, the land can be brought to the original
condition, thereby terrestrial ecology can be made up by
adequate compensatory replantption.

The plankton in the reservoirs is now dominated by
blue green algae or green algae and rotifers, cladocera and
copepoda. The desilting, raising of bund and storage of
water in the lake throughout the year may not only help in
maintaining the above plankton species but also increase the
diatoms and thereby the biological diversity. The desilting
of lake will reduce eutrophication.
In the Veeranam lake, fishing activity, though not
very important, is a source of revenue and food to a
sizeable population. The project would enhance the fishing
activities and the revenue therefrom.
Increased availability of ground water throughout the
year in and around Veeranam lake can promote agricultural
activities, and will be beneficial to the large and medium
sized trees and shrubs which depend on shallow water table
for their water requirements. This will have beneficial
effects on the forest and open lands which will be covered
by shrubbing vegetation. Diversity of plant species will
increase leading to healthier environment.   Consequently,
diversity of birds will also improve. The grazing field
will also increase due to availability of more ground water.
7.3.2 Environmental Pollution
The construction activities associated with the pipe
laying, pumping/ booster station, treatment plant will
temporarily increase the dust concentration and ambient
noise levels. These activities will also cause traffic
congestion/ diversion and disruption of normal life and
business. With the implementation of the project, the per
capita water supply for all the categories of consumers in
the metropolitan area will increase with consequent increase
in treated wastewater flows. This will result in improved
water quality in the city waterways. As a result of the
improved water supply, the present level of ground water
extraction will be reduced in the MMA which will help
mitigate the problem of saline water intrusion.
7-19



7.3.3 Aesthetics
The MMA is extremely flat with almost no hills. The
average slope within Madras city is less than 1 meter per
1500 m, a factor which presents numerous difficulties in
providing storm water and wastewater drainage facilities.
Flooding during rainy season in the city is a common scene
which often is compounded by overflow from surcharged
sewers. The topography along the proposed alignment of water
supply pipeline from Veeranam to Madras is undulating and
intercepted by rivers, several drainage channels and
national and state Highway.
The year round availability of water in Veeranam
lake due to the project may result in marginal changes in
the microclimate of the area. The water spread area of the
lake will also increase the scenic beauty of the area. The
visual water quality will improve with the implementation of
the project.
The main sensitive areas in and around the project
area are Guindy National Park, Vedanthangal Water Bird
Sanctuary, the Madras Snake Park, Adyar Estuary, Karikil
Bird Sanctuary, Temples and Forests. The project will not
have any significant adverse impact on these sensitive
areas.
7.3.4 Human Interest
The present per capita water supply to Madras city is
grossly inadequate (45-70 lpd). A few of the urbanised areas
in MMA outside the city have independent water supply
schemes with lesser per capita supply. The project will
improve the water supply situation considerably by making
available an additional quantity of 180 mld to the Madras
city, added areas and adjacent urbanised area. Employment
opportunities would increase during construction and
operational phases of the project.
Necessary action has been taken to rehabilitate and
resettle the affected people by allotting alternative sites
and, to pay monetary compensation for the property/ land
7-20



acquired from them for the project.  When viewed in the
context of the benefits likely to accrue to the people in
the MMA by the implementation of the project, the impact on
the displaced people would be marginal. The people in the
project area are aware of the proposed project and are in
favour of its speedy implementation.
In sum, the additional water supply from the New
Veeranam project will improve the health and productivity of
the people leading to an improvement in their economic
status and quality of life.
7-21



8. ENVIRONMENTAL
MANAGEMENT PLAN



8-    ENVIRONKENTAL MANAGENENT PLAN
8.1    Preamble
The New Veeranam project, when implemented, will
provide significant environmental and health benefits to the
residents of Madras Metropolitan Area by mitigating the
chronic water shortage experienced by the city. The project
also has the potential of causing some negative
environmental impacts due to large scale construction
activities associated with the project and change in land
use pattern.  These adverse impacts could be mitigated or
eliminated by implementing a well organised appropriate
Environmental Management Plan (EMP) during the pre-
construction, construction and operational phases of the
project as described below.
8.2    Pre-construction Phase
The pre-construction activities of the project
comprise mainly acquisition of land for Veeranam source
improvement works, pipeline ROW, booster station at Chendur,
and clear water storage reservoir(s) at Porur. Along the
existing Veeranam bund, and the transmission pipeline ROW
there are encroachments which have to be cleared requiring,



in many cases, rehabilitation and resettlement of PAFs.
Also, many PSC pipes manufactured for the old Veeranam
project lying unused along the ROW have to be transported
and stacked in identified places by the contractor under the
direction and supervision of MMWSSB/TWAD Board engineers.
If a final decision is taken to locate the proposed WTP at
Mangalam, the existing structures/unused pipes on the site
have also to be cleared.
At the time of site clearance for pipeline ROW, care
must be taken to minimise the need for cutting of trees,
damage to the native vegetation, disruption of existing
services such as electricity, telephones, etc., and to
minimise disturbance to the normal life and traffic.
8.3    Construction Phase
All construction activities by their very nature are
disruptions to the existing environment. The following
environmental protection and enhancement measures should be
incorporated as part of the terms and conditions of contract
for implementation by the contractor or the Authority as
appropriate.
8.3.1 Protection of Vegetation
Clearing of sites and grubbing operations should be
carried out in a manner that will not reduce slope
stability and that will minimize future surface water runoff
and erosion. As much of the removed materials as possible
should be used or reclaimed while the rest should be used
for landscaping and levelling activities.
Existing topsoil which must be removed during
construction should be neatly and temporarily stockpiled for
later use when required.
Precautions should be taken to minimize damage to
native plant communities on the periphery of the
construction area, particularly those that may support
wildlife.   The trees, shrubs, and sod that should be
8-2



retained after construction should be protected from
permanent damage.
All disturbed construction areas on the periphery of
the construction site should be replanted with native plant
growth to minimize visual impact and future erosion.
Erosion damage should be got repaired during the first
spring following the completion of construction.
In residential and rural areas, care must be
exercised to avoid damaging the root systems of trees so
much that they cannot survive, need to be removed, or
severely trimmed.  Whenever possible, damage to root systems
should be minimized either by routing the trench or
excavation far away from the trees.
8.3.2 Veeranama Catchment Area Treatment
Dry crops are cultivated in the Veeranam catchment
area with deep ploughing. Such cultivated fields, usually
produce a runoff of 15-25 % of a moderate rainfall. Against
this practice of clean cultivation, row crops like cotton,
cultivated legumes, cow pea, moong, urad, groundnut, and
soyabean with close planting result only in a runoff of
about 1-2 %. The catchment area of the Veeranam lake drains
an annual runoff of about 71.9 M Cu.m laden with 0.6 to 0.8%
of suspended particulate matter. The eroded soil and
sediment should be confined to each individual farming unit
by raising a suitable border of shrubs and grasses around
the farm. Rain drop intensity can be reduced, in the first
instance, by resorting to an agroforestry system, wherein
certain tree species are raised suitably on and around the
farms. A list of some of the recommended fodder and
ornamental trees is given in Table 8.1.
The catchment area should be divided into a number of
blocks and each block properly surveyed for physiography and
farm orientation with regard to natural slopes. Shrub
barriers should be raised across barren slopes. In each
block, any barren patch should be seeded with the grass
Cynodon dactylon. Two or three rows of small trees and

shrubs should be planted along both sides of the two major
drains in the catchment area along with seeding or slip
placing of a few local grass species. This will check the
bank erosion during high flow periods and also serve as an
additional barrier to trap runoff suspended matter entering
these drains from sides. No patch in the catchment area,
outside individual farm boundary and housing, should be left
barren. Some trees, ornamental shrubs and grass should cover
every such patch. During the initial stages, on sites that
are highly fragile and conducive to formation of deep
gullies, rubble check dams of appropriate size and dimension
should be constructed. Horticultural crops have special
value in that leaf litter from most of them forms a valuable
barrier for fine soil particles. Plants of guava, jamun
(black berry), custard apple, sapota, mango are useful for
this purpose. These should be planted on vacant areas,
outside the farms.
8.3.3 Runoff and erosion control along pipeline ROW
When facilities are constructed in other than paved
areas, precautions should be taken to minimize erosion.
Temporary drainage channels and structures should be
provided to minimize erosion and to prevent ponding of
surface water on the construction site and on adjacent
property. Precautions should be taken to divert the water
used in washing down construction areas and flushing
pipelines into storm sewers or natural drainage channels.
Exposure of soils susceptible to wind and water
erosion and sediment buildup in natural drainage courses
should be minimized by adoption of erosion control measures
such as raising of shrubs and grasses.
8.3.4 Dust Control
Dust should be controlled by sweeping, sprinkling or
washing, depending on the circumstances. Sprinkling will be
used on unimproved roads and rights of way. Surfaced
streets should be washed down only after all possible dirt
has been removed by mechanical means. Mud should be washed
8-5



from all construction equipment and vehicles prior to travel
on surfaced streets; any large amounts of mud deposited on
surfaced streets should be removed before the end of the
working day.
Trucks hauling dirt, rock or other granular or
particulate material to and from the construction project
should have their loads limited, trimmed, or wetted and
covered to prevent material from being spilled/ scattered or
wind blown over public streets.
8.3.5 Air quality control
Although relatively minor and temporary, construction
activities add to the air pollution in the region. Necessary
measures should be taken to meet the emission standards for
all construction equipment and vehicles, to keep
construction equipment well-tuned and serviced to reduce
emissions
8_ 3._6 Noise abatement measures
Construction operations in residential areas should
be restricted to the hours after 7:30 A.M. and before 6 P.M.
(except for equipment warm-up), unless emergency repairs or
special non-recurring construction operations are necessary
and are approved. Near schools, potentially disturbing
operations should be confined to the hours before and after
school, whenever practical. In hospital zones, every effort
should be made to minimize noise levels at all times.
Noise levels should be reduced by use of adequate
mufflers on all motorized equipment. Modern "quiet-running"
equipment should be specified whenever available. Noise
suppression equipment and baffling should be employed on
ventilating machinery, compressors, and generators,
especially when they are operated in residential, school, or
hospital areas. Blasting should not be permitted unless
absolutely necessary, and then only when the blasting plan
is approved in advance by the Authority.
8-6



8.3.7 Visual/aesthetic enhancement
All construction equipment and material should be
stored in a neat and orderly manner. When appropriate, the
specifications for a job should provide that the project
site and staging area is to be screened with an esthetically
pleasing temporary fence.
Any excess excavated material should be removed from
the project site as soon as possible after the completion of
excavation operations. After final site grading is
completed, all remaining excavated material should be
removed from the project site or used for leveling and
landscaping
Temporary sanitary facilities should be provided for
workmen by locating the facilities in as inconspicuous a
place as possible. When this is not possible, they should
be screened with temporary fencing or plantings, or painted,
so they tend to blend in with their surroundings. These
facilities should be maintained in a clean, odour-free
condition at all times taking care to avoid soil and
groundwater contamination.
Designs should include aesthetic treatment, such as
rounding the tops and bottoms of excavations and embankments
to create a natural-appearing surface.
8.3.8 Traffic controls and detours
The Authority should make a determination of the
safe, legal load limits of all bridges and surface streets
that may be traversed by heavy equipment used at the project
site. A decision on allowable traffic patterns in the
affected area throughout the work week will be made; this
should include a consideration of the large turning
requirements of certain equipment that might increase
congestion  and  traffic  hazards    at  heavily  used
intersections.
8-7



Deliveries of materials to the project site should be
consolidated whenever feasible to minimize the flow of
traffic.
As much movement of large equipment as possible
should be carried out at times other than morning and
evening rush hours. Before construction begins, necessary
cooperation should be sought from the local police and
public works authorities to select the most suitable route
for delivery and haul equipment with due consideration of
load limits, traffic patterns, and the character of
neighbourhoods traversed, and to establish traffic controls
and detours that are marked with signs, lights, and other
means to minimize motorist confusion and to maximize public
and worker safety.
Access for emergency vehicles should be provided at
all times with essentially no delay. Police and fire
departments should be notified before any street or other
emergency access route is closed, and routes will not be
closed until an approved alternate is opened.
Interruption of access to individual properties, and
other public agency-operated facilities will be avoided or
very limited in duration. Notice should be given to
individuals, businesses, utilities, and public agencies when
their access will be blocked, even temporarily.    No
equipment or materials should be allowed to block streets
longer than absolutely necessary. All streets should be
returned to a passable condition before the end of each
working day.
Pedestrian bridges with splinte--free handrails
should be provided at all intersections when trenches must
remain open. When trenches should remain open past the end
of the working day, steel plates over trenches should be
provided at driveways and intersections. Wooden bridging
should not generally be permitted for vehicular traffic.
8-8



8.3.9 Disposal of construction vastes
Any solid waste generated by the demolition of
existing structures or facilities at construction sites
should be hauled to an approved disposal site.
8.3.10 Paving repair
Cutting recently built or resurfaced roads should be
avoided except when this is essential for emergency repair.
To facilitate this practice, the Authority should maintain
close co-ordination with the agencies regarding their street
resurfacing programs. This coordination makes it possible to
renew any water mains and other services that are inadequate
or may require reconstruction in the near future before
resurfacing so as to avoid unnecessary road cuts in newly
surfaced streets.
To avoid possible subsidence in trenches and
excavations, and paving failure, it is necessary to use
granular soil or approved material for backfilling. All
backfill must be consolidated.
8.3.11 Historical and Archaeological Protection
If the construction activity uncovers subsurface
evidence of archaeological significance, the construction
activity in the vicinity of the find should be delayed until
the find is evaluated by the archaeological department.
8.3.12 Eliminating safety hazards
In developed areas, when pipe or other subsurface
facilities should be laid out above ground prior to burial,
these materials should be strung no earlier than three days
before actual installation. During installation, the amount
of open trench should be kept to a minimum, with backfilling
operations proceeding as close behind installation as
practical. Pipe storage should not block the line of vision
at intersections or other areas. Where installations are in
surfaced streets, temporary paving should be applied as soon
8-9



as possible after backfilling and should remain in place
until just before final paving operations.
Where it is necessary to leave an open end of pipe
exposed overnight, the pipe should be closed or plugged
securely to prevent entry.
More details on safety measures and services for
construction activities are given in Annexure 8.1.
8.3.13 Completing the construction project
Before the activity is considered as complete by the
Authority, appropriate measures should be taken to restore
the project and surrounding areas as near as possible to
pre-construction condition or to conformance with project
landscaping plans, and to remove all temporary structures,
equipment, surplus material, refuse, and construction
fencing from the project site. All temporary drainage
facilities should be graded or removed and all cut and fill
areas should be graded, planted and fertilized so they blend
in with native trees, shrubs so that the project's visual
impact is lessened.
8.4    Operational Phase
8.4.1  Source Protection
The very first step in assuring a safe and acceptable
public water supply is protecting the source from pollution
so as to minimise the future liability to the health and
well-being of the water consumer and the economic burden to
the water supply agency. Any deterioration in the quality
of raw water supplies could be mitigated by judicious
management and oversight of land use and human activities
within the watersheds involved.
A routine programme of water quality monitoring and
treatability studies should be instituted at the plant
laboratory to facilitate the control of unit operations and
processes involved. This activity has to be undertaken more
8-10



frequently, especially during the first 2 to 3 years
following the Veeranam water supply. In addition, effective
operation and control of treatment plant should be ensured
through qualified and adequately trained operating staff to
produce a final water which will meet the prescribed
standards.
8.4.2 Land Environment
Land environment related management plan in this
project aims at creating an aesthetically pleasing and
functionally efficient landscape. It is suggested that the
road side away from the lake edge should be subjected to
massive plantation programme with emphasis on ornamental
tree species in the first row, trees used for fodder and
wind breaks in the second row, with shrubs and small trees
placed in between. The spacing should be 10 m in the first
row and 5 m in the second row.   Along the road side close
to the lake edge, only one row of trees of foliage
significance such as Saraca indica, Minusops elengi,
Terminalia arjuna, Azadirachta indica, Casurina
equisetifolia should be planted at 10 m from plant to plant.
The first row of trees should be placed atleast 2 m away
from the road edge.
All along the pipeline alignment, trees should be
planted in one or two rows on either side, the first row
being always for ornamental and aesthetic purposes. Small
trees and shrubs should find place in the second row.
Spathodia companulata, Kyjelia pimmata, Tabebuia argunta and
Couroupita guianaensis are a few species suggested for
plantation.
Water treatment pumping stations and staff colonies
should also be subjected to plantation programme. Treatment
plant sites should be identified by plant species such as
Royal Palm, drooping Ashoka, Gul Mohar', Pride of India
etc. Colonies should have some plant species of ornament and
fragrance values, such as Cestruns, Jasmules, Parijatak',
Hibiscus, Ixoras. Lausonia, Casuarina, Tecomas can be used
and trained as hedges around gardens and treatment units.
8-11



The services of a horticulturist from the Department
and a taxonomist from the Forest Department should be
availed for species identification and procurement.
Departmental nurseries should be developed somewhere near
the lake, one at Tindivanam and one at Madras to cater to
the needs of initial and replacement plantations.
Weed growth in channel and the lake could be a
nuisance. Therefore, regular monitoring and control of weed
growth is necessary. The weed control should be carried out
only mechanically. The harvested or dying weeds should be
removed and destroyed promptly.
8.4.3 Water Treatment
The proposed treatment plant at Mangalam/ Vadakuthu
will generate around 3.2 mld of alum sludge with 0.5 %
solids. Thickening of sludge will further reduce the
quantity of sludge to be handled and the cost of sludge
treatment and disposal. The thickened sludge may be disposed
of as land fill without causing any significant impact as
the waste quantity would be very small. Being essentially
insoluble in nature, the alum sludge may not pose a serious
problem due to leaching of the metal. In order to minimise
the possible adverse impact, the feasibility of reusing the
sludge, after dewatering to reduce bulk and facilitate
handling, as a raw material for manufacturing alum may be
explored.
Use of alum sludge has also been tried as a
plasticizer in ceramic industry, a constituent of high
alumina refractory bricks, a part of the mixture with fly-
ash for road stabilization, an ingredient for the
preparation of building bricks, filler for rubber goods, a
soil-conditioner  for  heavy  clays,  and  for  other
horticultural purposes.
Pre-chlorination and disinfection by post
chlorination are proposed in treatment of veeranam water.
In addition, booster chlorination may be required. This
8-12



involves handling and use of considerable quantity of
chlorine. Chlorine safety measures as detailed at
Annexure 8.2 should, therefore, be strictly followed to
minimise hazards associated with chlorine handling and use.
Preventive maintenance activities for WTP should be
carried out regularly as per the guidelines at Annexure 8.3.
The frequency recommended for an activity be initially
adopted on an adhoc basis and the same be modified based on
experience gained from time to time. Good housekeeping,
preventive and corrective maintenance, record keeping, daily
work schedule and stock  inventory are essential for an
effective operation of WTP/ pumping station.
8.4.4 Water Quality Surveillance
The Metrowater has a fairly well established
infrastructure (Water Quality Control Department) with
competent staff for routine monitoring and control of water
quality at the source(s), treatment plant and distribution
system. In the light of augmentation of water supply to the
city from New Veeranam project and the likely increase in
population to be served, the number and frequency of sample
collection from the distribution system will have to be
suitably increased to meet the CPHEEO recommendations
(Annexure 8.4).
Regular monitoring of the lake water quality should
be ensured to facilitate appropriate preventive and
corrective measures at the source. This would zlso help to
develop a data base on water quality and establish its trend
which could form the basis for future water quality
management programmes.
From logistic consideration, when Veeranam project is
commissioned, it would be essential to have a full fledged
laboratory with competent staff established at Vadakuthu/
Mangalam for routine water quality analysis and treatment
control under the supervision of TWAD/ MMWSSB as the case
may be.
8-13



The existing level of laboratory facilities, and
operation and maintenance personnel for effective management
of the sewage treatment plants under MMWSSB is inadequate.
In the context of the proposed treatment capacity
augmentation under the ongoing project, and the anticipated
generation of additional sewage flows, the laboratory
facilities have to be strengthened and additional personnel
have to be recruited to ensure production of effluent of
prescribed standards.
Presently the waterways water quality in Madras is
monitored by the TNPCB which is well equipped with advanced
and sophisticated instrumentation and trained staff for
water and wastewater analysis. The TNPCB should continue to
monitor the waterways so as to assess the impact of
increased wastewater generation/ improved wastewater quality
due to Veeranam supply.
8.4.5 Leak Detection and Control in Water Distribution
System
In order to obtain maximum benefit of the increased
water supply expected to be available from Veeranam project,
it is absolutely essential that the unaccounted for water
(UFW) in the distribution system is kept within acceptable
levels. This would call for a well-organised, scientific
study to assess the leak levels and implementation of
appropriate corrective measures including phased replacement
of badly leaking, corroded water mains, house connections,
valves and other appurtenances. The process of waste
assessment, leak detection and control initiated under the
World Bank project should be continued.
Presently, in MMWSSB, a core of twenty trained staff
(including field labour staff) equipped with a complete set
of necessary instruments/ equipment is engaged in leak
detection and control programme. Considering the large area
to be serviced, this is very inadequate and therefore, the
existing infrastructure has to be further strengthened. As
an immediate measure, at least one more team fully equipped
with necessary instruments should be identified, trained and
deployed in the field work.
8-14



8.5    Environmental Monitoring
A comprehensive environmental monitoring programme
before the construction phase, during construction, and
operation of the project as detailed in Table 8.2 is
essential for effective mitigation of negative impacts of
the project.   The monitoring for each project phase, to
begin with, shall cover all environmental aspects related to
the project.  As factual information on the environmental
impacts due to construction and operation phases of the
project becomes available through the proposed monitoring,
the monitoring programme may be suitably modified, if
necessary.
For effective implementation of the recommended
environmental monitoring, it will be necessary to develop
adequate facilities for sampling and analysis. It will be
desirable to operate an environmental monitoring cell at
MMWSSB/ TWAD Board with adequate training and
instrumentation support. Alternatively, the available
infrastructure with the TNPCB and or private laboratories
with adequate infrastructural facilities and expertise may
also be identified to assist in these activities.
The implementation of the mitigation plan should be
regularly reviewed by a high level committee consisting of
members drawn from MMWSSB, TWAD, PWD, TNPCB and MMDA to
ensure compliance with the recommendations.
8.6   Training
With assistance from the World Bank and the British
Overseas Development Administration (ODA) the Metrbwater
Training Centre has been established at Kilpauk in 1979.
The Training Centre has all modern facilities for conducting

administration section, class rooms, audio visual workshop,
mains and services laying workshop, electrical /mechanical
workshop, a fairly well equipped laboratory, a curriculum
development room, and a library.

The Training Centre conducts training courses for the
MMWSSB staff based on an yearly training programme. Courses
of 1 day to 5 days duration are conducted, and a maximum of
ten trainees are included in each course. About 60 courses
have   been developed  covering management  aspects,
maintenance of water supply systems, sewerage systems,
sewage treatment plants, mains and service laying,
electrical/mechanical equipment maintenance etc.   Field
workers, technicians, operators, J.E./A.E.s, A.S.E.s and
E.E.s participate in the training courses. The Training
Centre has plans for strengthening the infrastructure under
the World Bank Project.
The TWAD Board, also has a fairly equipped training
centre of its own and conducts training programmes of
various types to its own personnel and on behalf of Ministry
of Urban Development, Government of India.
The personnel responsible for water   supply and
sanitation planning, design, implementation, and O&M
comprise three major categories of employees viz. qualified
engineers, supervisors and skilled artisans.  Appropriate
training of staff at each level is essential.   Training
should not be a one time activity; periodic training in
order to acquire latest knowledge and skill is essential in
the effective management of WTP, distribution system and
pumping stations and wastewater management systems.
8.7    Institutional Strengthening
The ongoing Projects and programmes of MMWSSB
envisage strengthening of institutional infrastructure for
improving the effectiveness and monitoring of the
programmes through reinforcing/ strengthening of the
existing infrastructure, capability development through
orientation programmes, training and refresher courses, and
strengthening the management and public relation skills of
staff at senior level, and increasing the proficiency of the
skilled cadre of the field staff. Hence, the need for
further strengthening of the staff may not be necessary.
