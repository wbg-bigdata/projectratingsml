MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO INDIA
FOR A SECOND MADRAS WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed loan to India for US$278.5 million equivalent repayable in twenty years, including five
years of grace, at the standard variable interest rate, to help finance the Second Madras Water
Supply Project.
2.    Background. The proportion of the urban population in India receiving water supply is
about 85% but this comparatively high coverage is an inadequate indicator of the status of the
water supply sector. In most Indian cities supplies to the consumer are intermittent and are
frequently reduced to as little as two hours per day often at very low pressures. This has
implications not only for convenience but for water quality because of the risks of health-
threatening contamination as a result of back-flow in the poorly maintained distribution systems.
Intermittent supplies to industrial consumers also have serious economic implications for
production. Madras, India's fourth largest city and the capital of Tamil Nadu State, has the
lowest level of water supply of all metropolitan areas in India. The maximum availability of
water from existing sources is about 290 million liters per day (mld) providing an average for
areas covered with piped supply of about 70 liters per capita per day (lpcd) inclusive of demands
by industry and other non domestic consumers. The corresponding figures for other cities are
Bombay 253, Delhi 220, Calcutta 190 and Bangalore 125 lpcd.
3.    Water supply for Madras is currently obtained from ground water sources and three
interconnected reservoirs. There has been underinvestment in water distribution for many years
leading to poor coverage, inequitable distribution and considerable wastage through leakage and
abuse. The Bank is funding an on-going Madras Water Supply and Sanitation Project
(LN.2846/CR. 1822-IN, known as the First Project) in the amount of US$69 million equivalent
for which the Board date was June 1987 with a closing date of December 1995. The project is
aimed at increasing water supply and improving water distribution and sewerage services. The
severity of the water shortage in Madras will continue, however, until large sources of supply are
developed to bring water from outside the city. There are two main new sources: the proposed
project, which would bring water from the Cauvery River system to the south of Madras (the
Second Project); and, the development of a source based on the Krishna River located in the state
of Andhra Pradesh to the north. In the latter case, works are currently underway (not financed by
the Bank) which will provide water by canal to the Madras reservoir system.
4.    In addition to this Second Project, a Third Project is also under preparation which has the
objectives of further expanding and strengthening for the water supply and sewerage system to



- 2 -
effectively utilize the new flows of water to the city. Additionally, the Third Project will
increase the cleanliness of the city and its waterways, improve access by the poor to sanitary
excreta disposal and further strengthen the relevant environmental sanitation and water supply
institutions. Thus, the Second Project should be considered as an element in a program of
physical and institutional strengthening and upgrading.
5.    Rationale for Bank Involvement and the Country Assistance Strategy. Following
the achievement of many of the objectives of structural reform at the Center, the India Country
Assistance Strategy (May 19, 1995) to be discussed by the Board on June 20, 1995, now gives
priority to implementing state-level sector reforms and improving state finances. These are
essential if state governments are to play their key role in the provision of critically needed
infrastructure and services. The lending reflects the requirements and characteristics of
individual states and the proposed project is consistent with this intention. Through increasing
the supply of water to the city of Madras the opportunity for sector reform is increased and the
drive for financial strengthening of the principal implementing entity, the Madras Metropolitan
Water Supply and Sanitation Board (MMWSSB), is sustained. The project is consistent with the
strategic intention to remove severe bottlenecks which are inhibiting economic growth and to
provide basic public services to the rapidly growing urban population and the urban poor.
6.    Project Objectives. The major objectives are to:
(a)   provide water to Madras on an urgent basis;
(b)   improve the distribution of water within Madras; and
(c)   strengthen conservation of water by MMWSSB through physical measures, such
as leak detection and repairs, replacements and the introduction of revised water
tariffs.
7.    Project Description. The proposed Second Project would increase the supply of water to
Madras and lead to significant improvements in distribution and conservation with consequential
benefits for the population, economy and environment. The Bank's involvement would be to
assist with the financing of the works and provide the stimulus for needed conservation measures
and financial discipline. It would safeguard the interest of persons who otherwise would be
adversely affected by the project, including farmers and persons displaced. The project would be
implemented over six and a half years and would have the following parts:
(a)   Source Works at the Veeranam Tank (US$22.1 million) 2: The project would
exploit part of the yield of an existing agricultural water source, the Veeranam
tank, which is a shallow reservoir formed by earth embankments. The project
would finance increases in the capacity of the tank and this and new operational
measures would remove any impact of withdrawing water from the irrigation
2 Base cost



- 3 -
system which serves local farmers. The proposed major engineering works
include raising the tank embankment by placing and compacting on it material
excavated from the bed of the tank; construction of a parapet wall and other
works for prevention of wave erosion; restoration of an existing embankment and
construction of a new foreshore embankment and necessary modifications to
weirs and spillways. Additionally, there would be lining improvements to the
Vadavar Channel, which is the principal canal which serves the tank, and minor
irrigation works.
(b)   Water Transmission, Treatment and Resettlement (US$234.6 million):
Construction is proposed of a raw water intake and pumping station and storage at
the Veeranam tank and the laying of a transmission main for the raw water to a
treatment plant at Vadakkuthu about 20 km away; renovation of the old treatment
plant with installation of new mechanical and electrical equipment; laying of a
transmission main and associated facilities to convey the treated water to a
terminal reservoir at Porur on the outskirts of Madras. The distance from
Veeranam to Porur is about 235 km. A total quantity of 192 mld would be taken
from the source and 180 mld would be delivered at Porur, following water use for
treatment and losses during transmission.
The resettlement and rehabilitation of persons displaced by the project would
ensure the restoration or enhancement of their standard of living up to or above
levels enjoyed by them prior to the commencement of implementation of the
project. There would be provision of technical assistance for preparation work,
supervision of construction for transmission mains and related facilities, and
studies for the relocation and rehabilitation of displaced persons.
(c)   City Distribution and Water Conservation (US$69.2 million): A terminal
reservoir and pumping station would be constructed at Porur. The works
associated with improvements to and rehabilitation of the distribution system in
the city would continue those of the First Project and would include distribution
mains and the development of six distribution centers.
The conservation program would include increasing public awareness, leak
detection and repairs, replacements, strengthening and bulk metering. An
important part of the program would be progressive introduction of domestic
metering to provide comprehensive coverage in each zone. The strategy for water
conservation would be greatly assisted by the combination of volumetric
charging, associated with comprehensive metering, and the introduction of tariff
increases which would be necessary for MMWSSB to finance its share (about
17.2%) of total project cost out of its own internal cash generation. The interests
of the urban poor, who largely rely on standpost supplies, will be safeguarded.
The project would include the carrying out of studies relating to the distribution
and conservation of water, and environmental sanitation including the preparation
of a future project.



- 4 -
8.    Project Costs. Total project cost would be US$421.0 million which includes US$64.1
million for physical contingencies and US$3 1.0 million for price contingencies. Total project
cost includes US$28.6 million for duties and taxes and a very small sum for land acquisition,
involving the transfer of publicly owned land in the city, neither of which would be financed by
the Bank. The foreign exchange component is about US$107.8 million or 25.6% of total project
cost. The Bank loan would be for US$275.8 million or about 70 percent of total project cost net
of taxes and duties.
9.    Project Implementation. The Government of Tamil Nadu (GOTN) has constitued a
Project Management Group (PMG) consisting of technical, administrative and finance staff
deputed from the three implementing agencies to manage and co-ordinate the project and
monitor progress. TWAD is the agency responsible for the construction of the pumping,
transmission and treatment systems. MMWSSB is responsible for implementation of the
distribution and conservation components. The Water Resources Organization of the Public
Works Department of Tamil Nadu (WRO) is the agency responsible for all source-related works.
An operational action plan (OAP) for implementation of the project has been agreed with the
Bank which would be updated annually or as circumstances require.
10.   The PMG will be responsible for the day-to-day management of the project. The OAP
would include a detailed implementation schedule, monitoring indicators and allocation of
budgets according to sound project management procedures and analyses. The time required for
project supervision by Bank staff and consultants is not expected to be substantially different
from the average for water and sanitation projects in the Region, which is currently about twelve
weeks per year. As supervision efforts for this project will be undertaken in parallel with the
supervision of the remaining phases of the First Project, and the preparation and initial phases of
supervision for the Third Project, it is likely that there will be some significant supervision cost
sharing between these projects and that supervision costs will be below average for the proposed
Second Project.
11.   Project Sustainability. Successful operation of the water supply and distribution
system depends on the generation of adequate resources by MMWSSB to finance these activities.
Tariff reform is a part of the project, with the need for tariff increases being emphasized by
MMWSSB's project financing requirements and, in particular, the need to generate annually
some 17.2 percent of total project costs from internal cash generation. Additionally, institutional
strengthening measures are being put in place to improve management procedures and
contracting arrangements. Implementation of the water conservation strategy would help to
ensure that the water is put to efficient and effective use and is not wasted.
12.   Lessons from Previous Bank/IDA Involvement. The Bank Group began supporting
urban water supply and sanitation projects in India in 1974 and through to the end of FY 1994
had approved twelve projects, which account for US$814 million in IDA Credits and US$173
million in World Bank Loans. Most of the further eleven urban development projects accounting
for US$990 million and US$69 million respectively Credits and Loans, have contained
substantial components of water supply and sanitation investments. Of the twelve urban water



- 5 -
supply and sanitation projects, five have been single city projects mainly in the metropolitan
cities.
13.   The main lessons learned are the need for: (a) focused use of legal covenants where the
action is critical to project success; (b) greater flexibility and use of operational action plans to
be revised in the light of changing conditions; (c) greater attention to project preparation prior
to project effectiveness; (d) persistent supervision; and (e) the active participation by state
governments and agencies as policy intermediaries for bringing about the necessary reforms in
the sector framework. The proposed project has addressed all these issues and requirements.
14.   Environmental Aspects. An Environmental Assessment was carried out and an
Environmental Mitigation and Monitoring Plan has been prepared for mitigation of the adverse
impacts. The most significant impact would be the improvements expected in public health
through the increased quantity, quality and reliability of water supply in Madras. Augmentation
of the city's water supply is expected to reduce abstraction from the shallow aquifers in and
around the city, helping to reduce their over-exploitation.
15.   Construction of embankments at the Veeranam tank, transmission mains and related
infrastructure will result in the loss of some agricultural land for which there would be
appropriate compensation and rehabilitation of project affected persons. There would be
adequate mitigation measures to minimize soil erosion due to the excavation of trenches for
transmission pipelines. There will be some concentration of dust and noise nuisance during
construction activities for which, again, there are mitigation measures in the plan. Normal traffic
flow will be interrupted during construction particularly along stretches of national and state
highways. The conclusion of the environmental assessment for the project, however, is that the
environmental impact will on balance be significant and positive.
16.   Involuntary Displacement. The number of project affected persons is 168, and project
affected encroachers is 1,261, a total of 1,429. An R&R policy has been prepared to safeguard
the interests of these people along with an R&R action plan, which has received Bank approval.
17.   Safeguards for Farmers. The Veeranam irrigation tank would have increased capacity
following source works under the proposed project. The additional capacity and additional
releases at certain times of the year to the tank, would ensure that farmers in the Command Area
that use the irrigation water will be better off, or no worse off, as a result in normal, bad and very
bad years. Operating rules have been issued by GOTN to safeguard the farmers' position and a
Non-GovernLmental Organization as well as local authorities and farmers' associations are being
used to ensure full consensus continues to be achieved in the application of these operating rules.
18.   Agreed Actions.    The following assurances were obtained during negotiations and
were recorded in the Minutes:
(a)   TWAD would ensure that public contact offices are established during
construction;



- 6 -
(b)   tightened procedures would be used for the management of procurement,
covering: bid invitation advertising; signing of contracts within bid validity
periods; bid evaluation reports; contract award committees; and, monitoring data
on contract processing; and
(c)   GOTN would continue to consult, using an NGO, the farmers associations and
local governments as appropriate, to ensure a consensus is maintained amongst
farmers regarding the Governnent Order and Contingency Plan for operations of
the Mettur Reservoir and the Veeranam tank.
Agreements were reached at negotiations concerning the implementation program; arrangements
for quarterly and other monitoring and reporting on progress; the subsidiary loan agreement
between GOTN and MMWSSB; insurance, and the arrangements for financial management and
auditing. In addition the following Agreements were reached which were specific to the project
as follows:
(a)   TWAD would employ consultants before award of the transmission main
construction contract to supervise the transmission main construction under terms
and conditions satisfactory to the Bank;
(b)   TWAD would submit final designs and tender documents for rural water supply
along parts of the transmission main right-of-way satisfactory to the Bank by June
30, 1996;
(c)   WRO would submit a program satisfactory to the Bank for modernization of the
Veeranam Command conveyance system component including designs, tender
documents and implementation schedules by December 31, 1995;
(d)   MMWSSB would award a contract to Consultants by December 31, 1995 on
terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank for the preparation of final designs
and tender documents for the distribution system component;
(e)   MMWSSB would submit final designs and tender documents for the initial phase
of work for the distribution system component satisfactory to the Bank by
December 31, 1996;
(f)   MMWSSB would carry out the Water Distribution and Conservation Strategy in
accordance with agreed dates;
(g)   TWAD and WRO would carry out the Rehabilitation Action Plan agreed by the
Bank;
(h)   MMWSSB and TWAD would procure works, goods and services required for the
project in accordance with the procurement plan;



- 7 -
(i)    MMWSSB would generate annually from internal sources, funds equivalent to not
less than 17.2% of the capital expenditure incurred, and provide to the Bank by
December 31 of the year preceding the relevant year, its program and financial
forecast to achieve its contribution to the financing plan;
(j)    MMWSSB, TWAD and WRO would carry out the provisions of the
Environmental Mitigation and Monitoring Plan;
(k)   GOTN, MMWSSB, WRO and TWAD would carry out a mid-term review of the
project at a date to be agreed with the Bank, but before September 30, 1998; and
(1)    GOTN would establish a panel of experts to review dam safety at Veeranam tank
in accordance with the Bank's guidelines.
The following will be conditions of effectiveness:
(a)   TWAD would submit final designs and tender documents for the transmission
main, pumping stations and treatment plant satisfactory to the Bank and
incorporating the recommendations of an independent engineering review; and
(b)   there shall be in place a subsidiary loan agreement, acceptable to the Bank,
between GOTN and MMWSSB.
19.   Project Benefits. The major direct benefits of the project would be the provision of: (a)
an improved level of water supply service; (b) a more equitable distribution of water; (c)
improved conservation of water; (d) better management of services. These direct benefits would
yield secondary benefits of health and convenience to consumers, especially the urban poor,
improved economic performance by the city's industries and reduction in the over-exploitation of
the shallow aquifers in and around the city by the substitution of piped supplies for private
abstractions. The economic rate of return for (a), the direct benefit of bringing the additional
water to consumers in the city, is calculated as 13 percent per annum. Other benefits, including
the reduced risk of epidemics, cannot be readily quantified.
20.   Project Risks: The main risks likely to face the project are: (a) the capacity of the water
entities in Tamil Nadu to successfully construct the transmission main; (b) popular resistance to
tariff increases that would be necessary to ensure the satisfactory financing of the project; and
(c) a risk, considered small, of failure of the source in an extremely bad drought year or
sequence of years. The capacity of the entities would be addressed by careful engineering
preparation and supervision and by stringent pre-qualification of contractors. On tariffs, GOTN
has been in compliance during the First Project with financial covenants which have required
substantial increases which have been introduced without significant resistance.



.8-
21.   Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank and I reconunend that the Executive Directors approve the
proposed loan.
