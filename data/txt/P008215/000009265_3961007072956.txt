MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMEDATION
OF TBE PRSIIDENT
OF THE INTRNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPNT
10 THIE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A IPROPOSED LOAN TO TIE REPUBLIC OF VEZUELA
FOR A HEALTH SERVICES REFORM PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the follwing memorandum and recommendation on a
prposed loan to the Government of Venezuela for the eqtuivalent of US$54 million to help
finance a health services reform project. The loan would be at the Bank's standard varable
interst rate, with a maturity of 1S years includnag a five-year grace period. - The inistry of
Health (MSAS) and the four states of Aragua, Falc6n, Trujillo and Zulia would be the executing
agencies.
Backrund
2.    Venezuela has made impresive strides in ensuring health service fcilities and
manpower, yet health indicators lag behind those of other Latin American countries with similar
levels of per capita income. With ratios of 1.6 physicians and 2.9 hospital beds per 1,000
population, Venezuela surpasses many counties in the region. Nonetheless, the infant mortality
rate of 34 per 1000 live births is higher than in Chile or Colombia. Several easily preventable
or tetable infectious diseases, including measles and diarrhea, continue to figure among the top
ten causes of child deaths. Furthermore, as adult chronic illnesses and injuries increasingly
dominate the country's disease profile, the health system is proving incapable of initiating the
public health actions required to address these chronic conditions.
3.   In part, these disappointing health conditions reflect the precariousness of health
conditions among the poor. Yet hee other factors directly within the purview of the health
sector also are important contributors. First, policies and practices for the financing and
organiation of services fai to promote cost-effectve use of resources or to encourage
appropriate responses to health problems. Second, a backlog of postponed investment in
physical rehabilitation and equipment hampers the health system's ability to meet patient needs.
Third, excessive centition and bureaucratization in the MSAS create severe internal
inefficiencies and jeopardize responsiveness to clients.
4.    Total public spending on health is equivalent to about 1.2 percent of GDP, a relatively
low level in companson with other Latin American countres at Venezuela's stage of
development. For 1994, it is projected at US$1.85 billion or US$97 per capita  About 55
percent of this amount (or US$54 per capita) is through the MSAS. Public financing for health
comes primarly from the federal level (97 percent in 1990). Because the federa budget is
highly dependent on oil revenues, MSAS spending has been quite unstable from year to year,
and suffered steep declines in real terms over the 1980s. In 1983, it amounted to about US$133
per capita; by 1988, it had fallen to just US$55, and remained at this level through 1990. in
1992, spending though the MSAS budget rose to about US$64 per capita, before faling back
to US$50 in 1993.



2
5.   The public sector finances and provides health care to approximately eighty percent of
the population. The two major public providers serve overlapping population groups without
coordination.- These-are the MSAS and the Venezuelan Social Security Institute (IVSS). The
MSAS is financed from the central govemment budget and theoretically serves the entire
popuation. IVSS, which covers about 25 percent of the population, is financed through payroll
taxes and federal and employer contributions. The MSAS is responsible for epidemiological
surveilance, public health campaigns, food and drug regulation, and health service delivery.
It operates 3,679 ambulatory clinics and 176 -hospitals, accounting for around 56 percent of the
country's bed capacity. The IVSS runs 31 hospitals and 71 health centers.
6.   The inefficiencies of the system are obvious. The MSAS operates nine different types
of health facilities, yet distinctions in the services they provide are blurred in practice. Despite
the wide range of facflities, important gaps exist in the services available and patients often seek
treatment for simple ailments from sophisticated tertiary hospitals. Even though patients remain
in hospitals longer than medically necessary, the average hospital bed occupancy rate is below
60 percent; there are more than two doctors for every nurse, as compared to the normal 24
nurms per doctor; and many hospitals and clinics lack basic drugs and supplies and require that
patie-nts purchase these on their own.
7.    When public spending on health dropped in the 1980s, so did spending on infrastructure,
equipment and maintenance. MPny basic hospital systems, such as water supply, solid and
liquid waste disposal, and electricity are damaged. Others such as fire prevention systems are
non-existent. Equipment problems are frequent. MSAS norms for building and equipment
management have not been updated since the 1970s. MSAS does not have a policy for
equipment replacement.
8.   The excessive centralization in the MSAS's management of financial, human and physical
resources limits responsiveness to local needs and makes the system slow to change. Budgets
are centrally allocated, giving facility managers little authority to adjust inputs for greater
effectiveness. Health services, endemic disease control, construction and rehabilitation of
facilities, and procurement and maintenance of equipment are centrally managed. The more than
100,000 health personnel whose contracts are based on national union negotitons do not have
adequate incentives to respond to local supervisors. States have little influence on health
program priorities.
9.    To address the the problems highlighted above, the Government of Venezuela is
embarking on a process of health reform that includes streamining the MSAS, transferring
responsibility for managing health services to states, and rationalizing service delivery by
strengthening lower-level facilities. The proposed project would support this process by
developing and implementing new policies and practices for organizing and financing health
services; strengthening local capacity to plan and implement health services; and rehabilitating
physical plant and replacing equipment in the network of government clinics and hospitals. A
complementary Inter-American Development Bank proposed project will support this process by
stremlining the central MSAS organization and functions. The Decentralization Law of 1990



3
already provides the legal framework for transfeimng mnagement of services from the centra
to state govenments. Within this framework, the MSAS is gradually devolving respon ity
to states on a voluntary basis. Since 1993, when the first decentalizaonagreement was signed,
eleven states have entered into such accords with the MSAS. Under these agreements, the states
receive resources direcdy from the national government and allocate them to finince health
services in addition to mobiling their own resources. Within the famework of national health
policy, states will develop their own health plans and pro s. Despite pogress on the legal
front, the actual trasfer of esonsibilites to the states has proceeded slowly. In large part, this
is because the fderda govemment is still developing the mechanism for covering the cost of the
accumulated social benefits of government health workers to be rmsignd  to the stats. In-
addition, some groups witin the sector (e.g. unions and mid-level officials whose functions
would be decentralized) have interests in delaying the transfer.
Relationship of Project to Bank Country Assisance Strategy
10.  The Bank's assistance strategy for Venezuela, disussed at the Board on November 4,
1993, is to support policies and investments that will reduce public sector imbalances, encourage
private sector economic activities and improve the effectiveness of social progams. In the
social sectors, the emphasis is on increasing the efficiency of public spending, supporting private
sector delivery of services, and targeting basic education, health and nutrition activities to the
poor. The proposed project is filly consistent with this statgy, by assisting the government
to improve the efficiency and quality of health services that benefit mainly low-income
households.
11.   Te Bank has supported other initiatives of the Venezuelan Government in recent years
in the health sector. By strengthening the goverment health care delivery system, this project
would complement and reinforce those ongoing efforts. The poverty auleviation program
(Programa para EfrtenmWeno de la Pobreza), strted in 1989, aims to bring a range of
services to the poor; an integral part of the program is the Social Development Project (Ln.
3270-VE, FY91) for maternal and child health and nutrition and day care services. Declining
coverage and effectiveness of vector-bome disease control efforts are also being revesed thrugh
the recently-signed Endemic Disease Control Project aLn. 3538-VE, FY93).
12.   The World Bank is well placed to assist Venezuela, because of its broad and rapidly
growing eperience with health sector   fm in deveoping countries. The Bank's analytical
work, as summarized in the 1993 World Development Report on health, and its support for
health projects in other countries address the issues of financing and orgatization which lie at
the heart of the proposed project.
Project Objective and Description
13. The proposed Health Services Reform Project aims to improve the health of the 3 million
users of government health services in the states of Aragua, Falc6n, TrujiLo and Zulia. Toward
this goal, the project will help the Government to: (a) redefine key govenment health policies



4
related to the orgnizaton - and fiancing of health services; () promote decentalization by
building the capacity of the four states and their respective health facilities to plan and manae
health care in a decentalized framework; and (c) enhance- the quality and efficiency of
govemment health services by rlating plant and rephcing basic equipment in ambulatory
clinics and hospitals. Te project is also expected to make a contribution to poverty alleviation
by improving the access of poor Venezuelans to good quality health care services.
14.  The proect would be implemented in the states of Ar4gua, Falc6n, Trujllo and Zulia.
These states were selected because they are at advanced stages in the decentralization process.
Implementation would begin in Falcdn, where pepartion is most advanced. - The project would
expand into the other states as each prepars a satisftory multi-year health plan and an annual
investment poposal for project financing. The project may extend limited support in traimng
to other states fron the outset.
IS.   The prqect consists of three components: (a) Policy Analysis and Reform; (b)
Institutional Development; and (c) Strengthening of Health Service Delivery:
(a)   Polic  Analysis and Reform. (Five percent of the base cost, US$4.5 m). This
component wil support seminars, studies and the development and implementation of pilot
experiments oriented toward redefining key health policies related to the financing and
organizaion of government health services. This component will also support the formulation
of action plans for introducing changes in hospital autonomy, health care fnance and the service
delivery model in the four states on the basis of studies and pilot experiments. The component
will concentrate on three importnt areas: (i) increasing hospital autonomy; (ii) rationalizing the
service delivery model; and (iii) improving health financing and introducing performance-related
contracts. Related to these studies, it will support other policy initiatives, including the
development of a proposal for resolving problems in the delivery of health services in the capital
city of Caracas and an assessment of health information needs and initiaves in the sector, both
important concerns of the IMSAS.
(b)   Istitutional Development. cTwenty five percent of the base cost, US$23.7 m). This
component will build capacity at the state and facility level to manage health care by providing
in-service management training to 5300 staff of state health directorates, district health offices,
hospitals and ambulatory clinics; by developing systems for them to manage finances, human
resources, strategic planning, materials, maintenance, waste disposal and health information; by
providing them with the computer support to carry out these functions; and by supporting them
with studies and technical assistance for specific institutional development projects they identify.
The complementary IDB proposed project (US$150 million loan) would support institutional
development to strengthen the capacity of the central MSAS to provide leadersip to, set
standards for and regulate all actors in the health sector, both public and private.
(c)   Strngthenlg of Health Service Deliery. (Seventy percent of the base cost, US$66.0).
This component will improve the quality and efficiency of government health services in the four
states by rehabilitating 427 ambulatory clinics and 4 hospitals and replacing basic equipment in
these facilities.



Pruject Costs and Jicing
16.  The total cost, net of taxe, is estimated at US$108 million equivalent, with a forign
xchange component of US$42.9 million or about 40 percent of the total. The prosed Bank
loan of US$54 million would finance SO percent of total estmated costs. The Bank loan would
finamce 100 percent of foreign  change costs and 17 percent of local expenditures. The loan
would provide up t US$1.0 million equivalent as reimbursement of eligible retoacdve project
expenditures. A breakdown of costs and the finacing plan are shown in Schedule A. The
financing by the Bank of local costs under the project is Justified by the project's poverty focus.
Amounts and methods of procurement and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B.
A Utmetable of key project processing events and the stu of Bank Group  ations in
Venezuela ate given in Schedules C and D), respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report No.
13474-VE dated November 9, 1994, also is being circulated.
Project  le etation
17.  The project would be implementd over a period of five years. At the nafional level, the
project would be managed by a Project Coordination Unit (PCU) of the MSAS that has been
entrusted with responsibility for oveseeing special projects. The PCU would handle overall
plnning, monitoring, and resolution of major implementaion problems for the both the World
Bank and IDB-funded projects.  It would report to the lending agencies and process
reimbursements from the two extemal loans.  It would also be direcdy responsible for
implementation of the Policy Analysis and Reform component, and would allocate the project
funds for institutional development, training and fality upgrding to tfie project states on an
annual basis. To do so, it would laise with the relevant MSAS headquarts depaents and
states. A project steering committe composed of the Minister of Health and the state Govemors
would review and approve annual project plms and budgets. An operationa committee
comprsed of the PCU coordinator and the Regional Health Directors would monitor oveall
project progress. At the state level, a project team within the Regional Health Directorate would
implement the Institutional Development and the Strengthening of Health Service Delivery
components. The Government is seeking the assistance of a procurement agent for most goods
and services.
Lesons from Previous Bank livolvement
18. A review of Bank-financed health projects, particularly those which have supported major
sector reform, yields important lessons. First, it is important to have a declaration of
government health policy early on. Second, the Bank and Government should carry out joint
annual reviews of progress in order to modify project design and realocate resources to meet
changing needs. Third, in projects which support decentralization, it is important to obtain
ageement between the central government and states on the reform program as a way of
confirming commitment to shared objectives. Finally, decentrzed execution of civil works can
be an effective vehicle for building local capacity. Bank experience with projects in Venezuela
suggest it is also important to addre  procurement issues early on and develop detailed



6
implementation plans during prepation. Each of these leswns is reflected in the- design of the
pd procL
Agreed Actions
19.  At negotiations, assuraces weobtained at the Govermment would: (a) conduct a
review of p_lminary fidings of policy studies by January 15, 1996, and agre on pilot
experiments to test reforms; O) prepare amual progress reports by February 28 of each year
beginning in 1995 and conduct joint annual reviews with the Bank by March 31 of each year
begping in 1995 on progre on-project implementao and the action plan; (c) agree an a plan
of action for introducing changes in the organiztion and financing of services in the four states
by June 30, 1997; (d) implement saifctory proect auditng agements; and (f) maintain a
Project Coordinating Unit and opert a project steering committee and a project operational
committee.
20.   The following would be conditons of effectivenes of the proposed loan: (a) the PCU
wil have formally established and the nadonal suprvisors of the twree components will have
been appointed with terms of reference and qualifications acceptable to the Bank;, (b) the transfer
of health services, including pesnnel, budget and property, from MSAS to the states of Falcdn
and Agua will have taken place; (c) the Government will have signed participation agreements
satsfatory to the Bank with the states of Falc6n and Aragua, and each of the states has
employed a coordiao to mwage project activities under the responsibility of the respective
state; (d) the Government will have signed an agreement with a procurement agent to assist in
in the procurement of goods and services for the Policy Analysis and Reform component and
for the Management Systems under the Instituonal Development component; (e) the final
version of the project Operating manual acceptable to the Bank will have been approved; and (f)
the Opational Committee will have formally estabLished.
21.  For disbursement for basic management training, the Govremment will have igned an
agreement with a pr  ent agent to assist in the procurement of services. Conditions for
disbursement on behalf of any project state would be that the state will have signed a
partcipay agreemnt with the Ministry of Health satisfactory to the Bank. For stexecuted
complementary training, physica rehabilitaion and equipment, a further condition would be that
the state wil have Signed a Decentalizion Agreement (Convemo de DescenJalzaddn
Descenwaca6n) satisfactory to the Bank for the transfer of health services. For state-eecuted
physical ehi  on and equipment, a further condition would be the recipt by the Bank of
an acceptable timebound progrm  for this taner. For equipment prwision, the state would
also be required to have signed an agreement with a procumet agent to assst in the
procurement of goods. For aU disbursements in or behalf of Trujillo or Zulia after June 30,
1997, the state wil be required to have met all the above conditions.

Pogram Objectve Categories
22.  Withn the broad category of human resource developen, the prects objectives are
to promote more effective population, health and nutrition policies and to reduce poverty. Ihe
opation targets the poor by strengthenig te goverrnment health serices which they use
disproportionately and by senring areas of the country where the incidence of poverty is above
average.
Envrolnmental Impact
23.  This project has been given an environmental assessment catgory B. The proect wil
have a beneficial impact on the environment in three ways. Pirst, the project will Introduce
substantial improvements in the handling of hospital and clinic waste and wi}l correct current
practices of releasing laboratory chemicals, other toxic materials and organic waste into
municipal refuse systems.  Waste management measures will be incorporated into aUl
rehabilitation works. The project also will contribute to improving the envimnment by replacing
outdated, inefficient equipment manufactured an estimated 20 years ago with equipment desined
in an age of greater environmental awareness. The Bank will encourage the selection and
financing of equipment with lower power consumption requirements, better safety features and
greater use of less toxic oonsumable materials. The project will also have a favorable
environmental impact through the rehabilitation of civil works, where malfimcng or
inopeative basic systems for water, electricity and air conditioning will be repaired and/or
replaced. This is expected to improve water quality and reduce environmental pollution. All
demolition work for the physical rehabilitation will be carried out using measures to mitigate the
impact of asbestos release.
Benefits, Risks and Sustaiability
24.   Benefits. The project is expected to contribute to important gains in the health sts of
3 million users of govemment health services in the four stats. The project also would genert
benefits in terms of higher quality and greater intemal efficiency of ambulatofy clinic and
hospital servces. Improvements would be measured through a limited number of carefuly
chosen indicators, including the level of hospital infections, the average length of patient stay
and bed occupancy rates in selected hospitals. A baseline survey would be conducted to
establish pre-project levels for comparison with levels followmg project execution. Thes would
be determined on the basis of a project evaluation study. A disprportionately high share of
project benefits are expected to accrue to the poor. They are the most adversely affected by
current health service shortcomings because they have the least ability to seek alterntiave sources
of care. Finally, Venezuela would benefit from the development of health policy analysis skills
in the Ministry of Health and from increased capacity to plan and manage health services at the
state and district levels. This capacity-building effort would be measured most direcdy by
monitorng the training, technical assistance and organizational development activities under the
project



N~~~~~
25.  RIsks. The project facek two pincipal risks. The first i that the de ation of the
health sector will slow down or stall because of lack of financing for accumubed staff social
benefits or oposition from cenUlist politicians or groups that have an interest in maintaning
the saus quo (especaly unions represntg public sector phydcians and other health workers
and MSAS officials). This risk would be minimized by workdng with a small number of saes
which are leadig the decnaization      and by insisting oan a timebound program fr the
transfer to the states of decision-mag audoity and budget resources as a condidon of
-disbursement for the rhabilitaton and basic equipment component. in addition, the project
would allow for the substitution of otier states if any of the states selected no longer has a
asonable chance of completingtrae fer of health servces during the project iplementtion
period. The project would aLso finance a public relatons progam to inform public opinion and
incrase support for changes in the financing and ornizaton of vices. Ihe second isk is
Xt weak public sector capacty at central and state leavels will delay proect execution. This risk
would be mitgated by focusing activities on a handful of stes with the sngest politcal
backing for decentralaion, taining staff to assume greater levels of rewsponsibility, and relying
heavily on proc t agencies for procurement services and on the private sector for a wide
rnge of other services (architectural, construction, training and maagement consulting) under
the project.
26.   Sustainability. By increasing the capacity of the states to plan and manage their health
sevices, the project would increase the institudonal sustainability of the government health
system. By restricting the numbers of new health personnel to those rquired to staff the
expanded state health diectrates and district health offices and by limiting the ugading of
fcilities to exsting hospitals and clinics, the proposed project would also be financially
sustainable. Current estimates suggest that the incremental recurrent costs assocated with the
prject would amount to 0.1 percent of government health spending in recent years.
Recomendation
32.   I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the
Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
