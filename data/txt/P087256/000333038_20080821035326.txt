F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objectives (from Program Document)

(i)Sustain and accelerate economic growth and broaden its impact:              Reducing
income poverty is one of the key focus areas of the MKUKUTA. Private sector and rural
development are the two areas where reforms are expected to have the biggest impact on
reducing income poverty in Tanzania. Reforms in the areas of agricultural and rural
development are intended to improve producer incentives and raise agricultural
profitability and thus enhance incomes in rural areas, where poverty is most widespread
and most deeply entrenched. Measures include improving export crop quality, reducing
marketing cost and the tax burden on farmers and improving access to markets and
finance. With respect to private sector development, the focus will be on strengthening
of the business environment, in particular for SMEs, and legal and administrative reforms
to enhance the functioning of land, credit, and labor markets.

(ii) Support results orientation of public service delivery: The second area of impact
is through monitoring and leveraging progress in the implementation of sectoral
programs to reduce poverty, covering the priority sectors identified in the first Poverty
Reduction Strategy (PRS), i.e., primary education, basic health, water, rural roads,
agricultural research and extension, the judiciary, and HIV/AIDS. The PRSC-3 policy
dialogue focuses on the establishment of a robust monitoring and evaluation system that
allows an assessment of the impact and results of sectoral programs. The information
derived from the monitoring and evaluation system will then feed into the assessment of
progress towards the MKUKUTA objectives. Finally, the resources provided through the
PRSC-3 complement government and other donor resources in financing priority
programs for poverty reduction. The well developed participatory Public Expenditure
Review and Medium Term Expenditure Framework (PER-MTEF) process provides a
mechanism for the monitoring of the use of resources.

(iii) Enhance public sector performance: Measures in this area will have a direct
impact on poverty reduction as they enhance public sector capacity to implement poverty
reduction programs in the priority sectors and generate additional funds for poverty
reduction by reducing leakages in the form of low allocative or operational efficiency of
public expenditures. Key areas of reform include strengthening of financial management
through the implementation of the public financial management reform program,
strengthening of the national audit office, implementation of pay reform coupled with
improved performance management in the public sector, procurement reform, the
implementation of anti-corruption strategies, and enhanced efficiency in the use of
development assistance.
(iv) Strengthen environmental management:             Finally, the PRSC-3 also supports
government's efforts to enhance the environmental sustainability of Tanzania's
development program. The MKUKUTA identifies this as an important element of efforts
to improve the quality of life and social well-being.

Revised Program Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)

Note on the results-framework

The Development Objective indicators presented below apply to the whole medium-term
program of three PRSC as laid out in the PRSC 1 program document. The program PDO
are recorded under the PRSC 1 box below, while the PRSC 2 and 3 boxes are left void.
Intermediary indicators were not laid out in PRSC 1, and a list was devised under PRSC2
and 3, but never really owned by government. Therefore, only the intermediary indicators
which are system generated are reported.

To assess the PRSC1-3 according to the new ICR standards, a results framework based
on the current specifications had to be retro-fitted. This has entailed certain choices as to
the selection of specific PDO indicators, extrapolating from the relevant sections in the
PRSC 1 document, as well as the adjustment to certain elements of the results framework
that were not fully aligned with the current standards. In particular, in order to measure
the impact of the program, the ICR uses, for flow variables, three-year average of the
indicator over the program period with a one year lag, while for stock variable, it uses
values achieved after the end of the program period. For the baseline values to be
comparable, it uses for flow variables, three-year average for the period preceding the
program. This may contradict at times the baseline indicated in the PRSC documents, but
given the volatility inherent in single year figures, and the need to consistently compare
the baseline with the achieved target value, the use of three-year averages for flow
variables is considered most consistent and sound.

The PDO retained for the series of programmatic PRSC1-3 have been structured to cover:
(i) the overarching objective of the PRSC1-3, (ii) PDOs under the specific pillars of the
PRSC1-3 program (with the exception of pillar 2 and 4, where it proved excessively
complex to define a good PDO indicator).

evaluations carried out jointly by the donors involved in the Poverty Reduction Budget
Support group (PRBS), in particular the "Joint Evaluation of General Budget Support
Tanzania 1995 ­ 2004" of November 2004, and the PRBS Annual Review Reports for
FY 2003, 2004 and 2005. It also incorporates the findings of the simplified ICRs for
PRSC 1 and 2. It introduces new elements to the assessment only in as much new
information has become available since the joint reports were prepared.


1.1 Context at Appraisal
(brief summary of country macroeconomic and structural/sector background, rationale
for Bank assistance)

Starting in the late 1980s, but implemented with vigor mainly since the mid-l990s,
Tanzania carried out a broad structural and social reform agenda. After the initial
objectives of macrostabilization and removal of key distortions in the economy had been
attained, reforms focused on improving economic governance, providing an enabling
environment for private sector activities, and enhancing public service delivery for
poverty reduction. As a consequence of its strong performance, Tanzania gained access to
irrevocable debt relief by reaching the completion point under the enhanced HIPC
Initiative in December 2001.

Tanzania's macroeconomic performance improved during the second half of 90s, with
GDP growth reaching on average almost 4 percent per annum, and picked up further to
5.1 percent in 2000, 6.2 percent in 2001, and 7.2 percent in 2002.

It does not appear from the best available data that the incidence of income poverty fell
significantly between the early 1990s and 2000/01. The national poverty headcount
declined from about 38 percent to 35 percent. However, because the 1991/92 survey had
a small sample size and the 2000/01 survey had some sampling issues, that difference is
within the margin of error for the two surveys and, therefore, we cannot conclude that
poverty declined. It was only in Dar es Salaam that the measured change was statistically
significant, reducing the proportion of those in poverty from 28 to 18 per cent. The lack
of real progress on poverty in the 90s was due mainly to 2 factors: the lackluster growth
performance in the first half, and the concentration of growth in Dar es Salaam in the
later 90s. Poverty in Tanzania was therefore still at unacceptably high levels and the
HIV/AIDS pandemic posed a major threat to the achievements made on all fronts.

The programmatic series of PRSC 1 to 3 were build on previous reforms undertaken by
the United Republic of Tanzania with the aim of supporting the implementation of
Tanzania's Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS). The first PRSC covering FY03 would



                                            1

deepen the reform agenda defined under the Programmatic Structural Adjustment Credit
(PSAC) and lay the ground for attacking income poverty more aggressively through at
least two further single-tranche PRSCs covering FY04 and FY05. The switch from a
PSAC to a PRSC also addresses several lessons learned during the implementation of the
PSAC. Key among these is the adoption of a single tranche, an ex-post conditionality
framework, which avoids uncertainty in disbursement linked to within-year conditionality.

Tanzania launched the participatory PRS process in 1999 with the preparation of an
interim PRS, followed by the approval of a full PRS in 2000 (PRS1), covering FY02 to
04, which was then extended through progress report in the following two fiscal year,
until a new PRSP became effective in FY07. The programmatic series of PRSC1-3 did
overlap only for two year with the original time span of the PRS1 (one year in terms of
disbursement, since they are ex-post instruments). This is most evident in the dating of
the PRS1 target year for indicators which is 2003, i.e. the period covered by the second
PRSC.

The PRSC1-3 were the first policy lending instruments fully integrated in a harmonized
donor support mechanism, the Poverty Reduction Budget Support (PRBS), established in
October 2001 by 9 DPs. The principles of PRBS were a single assessment process and a
unified performance assessment process, from which all DPs would draw their policy
matrix and result framework. The motivation for this effort derives from the clear desire
of both GoT and the development partners to ensure that all operations adopt:

    · a clear poverty focus guided by the homegrown PRS,
    · coherence in policy dialogue at cross-cutting levels and in sector wide programs,
    · enhanced efficiency in policy dialogue and performance assessment and
    · enhance flexibility and predictability of resource flows.

The Performance Assessment Framework (PAF)/Policy matrix, including the set of prior
actions and triggers for PRSC1-3 was developed in close cooperation with the
government, the PRBS donors and the Bank.

1.2 Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

(i) Sustain and accelerate economic growth and broaden its impact: Reducing
income poverty is one of the key focus areas of the MKUKUTA. Private sector and rural
development are the two areas where reforms are expected to have the biggest impact on
reducing income poverty in Tanzania. Reforms in the areas of agricultural and rural
development are intended to improve producer incentives and raise agricultural
profitability and thus enhance incomes in rural areas, where poverty is most widespread
and most deeply entrenched. Measures include improving export crop quality, reducing
marketing cost and the tax burden on farmers and improving access to markets and
finance. With respect to private sector development, the focus will be on strengthening
of the business environment, in particular for SMEs, and legal and administrative reforms
to enhance the functioning of land, credit, and labor markets.




                                             2

(ii) Support results orientation of public service delivery: The second area of impact
is through monitoring and leveraging progress in the implementation of sectoral
programs to reduce poverty, covering the priority sectors identified in the first Poverty
Reduction Strategy (PRS), i.e., primary education, basic health, water, rural roads,
agricultural research and extension, the judiciary, and HIV/AIDS. The PRSC-3 policy
dialogue focuses on the establishment of a robust monitoring and evaluation system that
allows an assessment of the impact and results of sectoral programs. The information
derived from the monitoring and evaluation system will then feed into the assessment of
progress towards the MKUKUTA objectives. Finally, the resources provided through the
PRSC-3 complement government and other donor resources in financing priority
programs for poverty reduction. The well developed participatory Public Expenditure
Review and Medium Term Expenditure Framework (PER-MTEF) process provides a
mechanism for the monitoring of the use of resources.

(iii) Enhance public sector performance: Measures in this area will have a direct
impact on poverty reduction as they enhance public sector capacity to implement poverty
reduction programs in the priority sectors and generate additional funds for poverty
reduction by reducing leakages in the form of low allocative or operational efficiency of
public expenditures. Key areas of reform include strengthening of financial management
through the implementation of the public financial management reform program,
strengthening of the national audit office, implementation of pay reform coupled with
improved performance management in the public sector, procurement reform, the
implementation of anti-corruption strategies, and enhanced efficiency in the use of
development assistance.

(iv) Strengthen environmental management: Finally, the PRSC-3 also supports
government's efforts to enhance the environmental sustainability of Tanzania's
development program. The MKUKUTA identifies this as an important element of efforts
to improve the quality of life and social well-being.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes


2.1 Program Performance (supported by a table derived from a policy matrix)

Overall program performance, as described in the PAF, has generally been sound, with
broad-based progress on most fronts, as reported in the General Budget Support Annual
Review reports for FY 03, 04 and 05, as well as in the ICRs for PRSC1 and 2. Two main
areas of the program have shown less than anticipated progress: anti-corruption, and crop
board reform, the latter issue prompting a reduction in the amount of PRSC3 by US$ 25
million. Those 2 issues were certainly difficult ones, since as of April 2007, crop board
reform is still in the works, and a new anti-corruption law is still in discussion in
parliament.

2.2 Major Factors Affecting Implementation:


Government ownership of the program and its commitment to the joint PRBS process
have been strong, and a key factor ensuring prompt implementation. In situation where
delays in the implementation of policy actions occurred, as under PRSC2, the
Government, under leadership of the Ministry of Finance, took swift action to bring back
the program on track.

Domestic political considerations rightly appear to have a dominant influence in the
choice and implementation of reforms, and while the yearly selection of triggers, and the
ex-post nature of financing allow for a more flexible matching of PRSC policy areas with
the government policy choices, there is still considerable scope for divergence.

The capacity of government in policy and planning is limited, with key senior policy staff
lacking strong institutional and technical backing, and being swamped by administrative
tasks. The ability to analyze policy options or convince the political level is therefore
problematic with respect to complex reform agendas, and can sometime lead to hesitation
in implementation, or to unsuccessful policy choice (e.g. in agriculture). In some cases,
this may also have led to misread the real commitment of the Authorities to implement
the reforms under PRSC.


                                                6

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:


Underlying processes for monitoring the PRSCs were the yearly PER process, and the
establishment of a poverty monitoring system that regularly reported on the
implementation of the PRS through yearly Poverty and Human Development Reports.
The specific monitoring of the PRSC was harmonized within the Annual Review process
which involved a mid-term review around March-April and an Annual Review in
October, which included inputs from various parts of government, civil society and the
PRBS donors.

The PRSC results framework was rudimentary by today's standards, and although it has
evolved over the three operations, it still left much to be desired in tracking program
implementation, especially with respect to the ultimate development objectives.


2.4 Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):

The PRSC 1-3 are being followed up by another set of programmatic PRSC that support
the implementation of a second PRS, labeled MUKUKUTA, that was approved in 2005.
PRSC4 was approved by the Board on April 10, 2006, and PRSC5 on April 24, 2007.


3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
(to current country and global priorities, and Bank assistance strategy)

Rating: Highly satisfactory
PRSC1: highly satisfactory; PRSC2: highly satisfactory; PRSC3: highly satisfactory

PRSC1 to 3 were highly relevant to the country's objectives, and to the specific
circumstances of aid coordination in the country. Based on the analysis of poverty trends
in the 90s, the PRSC medium-term framework rightly focused on strong rural growth as a
way to attack poverty, while maintaining strong momentum in the modern economic
sector, through an improved investment climate. It also rightly complemented sectoral
social programs by focusing on result-oriented monitoring, and on the improved
performance of government systems, as another critical condition for productive use of
budget support funding. The focus on Environment, given the high reliance of Tanzania
on natural resources and tourism, was also highly relevant.

The integration of PRSC with the harmonized process for budget support (PRBS) was
also important in implementing the Bank's institutional commitment towards
harmonization, reducing transaction costs for the government, and simplifying policy
dialogue.

3.2 Achievement of Program Development Objectives
(including brief discussion of causal linkages between policy actions supported by operations and outcomes)


The review of the program development objectives covers: (i) the overarching objective
of the PRSC1-3, (ii) the specific evaluation of PDOs under each of the four specific
pillars of the PRSC1-3 program

Overarching objective: Broad-based progress toward achieving the PRS objectives

The PRSC1 program documents states that "Broad-based progress toward achieving the
PRS objectives is the key results area against which the effectiveness of PRSC support
should be judged". The lack of specificity with respect to baseline and target values of
indicators, and of the timing of the objectives in the PRSC1-3 results-framework,
however, makes it difficult to precisely assess the achievements of the program
development objectives. Whether progress or achievement is the key criteria of
evaluation remains therefore ambiguous.

The annual PRSP progress reports and other assessments emanating from the Poverty
Monitoring System all point to significant progresses that have been made with respect to
the overall PRS objectives (a list of indicators covering PRS key indicators was included
in Annex 7 of the PRSC1 program document). The large increase in donor assistance, and
in budget support, accompanied by a significant increase in domestic revenues, has
allowed a rapid expansion of public expenditure in key areas targeted by the PRS, and
has supported broad progress in the underlying indicators towards the PRS objectives.

However, in several critical areas where progress has been realized, such as income
poverty, universal primary education2, or infant and under-five mortality, the country
appears unlikely to come close to achieving the PRS objectives by 2010, or even of the
MDGs by 2015.

Sustain and accelerate economic growth and broaden its impact
The objective of poverty reduction supported by the program was rightly predicated on
an increase in GDP growth in agriculture. That increase, over the implementation period,
has been on target, but overall quite moderate. The role of the policy impulse in
increasing agriculture growth is doubtful. The policy supported by PRSC1-3 was
predicated upon a package of measures to "improve agricultural productivity and
profitability, the key objectives of the Agricultural Sector Development Strategy".
Agricultural growth appears, however, to have been driven mainly by an extension of
cultivated areas rather than increases in land yields, which have been in most cases
declining moderately, in many cases stable, and in a very few cases having impressive
increases. On the policy front, although important achievements in agricultural reforms



2 See Annex 7 for a technical discussion



                                                           8

were achieved under the PRSC1-3 supported program, such as the operationalization of
the new land legislation, reform of microfinance legislation and regulations, removal of
local government `nuisance' taxes, progress has been slow on some of the key reforms in
the sector, in particular crop board reform which was a key trigger for PRSC, and was
only partially completed under PRSC3 (and not yet fully achieved as of April 2007).

The PRSC1-3 also targeted higher growth in the industrial sector. Industrial growth has
been strong, driven by the mining sector and by manufacturing. The good dynamism of
exports and private investment testify to the solidity of growth in the sector, and it stems
partly from some progress in improving the business environment, which however still
ranks quite low internationally, according to the latest Doing Business rankings.
Significant achievements in this area include the rationalization of the business licensing
regime, including the abolition of licensing fees for small enterprises and the removal of
annual licensing requirements. Revised labor legislation is another important element of
the reforms undertaken as part of Tanzania's efforts to improve the functioning of factor
and product markets. This has led to significant improvement from 2003 to 2005 in the
Doing Business indicators for the cost and capital requirements for opening a business,
although indicators on rigidity of labor or on contract enforcement have not shown any
improvements. It has also led to a positive reform momentum in this area, with Tanzania,
still in low rankings but qualifying as one of the top reformers in 2005/06 Doing Business
report.

The impact of industrial sector growth on overall poverty is however limited, given the
low labor intensity of the mining sector, the still relatively small scale of the
manufacturing sector, and its geographical concentration in the capital area.

More generally, overall growth of 6.8 percent of GDP at market prices during the period
from 2000 to 2005 has been strong. However, increased government spending has been
an important engine of economic growth on the demand side, contributing 3.8 percentage
points to the annual average of 6.8 percent overall GDP growth. The net demand impact
of government spending has been mostly spurred by a large increase in development aid.
It is therefore likely that part of the increase in GDP growth has been driven by the
demand effect of donor financial support, rather than by supply side response to policy
reforms.

Lack of up-to-date poverty data prevents a precise assessment of poverty trends over the
period in consideration. The 2007 Household Budget Survey will allow to have a clearer
picture of poverty by mid 2008. Assessment of poverty trends therefore has to be based
on projections.

Notwithstanding robust GDP growth from 2001 to 2005, growth in per-capita private
consumption may have been quite moderate, due to still large population growth and to
the large increase in the share of investment and public consumption in GDP (data on
private consumption in the National Accounts are uncertain because of a significant
statistical discrepancy). Therefore, the estimated poverty evolution over the PRSC1-3
implementation period, and consequently the projection over the 2010 or 2015 horizon,



                                              9

vary greatly depending on the measure of income used, whether per capita GDP or per
capita private consumption. Given that income poverty is measured on the basis of
household consumption, using per-capita private consumption is the standard accepted
method. Poverty projections for Tanzania using the higher measure, i.e. GDP per capita,
and assuming no significant worsening of income distribution, entail that the projected
per capita GDP growth of rate of 4 percent would result in a decline in poverty to 19
percent by 2010 and to 11 percent by 2015, which would be consistent with achieving
Tanzania's poverty reduction targets. The projection using the more conservative per-
capita private consumption, even with no degradation in income distribution, indicates,
however, that it is highly unlikely that the PRS objective of halving income poverty by
2010 will be reached, and neither the MDG date of 2015 seems attainable. In the event
of worsening distribution, the poverty objectives would be even more difficult to achieve.
The PRSC 1 program document diplomatically stressed the somewhat unrealistic nature
of that objective. On balance, although poverty appears to be on the retreat, it is unlikely
that Tanzania is on a path of sustained poverty reduction close to the levels envisaged by
the PRS, particularly in rural areas where most of the poor are concentrated.

Support results orientation of public service delivery

A regular system of reporting on both the PRS and sectoral outcomes has been introduced
under the Mkukuta Monitoring Master Plan, and with partial exceptions, Tanzania can
now count itself quite well served in terms of the reporting of comparable data on
impacts, while the analysis of those data by the Research and Analysis Working Group
may be considered one of the successes of the Mkukuta Monitoring System.

There remains a serious lack of data on the outputs and outcomes of government services.
The picture may differ between sectors and sub-sectors (e.g. education and health are
positive exceptions) but observations made by informed Tanzanian practitioners and
researchers within and outside of government suggest that administrative data systems
remain weak. More significantly, the analysis of the quality of underlying processes is
consistent with the judgments on the raw numbers. For the purposes of policy making
and monitoring, this is a worrying gap. It is partly being addressed through ongoing work
on strengthening the Mkukuta Monitoring System (MMS) and the Tanzania Statistical
Master Plan (TSMP).

Overall the ability to monitor and understand poverty trends in Tanzania is still weak, due
to low frequency, and limited scope of poverty surveys. At this time, the available
poverty surveys are the two Household Budget Surveys of 1991 and 2000. The latest
HBS was fielded in 2007. The use of household budget surveys rather than more detailed
Household Living Standards Measurement Surveys is a limiting factor. On the positive
hand a number of sectoral surveys, such as the 2001 and 2006 Labor Force Surveys, the
2002 Agricultural Sample Census, the 2003 HIV Indicator Survey, the 2004
Demographic and Health Survey, bring useful, if not fully comparable, data for M&E.

Enhance public sector performance




                                               10

The objective under this pillar was to enhance public sector capacity to implement
poverty reduction programs in the priority sectors and generate additional funds for
poverty reduction by reducing leakages in the form of low allocative or operational
efficiency of public expenditures.

As mentioned earlier, the large increase in access to social services financed through
increased revenue and foreign aid indicates that government systems have been able to
translate higher resources into higher levels of service delivery, in particular in the social
sectors. Citizen satisfaction as measured through Service Delivery Survey has increased
significantly, although around 25 percent of all clients were still dissatisfied with central
government services and 50-75 percent with local government services.

The Pubic Expenditure Review Process, the CFAA, and the IMF's Public Expenditure
Management Annual Assessment and Action Plan (AAP) all document how government
financial management systems have improved over time. The picture is undoubtedly
positive, and the capacity of government institutions to manage public resources has
undoubtedly increased.

There have been significant improvements in technical capacity in areas such as
macroeconomic planning, sector strategic planning and performance budgeting, resulting
from initiatives such as the PRSP, and the MTEF. The PER process has facilitated
improvements in the analysis of budget performance, and has improved the quality of the
overall budget process. However, it is unclear whether the improvements realized in
budgeting are actually having the impact they should have in terms of better spending
decisions across sectors and within sectors. The totality of these reforms does not
amount, necessarily to a change in incentives for spending agencies.

The Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) of 2003 highlighted significant
problems in the procurement systems. Improvements in this area since then have been
significant. A new procurement Act was approved in 2004, and has separated the
regulatory function from the executive function, establishing a regulatory body, the
Public Procurement Regulatory Authority, that started functioning in 2006. The
Procurement function was decentralized to MDAs, and, at the local government,
councilors have been excluded from the bidding process. Although weaknesses remain,
the overall framework has improved considerably.

On public sector management, the government started implementing its pay reform
strategy in the public service. The policy dialogue helped to elevate the dialogue on the
issue of compensation beyond the technical level and to keep the momentum on pay
increases. Although during that period progress in reaching the targets was below
expectation, the focus remained on attracting and retaining key skills, namely
professional, managerial and technical staff. Because of the dialogue under the three
PRSCs, compensation has received high priority on both the political and technical
agenda of government. Listening non-state actors on the performance of the public
service has also become a more regular feature of the dialogue.




                                            11

This progress has translated into a slightly improved perception of overall governance, as
it is captured by the WBI's Worldwide Governance Indicators. However, most of these
indicators show no significant progress between 2003 and 2005 in Tanzania, in particular
with respect to Government effectiveness and control of corruption. On government
effectiveness there has been slow but steady progress until 2004. On the control of
corruption, there had been significant improvement in indicator for the period up to 2003,
but is difficult to attribute the improvement in 2003 to the PRSC 1, since no prior action
for that operation (approved April 2003) dealt directly with the issues, nor was there
much substantive achievements on control of corruption in the broader policy framework
for that operation (PAF) in FY03.

The extent of effective prioritization of public expenditures towards the PRS goals is also
relative. Analysis has shown that while allocation towards PRS priorities in the budget
has increased in absolute terms, in terms of relative share this has not been consistently
the case over the period. In particular, there has been a relative expansion in the
administration sector budget on the recurrent side, whilst the share of the budget going to
local authorities has remained the same. In some sectors, most notably education, there
has been a large increase in administrative overheads.

There are significant deviations between approved budget allocations and actual
expenditures across and within spending agencies, indicating that the priorities articulated
in the budget are not always followed through in terms of expenditures.

There also remains substantial scope for increasing the efficiency of public expenditure.
While a major expansion in the levels of service delivery was achieved, it remains
unclear whether efficiency has improved, as there have been limited changes in the
patterns of expenditure in the sectors. The impression is "more of the same", and that
some key constraints to service delivery have not been addressed, both in terms of
quantity and quality.


Strengthen environmental management

Strengthen environmental management was the fourth pillar of PRSC1-3, although on the
ground impact is difficult to measure because of the lack of definition of impact
indicators and baselines. In terms of intermediate achievements, one should record the
passing of the new National Environmental Management Act, 2004, and the
establishment o f an appropriate institutional framework, which provides the basis for
improved environmental management in the future. There has been increased awareness
of the linkages within the relevant institutions and initiation of policy dialogue between
the Vice President's Office and relevant sectoral ministries having the mandate for
natural resources management. While capacity building for environmental management
and sustainable natural resources management remain challenges, several development
partners and the Bank are providing support to the key government institutions to address
these priorities. There are ongoing discussions regarding the potential for a Sector Wide
Approach for environmental management with an annual environmental review process
in support o f implementing the National Environmental Management Act.

Overall assessment of achievement of Program Development Objectives

On balance, there has been significant progress in the implementation of the PRS,
through the financing of scale-up access to social services within improving government
management systems, although progress on the policy and efficiency front have not been
sufficient to clearly put the country on track to reach its most ambitious PRS objectives.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Ratings: Moderate
PRSC1: Moderate; PRSC2: Moderate; PRSC3: Moderate

The increase in economic growth has been significantly influenced by increased levels of
foreign aid through higher government consumption and investment between 2000-2005.



                                                13

Maintaining GDP growth rates in the order of 7% per year, in the absence of ever
increasing foreign aid, could be problematic and consequently the poverty-reduction
outlook is uncertain.

In the area of rural development and agriculture, which is key to rapid reduction of
poverty, the lack of a dependable and clear policy stance, and the weak record on land
productivity, all point out to risks to the sustainability of the positive achievements in
terms of growth in the sector.

Relatively modest progress in the efficiency of public expenditures and in the quality of
key public services, notwithstanding a big growth in the scale of services and, in access
of the poor (in particular to primary education) mean that the impact of recent
improvement on the well-being, and productivity of the poor might not materialize on a
large scale.


       BOX 1. THE JOINT EVALUATION OF GENERAL BUDGET SUPPORT- TANZANIA 1995 - 2004

                                             SUMMARY AND COMMENTS

Methodology

The evaluation utilised the GBS Evaluation Framework recently approved by the OECD-DAC Evaluation Network.
The Evaluation Framework distinguishes five levels:

·     Level One:     Inputs by GBS Donors.
·     Level Two:     Immediate effects (on the relationship between aid, the national budget and national policy
      processes).
·     Level Three: Outputs (consequent changes in the financing and institutional framework for public spending and
      public policy).
·     Level Four:    Outcomes (interactions between the public sector and the wider economy and society, specifically
      with regard to the proximate determinants of poverty reduction).
·     Level Five:    Impacts (in terms of the empowerment of the poor and the improvement of their real incomes).

This ICR draws on the conclusions mainly under levels 3 to 5.

Synthesis of Conclusions

Notwithstanding the increased rates of GDP growth achieved in recent years in Tanzania, the country is not yet
succeeding in reducing poverty. This is because the structure of growth is skewed towards urban rather than rural areas,
towards mining and services rather than agriculture and towards the richer rather than the poorer. Without significant
policy and institutional changes, this situation is likely to continue.

There is evidence of the sorts of changes required beginning to be put into place. In particular, there have been
important changes to improve the business environment and to improve the administration of justice. Macroeconomic
fundamentals are in place and improvements are being made within the financial sector. GBS has supported these
improvements ­ by providing discretionary resources to facilitate macroeconomic management, by helping to
strengthen the core agencies addressing these issues and by providing a framework for promoting dialogue on these
questions and for exerting pressure for progress. On the other hand, the GBS contribution should not be overstated:
fundamentally, progress has been driven by the internal political commitment to achieving change in these areas.

There are other outcome areas, where GBS is not successfully facilitating such changes. On the policy side, the
constraints on agriculture sector growth remain to be properly addressed. On the service delivery side, while access has
improved, the poor still predominantly fail to use government services and in large part this is due to shortfalls in
efficiency and in quality. Poor service delivery outcomes can in turn be traced back to weaknesses at the output level:
the efficiency of public expenditure remains low, intra-government incentives ­ in particular, the incentives for
improved results, remain weak and the democratic pressure that might drive improvements is substantially absent.

Is it reasonable to assume that GBS ­ perhaps in increased volumes ­ might successfully facilitate change in these areas
in the future ? Clearly not, or at least not without parallel changes to strengthen policy making, budget formulation and
scrutiny, and to improve internal incentives. Such internal changes would be facilitated considerably by a continued




                                                              14

reduction in the number of aid projects and programmes within the public sector.

The Bank PRSC team had a number of comments and reservation on the report which are succinctly reported below. It
was thought that the quality of the assessment to be uneven across the five levels of assessment, with the analysis of
levels four and five much weaker than that of the first three levels.

The report was also deemed to have used a generic evaluation framework for GBS, but without discussion of how the
framework relates to the specific objectives of the PRBS. It was also observed that there is no discussion of the PRBS
objectives in the report and at various places one gets the sense that the PRBS is assessed against objectives that were
never part of the PRBS design.




5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance
(relating to design, implementation and outcome issues)

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
(i.e., performance through lending phase)

Ratings: satisfactory
PRSC1: satisfactory; PRSC2: satisfactory; PRSC3: satisfactory

PRSC1-3 were prepared by the country team with significant contributions from country
office staff which played a crucial role in both substance (by providing local knowledge)
and contribution (coordination with Government, donors and HQ). Under the direction of
a proactive Country Director (based in the country office), the team has continued to
strive to support Tanzania in the implementation of its poverty reduction strategy.

The Bank team had to face some of the trade-offs implied by the harmonization
framework. The 2004 ICA for instance made clear the critical constraint represented by
the energy sector, but it proved difficult to convince the other partners to introduce this
policy area in the policy matrix.

The Bank showed both flexibility and resolve in dealing with delay or shortfall in
program implementation. With both PRSC2 and PRSC3, the Bank delayed appraisal to
allow government to fully implement its program under the credit, and for PRSC3 the
Bank decided to cut the credit amount as a result of lack of satisfactory implementation in
one of the key program areas.

(b) Quality of Supervision
(including M&E arrangements)

Ratings: satisfactory

PRSC1: satisfactory; PRSC2: satisfactory; PRSC3: moderately satisfactory

Supervision of these operations was carried out with a high level of government
involvement and leadership and harmonization with a group of 12 donors, using a



                                                            15

common performance assessment framework and a joint review process. In this context,
the Bank's multisectoral team sustained a high-level and intense dialogue with the
government and other development partners.

The detailed PAF underpinning the first three PRSCs has, however, led to a greater focus
on whether actions contained in the PAF have been completed or not, with relatively less
dialogue on results and limited flexibility to acknowledge changing priorities or strategies.

There may have however been insufficient focus on the implementation through public
expenditures of the policy supported by PRSC1-3. The PER process which initially
supported a strong substantive dialogue between the Government, the Bank and other
Development Partners has become more process-oriented, and gradually weakening into
more of a routine activity.

Regarding the partial completion of the crop board reform benchmark, which lead to a
reduction of USD 25 million of the PRSC 3 amount, the Bank built a solid dialogue by
carrying out a PSIA that was widely discussed and led to a good understanding with
government on specific reform needs, while underscoring continued differences in a few
areas. Although the government demonstrated its commitment by starting to implement
key PSIA recommendations, a downward adjustment of the loan amount came in
response to partial achievement of the policy benchmark. This was a measured response
to the partial policy achievement, with the size of the reduction reflecting the relevance of
the reforms in the overall program. The Bank may have underestimated the political
economy complications of such reform and consequently, the time required to develop
constituencies for change.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Ratings: satisfactory
PRSC1: satisfactory; PRSC2: satisfactory; PRSC3: moderately satisfactory

Solid institutional arrangements for preparation and supervision of the PRSC operations
with key leadership from the Government, and a high level of harmonization with other
Development Partners providing budget support have resulted in overall good
performance by the Bank.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance

Ratings: Satisfactory
PRSC1: satisfactory; PRSC2: satisfactory; PRSC3: moderately unsatisfactory

The Government of the United Republic of Tanzania played an active role in the
preparation of the Credits, under the direction of the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry
of Finance, and the sense of program ownership was strong among the government
officials. Reflecting this strong ownership, government implementation of the program


                                             16

was effective and satisfactory. The Government of Tanzania was proactive in meeting the
requirements called for by the Credit, although delay in program implementation
occurred under PRSC 2 led to a postponement of appraisal and negotiations to allow for
more time to complete the prior-actions.

Under PRSC 3, timing was extended to allow for completion of the prior actions, but
eventually resulted in the prior action on crop boards not being met. The GoT was
committed to address the issues of the enabling environment in agriculture and engaged
positively with the Bank on the PSIA and follow up dialogue. It, however, committed to a
course of action on which it was unable to deliver. In subsequent years, it actively
engaged in an approach that gave more attention to the stakeholder process, and covered
all crop boards at the same time, rather than the previous, more selective approach. This
demonstrates both the government's persistence and reflects the complexity of the issues
and the ability of the government to learn from, and build on, partially successful
approaches.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Ratings: Satisfactory
PRSC1: satisfactory; PRSC2: satisfactory; PRSC3: satisfactory

The Ministry of Finance under the direction of the Senior Permanent Secretary
coordinated PRBS donors, including the Bank, and monitored the policy program
underpinning the PRSC1-3. MoF took the lead in trying to remedy slow implementation
by line ministries. The MoF was generally effective in doing so, although there is a sense
that in some instances, intervention could have occurred earlier in the process and that a
more continuous monitoring of the program in difficult areas might have been warranted.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Ratings: Satisfactory
PRSC1: satisfactory; PRSC2: satisfactory; PRSC3: moderately satisfactory

The strong program ownership by the government at large, and the effective leadership of
the ministry of Finance as the implementing agency, notwithstanding occasional
slippages, supports an overall satisfactory rating of borrower performance.

6. Lessons Learned
(both operation-specific and of wide general application)

Government ownership of the reform agenda is the single most important factor
determining the success of reforms. The performance assessment framework has proven
useful for the monitoring of reforms, but linking disbursement decisions to specific
actions has been a two edged sword. While in some cases this has helped to accelerate the
pace of reaching a specific milestone, in other instances, the processes of dialogue and
conditionality have become closely interwoven, crowding out the space for a
dispassionate, objective and non-committal sharing of views.




                                              17

The focus on a large number of actions contained in the PAF may also have reduced the
strategic focus of the budget support. There appears to be a tension between broad-based
progress, which is necessary to ensure improvements of government institutions and
systems, and more focused policy dialogue to align PRSC with the critical bottlenecks to
growth and poverty reduction.

More focus on public expenditure efficiency and effectiveness, and implementation of
policy through the budget may be required. This may require a significant revamping of
the PER process, to bring it back to supporting effective and timely dialogue on key
budget priorities between the government and the DPs.

On agricultural policy, or other complex issues which are critical to the achievement of
the poverty-reduction objective, the Bank might also need to provide a higher degree of
resources and attention. Sustainable achievements on economic growth will also depend
on more incisive structural improvements on the supply-side to boost competitiveness
and private consumption. Greater focus by the Bank on these, and some other key issues,
is potentially easier in the current harmonization framework, where the follow-up on the
broader agenda through the PAF is ensured. The issue of focus was raised repeatedly in
ROC meetings.

The policy dialogue related to the PAF has not been accompanied by a significant
extension of the scope of domestic accountability, and it has remained a dialogue
between government and a group of donors, with little direct input from other
stakeholders. This underlines the importance of linking PRSC support more strongly to
domestic processes as a means to support government accountability to local stakeholders.

Following PRSC3, the wider PRBS group undertook an extensive redesign of budget
support, in part drawing on experience with the earlier operations. There were three main
elements of the redesign. First was to ensure a better match between the coverage of the
PAF and the MKUKUTA ­ this element led to the widening of sector coverage in the
PAF, removing some of the difficulties the Bank encountered in the earlier PRSC's over
inclusion of key sectors such as energy. Second was a simplification of the PAF,
including a drastic reduction in the total number of elements in the PAF from in excess of
one hundred to not more than thirty. Thirdly, the review process was redesigned to draw
as much as possible on national processes, open to domestic stakeholders, such as sector
reviews and the annual PER process.

Following PRSC operations also improved on the quality and specificity of the results
framework to allow a better tracking of the program effectiveness.

      Annex 5. Comments of Cofinanciers and Other Partners/Stakeholders

Comments from KfW:

General

1. The design of the PRSC accurately reflects Tanzania's development needs. Fully in
line with Paris Agenda, it is fully integrated in the multi-donor Poverty Reduction Budget
Support structure. This safeguards a harmonised conduct by Development Partners and a
reduction of transactions costs. It also ensures valuable input by the World Bank to
support the Government of Tanzania to implement the MKUKUTA effectively and to
further strengthen the budget support instrument jointly with other budget support donors.

2.   The German Government through KfW co-finances the World Bank's PRSC
programme. This co-financing arrangement has proven to be mutually beneficial. The
collaboration between the World Bank Task Team Leader and Members and KfW's
Programme Manager has been exceptional and should be commended.

Specific Comments

3. PER / MTEF: The ICR Report rightly contains several references to the PER and
MTEF process (p. 3, 11, 15f). However, it should be pointed out more explicitly that this
process has not improved over the years. To the contrary, a worrisome deterioration can
be noted. Ownership and credibility of the MTEF seems to be increasingly weak. The
PER dialogue has not been effective for some time.

4. Major Factors Affecting Implementation (p. 6): We agree that limited capacity may
have led to slow or even stalling reform implementation. However, vested interests and a
lack of political will may also have contributed to implementation delays in some areas
(e.g. anti-corruption activities, pay reform in particular allowances).

5. Achievement of Program Development Objectives: "Broad-based progress
towards achieving the PRS objective" (p. 8): In light of the last Household Budget
Survey having been published in 2001, it is open to discussion whether income poverty
has indeed decreased. (NB: In this context the Ugandan example may be noted where
despite robust growth rates the 2003 HBS reported an increase in income poverty.).
Taking into account the lack of current data, we would exert caution with respect to
quoting reduced income poverty as an example for progress.

6. Lessons Learned: Redesign of the PAF: Further efforts are required to enhance
credibility of temporary process actions as well as outcome indicators, i.e. their
outcomes/ results need to be measurable, assessed annually and realistic (achievable
within a year also taking into account the political willingness to do so).

Annex 7. Technical Annex on primary education and income poverty

Education

To date the impact of Primary Education Development Program has been assessed using
administrative data. It demonstrates a large increase in net and gross primary school
enrollment, the former increasing from 58% in 1999 to 96% in 2004. Using data collected
from the families from which school going children originate allows verifying the results
reported based on administrative data and permits to assess who, rich or poor, benefited
most from the introduction of universal primary education.

From October 2004 to February 2005 a nationally (and regionally) representative
Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) was implemented by the National Bureau of
Statistics. This survey collected, amongst others, information about the educational
attainment of household members aged 5 years and above, current schooling attendance
for those aged 5-24 years and collected information about asset ownership. The latter has
been used to construct an index of household wealth. Consequently it is possible to
consider school attainment by wealth class. A comparable DHS was fielded in 1996 so
that before PEDP, after PEDP comparison can be made.

Using these sources, net enrollment increased by 40% from 49.2% in 1996 to 70.5% in
2004 while the gross enrollment rate increased from 75% to 95%. These are impressive
achievements, though insufficient to achieve the Mkukuta or MDG target of complete net
enrollment in primary education by respectively 2010 and 2015. As primary school lasts
7 years, this target has a 7-year lead time. So achieving the Mkukuta target requires
complete enrollment of children from the age of starting in 2003. In practice, by 2004,
only 27% of children aged 7 were enrolled in grade 1, and 20% of the 8-year olds were
enrolled in grades 1 or 2, implying that this Mkukuta target will not be achieved. Unless
enrollment rates increase dramatically by 2008, the MDG goal will also not be achieved.

It is also important to note that the actual wording of the MDG is "Ensure that, by 2015,
children everywhere, boys and girls alike, will be able to complete a full course of
primary schooling".     This does not translate directly as being 100% primary NER.
Analytical work on how to measure the MDG summarized in a World Bank publication
from 2003, Achieving Universal Primary Education by 2015: A Chance for Every Child,
concludes that the MDG should be measured by the Primary Completion Rate (PCR).
This has been universally accepted among the World Bank, UNESCO, and the UN
system generally. The Primary Completion Rate is defined in World Development
Indicators; it is "calculated by taking the total number of students in the last grade of
primary school, minus the number of repeaters in that Grade, divided by the total number
of children of official age."

The data also allow to consider how enrollment in primary and secondary education is
distributed across different wealth quintiles. It demonstrates that in 2004 17.8% of
children enrolled in primary school originated from the poorest quintile. This is an
improvement over 1996 when only 15.9% was enrolled. Access to primary school was



                                             27

already relatively equally distributed before UPE and became more equally distributed
once PEDP was introduced. Note however that if the aim is that all children should have
equal probability of attending primary school, the fraction of children from the poorest
households should exceed 20%. The reason being that households in the poorest quintile
have on average, more children of school-going age. In 2004 for instance, a household
from the poorest quintile had on average 1.23 children aged 7-13 while a household from
the wealthiest quintile had 0.89 children in that age category.

Poverty

Projecting poverty forward from 2001, it is prudent to use per capita growth rates of
consumption. Whereas between 1999 and 2000 (the period for which the poverty
simulations were done) the overall increase in GDP and consumption is comparable (i.e.
the average growth rate for the period are comparable--the annual pattern is different),
this fails to be the case since 2000.

1990-2000: all growth rates are aligned
Increase pvt consumption 1990-2000            43%
Increase GDP1990-2000                         48%
Increase Got consumption 1990-2000            43%

2001-2005: divergence of growth rates
Increase pvt consumption 2001-2005            23%
Increase GDP 2001-2005                        34%
Increase GoT consumption 2001-2005            71%

Average pc. growth pvt consumption 2001-2005                 2.3%
Average pc. growth GDP 2001-2005                             4.6%
Average pc growth of GoT consumption 2001-2005               11.2%

On the assumption of 4.6% pc consumption growth, poverty would have dropped from
35.8% to 25.3% in 2005. But when private consumption growth is 2.3% poverty would
only have dropped to: 30.2%. Unfortunately the Economic Survey numbers do not permit
to distinguish between rural and urban consumption/GDP growth, so that one can only
work with one consumption growth rate. If rural consumption growth is less than urban
consumption growth or if intra-sectoral inequality increased, the decline in poverty will
be overestimated. One reason why after 2000 consumption growth no longer tracks GDP
growth is the increase in Government consumption.

Note that the source of data makes a difference. Whereas the previous is based on the
economic survey, the ALDB suggests the following growth rates:
Average pc. growth pvt consumption 2001-2005                 0.9%
Average pc. growth GDP 2001-2005                             3.6%
Average pc growth of GoT consumption 2001-2005               14.2%

At a per capita growth rata of 0.9% poverty would have dropped to 33.6% in 2005.
