April 1977 to May 1978
In April 1977, the Government instituted a dual exchange rate system.
Under this system, a new "special" exchange rate of US$1.000 = J$1.250 was
established for all transactions except essential imports and transactions of
the Government and bauxite sector, which remained at the old ("basic") exchange
rate of US$1.000 = J$0.909. Subsequent adjustments were made in the "basic"
and "special" rates and by May 1978, the rates were:
Basic                               Special
US$1.000 =  J$1.050                  US$1.000 =  J$1.350

May 1978 to March 1979
On May 10, 1978, the exchange rate was unified at the new rate of
US$1.000 = J$1.550. The Government started a system of monthly devaluations
which would total 15% by May, 1979. The following were the exchange values
in effect on April 27, 1979.

JAMAICA
SECOND PROGRAM LOAN
LOAN SUMMARY
Borrower:            Government of Jamaica
Beneficiaries:       The Export Development Fund (the Fund), the Jamaica Export
Credit Insurance Corporation (JECIC) and the Jamaica
National Export Corporation (JNEC)
Amount:              $31.5 million
Terms:               Payable in 17 years, including four years of grace at
7.9% interest.
Relending
Terms:               The Borrower would relend US$30 million to the Fund at
an interest rate equal to the rate of interest on the Bank
loan payable in 10 to 20 years with a grace period for
interest and principal at least equal to five years.
Interest rates to exporters having access to the Fund
would initially be about 12% with the Government assuming
the cross currency exchange risk and exporters bearing
the US dollar exchange risk.
Program
Description:         The purpose of the loan is to support the Government s
program to expand the value of exports of non-traditional
manufactured goods by 25% a year over the next five years.
Thirty million dollars of loan funds would be used to
establish a revolving Export Development Fund, which
would discount commercial bank loans made to exporters
of manufactured goods. The Fund would provide foreign
exchange for the importation by bona fide Jamaican
exporters (and suppliers to exporters) of raw materials,
intermediate goods and spare parts into Jamaica. The
Fund would be replenished with US dollars from the sale
of exports and is projected to turn over up to 1.3 times
a year in the first year of operation and possibly more
rapidly thereafter. The Fund would be a government-
owned entity controlled and administered by JECIC,
a Bank of Jamaica subsidiary. It would have a minimum
existence of five years.
$1.5 million of loan resources would be used to provide
technical assistance to JECIC to develop its capacity
to manage export financing programs and to JNEC to develop
its capacity to provide export marketing assistance to
manufacturers and to evaluate industrial development and
export policies and incentives.



- ii -
The program is part of the Government's overall effort
to increase foreign exchange earnings from the export of
non-traditional manufactured goods. The program is aimed
at increasing export earnings from non-traditional manufac-
tured goods from $88 million in 1978 to $265 million in
1983 in current terms. The major risks in the program are
that entrepreneurs may not respond positively to the
programs being instituted by the Government, that they
will not be successful in their marketing efforts, and
that the Government will falter in the implementation of
its austere economic program.
UNDP resources of about $400,000 will be used to help
finance a program of management assistance to public
enterprises and Central Government project units charged
with the implementation responsibility for projects in
the public sector investment program. The Bank would be
executing agency for the UNDP.
Estimated Cost
and Financing Plan: The Export Development Fund's financing needs are all
foreign exchange and initially will be met completely by
the Bank loan. Other official and private lenders have
expressed an interest in co-financing after the Fund
becomes operational and it is possible that such financing
may materialize at a later date.

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
SECOND PROGRAM LOAN TO JAMAICA
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
program loan to Jamaica for the equivalent of US$31.5 million. The loan would
have a term of 17 years, including four years of grace, with interest at 7.9%
per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
Introduction
2.        An Economic Memorandum was prepared and distributed to the Executive
Directors in May 1978. An Economic Report entitled "Current Economic Position
and Prospects of Jamaica" is being distributed to the Executive Directors in
May 1979.
Background to the Economic Crisis
3.        Jamaica's real GDP per capita has declined in every year since 1972,
the cumulative decline being about 20% through 1978. This downward spiral
appears particularly striking when one notes that the country is well endowed
with natural resources, has well educated and skilled manpower, enjoys the
advantage of proximity to the lucrative North American market and possesses a
developed financial system. To some extent, however, its advantages are also
its disadvantages. The openness of the economy makes it highly susceptible
to exogenous factors such as international price and demand changes. Its
labor and capital have proved internationally mobile, with every domestic
economic crisis being accompanied by a massive outflow of capital and an
exodus of labor. Finally, its proximity to the United States and Canada has
resulted in some emulation of the consumption patterns and levels of its more
affluent northern neighbors.
4.        The Government which came to power in 1972 inherited an economy
which had experienced rapid growth but which suffered from some serious struc-
tural defects. These included (i) a policy bias against the agricultural
sector, the traditional source of Jamaica's employment opportunities; (ii) an
industrial sector which had grown under excessive protection and had become
inefficient, highly import-dependent and capital intensive; (iii) increased
pressure on urban centers due to migration from the rural areas; and (iv) a
widening of income inequality. The development strategy of the new Government
in terms of economic diversification, an expanded public sector role, employ-
ment promotion and redistribution of income created an atmosphere of uncer-
tainty with the immediate result of reduced investment activity by the private
sector. The situation was further aggravated by the increase in petroleum and
other commodity prices, the world recession of 1974-75, the drying up of
foreign commercial bank lending, labor problems in some of the key sectors and



political violence. In response to the ensuing balance of payments and fiscal
problems, there was a massive outflow of capital in 1976 (estimated at over
US$150 million or 5% of GDP). This has been accompanied by the migration of
skilled manpower, a phenomenon which initially was one of the main results of
the poor growth performance but now is one of its main causes. Table 1
illustrates some key aspects of this growth experience.
The Government's Response to the Crisis
5.        Since early 1977, the Government has been making concerted efforts
to alleviate the country's severe economic problems. The measures have
included a new tax effort, a wages policy for both the private and public
sectors, tightening of import restrictions and exchange rate adjustments.
In July 1977, the Government adopted a comprehensive program which became the
basis for an agreement with the IMF on a one-year standby arrangement. Under
this arrangement, Jamaica drew the first tranche of US$22 million, but by
early 1978, it became apparent that the Government would not be able to meet
the targets of the standby arrangement. Instead of seeking to renegotiate
the arrangement, the IMF and Government negotiated a three-year Extended
Fund Facility arrangement in May 1978, which permitted a longer period
for economic adjustment and provided a higher level (US$240 million for
a three-year period through June 1981) of financial assistance from the
IMF. The main focus of the program is to channel the maximum amount of
resources toward investment and growth. To this end, domestic consumption
is expected to decline from the 1977 level of about 88% of GDP to about 83%
of GDP by 1980. The key elements of the program for the first year of the
Facility arrangement were the following:
(i) Exchange rate policy: On May 10, 1978, the Government ended
the dual exchange rate system, in force for over a year, and
moved to a unified rate of US$1.00 = J$1.55. This implied an
effective weighted average devaluation of 25%. In addition,
the Government agreed to a program of small monthly devaluations,
which would total 15% by May 1979. Beyond that, it agreed
to frequent moves of the exchange rate in order to maintain the
competitiveness of Jamaican exports.
(ii) Incomes policy: Wage increases in any wage contract expiring
after May 1, 1978, have been limited to maximum nominal increases
of 15% per year for the two-year period. This limit applies to
the value of all concepts of pay: straight time pay and overtime
rates, plus the money value of all fringe benefits and allowances.
The wage guideline has been applied to the public as well as
private sector.
(iii)  Fiscal policy:  The overall deficit of the Central Government
was to be reduced to 12.5% of GDP in 1978/79 from about 16%
of GDP in 1977/78 through expenditure cuts and a new tax
package.

(iv) Production policies: The Government has reaffirmed its commit-
ment to a mixed economy. Public enterprises are expected to
operate on a cost recovery basis. Although price controls are
to be maintained for most basic necessities, they have either
been lifted or significantly liberalized for all other items.
6.        In addition to the foregoing, the program for the first year con-
tained (i) ceilings on net credit to the public sector from the banking
system; (ii) limits on the domestic assets of the Bank of Jamaica; (iii) limits
on the authorization of new foreign indebtedness by the public sector;
(iv) targets for increases in international reserves; and (v) provisions for
orderly management of payment arrears.
7.        Quarterly program tests have generally been met and through
April 30, 1979, five drawings, totalling about US$90 million, had been made
under the Extended Fund Facility. The exchange rate policy has been imple-
mented as planned, the rate being US$1.00 = J$1.766 on April 27, and one
further small move is expected to bring it to the originally agreed level.
Regarding the incomes policy, available data suggest that the 15% guideline
was substantially adhered to. Even when one includes the somewhat larger
wage increases negotiated prior to the effectiveness of the 15% guideline,
wages in the unionized sector increased, on the average, by less than 20%.
In respect to fiscal policy, however, the current account deficit was higher
(2.6% of GDP) than the progammed level (0.5% of GDP), although the overall
financing deficit was on target, owing to the slower implementation of projects.
8.        At the end of April, agreement was reached with the IMF on the
targets and policies for the second year of the program. The Government and
the IMF are agreed that the exchange rate and wage policies pursued over the
past year have restored Jamaica's export competitiveness, and, accordingly,
the mini-devaluations will be suspended as of May 1979. Emphasis will there-
after be placed on preserving Jamaica's competitiveness through (i) the reduc-
tion of the ceiling on wage increases from 15% of last year to 10% this year;
(ii) a more active monetary policy in which interest rates will be allowed
to increase.
9.        Over the last year, the Government has shown considerable resolve
in adopting the measures required to cope with the serious economic situation.
Politically, this has not been easy. Consumer prices increased by about 50%
during 1978 at a time when the Government was generally enforcing the guideline
regarding 15% nominal wage increases. The removal of subsidies on many items,
the adjustments in the tariffs of many services, and the additional burden of
the new tax package have combined to cause a considerable decline in the real              4
income of the population. Although public dissatisfaction with economic
conditions has generally been restrained, some civil disorders took place in
January 1979 in connection with a gasoline price increase and a one-day general
strike occurred thereafter in mid-February.
External Financing Requirements
10.       Since 1977, and concurrently with IMF negotiations, the Government
has continued discussions with bilateral and multilateral sources as well as
with foreign commercial banks for a package of extraordinary external financing.

-7-
The financing plan was based on a detailed analysis of the size of the external
resource gap, and the Bank has played an active role in the determination and
mobilization of the required resources not only through its first program loan
(para. 45 and 46), but also through the Bank-sponsored Caribbean Group for
Cooperation in Economic Development (para. 57). Commitments of US$53.6 million
in the form of program-type assistance were made to Jamaica in June 1978 under
the Group, and by the end of March 1979, about US$37 million had been drawn down.
Details on the sources and uses of the external financing are provided in
Tables 2 and 3.
11.       The proposed Bank loan is an integral part of the financing package
(see Table 3). To ensure that the negative real growth of output of the last
several years is reversed, a minimum level of merchandise imports (c.i.f.) of
US$1,000 million would be required, compared to US$872 million in 1978. Owing
to the foreign exchange constraints of the last few years, the level of capital
and intermediate goods imports of agriculture and industry (excluding the
bauxite/alumina sector) were reduced from US$585 million in 1975 to US$450
million in 1976 and US$305 million in 1977. In 1978, thanks to the package
of special external financing of which the Bank's program loan was a part,
these imports increased to US$510 million, but even then the 1978 levels of
such imports was about 30% below that of 1975 in real terms. Although in
absolute terms, the proposed Bank loan represents a relatively small part of
Jamaica's import requirements for 1979, the proposed loan would account for a
significant percentage of the funds required for imports by Jamaica's exporters
of non-traditional manufactured goods. To the extent that the proposed revolv-
ing fund could turn over up to 1.3 times a year, the foreign exchange avail-
ability stimulated by the loan during its first year of operation could
be up to US$40 million. Given the present low capacity utilization in the
manufacturing sector, and given that in real terms the foreign exchange avail-
ability to the sector is considerably lower than in 1975, the proposed loan
plays a crucial role in the Government's strategy for export promotion.
Impact of Government's Policies on the Economic Situation
12.       The key macroeconomic indicators suggest that the balance of
payments and fiscal situations have generally improved during 1977 and 1978
compared to 1975 and 1976, reflecting both improved international demand for
Jamaica's exports and the effects of the policy measures which have been
introduced over the last two years to deal with the crisis.
13.       Balance of Payments.  Buoyed by strong demand in the industrial
economies, the production of bauxite increased from 10.1 million long tons in
1976 to 11.3 million long tons in 1977 and to 11.8 million long tons in 1978.
In value terms, the exports of the bauxite/alumina sector increased by about
27% between 1976 and 1978. Sugar and banana exports increased marginally in
value terms due mainly to slightly better prices. Non-traditional exports and
tourism, on the other hand, have benefitted considerably from the exchange
rate adjustments. While merchandise exports increased by 22% in current terms
between 1976 and 1978, merchandise imports were maintained at below their 1976
level through a rigorous system of import licensing. The result has been that,
despite the higher net factor service payments, the current account deficit
has been substantially lower during 1977 and 1978 than during 1975 and 1976
(see Table 4). This has enabled Jamaica not only to reduce its commercial

arrears substantially, but also to increase marginally its gross official
reserves over the 1976 level. While the balance of payments situation still
remains difficult, the major trade-related distortions have been substantially
reduced.
14.       Public Finances.  Helped by the exchange rate adjustments, the
Central Government budgetary accounts registered substantial improvements
during 1977/78 and 1978/79. In reflection of the improved aluminum market
and as a consequence of the new tax package, current revenue increased by
about 57% in nominal terms between 1976/77 and 1978/79. By contrast, current
expenditure over the same period increased by 47% due to careful monitoring
of the expenditures of the ministries and departments by the Ministry of
Finance. In addition, capital expenditure has been lower during the last
two fiscal years due to slow implementation of projects. As a result, the
overall financing deficit decreased from 18.4% of GDP in 1976/77 to about
16% in 1977/78 and to about 12% in 1978/79 (see Table 5). This is still
an excessively large deficit but is expected to decrease appreciably as the
Government continues its adherence to its stabilization program.
15.       Output and Employment.  The above accomplishments in the fiscal and
balance of payments areas have been at a considerable cost in terms of output,
employment, and prices. The lower level of imports has led to shortages of raw
materials and intermediate goods which have, in turn, led to the closure or
reduced activity of many distributing and manufacturing firms. There is a
large underutilization of capacity in the productive sectors, in part because
of external conditions and in part because of the restriction on imports and
domestic demand. On the basis of provisional data, real GDP stagnated in 1978,
following declines of 6.7% and 4.0%, respectively, during 1976 and 1977.
Unemployment increased further to about 26% by the end of 1978, after remain-
ing stable at the high level of about 24% over the past two years. Finally,
as a direct consequence of the economic package, consumer prices (on an end-
of-period basis) increased by about 50%, implying a decline in real wages
of over 30%.
Growth and Balance of Payments Prospects
16.       Output.  The level of economic activity in Jamaica continues to be
severely restricted by the country's limited import capacity and scarcity of
skilled manpower. The speed with which recovery can be accomplished conse-
quently will depend heavily upon the growth of export earnings, the ability
of the public sector to mobilize external financing on appropriate terms, the
trends in private capital inflows, and the capacity of the Government to
ameliorate the problems arising from shortages of skilled manpower. However,
given the prospects of a tight balance of payments during the first half of
1979, GDP is expected to grow in real terms by no more than 2.5% during the
year. Growth prospects beyond 1979 appear somewhat brighter as the economy
gradually overcomes the current short-term constraints. GDP growth rate, in
real terms, is projected at 3.5% for 1980 and 4% beyond 1980.
17.       Balance of Payments.  Assuming no recurrence of the civil unrest
that occurred in early January, and given normal local weather conditions for
agriculture, the exports of goods and nonfactor services of Jamaica should

increase during 1979 to a level of about US$1,115 million, a nominal in-
crease of 11% above the 1978 level of about US$1,006 million. Total bauxite
production is projected to increase to 12.6 million tons, about 7% above the
1978 level of 11.8 million tons. The production of sugar is projected to
increase to 350,000 tons, 16% above the 1978 level but still lower than the
1972 level of 373,000 tons and substantially lower than the 500,000 tons in
1965. Slight improvement is also expected in banana production and exports.
The area which is expected to benefit most from the Government's new emphasis
on export promotion is non-traditional exports. The proposed changes in the
incentive structure to favor exporting (see paras. 71-77), together with more
favorable macroeconomic policies, are expected to result in a nominal increase
of about 25% in the exports of non-traditional exports (mainly manufactured
goods but also including some agricultural goods and petroleum by-products).
Provided that there are no further disruptions, tourist arrivals should
increase by 12-13% during 1979.
18.       Imports of goods and nonfactor services are projected at US$1,152
million, about 14% above the 1978 level. On this basis, the current account
deficit in 1979 is projected at US$135 million (about 4.5% of GDP) compared
to US$142 million (5.3% of GDP) in 1978.
19.       Over the five-year period, 1979-83, the current account deficit is
projected to average about US$85 million annually. In addition to this
deficit, amortization payments on existing and new debt to be contracted are
expected to average US$146 million. Thus, the annual external capital require-
ments to cover both current deficits and requisite amortization payments are
estimated to average US$231 million.
20.       It is projected that gross disbursements of medium- and long-term
loans and credits would provide, on an average, about US$255 million. Com-
plemented by potential net disbursements from the IMF, averaging about US$65
million annually, this would be sufficient to cover the above indicated
capital requirements and also provide for strengthening of international
reserves 1/ and for a small outflow on account of direct private investment
due to amortization of bauxite/alumina investments.
21.       Creditworthiness.  Jamaica's public external debt has grown rapidly
in recent years. At the end of 1973, external public debt outstanding and
disbursed was US$309 million, or about 16% of GDP. By the end of 1978 it had
risen to about US$1,005 million,or about 38% of estimated GDP. Particularly
because of the shorter maturities of much of the recent borrowing, the growth
in debt service has been more rapid than the growth of debt. Service payments
on this public debt are estimated at about 17% of exports (including nonfactor
services) in 1978, compared to 6% in 1973. The interest payments in 1978 alone
amounted to about 2.4% of GDP and to about 8% of central government current
revenues.
22.       Debt and debt service, in relation to GDP and exports, are now above
the levels that are desirable for a small open economy that is not highly
diversified. The role of external borrowing will necessarily be limited by
the need to improve these relationships and thus give the Jamaican authorities
greater freedom of action in their economic management. The most desirable
1/   Net foreign reserves are expected to increase by US$67 million in 1979.

way of reducing the debt service ratio and to increase GDP and exports and to
borrow on more favorable terms rather than to reduce the net inflow of capital
from abroad. The projected debt burden is shown in Table 6. Interest as a
percent of GDP is projected to fall slowly from 2.4% in 1978 to 1.8% by 1985.
This slow improvement is reflective of the present debt structure of Jamaica,
with the service payments to foreign commercial banks expected to account for
70% of the total debt service payments in 1979. A gradual improvement in debt
structure is foreseen in line with the Government's limits, under the economic
program, on the authorization of new foreign indebtedness of shorter maturities
by the public sector and this improvement is expected to offset the increase
in the average effective interest rate (as new loans at around 8.5% replace
older loans contracted at lower nominal interest rates). The debt service
ratio and the ratio of debt outstanding and disbursed is projected to decline
gradually over the next several years, due in large part to good prospects
for exports, especially of bauxite/alumina. On this basis, provided Jamaica
successfully carries out its economic stabilization program and pursues
its new export-oriented strategy, it should be able to manage its external
indebtedness and be considered creditworthy for continued external assistance.
PART II - DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY AND PROSPECTS
General
23.       The Government has prepared a Five-Year Development Plan for the
period 1978-82. The Summary of Objectives, and Macroeconomic Strategies and
Targets for the Plan were approved by the Cabinet in October 1978. The Plan
was presented to the House of Representatives and published early in December
1978.
24.       The principal objective of the Plan is to place the economy on a
growth path through expanding exports, doubling the rates of savings and
investment and stimulating the productive sectors. The principal means to
be employed are careful fiscal and monetary policies, a realistic public
investment program and prices and incomes policies which will maintain produc-
tion incentives; insofar as the latter may be insufficient to maintain export
competitiveness, a flexible exchange rate policy will be followed. The Plan
is to be supported by a public investment program prepared on a rolling
three-year basis (see paras 48 to 50). The Plan aims to reduce the rate of
unemployment from its current level of 26% to approximately 15% by end of the
Plan period.
25.       The mission review of the development plan concentrated on the
sector plans and prospects in those sectors which will make a contribution
to export earnings--agriculture, bauxite/alumina, tourism and manufacturing.
The country's ambitious per annum growth targets for these sectors during the
Plan period are in real terms as follows:
a.   Agriculture       -   7-8%
b.   Bauxite/Alumina  -   6%
c.   Tourism           -   15%
d.   Manufacturing    -   4-5%



- 15 -
26.       The Government anticipates that the sectoral targets of the Plan may
be reached without immediate extensive new investment, since the economy is
operating with a considerable margin of excess capacity in the key productive
sectors. The bauxite/alumina sector is operating about 75% of capacity, while
the manufacturing sector is operating at about 60% of capacity. In the agri-
cultural sector, it is estimated that there are 65,000 acres of arable land
on properties of 100 acres and over that can be brought into more intensive
production. The Government believes, very plausibly, that the restoration of
growth will require:
(i) adequate supplies of foreign exchange to finance the importation
of needed raw materials and capital goods;
(ii) expanding markets, both domestic and external;
(iii) a positive private sector response to the recovery program; and
(iv) improved public sector performance in the implementation of
programs and projects.
27.       A brief review of the export earning sectors follows.
Bauxite/Alumina
28.       There was marked improvement in 1977 and 1978 over 1976 in production
and revenue earned by Jamaica's bauxite and alumina industry. Bauxite and
alumina exports accounted for 74% of Jamaica's export earnings in 1977, com-
pared to 69% in the preceding year. The improvement was largely due to a
25.5% increase in alumina exports. The improved production in bauxite
permitted Jamaica to regain second place from Guinea in world production.
It now only follows Australia and accounts for 13% of world production.
29.       Despite the improved performance, production is still far below the
peak year of 1974, with bauxite production and alumina exports both trailing
the 1974 levels by 25%. At current levels of extraction, Jamaica is estimated
to have about 100 years of supply of bauxite. Opportunities for expanding
current production and exports are principally dependent on the following
factors:
(i) The economic health of the North American and Western European
market economies. Jamaican bauxite has traditionally been
entirely sent to the United States. The United States has also
received close to one-third of Jamaican alumina exports over the
last five years. Most of the remaining alumina exports have
gone to Norway, the United Kingdom and Canada.
(ii) The extent to which new markets for bauxite and alumina can be
developed. Efforts have been made to diversify export to the
South American and COMECON markets. The Government continues
to explore the possibility of expanding domestic alumina
production in a partnership arrangement with foreign entities.



- 16 -
(iii) The willingness of the multi-national alumina companies to expand
production in Jamaica. The willingness of the multi-national
companies to expand production in Jamaica is determined by the
world demand for aluminum as well as their commitments to purchase
bauxite and alumina in other producing countries; the cost of the
Jamaican product in relation to other bauxite and alumina; the
difference in quality characteristics of bauxite; and the desire
to eliminate supply risks by following a policy of source divers-
ification. These factors have in part been responsible for the
reduction in Jamaica's production by about 25% over the last
four years, while total production of the International Bauxite
Association producers (who account for 73% of world production)
has increased 11% during the same period.
30.       Despite prevalence of external factors in determining demand for
bauxite and alumina, internal factors also have affected production. These
have included industrial unrest and the uncertainties caused by the imposition
in 1974 of the bauxite production levy on the multi-national companies, as
well as the extended negotiations that have taken place over the last several
years for an ownership interest by the Government in mining and production
facilities. Government efforts have resulted in labor tranquility over the
last year and it is expected that labor conditions will remain stable. More-
over, the bauxite production levy has been accepted and the negotiations for
Government ownership interest in the mining companies and alumina facilities
have been successfully completed. Discussions with the companies are currently
underway regarding measures the Government might take in order to encourage
expanded output in Jamaica.
31.       Given the stable domestic conditions which appear to have been
achieved, and favorable forecasts for world-wide demand of lightweight metals
to expand its markets, prospects are for net foreign exchange earnings from
the sector to grow in real terms at a 5-6% annual rate over the period of the
Five-Year Plan. Such growth could be achieved without any significant new
investment. New investment in the sector is dependent on securing partnership
arrangements which would call for major capital contributions from the external
partner.
Tourism
32.       Tourism is Jamaica's second largest foreign exchange earner after
bauxite and alumina, and it generates 20,000 direct and indirect jobs. The
industry is thus of critical importance for Jamaica's development prospects.
33.       Growth in tourism has shown sensitivity to economic conditions in
the North American market and the perception in those markets of civil disorder
in Jamaica. The years between 1960 and 1974 witnessed a steady and healthy
growth in tourism. Stopover visitors rose from 156,745 in 1960 to 432,987 in
1974. The trend began to reverse in 1975, when Jamaica and other Caribbean
tourist destinations began to feel the effects of the recession in the North
American and European countries. Arrivals in 1975 declined by 8.6% to 395,809.
While other Caribbean destinations showed a strong recovery in 1976, the
escalation of crime and the ensuing bad publicity caused a further 17.2%



- 17 -
decline in arrivals in 1976 and another 19.2% in 1977 when stopover visits
totaled only 264,921. The incomplete figures for 1978 show a sharp turnabout,
with stopovers estimated to have recovered to 382,000, the highest level in
three years, but still about 17% below the 1974 peak. The main reasons for
the reversal in Jamaica's tourist traffic trends in 1978 were the country's
ability to participate in the general improvement in the tourist trade both
worldwide and regionally, within the context of a period of relative social
calm at home and a moderation in the negative image abroad. Furthermore,
promotional efforts were made to attract group charters and to establish
all-inclusive tours which reduced the total cost of trips.
34.       Based on a trend analysis, the level of hotel allocations and the
charter programs planned, the Jamaica Tourist Board by late 1978 was forecast-
ing stopover arrivals for the first four months of 1979 at 218,000, the
highest level ever. Unfortunately, civil disorders took place during the
second week of January 1979 which received wide publicity abroad and there
were some cancellations of vacation trips to Jamaica. Although conditions
have since become settled, the consequent negative image, both among the
travelling public and particularly among travel organizers in the market
countries, may persist for some time to come.
35.       It would thus seem unlikely that the Tourist Board's target of
479,000 arrivals in 1979 will be achieved. Provided that there are no
further disruptions, it is possible that the high season tourist traffic
levels of 175,000-185,000 recorded for January-April in 1974 and 1978 can be
maintained. Furthermore, as the negative image recedes later in the year and
the off-season marketing efforts undertaken in 1978 are continued, it is
possible that traffic increases for the last eight months of 1979 will achieve
the projected 25% increase rate. In this event, arrivals of stopover visitors
would total around 430,000 or 12-13% more than the figure estimated for 1978.
36.       Provided there is no further damage to Jamaica's image as a tourist
destination, the Tourist Board's target of an annual average increase in
stopover traffic of 15% would again become a reasonably attainable marketing
target for 1980 and several years thereafter. Thus, arrivals of over 650,000
stopover visitors in 1982 could be expected. Based on these projections, the
foreign exchange expenditure by tourists would rise from US$123.5 million in
1978 to about US$225 million in 1982.
37.       The growth in tourism can be accommodated without significant new
investment in room capacity over the next two years, because of the rapid
expansion that took place in the late 1960s and early 1970s. New investment
might be considered subsequently when a clearer perspective on traffic trends
develops.
Agriculture
38.       Agriculture is a major source of employment and income in Jamaica
and a critical factor in the country's balance of payments. It contributes
about 8% to GDP, over 30% to national employment and about 13% to export
earnings. Foodstuff imports have been running about 13% of total imports
over the last two years, down from highs of over 20% of total imports in the
middle years of this decade.



- 18 -
39.       In recognition of the importance of the sector and in the belief
that it has not lived up to its physical potential, the Five-Year plan has
assigned it an ambitious per annum real growth target of 7-8% for the period.
If the target is achieved, it would represent a break with the stagnant produc-
tion of the last decade, which resulted in per capita declines in overall
agricultural output and food production. The output performance for 1978 gives
grounds for some cautious optimism that production trends will be moving in a
positive direction. Preliminary estimates are that there was a 3% increase in
export agriculture and a 15% increase in domestic agriculture (which follows
the strong 18.6% gain in domestic agriculture in 1977). Overall agriculture is
estimated to have increased 7.4% in 1978, an even higher rate than the 6.2%
increase achieved in 1977. The strong performance of domestic agriculture is
probably due to several factors:
(i) A significant stimulus to domestic production due to import
restrictions;
(ii) The institutions in 1977 of guaranteed prices for 18 products;
(iii) Improved weather conditions; and
(iv) The mobilization of farmers to produce under the Government's
Emergency Production Plan, which included a crop credit program
for food production.
40.       The Plan's principal objectives in agriculture are to:  maximize
production of food and agricultural raw material; reduce reliance on imports;
improve utilization of agricultural land; improve the standard of living of
the rural population by increasing both farm incomes and rural amenities;
provide more employment opportunities; ensure that inputs and markets are
available to farmers; and protect farmers from predial larceny. Measures
proposed in the Plan to accomplish these objectives include:   continuing the
system of guarantee prices for the most important crops; accelerating the
distribution of land to small farmers; implementing new or improved drainage
to about 20,000 ha (50,000 acres); improving soil conservation program;
strengthening research and extension services; improving the marketing and
distribution of domestic food crops; and increasing the flow of agricultural
credit.
41.       A brief review of the strategy and prospects for the sector may be
divided into the following areas;
(i) domestic food crops;
(ii) the traditional major export commodities--sugar and bananas; and
(iii) other--the miscellaneous, but important catch-all which includes
non-traditional export crops, livestock and non-food production.



- 19 -
(i) Domestic Food Crops. The Plan aims to expand food production
by an additional 90,000 crop acres over the five-year period.
The additional acreage will come largely from more intensive
land-use practices (multiple cropping, inter-cropping, and crop
rotation); and the bringing into production of idle lands (much
of it formerly owned by the bauxite companies) and land made
more suitable for intensive production through drainage,
irrigation or the terracing of steep slopes. The target is
to increase the output of domestic foods by 268,000 tons over
the 1976 level of 365,000 tons. The emphasis will be on the
production of legumes, cereals (rice and corn) and vegetables.
42.       The success of the Plan in achieving food crop targets will depend
on several factors. Among the more important are the following:
(a) Continuation of a viable crop credit program. The emergency
crop credit program initiated in 1977 has experienced serious
difficulties with loan collections.
(b) The ability of the Government to provide services to farmers
and carry out investment program.
(c) Continuation of an effective marketing and price support
program.
(d) Availability of essential imported agricultural inputs, i.e.,
fertilizer, implements and machinery.
(ii)  Sugar and Bananas.  The Government's program for the sugar industry
is primarily one of rehabilitation with the major objectives being
to increase sugar production closer to its peak level of 1965;
to ensure that foreign exchange earnings are maintained; and to
continue research and a planting program so as to reduce the risk
of smut disease which is affecting the industry. The major rehab-
ilitation works are confined to three sugar factories which account
for about 60% of total output. (The Bank is financing the foreign
exchange costs of this project.) The sugar industry has been beset
by many problems. A particularly difficult problem has been the
production efficiency of the former sugar estates which have been
subdivided into 23 cooperatives.  The cooperatives were created
without adequate planning and this has in part been responsible
for the labor problems and low productivity that has been
experienced. Achievement of the Plan target will depend on coming
to grips with the problems of the cooperatives.
The Plan aims to increase exports of bananas from about 75,000 tons
in 1977 to 150,000 tons by 1982 through a program to expand acreage
under production and by replanting. Exports have been low because
of production problems and a lack of incentives. The marketing,
shipping and export of bananas has been controlled by an ineffi-
cient Banana Board which the Government intends to reorganize.
The revitalized Board would reduce some of the costs in packing
and shipping bananas, increase prices to producers and exercise
more careful quality control.



- 20 -
(iii) Other. Jamaica has the resource potential to develop further
dairy production, small stock and poultry, fisheries, coconuts,
coffee, cocoa, spices, fruit trees, tobacco and forestry. These
areas of development have important potential for foreign exchange
earnings and savings through import substitution. The realization
of the potential will depend on effective Government policies,
adequate production incentives and improved project implementation.
43.       The targets of the Government in some areas (sugar and bananas)
merely would restore production to levels reached in previous years. In other
areas, although production goals are higher than what has been previously
produced, there is a clear capacity to expand production. The attainment of
Plan targets is not constrained by physical limitations, but instead will
depend on overcoming institutional problems.
Manufacturing Sector
44.       The principal purpose of the loan is to support the Government's
program to expand the value of exports of nontraditional manufactured goods.
The review of the manufacturing sector and its export earning prospects there-
fore deserves a more comprehensive and detailed treatment than that given to
the other export earning sectors. Consequently, a separate Part V exclusively
devoted to the "Manufacturing Sector" is included in this report.
PART III - THE FIRST PROGRAM LOAN AND THE PUBLIC SECTOR INVESTMENT PROGRAM
The First Program Loan
45.       The $30 million Jamaica First Program Loan was approved by the Bank's
Executive Directors on December 13, 1977. The loan was made to help Jamaica
finance a minimum level of imports required to maintain a reasonable level of
production and employment in industry and agriculture, and to support the
Government's public sector investment program. Disbursment on the loan was
initially linked to drawings under the August 1977 IMF Stand-By Arrangement.
After it became apparent that a longer period and a higher level of resources
was necessary for economic adjustment than had been anticipated, the Stand-by
Arrangement was abandoned and the Government and the IMF instead entered a
three-year Extended Fund Facility arrangement in May 1978 (see para. 5). As
a result, the conditions linking disbursement of the First Program Loan to the
no longer existing Stand-By Arrangement became inoperative and the Executive
Directors approved the waiver of these conditions and made the full amount of
the loan available for disbursement on the basis of the recommendations
contained in the President's Memorandum to the Board of May 25, 1978 (R78-128).
46.       Disbursement on the First Program Loan began on June 5, 1978 and was
completed on July 28, 1978. Disbursement took place rapidly, because the
Government was able to submit documents for reimbursement for payments that
had been made since the signing of the loan on December 16, 1977. Disburse-
ments were made for raw materials (26%), intermediate goods (66%) and machinery
and transport equipment (8%). The counterpart currency generated by the loan
has been applied to various projects in the public sector investment program.



- 21 -
The First Program Loan succeeded in helping maintain the level of imports for
raw materials, intermediate and capital goods for industry and agriculture at
US$510 million (58% of merchandise imports) and in contributing J$47 million,
or 12% of the fixed investment of the Central Government and nonfinancial
public enterprises.
The Public Sector Investment Program in 1978/1979
47.       The disbursement of the First Program Loan was conditioned on the
adoption by the Government of a satisfactory three-year public sector invest-
ment and financing program, which was reviewed in the Economic Memorandum on
Jamaica distributed to the Board on May 26, 1978. This represented the
Government of Jamaica's first attempt at preparing an operational public
sector investment program and its financing plan. For 1978/79, the program
called for fixed investment by the Central Government and nonfinancial public
enterprises of J$386 million, or about 56% of the total public investment
program of J$683 million. The remainder included the investments of the
Jamaica National Investment Corporation, credit programs of financial agencies
and capital transfers. About 36% of the total public investment was in
directly productive sectors (agriculture, industry, mining and tourism), about
23% in economic infrastructure and about 37% in social infrastructure. It had
been envisaged that public sector savings would cover about 29% of these
expenditures in 1978/79, the remaining financing coming from domestic sources
(35%) and external borrowing (36%). Actual public sector investment in
1978/79 has been lower than programmed, particularly in the case of the
Central Government financed projects for a number of reasons outlined in
para 52. On the whole, however, the levels and nature of the public sector
investment during 1978/79 appeared in line with the Government's overall
strategy of increasing the emphasis on the directly productive sectors.
The Revised Public Sector Investment Program, 1979/80-1981/82
48.       As a result of the experience of the First Program Loan, the Govern-
ment has institutionalized the preparation on an annual basis of a rolling
three-year public investment and financing program. With Bank assistance,
such a program was prepared, covering the period 1979/80-1981/82. The program
was approved by the Government at the end of April 1979. Details of the
investment and financing program are provided in the recent Economic Report,
and Tables 8 and 9 provide a summary of the program.
49.       Briefly, of the total public investment program of J$ 2,571 million
over the next three years (averaging about 14% of GDP), directly productive
sectors have the largest share, 35.4% of total, in line with the Government's
stated objective of putting the economy on a growth path. This is followed
by economic infastructure, 32.9%, social infrastructure, 30.2% and general
administration, 1.5%. Equally important, there is a compositional shift of
the program over the next three years, with the share of the directly produc-
tive sectors expected to increase from 33% in 1979/80 to about 37% by 1981/82,
while the share of social infrastructure is expected to decline from 34% in
1979/80 to 27% by 1981/82. On the whole, the public sector investment program
appears acceptable in terms of its objectives, realism and the Government's

ability to finance it. Most of the projects are ongoing and many of these
have external financing available. The current fiscal and balance of payments
restraints have necesitated a close scrutiny of all projects by the Government.
The program appears realistic and devoid of major new projects which do not
fit into the Government's development strategy or for which financing seems
unlikely. Moreover, the level of capital expenditure in the program is con-
sistent with the Government's ceilings for total expenditure (current and
capital) under the economic program agreed to with the IMF.
50.       On the financing side, public sector savings are expected to cover
about 44% of the public investment program. The major measures being envi-
saged are a sharp reduction in current transfers and subsidies, a ceiling on
wage increases of 10% for the next two years, streamlining of the bureaucracy,
strengthening of the tax administration and frequent changes in the tariffs
of public enterprises to ensure their financial viability. Net domestic
financing (banking and nonbanking) is expected to provide an additional 30%
of the resources without resulting in a deficiency in credit availability to
the private sector. The remaining financing, about 3.5% of GDP, is expected to
come from external medium- and long-term sources, averaging about J$ 222
million on a net basis. To achieve this level, gross disbursements would have
to cover projected amortization payments as well, estimated to average about
J$ 248 million annually. Thus, gross disbursements from external medium- and
long-term sources would have to average about J$ 470 million (about US$260
milion). It is expected that these requirements would be met through (i) dis-
bursements from prior commitments on project assistance, (ii) borrowing from
external commercial banks, and (iii) non-project assistance, including dis-
bursements through the Caribbean Development Facility.
Measures to Improve Investment Program Implementation
51.       The Government has been concerned about lags in the public sector
investment program and has informally asked the Bank for assistance in dealing
with the problem. The Bank and other international agencies have also been
concerned with the problem in regard to projects in their individual Jamaica
lending programs. A consultant in public management was, therefore, included
as a member of the mission that appraised the proposed Second Program Loan.
52.       The mission concluded that the problems of project implementation
could be classified under three headings: (i) shortages of key personnel,
(ii) inadequacies in the systems of management used in planning and controlling
projects, and (iii) the basic organizational structure and practices of the
public sector. The difficult economic conditions of the last several years
have affected and intensified the problems in all three areas and have in-
creased the difficulty in financing recurrent project costs.
53.       The discussions of the problems of public sector management were
subsequently expanded and it was concluded that both the UNDP and the Bank
could support some of the efforts being made by the Government to address the
problems that had been identified.



- 25 -
The UNDP agreed to provide about $400,000 for a project in which the Bank
would be executing agency. The project would finance the salaries and costs
of management experts who would assist a new centrally located Government
management services unit in providing the following services to project units
charged with implementing public sector investment projects:
(a) Assistance in planning project work programs.
t                 (b)  Assistance in designing project monitoring systems.
(c) Management training.
(d) Identification of management and professional needs.
(e) Recruitment of professional and managerial personnel.
54.       The Government's new management services unit would be designed to
function as an in-house Government management consulting firm, which would
help solve management problems, identify management needs and as appropriate
would assist in the recruitment of managers and professionals. External donors
would be asked for help in providing or financing the services of managers and
professionals and the work of the management services unit in this regard would
be explained to donors at the Jamaica subgroup meeting of the Caribbean Group
for Cooperation in Economic Development (see para. 57). The proposed new
project would complement an ongoing UNDP project directed at longer term insti-
tutional problems in the Jamaica Civil Service.
PART IV - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN JAMAICA
55.       To date the Bank has made 19 loans in Jamaica totalling $227.4
million after cancellations. Of this amount, $101.5 million (45%) has been
for infrastructure investments in transportation, electric power, water supply
and sewerage; the remainder has gone into agriculture and agro-industry (19%);
program lending (13%), education (10%), sites and services (7%), population
and nutrition (4%), and small scale enterprises (3%). There have been two
IFC investments in Jamaica; a loan in 1961 to a premix concrete company and
an equity loan investment in 1968 in a hotel project. Annex II contains a
summary statement of Bank loans and IFC investments as of March 31, 1979 and
notes on the execution of projects in Jamaica.
56.       Bank lending in Jamaica has covered a wide range of sectors and
development problems. Initially, the Bank lending program emphasized infra-
structure investment. Although financing for this purpose has continued, the
emphasis of the lending program in the early and middle 1970s moved to the
social sectors, with projects in education, population and nutrition, housing
and employment for the urban poor and rural development. In response to
changing economic forces, a further shift in Bank lending has taken place in
Jamaica for the late 1970s. The priority needs of this most recent period
have been the country's critical short- to medium-term balance of payments



- 26 -
and production requirements. Thus, the FY78 lending program contained a $30
million program loan and an $18 million loan for the rehabilitation of sugar
factories. The proposed second program loan and forestry project are directed
at similar needs. Although the BDank lending program has expericai 7..
emphasis and priorities based on changing economic conditions, the longer-term
objectives of balanced economic development have not been overlooked. Accord-
ingly, while some of the loans now under consideration are directed at promo-
ting exports and the development of efficient import substitution activities,
other development objectives are being addressed to the extent possible. Bank
lending aims to support programs to increase employment, to achieve a wider
distribution of the benefits of economic growth, and to preserve and improve
essential infrastructure. It is also an important objective of Bank lending
to strengthen the public sector institutions associated with Bank-financed
projects by supporting policies to improve the quality of their management,
operating procedures and finances.
57.       Coordination with other external lenders and assistance agencies has
been given particular attention in formulating the Bank's lending strategy.
The Bank has taken a lead role in an international aid effort for the Caribbean
called the Caribbean Group for Cooperation in Economic Development. Its first
meeting was held in Washington in June 1978 and a second meeting is scheduled
for June 1979. The Group has brought together the donor agencies and countries
for the Caribbean and the recipient countries. Within the framework of the
Group, individual country subgroup meetings, similar to Bank consultative
group meetings, have been held. The subgroup meeting for Jamaica has provided
an oportunity to present a country project list and to coordinate assistance
efforts. As a result of the Caribbean Group and subgroup meetings, and of
related donor activities, Jamaica has received commitments, exclusive of Bank
and IMF assistance, for additional balance of payments and project local cost
financing of $53.6 million in FY79 from several bilateral and multilateral
donors. Local cost financing provided in this manner financed the local cost
requirements of several Bank-assisted projects in FY79. The Caribbean Group
also provided a basis for co-financing foreign exchange costs with OPEC Special
Fund in the Bank-assisted Second Power Project. The Bank has also worked
closely with the UNDP in developing a small UNDP financed technical assistance
project to improve the execution of development projects, in which the Bank
would be the executing agency (see para. 53). In addition to the close re-
lationship established with the IMF and the UNDP in dealing with Jamaican
problems, the Bank has worked intimately with other sponsoring agencies of the
Caribbean Group--the Inter-American Development Bank and the Caribbean Develop-
ment Bank, as well as with bilateral aid agencies in the United States, Canada
and the United Kingdom.
58.       Project implementation difficulties have been endemic to Bank and
other internationally financed projects. These have had three principal causes:
(i) shortages of key personnel; (ii) inadequacies in the systems of management
used in planning and controlling projects; and (iii) organizational and structural
problems in the public sector. The difficult economic conditions of the last
several years have affected and intensified the problem in all three areas. The
Government, the Bank staff and the international agencies are taking steps to
deal with it in existing projects and the design of new projects, but it is too
early to assess the impact of these steps.



- 27 -
59.       In July 1978 the Bank provided a $7 million loan for a Small
Scale Enterprise project which is assisting emerging enterpreneurs and small
businessmen. The project is expected to have significant employment and
social benefits. In addition to the proposed Second Program Loan, a Forestry
Project and a Highway Maintenance Project are planned to be presented to
the Board in the very near future. An education project dealing with voca-
tional education and teacher training has also recently been appraised.
Looking further ahead, projects have been identified for assisting export
industries and to support the Government's efforts in the agricultural sector.
It is expected that the precedent established for close coordination with
other external aid donors will continue and exert a strong influence on the
future character of Bank lending to Jamaica. The Bank's share of external
public debt outstanding and disbursed was about 8% in 1977 and its share of
external public debt service was about 5% in that year. It is estimated that
in 1978 the Bank share of external public debt outstanding increased to about
11%, while its share of external public debt service remained about the
same.
PART V - THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR
60.       For a developing country of just over two million inhabitants,
Jamaica has a relatively broad-based industrial sector which produces a wide
variety of manufactured products. The initial impetus for industrial develop-
ment derived from the demands of the sugar and bauxite/alumina sectors. Sub-
sequently, industrial production was stimulated by import substitution policies
that afforded the sector protection against imported manufactured goods, first
within the Jamaican market and later within the Caribbean community. The
manufacturing sector experienced real growth through 1972, and although it
remained completely stagnant during the next three years as a result of the
country's general economic difficulties and political uncertainties, in 1975
it passed the distributive trade sector and has since been the leading sector
in terms of value added. Following the sharp deterioration of the balance of
payments in 1976, however, the manufacturing sector has been hampered by
shortages of raw materials and parts, reduced consumer demand caused by the
general economic slowdown, and a virtual halt of investment activity of the
prvate sector due to the continued atmosphere of uncertainty. Consequently,
sector output declined 3.3% in 1975, 5.5% in 1977, and an estimated 5.0% in
1978. Last year, manufacturing contributed 18% to GDP, sector employment was
76,000 or 11% of the employed labor force, and exports of manufactured goods
(excluding sugar and petroleum products) reached US$88 million or 11% of
merchandise exports.
61.       The current structure of Jamaica's manufacturing sector is the
result of incentive and trade policies which, since the introduction in 1956
of the Industrial Incentives Law, have been directed at establishing and
protecting domestic industry. The substantive elements of the Incentives Law
prevail to this day. They allow Jamaican manufacturers to import capital
goods, raw materials and intermediate goods without duty, and further encourage
the use of foreign capital goods through generous tax write-offs after a ten-
year income tax holiday. The manufacturer is further protected because when
there is sufficient installed capacity to supply the domestic market, imports



- 28 -
have been excluded without any meaningful efficiency criteria being applied.
The only exception to import restrictions are for goods manufactured in CARICOM
countries. However, the 1974 CARICOM Scheme for the Harmonization of Fiscal
Incentives to Industry embodies the same basic incentives and protective
features of the Jamaican Industrial Incentives Law, and its only effect has
been to extend the protective barriers from the small Jamaican market to the
also limited CARICOM market.  The current list of restricted imports includes
335 items, of which 30 are intermediate goods, 50 are capital goods, and the
balance consumer goods.  In practice, the list i8 much larger because some
items are defined as broadly as "clothing--all types and materials." The
import restrictions have resulted in very high effective levels of protection
to domestic industry.  Estimates developed for seven products by two Bank
missions indicate that the effective protection levels (excess of value-added
at domestic prices over value-added at world prices) range from about 60% for
steel bars and 80% for woven garments, to as much as 300% for textile shirtings.
62.       The industrialization policies and incentives have resulted in
significant distortions within the manufacturing sector. The system of incen-
tives encouraged the development of a mix of capital intensive industries, and
many so-called "screwdriver" industries, performing final assembly or process-
ing operations with very low domestic value added. Paradoxically, what has
happened is that the policy of import substitution through the encouragement
and protection of domestic industry, has resulted in the creation of a highly
import dependent manufacturing sector that is exacerbating, rather than helping
Jamaica's balance of payment's problem. By providing incentives in the form of
duty-free imports of intermediate goods, efforts to develop backward linkages
where comparative advantages might have existed, or developed, were effectively
discouraged. A recent survey of 77 large firms in 15 subsectors indicates that
direct raw material imports represent 35% of gross sales and 74% of total raw
material requirements of manufacturing firms. Including indirect imports, the
import content of domestic manufacturers increases to about 40% of sales and
85% of total raw materials utilized. Furthermore, the Government estimates
the import content to be more than 50% in the case of non-traditional exports.
The higher than average import content of non-traditional exports reflects
the distortions created by the industrialization policies. Because of the
high cost structure of locally manufactured goods, the magnitude of which is
indicated by the estimates of effective protection, products with a relatively
lower content of local inputs have been more able to compete outside of
Jamaica, and in particular outside of CARICOM. Also, to be competitive most
exports have had to be priced below their local levels, which further increased
their import content as a percent of export sales. The exchange rate and wage
policies over the last year have, however, increased the cost competitiveness
of Jamaican products, and there has been a corresponding increase in private
sector interest in production for the export market.
63.       In itself the high import content of Jamaican manufacturers is
understandable given the limited natural resources of the country. However,
the duty-free import of capital goods and generous depreciation allowances
tended to promote the use of capital intensive technologies and the production
of capital intensive goods, while the protective barriers assured profits
without penalizing inefficiency. As a result of the marked bias favoring the



- 29 -
use of capital, Jamaican industry failed to absorb labor in proportion to the
country's factor endowments. During the last five years, the political and
economic uncertainties that led to a sharp decrease of private investment and
that generally had the disastrous impact on the economy described above, had
one unexpected positive side effect. They indirectly helped to ameliorate the
factor bias of the industrialization policies, as manufacturers willing to
invest have sought to reduce their capital exposure through labor intensive
investments, and a small scale indigenous industry appears to have continued
growing despite the general economic slowdown.  Since 1972, there has also been
a marked shift among industrial subsectors. In contrast to the 8.4% decrease
in real output of the overall manufacturing sector during the 1972-77 period,
the food subsector (excluding sugar and beverages) increased 7.5%, while the
capital intensive chemicals subsector, which includes petroleum products and
many non-essentials such as cosmetics, decreased 21.2% in real terms.
64.       The high levels of effective protection of the manufacturing sector
also reflect high profits, inefficiencies, cost penalties associated with
small-scale production, and unutilized capacity. Despite the limited size of
the Jamaican market, the generous industrialization incentives encouraged
investments to manufacture the vast majority of finished goods consumed locally.
The resulting industrial base is fragmented into many small and inefficient
producers, most of whom operate one shift producing a wide variety of products
in very short runs, and who rely on the high prices made possible by the pro-
tective barriers to cover their high operating and capital costs. In addition,
the aforementioned survey of 77 firms indicates that the sector is operating
at 60% of capacity, where capacity is understood as the overall output possible
of the current product mix in two shifts (three where the process is contin-
uous). The low utilization of capacity is due to the contraction of the local
market, and inability of many firms to maintain or increase their export
markets because of the shortage of foreign exchange. The net effect of the
foregoing is a relatively high cost structure for Jamaican manufactured
products, and inordinately high profit margins per unit produced or invested,
necessary to obtain reasonable financial rates of return on investment.
Exports
65.       Manufactured exports 1/ increased from US$48 million in 1972 to
US$73 million in 1976, or 11% yearly, in nominal terms, decreased 4% to US$70
million in 1977, and are estimated to have increased 25% to US$88 million in
1978. The improved performance of manufactured exports in 1978 is based on
several factors, including an improved flow of foreign exchange to the sector,
stronger external than internal demand, and the exchange rate and wage policy
actions which have enhanced the relative price advantage of Jamaican exports.
1/   Excluding sugar and molasses (US$63 million in 1977), other agricultural
products (US$34 million in 1977, of which US$14 million were bananas),
petroleum products (US$14 million in 1977), and re-exports (US$13 million
in 1977).

66.       Between 1972 and 1977 there was a marked shift in the composition of
exporting firms and manufactured export goods. Beverages, paper products,
furniture, metal mechanics, and mechanical and electrical equipment registered
real growth, while clothing suffpred a r-h-tantial declin-.  The latter
reflects the limited scope of past export incentives. The Export Industry
Encouragement Law of 1956, amended in 1960 and 1969, contained the same set
of basic incentives as the Industrial Incentives Law, but in addition provc.,u
exemption from all indirect taxes and made available benefits normally asso-
ciated with free trade zones to firms exporting 100% of their production volume
to non-CARICOM markets. This resulted in the establishment of some 170 so-
called "export enclave" firms performing assembly operations mostly in the
garments field and a few in electronics, sports equipment, toys, processed
foods, and leather goods. Because of inordinately high wage increases between
1972 and 1976, coupled with an overvalued currency, by 1978 only 30 of these
firms remained. The most affected subsector was clothing, which decreased
from 18% (US$8.9 million) of total manufactured exports in 1972 to only 4%
(US$3.1 million) by 1977 (see Table 8).
67.       In recent years Jamaican manufactured exports have become highly
dependent on the CARICOM market. Thus, while exports to CARICOM more than
doubled from US$16 million in 1972 to US$36 million in 1977, exports to
international markets only increased from US$32 million in 1972 to US$34
million in 1977, in current terms. Furthermore, beverages and tobacco products
accounted for US$11 million of the exports to international markets in 1972,
and US$21 million in 1977. Thus, other than beverages and tobacco, exports
to international markets decreased substantially. This decrease was due
mostly to the closing down of the export enclave firms, but is also in part
a result of the nature of the remaining high cost Jamaican manufacturing
infrastructure and the protection afforded to Jamaican products in the CARICOM
market. With the increase in local costs and the fixed exchange rate up to
1977, to remain profitable many exporters concentrated on CARICOM where they
enjoyed higher prices--about 20% on average in 1977--than in international
markets. As a result, CARICOM markets offer few new opportunities, and any
further significant export gains will have to be made in the international
market where Jamaican manufacturers on the whole have not been cost competi-
tive.
Prospects
68.       The Government's Five-Year Development Plan for the period 1978-82
calls for a 4 to 5% annual growth of the manufacturing sector. To achieve
this growth, the Government has given priority to increasing exports of manu-
factured goods, and to development of deeper and wider linkages within the
sector and with other sectors to stimulate the economy and to reduce the
import dependence of manufacturing. In the short term, if a reliable supply
of foreign exchange is made available to the sector, which is one of the main
purposes of the proposed Bank loan, the 25% export growth registered in 1978
can be sustained as exporters try to recover the markets they abandoned prior
to the 1977-78 currency and wage adjustments. Also, those domestic market
oriented manufacturers who previously enjoyed high profit margins, or whose
marginal cost of production does not exceed the world price of the products
concerned, will be able to utilize some of their idle capacity for the export
market.

69.       However, to achieve a sustained 25% yearly export growth beyond 1980,
or above levels of about US$140 to US$160 million, important changes to the
industrial infrastructure and incentive system will be required. During the
next two years it will be necessary to improve significantly the cost competi-
tiveness of Jamaican products with a comparative advantage outside of CARICOM,
and to develop the marketing know-how and managerial drive necessary to pene-
trate new international markets. This task will require inter alia the follow-
ing major changes: (i) adjustments in export promotion and import substitution
policies to redress the imbalances in incentives which favor import substitu-
tion and production for the local market and CARICOM over exports to interna-
tional markets; (ii) expansion of the exportable product mix by better iden-
tification of the country's comparative advantages, and development and
implementation of meaningful and well targeted programs to promote production
of goods that are competitive outside of CARICOM; (iii) improvement of the
physical plant, including capital investment for retooling and expansion of
existing capacity, and new plant and equipment for products with a comparative
advantage; 1/ (iv) expansion and training of the existing managerial pool,
particularly in the fields of export marketing, cost accounting and industrial
engineering; and (v) reorientation of the private sector, which to date has
been accustomed to relatively well protected low volume and high margin sales
within the country and CARICOM, to production for export. The Government
shares these views and its export promotion program addresses these issues.
70.       Critical to the prospects of the manufacturing sector for both the
domestic and export markets is a restoration of confidence by the private
sector, which still has a dominant role in manufacturing. The deterioration
in private sector confidence over the last several years has caused entrepre-
neurs, managers, and professionals to emigrate, resulted in capital flight
and sharply curtailed the avaiability of new capital for the sector. The
causes for the deterioration in confidence are complex. Some of the most
frequently mentioned causes are the rising crime rate of the last several
years, labor unrest and violence, the alleged ill-defined respective roles
of the private and public sectors, the high tax structure, shortages of
materials and foreign exchange for necessary imports, lack of demand in the
local market and the belief by some businessmen that Government neither
understands nor is sympathetic to their problems. The Government is aware of
the confidence problem and one of its objectives has been to restore the
confidence of the private sector and encourage savings and investment. To
this end it has adopted some of the measures discussed above and elsewhere
in this paper--a restrictive wage policy, a realistic exchange rate policy,
a partial liberalization of prices, development of an export promotion program,
initiation of a review of the tax structure to remove disincentives for
production, establishment of a clearer definition of the members of the
economic team and the business community. As a result of these efforts, there
has been some noticeable shift in the attitude of the private sector to a
cautiously more positive view of the future.
1/   The Bank staff intends to review the possibility of future financing of
a project that would provide long-term credits for export activities.



- 33 -
Policies and Incentives
71.       The Government has indicated in its attached letter (Annex IV) to
the Bank that it is keenly aware of the sectoral requirements for rapid short-
term export gains and sustained long-term export development. The letter
outlines the main export targets and policies of the Government.
*           72.       During the last 18 months, the Government has taken a number of
substantive steps designed to support its export promotion policy, and it
has entered into a continuing dialogue with the private sector to assure that
new policies are compatible with the needs of exporters. The most significant
short-term steps taken were the adoption of realistic exchange rate and wage
policies. Also, the Jamaica National Export Corporation (JNEC), which provides
export marketing services to local firms in the private sector, has been
restructured and substantially strengthened. Under JNEC, the Jamaica Export
Trading Company was formed to locate export markets and provide sales services
to new exporters and to small scale enterprises; the Trade Commissioner Service
has been strengthened and now has marketing officers based in Brussels, London,
Toronto, New York, Miami, and Port of Spain; and product design, production,
quality control, and shipping technical assistance is now being provided to
local manufacturers by a growing group of specialists hired for the purpose
by JNEC. A component of the proposed Bank loan would be utilized to provide
JNEC with technical assistance to review its rapidly expanding operations and
further strengthen its internal and delivery capabilities.
73.       The Government is particularly committed to the development of small
scale enterprise as a means of increasing production and employment, and devel-
oping more labor intensive exports and further backward linkages. The Bank
has been working closely with the Government in this area and is providing
direct assistance under the Small Scale Enterprise Loan approved by the Board
in July 1978. The development of the Kingston Free Zone has also been expe-
dited to attract foreign investors and sub-contracting operations. Jamaica
has unique comparative advantages for these types of industries, which have
the potential of creating a substantial number of new employment opportunities,
as illustrated by the large number of export enclave firms that operated in
the country prior to the 1973-77 economic and political developments. With
the restoration of internationally competitive wage levels, and its announced
intention to maintain its export competitiveness, Jamaica hopes to recover
many of the industries it lost. In this respect it is noted that considerable
interest has been expressed by international investors ready to utilize the
new Kingston Free Zone's facilities as they become available.
74.       A major constraint for exporting over the last two years has been
the uncertain availability of foreign exchange. Accordingly, the Government,
working closely with the private sector, adopted early this year a Certified.
Export Status scheme which will provide foreign exchange on a priority basis
to certified exporters for necessary imports, expedite the import licensing
process and confer certain other benefits. The proposed Bank loan would meet
some of the foreign exchange needs of exporters and assure that a minimum level
of foreign exchange for imports is made available to exports on a continuing



- 34 -
basis.  Pending the proposed Bank loan, exporters who have been certif -d
date are being given preferential access to the foreign exchange available
after the country's requirements for debt service, fuel, food, drugs, and
basic necessities are met.  A number of criteria for detc-t4intg            4
for the certified exporter status have been set forth and are being further
refined in line with the conditions set forth in the next section for the
utilization of foreign exchange that the proposed Bank loan would make avai-iL
able. In general, the criteria are designed to assure that the exporter is
a bona fide exporter, with either a record of performance, or a credible plan
for future performance; that the firm is capable of expanding exports in
coming years sufficiently to help meet the overall non-traditional exports
growth target of 25% yearly; and that there is a net foreign exchange gain
to the country resulting from the export sales. The Government and private
sector consider the full implementation of the Certified Export Status scheme
of paramount importance to meet the short-term export targets of the sector
and to establish a base from which to start working on development of a
long-term export base.
75.       Recently, the Government has also become more receptive to direct
foreign investment, and is quietly but aggressively promoting it, particularly
where it can contribute to increased exports. To that effect, the Government
has codified the general provisions, principles, regulations and administrative
policies for the approval of foreign direct investment and subsequent transac-
tions of subsidiaries of foreign companies. Although joint ventures are
encouraged, full foreign ownership is welcomed in certain activities, parti-
cularly in those that are export oriented or which depend on technology that
is controlled by the parent company and which is of interest for the develop-
ment of the Jamaican economy.  The past 7% limitation on the amount of profits
that can be distributed as dividends is not being applied at present and the
Government has indicated it is not planning to do so in the future. Also,
restrictions on royalty payments have been relaxed, and repatriation of regis-
tered capital is allowed without limitation.
76.       At the end of last year the Special Export Incentive scheme was
enacted under the CARICOM Harmonization of Fiscal Incentives Program. This
is a partial income tax credit provision, with 10 years duration, to provide
incentives for export sales outside CARICOM to firms not benefitting from tax
holidays provided by previous incentives laws. The amount of the tax credit
increases up to a maximum of 50% of the export profits of firms who export 60%
or more of their total sales. Because the tax credit is applied specifically
to the earnings of export sales it will prove difficult to administer. Further-
more, many existing and potential new exporters are or will be exporting at
the margin at least until their products become well established in foreign
markets and local manufacturing becomes more efficient. The Special Export
Incentive scheme will thus be of limited, if any, value in providing new
incentives to exports. The Government has for the past twelve months been
working on a tax reform package that would modify the existing structure
of personal and corporate income taxes. The Bank staff has been in communi-
cation with the Government and with the IMF which, since last year, has
had a team assisting the Jamaican Government develop the tax reform package.



- 35 -
77.       Achievement of the Government's export targets for manufactured goods
will depend on modifying those industrial policies and incentives which have
resulted in the creation of a highly protected and inefficient import substitu-
tion industry, which has made it more profitable for manufacturers to produce
for the domestic, rather than the export market. The Government agrees that
the imbalance in incentives offered producers for the domestic market and those
offered producers for export should be redressed. The action taken in this
area cannot be precipitous, because of the delicate relations of the Government
with the private sector, who may interpret any action to reduce incentives to
domestic industry as further proof of the Government's alleged antipathy to
the business community. In addition, manufacturers for the domestic market are
important employers of labor, and the current high unemployment rate would make
it difficult to take actions which would result in further layoffs. Finally,
to the extent that incentives are changed through tax measures, or the payment
of cash subsidies, the revenue implications would have to be consistent with
the Government's overall economic program. As indicated in the attached
Annex IV letter, however, the Government has agreed to give high priority to
the review and resolution of the problem and has agreed to discuss its findings
and proposed actions with the Bank.
PART VI - LOAN DESCRIPTION
78.       The proposed loan is in response to a Government request for balance
of payments assistance made to Bank management in Washington in September 1978.
A Bank appraisal mission for the proposed loan visited Jamaica in late November/
early December 1978. The Bank mission coincided with the Government review
and formulation of a program to stimulate the growth of non-traditional manu-
factured exports. The Minister of Finance expressed his interest in using the
proposed Bank loan as the focal point for the program that his Government was
developing for expanding exports and to use all of the Bank funds that would be
made available for financing the import requirements of exporters of manufac-
tured goods and for technical assistance to provide institutional support to
those same exporters. The Government's proposed targets, policies, strategy
and measures for realizing its export drive, as well as the use of the resources
that would be made available by the proposed Bank loan, were further appraised
by subsequent Bank missions in February and March 1979. Negotiations were held
in Washington in April 1979. The Jamaican delegation was led by Mr. Ainsley
Elliott, Deputy Financial Secretary, Ministry of Finance and Planning.
Loan Amount and Objectives
79.       The proposed loan amount is $31.5 million.  Thirty million of loan
funds would be used to establish a revolving Export Development Fund to finance
imports of raw materials, intermediate goods and spare parts for producers of
non-traditional exports and their domestic suppliers. The remaining 1.5
million of loan funds would be used for technical assistance to strengthen
the institutional capabilities of the Government agencies responsible for
providing exporters with marketing, financial, production and other technical
and administrative support. In addition to providing Jamaica with short-term
balance of payments assistance, the loan would be expected to induce a



- 36 -
sustained export drive and long-term development of the country's non-
traditional exports by: assuring a continued availability of foreign exchange
to meet the import requirements of non-traditional exporters; complementing
the export development policies being implemented by the Government; and
strengthening the institutional infrastructure that provides assistance and
support to exporters. The act of creating the revolving Fund, together with
the continued availability of foreign exchange that would result, would
provide additional confidence among exporters about the Government's commit-
ment to support their export development programs. The foreign exchange
shortages of the last several years resulted in periods when there was no
foreign exchange available to exporters and when no assurances were given by
the Government as to when foreign exchange might be made available. Under
these circumstances exporters could not make production plans and there was
no incentive to make capital investments. The creation of the Fund and the
assurance of foreign exchange availability it will provide should help over-
come this problem. The project would thus encourage new investments for
export market development, and for new plant and equipment.
The Export Development Fund
80.       The proposed loan would be made to the Government of Jamaica who
in turn would relend US$30 million to the Export Development Fund (the Fund)
at an interest rate equal to the rate of interest on the Bank loan payable in
10 to 20 years with a grace period for interest and principal at least equal
to five years. Approval by the Bank of a subsidiary loan agreement would be
a condition of loan effectiveness (Section 6.01 of Loan Agreement). The Fund
would be a government-owned legal entity controlled and administered by the
Bank of Jamaica through its wholly owned subsidiary, the Jamaica Export
Credit Insurance Corporation (JECIC). The Fund would have authority to
hold and manage its liquid foreign exchange assets and as a condition of loan
effectiveness would receive the necessary exchange control approvals and
exemptions to do so (Sections 3.04 and 6.01 of Loan Agreement) The establish-
ment of the Fund and the appointment of its Board of Directors would be
conditions of loan effectiveness (Section 6.01 of Loan Agreement). The
Government would assure that the Fund would have a minimum existence of five
years unless the Government and Bank otherwise agree (Section 3.03 of Loan
Agreement). The operations of the Fund would be subject to a Statement of
Policies and Procedures that would be approved by the Bank as a condition of
loan effectiveness (Section 6.01 of Loan Agreement). Additional operating
guidance would be provided by the Fund's Board of Directors which would be
chaired by the head of JECIC and include in its membership representatives of
the Bank of Jamaica, the Ministry of Industry (through the Trade Administrator),
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (through the head of the JNEC), the Ministry
of Finance, and the private sector. Loans denominated in Jamaican dollars
indexed to the US dollar, would be made by commercial banks to eligible
exporters and discounted by the Fund. Thus, commercial banks would assume
the credit risk and borrowers the US dollar exchange risk, while the Fund
would discount the loans and guarantee their convertibility into US dollars.
81.       Upon receiving an import license and JECIC s approval for access
to the Fund, eligible exporters would arrange a US dollar equivalent loan
with a commercial bank of their choice to pay for the import. The process
would be expedited by the Government assuring that persons and entities granted



- 37 -
access to the Fund would be promptly granted import licenses (Section 3.02
of Loan Agreement). Once the foreign supplier is paid, the commercial bank
would discount the loan made to the exporter. To that end, the commercial
bank would furnish the Fund with; a properly endorsed debt instrument;
a copy of JECIC's approval of access to the Fund; import shipping documents;
and evidence of payment to foreign suppliers or creditors. Upon approval of
the operation, the Fund would credit the commercial bank with the foreign
exchange amount of the debt instrument.
82.       Financing would be limited to the import of raw materials, inter-
mediate goods, packaging materials and spare parts entering into the manufac-
ture of non-traditional exports, including the processing and packaging of
agricultural products. In the case of firms that are net earners of foreign
exchange, financing would be made available for all of the direct import
requirements of the firm, including those necessary to satisfy their domestic
sales. For firms that are not net earners of foreing exchange, financing
would be limited to the value of the direct imports required exclusively for
the production of goods that would be exported. Local firms manufacturing
intermediate goods utilized by eligible exporters would also be eligible for
financing up to an amount not to exceed the direct import content of goods on
order from exporters for use in the manufacture of export goods also being
financed from the Fund's resources. Only exporters with an established record
of performance, or a credible plan for future performance, would be eligible
for financing. It is expected that exporters would use the Fund's resources
at least once a year, but the Fund would in general not finance new imports
of an exporter who has failed to perform as agreed upon to the export of
previously financed imports. Export performance would be monitored by JECIC
who would prepare quarterly reports of substance and in form acceptable to
the Bank (Section 2.06 of Project Agreement).
83.       Commercial bank loans to exporters would be extended for a period
not to exceed the export cycle, or 365 days, whichever is shorter. In the
case of local firms manufacturing intermediate goods utilized by eligible
exporters, the terms of the financing would extend to the expected time of
delivery to the exporter. During the first six months of operation of the
Fund, interest rates to beneficiaries would be based on the Bank loan rate
(which would be the discount rate of the fund) plus a 1% per annum adminis-
tration fee to JECIC and a spread to commercial banks not to exceed a rate of
3% per annum. Thereafter interest rates would be reviewed every six months
to assure positive and commercially competitive lending rates (Section 2.04
of Project Agreement). Repayment of principal and interest would be withheld
from the proceeds of export sales. To this effect, upon receipt of the export
proceeds the commercial bank would repay the Fund the principal and interest
due, and would surrender the remaining foreign exchange to the Bank of Jamaica.
The exporting firm would receive the local currency equivalent of the remain-
ing foreign exchange. The commercial bank would, at the time of credit
approval, establish an amortization schedule, in consultation with JECIC,
compatible with the enterprise's expected export program. The same procedure
would apply to firms manufacturing intermediate goods for exporters, except
that since no foreign exchange would be earned at the time of sale, the
commercial banks would surrender to the Bank of Jamaica the local currency



- 38 -
equivalent of the US dollars due to the Fund. In this case, the Bank of
Jamaica would replenish the US dollars due to the Fund 90 days after receipt
of the local currency equivalents (Section 4.01 of Project Agreement).
84.       To maintain the foreign exchange integrity of the Fund, the Bank
of Jamaica would replenish the Fund with US dollars whenever: a) the export
cycle exceeds 365 days at which time the Bank of Jamaica would take over
the debt instrument deposited in the Fund in exchange for US dollars; b) a
firm fails to export or defaults on its subloan in which case the Bank of
Jamaica would exchange the local currency then deposited in the Fund by the
commercial bank for US dollars; and c) soft currencies are earned from export
sales (Section 4.01 of the Project Agreement).
85.       The Statement of Policies and Procedures descibed above would
regulate the administration of the resources of the Fund, and would describe,
inter alia, the following: (i) activities and items eligible for financing;
(ii) sources and uses of resources, including management of the Fund's liquid
assets; (iii) duties and responsibilities of the coordinating committee, the
Bank of Jamaica, the Office of the Trade Administrator and JECIC in the
issuance of import licenses to eligible exporters, and of the commercial banks;
(iv) criteria, including priorities, for access to the Fund; and (v) methods
of processing, approving and supervising the discount operations of the
Fund. The Fund and the operations of JECIC would be audited by independent
auditors acceptable to the Bank. Designation of an auditor acceptable to the
Bank to audit the operations of the Fund would be a condition of loan effec-
tiveness (Section 6.01 of Loan Agreement). The audited accounts would be
submitted to the Bank within four months of the close of each fiscal year
(Section 5.02 of Project Agreement).
Resources
86.       It is expected that during the first year of operation the Fund's
resources would turn-over 1.3 times a year, thus making available US$40 million
or some 70% of the US$55 to US$60 million required to support an export volume
of US$110 million during 1979. The creation of the Fund would also be expected
to encourage foreign suppliers, overseas confirming houses and foreign commer-
cial banks to reinstate short-term credit lines to help finance the import
requirements of Jamaican exporters. Because of Jamaica's very tight foreign
exchange situation, during the last two years suppliers' open account, and
sight drafts and other acceptances, which at one time provided as much as 85%
of all import financing and were normally for terms ranging from 90 to 180
days, were replaced by commercial banks' letters of credit wherein the commer-
cial bank assumed the foreign exchange obligation to the overseas supplier.
However, because Jamaica's foreign exchange situation has continued to deter-
iorate and commercial banks have had difficulties in obtaining cover from the
Bank of Jamaica, they have limited the amount of letter of credit operations
and have reduced their terms to 30 to 90 days. With the creation of the Fund,
the cover for letters of credit and other supplier import financing would
de facto be guaranteed. To the extent that this guaranteed cover would allow
exporters to negotiate better terms abroad, the availability of foreign
exchange to the sector would be expanded and the Fund's resources could be
utilized to finance a larger volume of imports. Exporters will be encouraged
to use the Fund's ability to cover foreign exchange obligations to negotiate
better terms overseas and thus increase the rotation of the Fund's resources.



- 39 -
Cofiniancing
87.       In order to meet demand in excess of the Fund's resources and make
available a reasonable reserve of foreign exchange with which to further
guarantee cover of suppliers' credit, the Government has expressed interest
in the Bank exploring possible cofinancing of the Fund. Conversations have
been held with four major banks, who have expressed some interest in consid-
ering the possibility of participating after the Fund becomes operational.
In general, these banks recommend that the Fund operate with as much autonomy
as possible and be managed in a way that commands the respect and confidence
of the private sector. They have, however, indicated that their financing of
the Fund would be dependent on its first establishing a track record which
would meet the foregoing criteria and the more general economic considerations
that would influence a decision to increase their exposure in Jamaica. Prelim-
inary discussions have also taken place with other official sources of finan-
cing about their interest in the proposed program. In the event that co-
financing materializes in amounts greater than the likely demand for resources
from the Fund by exporters and should there be undisbursed Bank resources
still available, a request to the Executive Directors might be made that they
authorize the use of such loan resources to finance other essential imports.
In the alternative consideration could also be given to expanding the Fund role
to finance the import needs of traditional and agricultural exporters. At
present, however, it is not anticipated that cofinancing agreements would be
arranged prior to the disbursement of Bank loan funds, or that, if it did
materialize that the total fund resource availability would exceed the demand
from qualified exporters.
Technical Assistance
88.       During the last year JECIC has expanded its activities considerably
beyond its original functions of insurer of export credit, and operator of
three relatively small local currency pre- and post-shipment financing funds.
JECIC negotiated and is now managing supplier lines of credit from six
countries, is currently negotiating a seventh line and has recently under-
taken export credit guarantee operations. All of these activities have given
JECIC considerable experience relevant to the management of the Fund. However,
they have also resulted in a substantial dilution of its technical and
managerial resources. As a consequence, JECIC is in need of additional trained
manpower, a restructuring of existing responsibilities and workloads, updating
of its operating policies and procedures, and implementation of new cash flow
and other management information systems necessary to carry out its expanded
functions effectively. The proposed Bank loan includes $900,000 for technical
assistance for JECIC, which would cover the salaries and expenses of six man
years (three men for two years each) of internationally recruited personnel
who would work full-time with JECIC and about 80 man months for the services
of short-term consultants. These resources would be for establishment and
initial operation of the Fund and for strengthening JECIC's other programs.
Over the next twelve months JECIC will have to double its current staff of 20,
and the internationally recruited experts would be expected to carry out a
comprehensive on-the-job training program of the existing and new staff.



- 40 -
Retroactive financing of up to $200,000 would be provided in the loan to cover
the cost of technical assistance services purchased by JECIC since November 1,
1978. JECIC would submit its consulting contracts to the Bank for approval
and furnish counterparts to work with the three longer term consultants
(Section 2.02 of Project Agreement).
89.       The remaining $600,000 of technical assistance funds in the loan
would be for the JNEC--Jamaica National Export Corporation. As outlined in
para. 72, JNEC has over the last two years substantially increased the scope
of operations in support of Jamaican exporters, particularly small scale
enterprise. JNEC is badly in need of assistance to help in identifying more
clearly the needs of exporters and the best methods of delivering the assis-
tance they require, and in this context, to help in reviewing JNEC's own
operations, establishing priorities for its activities, and strengthening
its organizational structure, personnel and procedures. JNEC would submit to
the Bank within six months of loan signing a survey of its technical assis-
tance needs (Section 2.02 of Project Agreement). A portion of the technical
assistance funds would be used by JNEC to secure assistance in evaluating
industrial policies and export policies and incentives which would help
Jamaica meet its export goals. JNEC would submit the proposed contracts for
technical assistance to the Bank for approval (Section 2.02 of Project
Agreement).
Disbursement and Procurement
90.       The Jamaican Government has committed itself to a program which
would maintain the international competitiveness of its exports. It recognizes
that the maintenance of such competitiveness is vital to the success of its
export expansion goals. It has agreed to undertake a review with the Bank of
the competitiveness of its exports in the international markets. The review
is to take place no later than October 31, 1979 (Section 3.05, Loan Agreement)
and no disbursements in excess of US$15 million to the Export Development
Fund may be made before that date (para. 2, Schedule 1, Loan Agreement). If
the review determines that there has been no loss in the international
competitiveness of Jamaica's exports since April 30, 1979, disbursements of
the balance of the US$30 million available to the Fund would continue. In
the event it is found that there has been a significant loss in the competi-
tiveness of Jamaican exports, disbursements to the Fund beyond October 31,
1979 would not continue, except with respect to commitments made before
October 31, 1979 and up to a US$15 million maximum, unless the Bank and the
Borrower agree on appropriate measures to be taken by the Borrower to restore
the competitiveness of exports.
91.       Procurement would be made by firms using normal commercial practice
from Bank member countries and Switzerland. Since procurement for imports to
be financed by the Fund would depend on the decision of many enterprises for a
large number of items, international competitive bidding would not be practic-
able. Reimbursement for procurement of individual items costing the equivalent
of $100,000 or more would, however, have to be supported by evidence that the
purchasers had sought at least three price quotations (Section 2.03 of Project



- 41 -
Agreement). As JECIC evolves, a qualified individual would be added to the
staff to audit prices paid abroad and the use of imported goods in the amounts
financed for the production of export products. There would be no retroactive
financing of exporters' imports, but goods imported under licenses or letters
of credit issued before the date of signing of the Bank loan agreement but
paid after that date would be eligible for reimbursement. JECIC would be
responsible for collecting, through the commercial banks, invoices, evidence
of shipment and evidence that the foreign suppliers have received payment.
Disbursements would be made against certificates of expenditure issued by
JECIC. The detailed documentation evidencing the final expenditure would be
retained by JECIC and be available for inspection by the Bank during the
course of project supervision missions.  JECIC would further certify that it
has not claimed financing for these imports from any other source. In the
light of present import requirements for export, it is expected that this
portion of the loan would be disbursed within eight months after loan signing.
It is estimated that about half the technical assistance component would be
disbursed within the first year after signing, and the balance in equal parts
during the following two years.
PART VII - BENEFITS AND RISKS
92.       The principal benefits anticipated from the proposed loan are the
following:
(a) Loan resources would permit the importation of necessary raw
materials, intermediate goods and spare parts to utilize
existing unutilized industrial capacity. The loan would
finance 5% of Jamaica's imports of such materials in its
fiscal year 1979/80.
(b) The loan would enable exporters to obtain their import
requirements and help increase non-traditional manu-
factured exports from $88 million in 1978 to $265
million in 1983.
(c)  The Bank's lending action and the IMF Extended Fund Facility
would encourage other countries and institutions to provide
similar assistance to Jamaica. In June 1978, other donors,
participating in the Bank-led Caribbean Group for Coopera-
tion in Economic Development, committed $53.6 million of
such assistance to Jamaica.
(d) The loan would be a focal point for the Government program
to increase exports, serve as a demonstration of its
interest and concern for the private sector and provide
important technical assistance for institutions serving
manufacturers for export.



- 42 -
(e) The increased output and employment opportunities generated
by the loan would help create conditions making it possible
for the Government to carry out its economic stabilization
program.
93.       The principal risks in the loan are the following:
(a) The Government's stabilization program has imposed a reduced
standard of living on Jamaicans. Wage increases have been
held to between 15% to 20% during a period when inflation has
been about 50%. Consumer imports have been severely curtailed
over the last year, resulting in the unavailability of certain
luxury goods and occasional shortages of necessities. Unem-
ployment levels remain at almost the level that were in place
before the program began. In short, the population at large
has not yet seen the results of its sacrifices and unless
economic improvements become apparent over the next year, it
may become increasingly difficult for the Government to maintain
key elements of the stabilization program. In this regard, the
most vulnerable element of the program would be the Government's
wage policy. If the Government were not able to maintain its
wage policy, this could have an adverse effect on the competitive-
ness of Jamaican exports in international markets.
(b) The success of the export program will depend on entrepreneurs
responding positively to the programs instituted by the Government
and being successful in their marketing efforts. The response
of the entrepreneurs could be limited by the damage that has been
done to the manufacturing sector by emigration and the erosion
of confidence. The ability of the sector to export will depend
on producing acceptable products at competitive prices and then
being able to market them.
94.       If the Government pursues its present plans a growth pattern can
be restored to the economy which would limit the macroeconomic risks, and
the incentives available to the private sector should be sufficient to
encourage manufacturing for export and stimulate a successful marketing
effort. The economic review which is to take place in October 1979 (see
para 90) is intended to monitor accomplishments in these areas carefully
as a condition of further disbursement.
PART VIII - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
95.       The draft Loan Agreement between Jamaica and the Bank, the draft
Project Agreement between the Bank of Jamaica, the Jamaica Export Credit
Insurance Corporation and the Bank and the report of the Committee provided
for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement are being
distributed separately. Special conditions of the loan are listed in Annex
III, Section III. Special conditions of effectiveness are: (a) that the



- 43 -
Export Development Fund be established and its Board be appointed; (b) that
the Borrower shall provide the necessary exchange control approvals to permit
the Fund to hold and manage its liquid foreign exchange assets; (c) that
a satisfactory Statement of Policies and Procedures governing the operation
of the Export Development Fund be submitted to the Bank; (d) designation
of an auditor acceptable to the Bank to audit the operations of the Fund;
and (e) a satisfactory subsidiary loan agreement betwen the Government and
the Fund. A special condition of disbursement is that no more than US$15
million of disbursements may be made to the Export Development Fund before
October 31, 1979 and disbursements to the Fund will only take place beyond
that date if Jamaican exports have retained their international competitive-
ness or appropriate measures have been taken to restores such competitiveness,
except for commitments made before October 31, 1979 totalling less than
US$15 million.
96.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART IX - RECOMMENDATION
97.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C.   Projects in Execution
Ln. No. 727   Second Education Project; US$13.5 million of March 25, 1971;
Effective Date: July 30, 1971; Closing Date. June 30, 1979.
Project implementation is about three years behind appraisal
schedule due to a change in government, high turnover in project unit staff
and a lack of project implementation machinery. However, project implemen-
tation now seems satisfactory.
Ln. No. 899   Road Improvement and Maintenance Project  US$9.3 million of
June 1, 1973; Effective Date. August 31, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1979.
Increased costs have made it necessary to reduce by almost
50% the number of miles which were to be resurfaced. The loan has succeeded
in resurfacing 220 miles of road and resealing an additional 240 miles of
road, while making a substantial contribution toward improving the quality of
maintenance work and preserving the road network.
Ln. No. 1003 Sites and Services Project; US$15.0 million of June 13, 1974;
Effective Date: September 9, 1974; Closing Date: December 31, 1980.
Delays in the project have been caused by initial start-up
problems, political violence and ineffective management controls. The project
is about 18 months behind schedule and costs are running 50% more than anti-
cipated. The Government has adopted measures suggested by the Bank to improve
management systems and controls.

Ln. No. 1004 Second Agricultural Credit Project; US$5.5 million of
June 13. 1974, Effective Date: October 3, 1974;
Closing Date: June 30. 1979.
The difficult general economic situation and unfavorable weather
conditions have had a negative impact on the Borrower (the Jamaica Development
Bank) and the project. As a result, arrears on principal and interest payments
have risen to unacceptable levels. The Jamaica Development Bank has initiated
an in-depth review of its loan portfolio, including the reappraisal and
rescheduling of loans and the strengthening of collection activities.
Ln. No. 1032 Third Highway Project; US$13.5 million of July 26, 1974;
Effective Date: September 27, 1974; Closing Date: March 31, 1980.
Construction has been delayed due to adverse weather conditions,
redesign of some sections, unsuccessful tenders and labor problems. Addi-
tional delays have been experienced because of the departure of qualified
personnel from the Ministry of Works and because of the lack of equipment and
equipment failures. Project implementation has been improving and the project
is now scheduled to be completed by mid-1980.
Ln. No. 1043 Airport Development Project; US$12.5 million of October 2, 1974;
Effective Date: March 14, 1975; Closing Date: December 31, 1979.
All major contracts have now been awarded, but earlier delays
encountered during the design and award phase, mean that the project completion
date will slip from 12 to 18 months, and the project cost will probably exceed
appraisal estimates by about 10%. Though execution of work in progress has
been slower than expected, the Government's tight fiscal situation makes the
revised construction schedule more acceptable. The Airports Authority's
aggressive management has improved this institution's financial position in
spite of reduced traffic and high inflation. Nonetheless, the Authority will
be unable to supply its contribution to the project financing plan. The
shortfall will be made up by the Government with help from the Venezuelan
Investment Fund.
Ln. No. 1146 Kingston Sewerage and Water Supply Project; US$15 million of
July 23, 1975; Effective Date: June 24, 1976;
Closing Date: June 30 1981.
After some initial delays in establishing the project unit,
project implementation is proceeding satisfactorily. Construction has begun
on all of the subcomponents of the water supply construction program and been
comnpleted on one of them.
Ln. No. 1284 Second Population Project; US$6.8 million of June 17, 1976;
Effective Date: August 30, 1976; Closing Date. December 31, 1980.
Civil works and procurement are on schedule and project costs are
within appraisal estimates. The project is proceeding satisfactorily.

Ln. No. 1464  Rural Development Project. US$15 million of June 29, 1977;
Effective Date: October 14, 1977; Closing Date: June 30, 1981.
After initial delays due to administrative problems, implemen-
tation has improved and fieldwork in all project components has been initiated.
Preparatory selection work of prospective settlers is progressing satisfac-
torily, but the physical settling of selected farmers has been constrained by
the lack of land survey services. Delays in implementation have caused cost
overruns in some project components.
Ln. No. 1516  Second Power Project; US$20 million of March 6, 1978;
Effective Date June 1, 1978; Closing Date: September 30, 1982.
Delays of about 4 to 6 months have been experienced in the
initial steps of project execution, as well as with the selection of key
personnel. A slow-down in economic activity and a devaluation of the Jamaican
dollar have strained the borrower's finances. The Government has granted an
increase in tariffs to help ease the situation. The Project description has
been amended to incorporate the project component for rehabilitating existing
generating units and for purchase of spare parts. The new component will be
financed by a $3.3 million loan to Jamaica from the OPEC Special Fund made
under a loan agreement dated December 19, 1978. The Bank will act as the
administrator of the OPEC Special Fund loan.
Ln. No. 1517  Sugar Rehabilitation Project; US$18 million of March 6, 1978;
Effective Date June 1, 1978; Closing Date: June 30 1983.
The project is proceeding on schedule.
Ln. No. 1609  Small Scale Enterprise Development Project; US$7 million of
August 2, 1978; Effective Date December 29, 1978;
Closing Date: June 30 1982.
Implementation is proceeding as scheduled. The program has
received substantial support from the commercial banking system and other
financial intermediaries. The work on the proposed manufacturing sector
survey has been initiated. The commitment under Sub-Program I (modern small
scale enterprises - $4.5 million) will star: ')y July 1979. The commitment
under Sub-Program II (very small scale enterprises - about $2.0 million) has
been delayed due to the organization problem faced by the Small Enterprises
Development Corporation (SEDCO), the implementing agency.  However, appropriate
actions are being taken to strengthen SEDCO.

MINISTRY OF FINANCE AND PLANNING

ANNEX IV
Dear Mr. McNamara:
The principal elements of the Government of Jamaica's development
strategy are contained in the "Five Year Development Plan, 1978-82"
which was approved by the Cabinet in October 1978 and presented to the
House of Representatives and published in December 1978.   It is the
purpose of this letter to explain briefly the main elements of the
Government's strategy, especially as it affects the prospects for the
growth of exports, and the growth of non-traditional manufactured and
processed agricultural products in particular.   This letter will also
indicate some of the actions that have been and will be taken by the
Government to implement its strategy.
The Plan proposes placing the economy on a growth path through
increasing exports, doubling the rates of saving and stimulating the
productive sectors to improved performance.   The principal means to be
employed are a flexible use of exchange rate policy, a prices and
incomes policy which will maintain production incentives, and careful
fiscal and monetary policies, supported by a realistic public investment
program and keep local production costs in line with international
competitive conditions.   The target is to achieve an average growth of
GDP of 3-4% over the Plan period and to reduce unemployment from its
present 24% to 15% or less of the labor force.   Growth will be
structured so as to emphasize activities which either save or generate
foreign exchange.   As a result, the Plan projects that growth will be
led by the following sectors (with the a-!erage per annum growth stated
for the Plan period in parenthesis): tourism. (15%); agriculture (7%);
bauxite/alumina (6%); and manufacturing (4-5%).
In view of the significant under-utilized industrial plant capacity
and the potential for realizing significant increases in exports in a rela-
tively short period, the Government has decided to place particular
emphasis on export development of non-traditional manufactures and
processed agricultural products.   Specifically, the target for 1983 is
that exports of manufactures, excluding petroleum products, reach
US$265 million, which would be the result of a 25% nominal annual growth
rate, or a threefold increase over the 8% annual growth rate experienced
between 1972 and 1977.   Exports of non-traditional agricultural products
are expected to grow at a more modest pace of 15% annually as the country
has yet to become self-sufficient in some areas of this sector, and
production programmes for export will need to be planned and implemented
on a carefully scheduled basis.
During the next two to three years the planned increase in manufac-
tured exports will be brought about mainly through fuller use of existing
capacity in the food, garments, leather and wood products, and assembly of
electrical and mechanical equipment industries; through recovery of markets
lost prior to the recent currency adjustments; and through diversion from
domestic use of some products, such as non-essential consumer goods, as a
result of the contraction of the local market for these products.  Beyond
1980 continued growth of manufactured exports will depend on new export
oriented investment projects which the Government will actively promote
in the coming two years.

The Government believes that this high export growth rate is
teasible given tne initially low level of Jamaican exports, but it
recognizes tnat achievement of the targets will require vigorous
implementation of appropriate policy measures and careful monitoring or
performance throughout the period.
To achieve the planned export targets, the Government intends
to make exporting at least as profitable as selling in the domestic
market. This will require measures to ensure that Jamaican exports are
cost and price competitive in world markets, and an appropriate currency
value response to divergencies between tne rate ol inflation in Jamaica
and in the economies or her trading partners. It will also require that
protection of the domestic market through duties, quantitative restrictions,
and preferential treatment of local manufacturers be carerully examined and
harmonized so tnat domestic sales do not continue to be unduly profitable
relative to exports. In addition, the (Government intends to consider
financial incentives to exporters to the extent consistent with the balanced
use of the country's endowments, with prudent management of the public
finances, ana witn tne  ieneral Agreements on Tariffs and Trade since it is
recognized that exchangeLadjustmenta by tnemselves are not enough to induce
producers to export.
In addition to the export encouragement measures contained in
the stabilization program introduced last year, the Government has recently
implemented a number of measures to promote exports. A scheme has been
implemented whereby exporters and their domestic suppliers are to be given
priority access to scarce foreign exchange for the purchase of imported
inputs for export production and to a limited extent for production for
the domestic market. The Jamaica Bational Export Corporation, wnich
provides export marketing services to local lirms in the private sector,
was restructured and substantially szrenghtened. Thie Jamaica Export
Trading Company was es4aulished to sell aoroad tne products of local
manulacturers, parvicularly small scale enterprises. Tne Trade Commis-
sioner Service nas oeen strengatened ana now nas marketing oiiicers based
in six major cities abroad.  rne aevelopment OI tne Kingston Free Zone

Parallel to providing exporters with foreign exchange assurance to meet
their import for export requirements, administrative procedures will be
further simplified to allow better planning and timely production for
export in consultation with the Jamaica Exporters' Association and the
Jamaica National Export Corporation. Export credit insurance schemes
vhich will cover both the creditor and producer are being studied and
will be put into effect during this calendar year under the Jamaica Export
Credit Insurance Corporation. Domestic and foreign investments aimed at
exports will be given special facilities. Attempts will be made to
diversify the products exported and the markets to which Jamaica exports,
with a special emphasis being placed on developing the country's com-
parative advantages. The services of the Jamaica National Export Corpora-
tion will continue to be expanded to provide new exporters with technical
assistance on product design, production, quality control, shipping and
export sales.

ANNEX IV
Most important for the long-term development of an export-
oriented manufacturing sector,. the Government considers that the distortions
created by past import substitution policies must be corrected.  By
December 1979 the Government intends to have developed a detailed program
and schedule for making the necessary changes to existing incentive
legislation and administrative procedures. The primary objective of this
program would be to redress the imbalance in existing incentives which
favour import substitution and production for the domestic market over
exports to international markets. In considering such a program, the
Government would review the possibility of phasing out duty free imports of
capital equipment and industrial inputs, and instituting a system of tariff
rebates on imports for export. A system of direct incentives to exporters
would also be explored.
Several ministries and Government agencies are invloved in export
SWOMetionedevelopment and policy. As a result, the Government agrees to put
overall responsibility for the program under the Economic Council which is
chaired by the M4inister of Finance ai.d includes in its members the heads of
ministries and agencies concerned with economic matters. The Council will
monitor progress in meeting export targets and will review policy measures
to achieve those targets. The Council will also be responsible for
establishing the program and schedule to modify the incentive system for
exports.
in the above tasks. we look forward to a continuation and extension
of our close and valuable relationship with the World Bank. On a more
formal basis we would meet with the Bank on a semi-annual basis for a period
of at least two years after the signing of the Second Program Loan to discuss
progress in the Government's export program, and more particularly progress
in modifying the existing incentives and policies relating to export
development.
