PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BRAZIL
SECOND FEEDER ROADS PROJECT
(LOAN 1730-BR)
EVALUArION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.        The Second Feeder  goads  Project  (Loan  1730-BR,  US$110 million),
approved in 1979, was intended to assist in the continuation of a national
feeder roads program administered by the National Economic and Social
Development Bank (BNDES) and initiated with the Secondary and Feeder Roads
Project (Loan 1207-BR), which was completed  in  1984.    The  second project,
scheduled for completion by the end of 1986, was actually completed by the end
of August 1987, and the loan was fully disbursed.
2.        BNDES has prepared an adequate  completion  report  for  the project
(attachment).   The present  evaluation summary  briefly summarizes the record
and main findings, and augments the information contained in a few areas of
the  report,   in  particular   with  regard  to  the  project's  results  and
sustainability and to the performance of the institutions and the Bank.
Obiectives
3.        Project objectives were (a)  in the  short term  to provide improved
and reliable road access, and (b) in the longer term to provide means and
incentives for higher agricultural productivity and promote better land use,
improve isolated rural areas' access to health, education and social services,
and promote the institutional development  of  the  state  and municipal road
agencies. Under the project, funds were onlent through BNDES to sub-borrowers
for: (i) the construction, rehabilitation or improvement of roads linking
agricultural areas or third level urban centers to state and federal through-
roads; and (ii) the improvement of earth roads and tracks to all-weather
standards in areas of high economic potential for which a defined development
program is to be implemented.
4.        Project preparation  focussed  upon  the  design  or  improvement of
procedures and methodologies for the preparation, appraisal, implementation
and monitoring of the feeder roads subprojects to be financed out of the
proceeds of  the loan.   A  revised Manual  for Feeder Roads was developed and
agreed upon between BNDES, DNER (the National Roads Department) and the Bank
to define subproject eligibility and.engineering standards, and the criteria
and methodologies  for  economic  evaluation.    But  there were  no prepared
subprojects at the time of project appraisal or loan negotiations, nor any
targets  regarding  quantities  of works.    All  subproject  preparation and
appraisal work had been scheduled for after Board approval of the loan, which
obviously resulted into very slow disbursements in the initial phase of
project implementation (Table 1.2 of main report). Although it is common
practice in Brazil not to undertake preinvestment studies until financing is



-vi -
secured, it appears, in retrospect, that the Bank should insist, under such
program  loans,  for  having  at  least  an  initial   portfolio  of  prepared
subprojects, which would be ready for implementation as soon as the loan is
approved.
5.        The project involved a  large  number  of  institutioas.    The sub-
borrowers, i.e. the state governments. state highways agencies ()ERs) or
municipal  road  consortia  (CRs)  were  responsible   for  preparing  subloan
applications, including supporting technico-economic feaiibility studies, and
subproject final engineering, and for subproject execution and monitoring.
BNDES was responsible for approving subloan applications, engineering designs
and  cor&tracts,  for  supervising  the  execution  of  subprojects,   and  for
monitoring the implementation of the project. DNER was responsible to provide
technical assistance to BNDES for all of the above tasks and to review and
approve the procurement process. Bank review of subproject appraisal reportrs
and concurrence on terms and conditions of subloan agreements were required
prior to BNDES' approval for all subprojects with a total cost above about
US$10  million  equivalent.    BNDES   was   also   responsible   for  subloan
disbursements, including its own and the Bank's participations, and for
transferring the federal government's  non-reimbursable  contributions.   This
organizational set-up has proved generally adequate to prepare and implement
feeder roads proiects country-wide, on a decentralized basis, including to
disseminate appropriate norms, standards and methodologies, which is now
followed evan outside the program; there is still, however, considerable scope
for improving its effectiveness (para 7).
Implementation Experience
6.        The project  actually comprised  19 subprojects  in 13 states, which
together consisted of the construction or improvement of 255 road links of a
total length of about 4,800 km, and of the construction of bridges of a total
length of about 16,4CO meters. Although no targets were set at appraisal, the
project's actual output had been less than anticipated, as a result of a
shortfall of domestic funding and the consequent decision of the Bank to
increase its relative participation in the cost of the subprojects. Under
this Special Assistance Program (SAP), which was in effect from October 1983
to May 1986, the Bank's participation was increased to about 602 of subproject
expenditures, the participations of BNDES, the federal government, and of the
sub-borrowers being reduced accordingly; and about US$19.5 million of the loan
amount was disbursed in the form of supplementary financing for the Secondary
and Feeder Roads project (Loan 1207-BR), to allow for its completion. As a
result, the investment actually made under the project was about US$216.6
million equivalent, against the US$338.5 million appraisal estimate. The risk
of shortages of domestic funds has not been clearly assessed at appraisal. At
that time, however, tne DERs had substantial and reliable revenues through
federal transfers, in particular from a national highway fund, which was
replenished with  the proceeds  of road  user taxes  earmarkes ^   road works.
But this funding system was dismantled in the early 1980s, a measure aimed at
restoring some central control over public expenditures, and the DERs had then
to rely essentially upon less predictable appropriations from their state
government budgets.



- vii -
7.        Although the  project was  completed with  only 9Z time overrun, and
the loan fully disbursed at the closing date, the pace of the project's
implementation has been very slow at the beginning. Only three subloans were
effective by the end of 1980, and it took until the end of 1982 to reach a
substantial portfolio  of 14  effective subloans.   Sublroject preparation and
appraisal, and subloan  processing  have  required  an  sverage  of  two years
-(section II B). The main factors for the delays have been: (a) the lack of
preparation of the initial portfolio of six subprojects,  which was considered
at the time of the project's appraisal, and which did not materialize
thereafter, as a result of changes in the state administrations; (b) the
inadequate priorities  proposed in subloan applications, generally emphasizing
the need for high-standard highways rather than low-cost feeder roads, which
reflects the lack of dialogue between the program's management and sub-
borrowers at the early stage of subproject identification; (c) the cumbersome
subproject appraisal process which resulted from BNDESIDNER's insufficient
guidance and supervision of subproject preparation; and (d) difficulties
encountered with the states' borrowing capacities and/or the non-performance
of some states on BNDES loans, and with the administrative procedures for
subloan contracting. There is scope for improving the program's effectiveness
in the above areas.    But  the  development  of  a  substantial  portfolio of
subprojects would still require some time; in order to avoid bunching problems
in the initiai phase of a new project, an appropriate strategy would be to
evolve toward a continuous program in which the program's management would
have commitment authority on a more permanent basis.
8.        The preparation  of engineering  designs and  bidding documents, and
their review and approval by BNDES/DNER have also been cumbersome processes.
A main factor has been the general tendency for overdesign, which the
program's management has sought to contain, with somewhat mixed success;
average construction costs have been reduced, as compared to the first
project, for most categories of roads, but almost half of the roads built were
paved roads. In order to be more effective, the program's management would
have to strengthen their guidance and supervision at the engineering stage,
and training of DERs engineers in appropriate engineering and construction
techniques for low-cost rural roads should be promoted.
Results
9.        The  use  of economic  criteria  in the preparation of feeder roads
programs, which are generally subject to strong political interferences, was
an important consideration, and the project made progress in this area. The
criteria and evaluation methodologies proposed in the Manual are now more
widely followed in the states, even outside the program, and the project
included investments with appropriate ex-ante assessments of their economic
justification.   The economic internal rates of return (ERR) of the individual
road  investments,  as  they  were  estimated  by  BNDES/DNER   at  subproject
appraisal, were generally in the range of 12Z to 40S (section V. D). After
completion of the project, BNDES attempted to make a re-evaluation of the ERRs
of the individual road links, by replacing their appraisal forecasts of the
growth of benefits derived from the investments by the actual rates of
increase, between two surveys carried out in 1980 and 1985, of the relevant
agricultural production in the micro-regions of influence of  the roads.   The



- viii -
test showed that only 472 of the improved roads would have, under these
assumptions, an estimated ERR above 122. Most subprojects, however, have been
completed in 1986-1987; the trends of the agricultural production which were
observed over 1980-185 cannot be considered to adequately reflect the
possible impact of the project's investments.
Sustainability
10.       The  sustainability  of  the  project  will  first  depend  upon the
maintenance of the roads built or  improved.   Subloan agreements  had clauses
whereby the sub-borrowers were committed to adequately maintain subproject
roads. The project roads visited by the various supervision missions were in
good condition, but they were too recently built for such visits to provide
an indication of the maintenance efforts and of the long-term prospects for
their adequate  maintenance.   The large  proportion, in the project, of paved
roads, which in general deteriorate slowly during the first ten years of their
lifetime, and the over-design of most categories of roads provide, at least
in the short term, some protection against insufficient maintenance.   But the
maintenance condition of the state highways and feeder roads networks, despite
their relatively young age, is generally insufficient. From recent surveys of
the DERs' programs and organization, it appears that the portions of the state
networIks which actually receive maintenance has been increasing over the last
decade, but only a few state governments, generally in the more developed
states, make substantial efforts for road maintenance, and there is scope for
improving the effectiveness of the maintenance programs. Any new-construction
program at the state and municipal levels should therefore be linked to
programs of measures to improve the maintenance of the networks; this is
actually a high-priority of the Bank in it- present strategy fur the sector.
Findings and Lessons
11.       BNDES was selected as lead agency for the management of  the program
because, as the national development bank, it had already well-established
capabilities for developing lending programs and managing loan portfolios, an
extensive experience in lending for infrastructure and agriculture, and an
ongoing dialogue with the state and  local  governments.    BNDES  developed a
capacity for appraisal and supervision of feeder roads subprojects by
gradually building up a special working group of road engineers and economists
under the  first project.   Originally within the in'rastructure departzr.nt of
BNDES, the working group and the managesnent of the program were transferred,
under the secor.' project, to its agriculture department, a measure aimed at
strengthening the program's emphasis upon support to agriculture development.
As a result, existing agricultural production and/or development potential
rightly became more important criteria in the selection of the roads to be
improved; but at the same time less consideration was given to the priorities
of the state road agencies, and in particular to road maintenance. Although
BNDES actually carried out its main responsibilities, its management of the
project has not been fully  effective.    The  lack  of well-defined internal
procedurec and work programs has been an important fact of the implementation
problems and delays noted earlier. BNDES/DNER teams did not provide guidance
to sub-borrowers to the extent which was envisaged at appraisal, and the
supervision and follow-up of the implementation of the su'projects has had



- ir -
serious weaknesses.   It is only by the end of the project, actually under the
third project, that efforts were made to develop lending the work programs,
and to establish internal procedures and a computerized information system for
an adequate monitoring of the program and for appropriate reporting.
12.       DNER also discharged its responsibilities under the project  but its
-expected leadership role in the dissemination of appropriate engineering
design and construction techniques for low-cost rural roads did not fully
develop.   A major  factor has been the varying degree of interest on the part
of  DNER's  management,  as  a  result  of  BNDES'  leadership  role   in  the
implementation of the program and allocation of the project resources.
13.       Sub-borrowers' performance  has been diverse, and generally reflects
the levels of institutional development and organization of the state
governments and their road agencies. A major problem generally faced by the
program's management has been the changes of priorities in the  roads programs
and  of  the  management  and  higher-level  professional  staff  of the roads
agencies, which have accompanied the changes of administration.   In  order to
obtain the  minimnm stability  required for  their programs, in particular for
maintenance, the roads agencies will have to strengthen their planning systems
anu  develop  medium-term  roads  programs,  and to seek their endorsement and
sipport  by  their   governments   and   congresses.        Strengthening  their
organization, through the establishment of appropriate management systems and
train±n; of management and professional. staff to implement their main programs
should also be a priority.
14.       The  Bank's  performance  on  the project appears, in retrospect, to
have been mixed. In the preparation phase, in addition to defining the
mechanisms and methodologies for the preparation, appraisal and implementation
of subprojects, more efforts should have been made to prepare and appraise an
initial  portfolio   of  subprojects,   which  should   have  been  ready  for
implementation as soon as the loan is approved.   In  order to  compensate for
the insufficient preparation, however, and to assist BNDES in the appraisal
and supervision of subprojects, the Bank established in 1981 a position of a
Resident Highway Engineer, who was stationed in Rio de Janeiro, in BNDES'
offices, for  a  period  of  four  years.    This  special  supervision effort
contributed, through the Resident Engineer's constant interaction with BNDES
and DNER project staff and his frequent visits to sub-borrowers, to the
development of BNDES/DNER capacity to implement and monitor the project, and
to the adoption by the DERs of more appropriate standards and techniques for
the engineering and construction of low-cost rural roads.



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
BRAZIL
SECOND FEEDER ROADS PROJECT
(LOAN 1730-BR)
I.        SUMMARY
A.   INTRODUCTION
On March 23, 1979 IBRD indicated to BNDES its intention of
contributing to the financing of a second feeder roads project costing
US$338 million overall, allocated as follows:
IBRD           US$110,000,000
BNDES          US$110,000,000
DNER           US$ 26,000,000
Sub-borrowers  US$ 92,000,000
TOTAL          US$338,000,000
Beneficiaries of this project would be classified in terms of three
different regions with the following characteristics:
Region A:      lower-income states
Region B:      middle-income states
Region C:      high-income states
The contract was approved by BNDES on June 7, 1979 (Resolution
DIR-119/79).
On June 20, 1979 Loan 1730-BR was signed to provide part of the
financing for a project with an overall cost of US$338.5 million, the
breakdown of financing sources for each region being as follows:
Z Share                        Amount
Region A  Region B  Region C              USS million
IBRD                  32.8       32.2      32.5                   110.0
BNDES                 37.0       29.7      21.6                   110.0
DNER                  10.2        8.1       5.9                    30.0
Sub-borrowers         20.0       30.0      40.0                    f8.4
TOTAL                100.0      100.0     100.0                   338.5S
The pertinent agreement between BNDES and DNER was signed on
August 11, 1979.
The loan became effective not on September 18, 1979 as initially
planned but on December 17, 1979.
Owing to the significant lags, principally during the year 1980,
between changes in the costs of road construction in Brazil and in the value
of the ORTN (current OTN), the sub-borrowers' share of project custs
increased, seriously jeopardizing the progress of project execution. As a
result, the financing agencies agreed on June 17, 1981 to provide additional
resources for the various agreements so as to restore the original financing
shares.



-2-
Subsequently project execution again slowed as a result of the
general scarcity of funds in Brazil, leading to the signing on September 30,
1983 of an amendment to Loan 1730-BR, whereby IBRD increased its financial
parcicipation for the period October 1, 1983 to June 30, 1985. This Special
Assistance Program (SAP) was. in effect until May 30, 1986, the breakdown by
source of funds being as follows:
Share (2)
Region A  Region B  Region C
IBRD                   60.7      58.8       56.2
BNDES                  30.0      21.7       14.1
DNER                    6.0       4.4        2.7
Sub-borrowers           3.3      15.1       27.0
TOTAL                 100.0      100.0     100.0
After termination of the SAP the shares of the various financing
agencies reverted to those originally agreed, except for those of IBRD and
BNDES which we.e disbursed so as to provide the amounts initially laid down in
the various contracts with the sub-borrowers.
Project completion, initially scheduled for December 31, 1986, was
postponed until August 31, 1987, thereby extending the original implementation
period from 7.04 to 7.7 years. (an increase of 9.42).
Total ?rogram expenditure through June 30, 1987 was US$265.8 million,
including US$49.2 million from Loan 1730-BR used to supplement the First
Feeder Roads Project.
IBRD's share, in the amount of US$110 million, was allocated as
follows:
(a) supplement to First Project - US$19.5 million
(b) applied to the Second Project - US$90.5 million
IBRD resources applied to the Second Project include the amounts
used under the Special Assistance Program (SAP/DNER and SAP/Sub-Borrowers) in
the amount of US$20.7 million.
Table 1.2 in the annex shows that actual disbursements throughout
program implementation fluctuated between 65.21 and 105.91 of projected
disbursements.
B.   OBJECTIVES AND RESULTS ACHIEVED
In broad terms, the project was designed to boost agricultural
activities by overcoming the lack of permanent outlets for agricultural
productior, and improving access to inputs, thereby increasing agricultural
output by extending the agricultural frontier and raising productivity.



-3-
To this end the project called for construction of 281 sections of
feeder roads of various categories with a total length of 5,312.8 km, and
17,160 m of concrete bridges, in 13 different states at an overall estimated
cost of 29,049,632 OTNs.
By June 30, 1987, approaching the closing date for the project
(August 31), 255 road sections had been completed, with a total length of
4,802.4 km, and 16,406 m of concrete bridges, at an overall cost of
25,750,758 OTNs.
According to the information available, agricultural output and the
area under cultivation expanded in the period 1977/84. The increase was
particularly marked in the case of grain crops from the 1986/87 harvest
onward, when production jumped from its previously flat level of 57 million
tons to 65 million tons. In addition to economic objectives, social aims were
also achieved, in the form of improved access to needy communities.
C.   PROGRESS OF IMPLEMENTATION
The Second Project became effective on December 17, 1979 and was to
conclude on August 31, 1987. The intervening period of 7.7 years saw the
implementation of some 4,800 km of roads in Brazil as a whole at a rate of
about 624 km/year. This must be regarded as extremely slow. Given that the
roads in question represent only 0.3S of Brazil's total estimated tertiary
network of about 1.4 million km, then-by way of illustration--upgrading 102
of this total at this rate would take 224 years.
The reasons for this very slow rate of implementation can be listed
as follows:
(a) lack of appropriate organization;
(b) low volume of investments;
(c) indecision concerning objectives;
(d) lack of master plans for feeder roads;
(e) successive phases of studies, analyses, further studies, additional
analyses, definitions and redefinitions that intervened between
intentions and decisions;
(f)  low capacity for infrastructure investment on the part of the
Federal Government and the states;
(g) general difficulties for the states to bear their share of the
financing burden.
D.   DIFFICULTIES ENCOUNTERED AND EXPERIENCE GAINED
The principal difficulties encountered in project execution were:
(a) lack of appropriate organization;



-4 -
(b)  lack of master plans for feeder roads;
(c) low capacity for infrastructure investments;
(d) general constraint on the states' public indebtedness capacity.
Clearly, these difficulties do not affect the feeder roads sector
alone, but are inherent in all sectors of activity for which the public sector
is responsible in Brazil. It is difficult to believe that these problems
could be entirely resolved merely through efforts targeted at a particular
sector of activity.
The most significant experience obtained from project execution
concerned the:
(a) increased interest on the part of the states in improving their
tertiary transportation networks;
(b) better technical acceptance of smaller-scale roads;
(c) steady improvement in the quality of subproject management;
(d) better mutual understanding on the part of the technical teams
involved.
E.   COMPARISONS WITH THE FIRST PROJECT
Table 1.4 shows these comparisons in more detail. In brief:
(a) total costs were similar (approximately US$215 million);
(b) the IBRD loan share was larger, viz. 45.2% higher than in the First
Project.
(c) the total length of the roads built was aboutt 72 less, with greater
emphasis on paved roads in order to build up the states' secondary
network;
(d) more stress was placed on specific projects for reinforced concrete
rather than wooden bridges: 16,406 m in the Second Project, against
361 m in the First;
(e) the number of road sections executed was about 402 greater;
(f)  the execution period was about 19% shorter;
(g) the annual rate of implementation was about 10% greater;
(h) there was an approximate 39.22 increase in the volume of paved roads
built;
(i) average costs were overall about 4.32 greater than in the First
Project, though far more paved roads were built under the Second
Project.

Through June 30, 1987 4,804.2 km of feeder roads and 16,406 m of
bridges were built, representing 90.4% and 95.6S respectively of the initial
physical targets. The project finally closed on August 31, 1987.
B.   TIME REQUIRED FOR VARIOUS PHASES
Loan Agreement 1730-BR was signed on June 20, 1979 and declared
effective on December 17, 1979. The principal events that took place up to
the signing of financing agreements with the sub-borrowers were as follows:
1.   presentation of the subloan applications to BNDES;
2.   consideration of the subloan applications by BNDES;
3.   submission of feasibility studies by sub-borrowers;
4.   analysis of the subprojects by BNDES/DNER;
5.   BNDES decision approving the analysis;
6.   signature of contracts with sub-borrowers;
7.  declaration of effectiveness of contracts with sub-borrowers.
In the annexes, Table I1.1 shows the dates on which these events
occurred and Table II.2 the intervals between them. Expressed as averages,
these intervals were as follows:

C.   ANALYSIS OF DIFFICULTIES
(1) Lack of Clear Priorities in the Subloan Application
Although we are now in the mi.'dle of executing the third Feeder
Roads Project, and despite continuous guidance from BNDES, sub-borrowers still
do not have a Feeder Roads Master Plan against which to prioritize the roads
making up their networks. The first steps in this direction are being taken
by the DER/MG and DER/RJ.
Without this valuable planning instrument the selection of road
sections to be financed depends a great deal on the political decisions of the
state authorities that happen to be in power at a given time.
Getting sub-borrowers to understand the philosophy of the BBD
(National Feeder Roads) program is a very slow process. There is a permanent
tendency to select roads of a higher category than those that the program is
intended to finance. The percentage of paved roads increased from 30.2S under
the First Project to 47% under the Second, reflerting a trend which BNDES and
the DNER have done their very best to resist.
(2) Preparation of Feasibility Studies
The average time for preparation of feasibility studies by
sub-borrowers exceeded seven months, as shown above (0.59 years).
This is too high, given the period initially fixed for this purpose,
e mely 120 days.
The delay is largely due to the lack of the Master Plan(s) referred
to above, lack of organization in the sub-borrower and the sophisticated
methodology used.
Nonetheless, there was perceptible improvement in relation to the
average time taken under the First Project, which was one year.  There were
still some relatively major shortcomings in the feasibility studies, which
thus required lengthy analysis by the BNDES teams (0.75 years = 9 months).

(3) States' NonperformancelIndebtedness Capacity
After the BNDES decision approving the subloan contract, another
0.36 years (131 days) on average was required before the loans could be
declared effective. This lengthy interval was generally the result of the
sub-borrowers' problems pertaining to financial nonperformance and/or
indebtedness capa-ity (monitored by the Central Bank).
It is apparent that this situation has deteriorated in recent years
and there is already a strong current of opinion in favor of a reform of
taxadion that would transfer larger amounts of federal resources to the states
and municipalities.
(4) Administrative Conditions of Effectiveness
The most frequently encountered conditions for effectiveness were
the following:
-    Central Bank authorization for the sub-borrower to incur the debt
associated with the new loan;
-    State law authorizing the loan contract;
-    Settlement of state debts to BNDES relating to earlier contracts;
-    Approval of the sub-borrower's Executive Council for the loan
contract.
The average interval elapsing before the various contracts with
sub-borrowers became effective was 0.20 years (73 days).
(5) Appraisal Methodology
The methodology for analyzing the investments was again found to be
rather sophisticated for most sub-borrowers, leading to the submission of
imprecise and incomplete feasibility studies, which in turn resulted in
adjustments during the analysis by BNDES; this caused further delays in the
execution of this phase.
III.      EVALUATION OF PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. INTRODUCTION
The principal events occurring between the signing of the contract
with the sub-borrower and the completion of the works were:
1. Signing of BNDES/sub-borrower contract;
2. Presentation of final engineering plans by the sub-borrower;
3. Approval of plans by BNDES/DNER;
4. Submission of bidding documents for the works by the sub-borrwwer;

5.   Approval of bidding documents by BNDES/DNER;
6.   Signature of contract between sub-borrower and contractor;
7.   Start of works;
8.   Conclusion of works.
B.   DURATION OF THE VARIOUS PHASES
In the annexes, Table 111.1 shows the dates on which the above
events occurred and Table III.2 the intervals between them, in days.
Expressed as averages, these intervals can be wunmarized as follows:
Description                           Time (years,        Responsibility
Each stage Cumulative
1.   Signing of BNDES/sub-borrower
contract - presentation of plans           1.0                 Sub-borrower
2.   Presentation of plans - approval          0.52          -      BNDES/DNER
3.   Bidding documents submission -
approval                                  0.58         -       BNDES/DNER
4.   Signing of sub-borrower/contractor
contract - start of works                 0.95         0.95   Sub-borrower
5.   Start - end of works                      3.18          4.13   Sub-borrower
C.   ANALYSIS OF DIFFICULTIES
(1) Preparation of Final Engineering Plans
Generally speaking the sub-borrowers prepared engineering plans by
contracting road design consulting firms.
BNDES has encouraged sub-borrowers to prepare such plans themselves
whenever possible so as to become more deeply involved in the problems
encountered and the solutions to them.
The lengthy period (one year on average) required to execute this
phase was due to the switching of road sections or the inclusion of new
sections to absorb the total investment resources available.
The same reasons explained che average time of 0.52 years taken by
BNDES/DNER to examine and approve the plans.
(2) Bidding Documents and Contract Awards
The long interval of 0.58 years on average tnat elapsed between the
presentation of bidding documents and their approval by BNDES/DNER is
explained by the same factors as mentioned in connecticn with the preceding



- 15 -
(3) Revision of Subprojects
The various subprojects were very frequently revised, particularly
after the entry into office of the new state governors elected in 1982 and
1986; this caused significant delays in project implementation.
The average elapsed time for works execution of 4.13 years from the
time that contracts were signed with contractors is partly due to these
rotations of governors, for the following reasons:
(a)  fixing of new priorities;
(b)  changes in technical and administrative teams, requiring lengthy
adaptation and integration periods.
The revisions to subprojects altered the physical targets initially
set, which affected projected costs.
Table III.3 in the annexes shows the changes in physical targets by
region and road category; these can be summarized as follows:

Of the planned total of 17,160 m of bridges, 15,573 m were executed,
equivalent to 91S. The number of paved sections and their total length were
4.81 and 18X, respectively, higher than the projections. For gravel roads the
number of sections and their total length were 24X and 25X, respectively,
lower than the projections.
The distribution of gravel and paved roads, by region, was as

There was, therefore, a 161 increase in the investment in paved
roads and : 39S reduction in gravel roads. Actual expenditure on bridges was
171 less than initially planned. In overall terms investment was 18S less
than projected.
*              (4)  Works Supervision
The great majority of sub-borrowers contracted consulting firms to
*        supervise the works.  BNDES would prefer that supervision be carried out
directly by sub-borrowers whenever possible, in order to make them participate
more closely in finding solutions to problems encountered and to increase the
experience of their technical staff.
IV.       COSTS AND DISBURSEMENTS
A.   CHANGES IN THE FINANCING PLAN
The original arrangements for Loan 1730-ER provided for an
allocation of subproject costs differentiated by region as shown below:
Participants' Percentage Share
Retions                          IBRD    BNDES    DNER  SUB-BORROWERS  TOTAL
Region A (lower-income)          32.8    37.0      10.2       20.0       100.0
Region B (middle-income)         32.2    29.7       8.1       30.0       100.0
Region C (higher-income)         32.5    21.6       5.79      40.0       100.0
Because of the increasing lag from 1980 onward between changes in
the value of the ORTN (current OTN) and in the costs of road construction, the
resources that had to be found by sub-borrowers increased considerably,
raising the prospect of a substantial alteration in the percentage shares
originally established for each of the three sources of financing.
The agencies financing the project then agreed to increase their
project contributions so as to maintain the original participation levels.
Even with these additional funds it was necessary to reduce physical
targets and cancel plans already made, as follows:
(a) additional funds without reduction of physical targets for
subprojects CRIBA-1I, SE-I and DAER/CE-I;
(b) additional funds and reduction of physical target for subproject
DER/PE-I;
(c) cancellation of priority accorded to subprojects GO-III, SC-IV,
MA-1, MG-III and MT-Il, to be financed under a new loan (Third
Project).
It was also decided to provide additional funds for subprojects in
the First Feeder Roads Project out of the proceeds of Loan 1730-BR, using
US$19.5 million of IBRD's share, the total investment being US$49.2 million.



- 18 -
Subsequently the project execution rate fell sharply because of
shortages of funds from Brazilian sources (BNDES, DNER and sub-borrowers),
leading IBRD to implement the Special Assistance Program in the form of an
amendment to Loan 1730-BR, signed on September 30, 1983. This altered the
relative shares of the different sources of funds for the period between
October 1, 1983 and June 30, 1985, as follows:
Share (2)
Sources                     Region A        Region B        Region C
IBRD                           60.7           58.8             56.2
BNDES                          30.0           21.7             14.1
DNER                            6.0            4.4              2.7
Sub-borrower                    3.3           15.1             27.0
TOTAL                         100.0          100.0            100.0
Subsequently the application period of this plan was extended until
June 30, 1986.
After this date the original percentage shares for DNER and the
sub-borrowers were restored; the IBRD and BNDES portions were disbursed in
such a way as to provide the amounts initially fixed in the various contracts,
whenever possible.
At the closing date used for this report (June 30, 1987) the final
breakdown of the various sources of financing was as follows:
Final Participation (Average) I/
Share                 Region A        Region B        Resion C       Total

2/   Including SAP/DNER
3/   Including SAP/Sub-borrowers
If the SAPIDNER and SAP/sub-borrowers portions are regarded as IBRD
contributions, the final shares are as follows:
Source                       2
IBRD                       44.4
BNDES                      28.2
DNER                        6.7
Sub-borrowers              19.7
TOTAL                     lCO.0
The closing date, initially fixed for December 31, 1986, was
postponed to August 31, 1987 by agreement among the financing agencieos.

Table IV.1 in the annexes summarizes the percentage shares of
financing by region throughout the project execution period.
B.   AVERAGE COSTS
Since as always the value of the ORTN (current OTN) fluctuated, as
did the costs of road construction, an attempt has been made to calculate the
cost of road construction in U.S. dollars.
Table IV.2 shows the average costs of rnad construction and paving
or graveling for each road category. The final col&mn in the Table shows the
relationship between the value of the OTN and the dollar on the date of the
distribution of funds (average ratio).
Average costs calculated by road category can be summarized as
follows:
Final Cost (US$10,000/km)
Cateaorv                          Planned            Actual
A/Paved                             66.7              69.2
B/Paved                             66.0              65.6
B/Gravel                            45.8              34.4
C/Paved                             55.5              61.1
C/Gravel                            41.3              40.0
D/Gravel                            27.5              32.7
E/Gravel                            25.5              22.8
Bridges (km)                        1,270              1,102
It will be seen that in general terms the highest cost per kilometer
occurred in Pernambuco (crushed rock pavement base), Espirito Santo (large
amounts of excavation in very rocky terrain), and Rio Grande do Sul (graduated
crushed rock pavement base).
The lowest costs per km were in Sao Paulo, where large quantities of
the right materials are available, along with a specific methodology for
low-cost surfacing.
The average cost of $1,102,000* per km of bridge resulted from the
subprojects executed in Parana and Rio Grande do Sul.
Table IV.3 shows the average costs of construction and
paving/graveling of roads by subproject and region in OTNs. The average unit
costs per region can be summarized as follows:

The same table indicates that 67.12 of total funds applied to roads
went to paved roads.
C.        DISBURSEMENT RATE
Table IV.4 shows disbursements by subproject and by region, showing
accumulated disburseitents in percentage terms on the dates corresponding to
252, 50S, 752 and 100% of the disbursement period for each subproject. The
table indicates that disbursements started earliest in region A and latest in
region C.
The timing of disburserants can be summarised as follows:

It is apparent that, despite the additional resources and the

Bank's expectations.

V.        ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A.        INTRODUCTION
The recent conclusion of the Sec3nd Project makes it too soon for
any economic evaluation.  There has been no timP for any fieldwork to measure
conclusions that could be incorporated in this section of the Project
Completion Report.
B.        CHANGES IN PRODUCTION IN PROJECT IMPACT AREAS
The locations of the roads in the various states included in the
preject were selected by the sub-borrowers to meet the following objectives:
Region A
Piaui - PI: babassu and mixed crops
Bahia - Ba: cocoa and milk
Ceari - CE: mixed crops
lagoas - AL: sugar cane and alcohol
Espirito Santo - ES: mixed crops
Paraiba - PB:   sugar cane, alcohol and mixed crops
Pernambuco - PE: sugar cane and alcohol
Rio Grande do Norte - RN: mixed crops, cotton and sisal
Sergipe - SE: sugar cane and mixed crops
Mato Grosso do Sul - MS: mixed crops, monoculture (soybeans and
wheat) and milk.
Region B
Rio Grande do Sul - RS: mixed crops, monoculture (soybeans and
wheat) and milk
Parana - PR: mixed crops, monoculture (coffee, cotton, sugarcane,
soybeans and wheat) and milk.
Redion C
Sao Paulo - SP: mixed crops, monoculture (coffee, sugarcane,
soybeans and wheat) and milk.
The attempt to use two moments-viz. the years 1980 and 1985-to
measure, using statistical information from IBGE (Brazilian Institute of
Geography and Statistics), changes in production in the various regions
covered by the project in the different states turned out to be



- 22 -
impracticable. The statistical data at the Homogeneous Microregion (MRH)
level in the Synopsis of the 1985 Agricultural Census are not similar enough
for any comparisons with the 1980 (General Census). This aim could therefore
only be ursued through a much more comprehensive data aggregation pLocess at
the municipal level; more time is required for such an exercise, and the
results cannot be submitted within the period fixed for the Project Completion
Report.
Although the DNER, through its Institute of Highway Research (IPR),
intends at the present time to carry out an economic evaluation in the field
relating to selected groups of highways, most of the latter were built under
the First Project. not the Second. Approaches are currently being made with a
view to including a limited group of Second Project roads in this fieldwork.
The work will be completed after the deadline for thie report and will cover
only a small number of roads, given the objectives of the work contracted by
IPR to a consulting firm.
The only alternative is therefore-given the time constraints-to
draw general conclusions based on statistical data for Brazil as a whole in
order to provide some sort of assessment, given that a true economic
evaluation is impossible at this time.
The reasons for adopting this approach are as follows:
(a) lack of time for an economic evaluation of wider scope, whether
based on statistical data or on fieldwork;
(b) the rather short interval since the conclusion of the project makes
it difficult to carry out an accurate economic evaluation;
(c) the project was implemented in the most economically dynamic areas
of the various states covered and in areas that promoted project.
objectives ;*
(d) In general terms the project was designed to prov'de transportation
infrastructure support for mixed crops (rice, beans, corn, manioc),
and specific monocultures such as soybeans, wheat, cocoa, coffee,
sugarcane (specifically for alcohol production), cotton and milk.
In general terms these were the main products identified in
subproject appraisals.
C.        COMPARISON WITH APPRAISAL ASSUMPTIONS
A general assessment of the evolution of the cultivated area and the
performance of output [for Brazil as a whole] in the period 1977/1984 (the
year before the loan agreement was signed and the last year for which
statistics are available) may indicate whether project objectives were
achieved. It should be noted tbht grain production in Brazil, previously flat
at around 57 million tons up to the 1986/87 harvest, then jumped to 65 million
tons, a level not achieved during 1977/84.

D.        CONCLUSION
Tablo V shows, for the years 1977 and 1984, the principal data for
changes in output and the cultivated area for the products in question, from
which the following conclusions can be drawn:
(a)  Output and the cultivated area grew in the period 1977/1984,
particularly from 1986/87 onward, and especially for grains;
(b)  The rate of growth was small for mixed crops and relatively large
for monocultures, milk production and alcohol.
General Isbues and Evaluation Methodology
The aim of this section of the report is to carry out an economic
evaluation of the roads built under the Second Feeder Roads Project in more
detail than is attempted elsewhere in this report.
For this purpose pertinent output data were sought from IBGE for the
products specified in the appraisal reports from the states in which the
Project was implemented.
The methodology for this economic evaluation involved the following
procedures:
5i)    identification of the rate of growth of output in the period 1980/85
for the main products to be promoted in each state, as listed in
section V(b) above;
(ii)    identification, as per the appraisal reports, of the total benefit
calculated for the first year of implementation of the road sections;
(iii)    similar identification of the total costs of these sections*
(iv)    definition of the ratio A = 1.15 C
where:
1.15 - the coefficient of the increase over the cost of the section
to meet maintenance costs (2S) plus an approximation of design and
supervision costs and other contingencies, totalling about 12.52:
1.02 x 1.125 u 1.1475 = 1.15
C - cost of the section according to the appraisal report
B° = the benefit in the first year after execution of the section;

1 + a
The rate a is identified by findiag in the Financial Table the rate the
sum of which over the ten-year period is equal to A.
Products and Grouping of Roads
The products surveyed were:
(i)   beans, rice, corn, manioc and milk, as basic foods
2ii)    herbaceous and tree cotton, sisal, soybeans, wheat, coffee, cocoa
and sugarcane. as monocultures. The roads were grouped in light of
their position relative to the MREs.
Results
The annexed data for each state and its road sections show the
results of the economic evaluation by comparing the resulting internal rate of
return with that contained in the various appraisal reports. The evaluation
results can be summarized as follows:

As mat of the road sections analyzed exclusively using VMD* (cost
of transportation) lacked traff.c counts, the economic evaluation used the
growth of production as the probable increase in traffic, and the net benefit
of the VMD in the firet year of operation as the basis for calculating the
benefits over 10 years. These sections include those in the states of
Alagoas, Hato Grosso do Sul, Parana (PR/IV), Pernambuco, Rio Grande do Sul,
Sergipe and Sao Paulo.
It should be noted that the period 1980/1985 adopted for purposes of
the economic evaluation was the closest period to the year 1987; the various
component subprojects in the Second Feeder Poads project became effective as
follows (see chapter II, section B):
Contracts                          Year
3                              79/80
11                              81/82
2                              83/84
3                              85/86
It is thus apparent that many subprojects will be completed outside
the period 1980/1985, which to some extent suggests that the conclusions of
the economic evaluation do not incorporate all the benefits that may have
resulted or will result from project implementation.
VI.       EVALUATION OF INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
A.        ORGANIZATION/DISTRIBUTION OF PROJECT RESPONSIBILITIES AMONG BNDES,
DNER AND SUB-BORROWERS
The Second Feeder Roads Manual, developed to regulate the various
activities and specifications in effect for the Second Project, clearly
establishes the organization/allocation of project responsibilities.
(M)    BNDES is responsible for coordinating the loan applications and
subprojects of the various sub-borrowers (normally the state DERs
and similar agencies) in line with the general guidelines for the
Second Feeder Roads Project Lnan Agreement and the infrastructure
sector planning managed by BNDES. Subsequently, BNDES plays the
leading role in the technical and economic analysis of the
subprojects presented by the svb-borrowers in their feasibility
studies; in this work BNDES is supported by DNER. After contracts
have been signed, &WDES is entirely responsible for financial
supervision, overseeing the subprojects and monitoring the progress
of their execution.
(ii)    The DNER supports BNDES in the work of technical and economic
analysis, and plays the main role in examining and approving final
engineering plans and bidding competitions. At the present time
DNER is also making an effort, still on a small scale, to carry out
an economic evaluation of results achieved on selected road sections
already constructed, particularly those incorporated in the First
Feeder Roads Project.
*TN Possibly "average daily value."



- 26 -
(iii)    The sub-borrowers (state DERs and similar agencies) are responsible
for choosiog their subprojects & : analyzing them in the form of
feisibility studies, preparing final engineering plans and bidding
competitions, and works supervision. In these activities they are
supported by BNDES and DNERo as already noted.
B.        PROJECT MANAGEMENT BY BNDES
BNDES has improved its project supervision system and although its
team has declined in numbers it performed all its tasks satisfactorily. The
experience acquired from the two projects already implsmented will improve
supervision during the Third Project, which must be implemented more rapidly.
C.        TECHNICAL AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT BY DNER
DNER stepped up its activities in the areas for which it is
responsible. expanding its technical personnel and using the resources of its
District Road Offices in order to meet implementation requirements more
quickly during the course of the Second Project. It merely remains for it to
release funds more promptly, in line with the disbursement schedules, given
that DNER's disbursements lag significantly in relation to those of BNDMS and
IBRD.
D.        ORGANIZATION OF SUB-BORROWERS
Sub-borrowers now have a better understanding that feeder roads are
part of a tertiary network, and as such require less complex technical
specifications than the primary and secondary networks.
Nevertheless, and despite the fact that the Third Project is now
under way, there is no institutionalized approach to tertiary networks, which
is hindering their proper treatment, whether as regards execution or
maintenance, particularly for gravel roads. The lack of this institutional-
ization results in projects and works being larger in scale than they ought to
be, while as regards contractors the stipulated requirements in terms of
company capitaL and works equipment are always greater than is necessary for
this kind of road.
Neither BNDES nor DNER has required more specific institutional-
ization/organization within the state DERs to handle feeder roads as a
tertiary network.
Other problems hampering better implementation were discrepancies
among construction costs and the fluctuating value of the OTN as a result of
government policies, as well as payment flows and works supervision
difficulties and the nonearmarking (caixas unicas)* of funds in State
Secretariats of Finance.
Another problem is that the sub-borrowers' counterpart funds were
always inadequate, given the taxation system in effect in Brazil.
*TN: Assumed meaning.

E.        ROLE AND PERFORMANCE OF TRE WORLD BANK
Geurally, IBRD's role was to guarantee that the funds budgeted were
efficiently allocated by the other participants.
More rapid implementation and upgrading of Brazil's tertiary network
requires swifter application of funds and works execution, and better
organization among sub-borrowers-even more so than as regards DNER.
It is vital that the roads being built be properly maintained; part
of the 10,000 km of roads already executed under the First and Second Projects
already needs rehabilitation work as a result of inadequate maintenance.
Given the success of the Special Assistance Program in supplementing
the sub-borrowers' counterpart funds it is to he hoped that greater use can be
made of grants, at least for category D, E and F roads.
Since in general terms the sub-borrowers basically lack
organization, capital and infrastructure, IBRD should play a larger role in
the following activities: improving the organization of individual DERs, in
particular. and providing larger contributions to help sub-borrowers with
their counterpart funds, together with more rigorous oversight of the
preparation of final engineering plans. unit costs and total costs of works.
VII.      CONCLUSIONS
1.   Very often the definition of priorities by sub-borrowers in their
loan applications has been randomly dependent on political decisions by the
state government holding power at the time. In most states there is still no
Feeder Roads Master Plan identifying the entire existing road network and the
different priorities attached to the component roads. We believe that it
would be very worthwhile to finance the preparation and institutionalization
of such plans as a way of improving the initial selection of road sections to
be financed and preparing the ground for possible section changes in the
future. Such a step would lead to more rapid implementation of the various
subprojects.
2.  About 35S of the time elapsing between submission of the loan
application by the sub-borrower and the resulting loan agreement being
declared effective was taken up by analysis by BNDES/DNER of the feasibility
studies. This analysis was lengthy because of the need to make numerous
adjustments as a result of poor initial selection decisions and the
imprecision or inconsistency of the studies submitted by sub-borrowers, who
find it rather difficult to use the methodology proposed in the manual.
Utilization of a simpler methodology would cut the time required for analysis.
3.   The growing tendency to build roads to a higher level than the
program is intended to finance could be tackled by providing some incentives
to construct simpler roads. We suggest that the possibility be studied of
establishing differential rates of financing or E? greater use] of grants or
the use of the Special Assistance Program for subprojects involving D, E and F
category roads.

4.   The interval between the signing of a contract with a sub-borrower
and approval of the final engineering designs averages a high 1.52 years. It
would be very beneficial to swifter project execution if the feasibility
studies submitted by the sub-borrowers were prepared on the basis of tile
relevant engineering plans. This would also ensure more accurate costing.
5.   The delays resulting from'switching or inclusion of new sections
during project implementation have already been significantly reduced in the
Third Feeder Roads Project through the requirement for a reserve pipeline of
roads for the various subprojects.
6.   To improve performance as measured in terms of disbursements it is
suggested that even before a new loan agreement is sigued, it be permissible
to maka contracts asd start on the execution of available subprojects that
meet the technical and economic requirements now fairly well cousolidated in
the most recent Feeder Roads Manual.
7.   There is still a problem, not easy to solve, regarding the
maintenance of gravel roads. Almost all the sub-borrowers carry out
maintenance work using only large mechanical graders, causing progressive
deterioration of the road surface. Only now are smaller machines beginning to
be constructed in Brazil that are more compatible with the construction and
maintenance requirements for feeder roads.
