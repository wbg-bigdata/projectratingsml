CORUM-CANKIRI RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
TURKEY
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        In the agricultural sector, IDA/Bank lending to Turkey totals
US$210.6 million equivalent (excluding IFC investments) and includes 7 credits
and 5 loans. Two loans and two credits, totalling US$69.2 million, were made
in 1952, 1963 and 1969 for the Seyhan Irrigation Project, including the dam;
this project is one of Turkey's more successful irrigation developments.
Progress is satisfactory on a 1971 credit of US$4.5 million for an Intensive
Dairy Production Project and on a 1971 credit/loan totalling US$25 million
for a Fruit and Vegetable Export Project. FY1972 credits of US$18 million
for an Irrigation Rehabilitation and Completion Project and US$16 million
for the Second Livestock Development Project became effective in April 1972
and January 1973 respectively. A US$74 million credit/loan helped finance
the Ceyhan Aslantas Multipurpose Project in 1974.
ii.       Agriculture in Turkey contributes about 26% of the GNP, 67% of the
export income, and employs 65% of the work force; the value added grew 3.2%
per annum from 1962 to 1972. Growth rates for production of industrial,
fruit and vegetable crops have been greater than those for cereals and
livestock, and the share in total agricultural production of the latter two
categories fell from 62% in 1962 to 58% in 1972. Turkey's Third Five Year
Development Plan (TFYP) indicates that the gross agricultural output must
increase by 4.5% per annum from 1972-77, although a higher rate of growth
of the industrial sector will,result in agriculture's share in total exports
falling from almost 70% to 19% in 1987. More than three quarters of the
planned investment in agriculture will go to land and water resources (43%)
and mechanization (34%). This program is mainly concerned with production
of crops under irrigation and the mechanization of commercial crop production.
Rainfed agriculture, however, predominates in the sector and the Government
has requested Bank assistance in financing an integrated rural development
project in Corum and Cankiri provinces where 90% of the cultivated land has
no irrigation and cereal and livestock production dominates the agriculture.
iii.      The total population of Corum and Cankiri, adjacent provinces in
the northern part of Central Anatolia (map), is 779,700 people of which
313,400 are employed in agriculture. There are 890,000 hectares of cultivated
land and 90,000 farm families, an average of almost ten hectares per holding.
Considerably more than one half of the holdings are less than ten hectares
in size. More than four fifths of the cropped area is planted to wheat and
barley and less than one tenth of the cultivated land is under irrigation
producing primarily sugar beets, food legumes, rice, fruits and legetables.
iv.       The Corum-Cankiri Rural Development Project would provide a means
to increase the production of crops and livestock and increase farmer income
and standard of living by means of the following:



- ii -
(a) an intensive extension service;
(b) credit through the Agricultural Bank of Turkey (ABT);
(c) new irrigation facilities and on-farm development for about
12,500 hectares of land;
(d) new village access roads and upgrading some existing roads;
(e) drinking water for 120 villages which have inadequate supply;
(f) electricity for 233 settlement areas; and
(g) construction of some social facilities in 63 villages.
In addition, the project would finance services of long-term and short-term
internationally recruited consultants, particularly to advise the project
extension service in management, technical specialization and in-service
training.
V.        Estimated total project cost including contingencies is US$161.6
million with an estimated foreign exchange component of 34% of the total cost.
Because of farmers' contributions short- and medium-term credit would be
financed by a revolving fund and the total project investment cost to the
Government of Turkey would be US$142.1 million. The Bank loan of US$75 mil-
lion would finance about 53% of the total project investment cost, including
all of the foreign exchange component and about one fourth of the local costs.
vi.       Civil works totalling about US$41.2 million, excluding contingencies,
would be carried out by various government agencies either by force account or
by contractors following local competitive bidding because of the diverse
nature of these works, their small size, scattered location and construction
over a relatively long time. Equipment totalling about US$8.7 million, exclud-
ing contingencies, would be procured by international competitive bidlding in
accordance with Bank guidelines and import licenses would be issued piow.lptly
to all successful bidders for such equipment.  In the event of any iters to
be procured under international competitive bidding being reserved for local
procurement, an equivalent amotnt of the Bank loan would be cancelled. Ap-
p-roxiinately US$30 million would be on-lent to farmers by ABT as credit for
aiinual crop expenses, purchase of farm machinery and construction of fatma
buildings.  Purchases made out of this credit would be through local conmler(cal
channels because of the individual nature of such purchases. Program etxpenses
for extension and veterinary services during the 5-year project period would
total about US$7.0 million, excluding contingencies.
vi.i.     Various agencies of the Turkish Government would be involved in im-
plementing the project: the General Directorate of Agricultural Affairs for
extension assistance to farmers in increasing crop and animal production; the
General Directorate of Veterinary Services for animal health and breed improve-
ment; the ABT for credit to farmers; General Directorate of State Hydraulic
Works (DSI) for construction of the larger irrigation works; TOPRAKSU for



- iii -
construction of small irrigation works, dams for livestock water and on-farm
development in all new irrigation schemes; General Directorate of Village
Roads, Water and Electricity Works (YSE) for village access road construction
and rehabilitation, and village water supply; Turkish Electric Authority (TEK)
for electrification of some villages; and the General Directorate of Land and
Resettlement (TOPRAK ISKAN) for construction of facilities at village centers.
The agencies which would be involved in construction would be responsible for
the operation and maintenance of these works. Consultants would be employed
by the Extension Service in the management and implementation of the Project
Extension Service. Project coordination would be provided by means of a
central advisory committee and two provincial advisory committees, one in
each province. The central committee would consist of the heads of each
agency involved in the project with the State Planning Organization (DPT)
acting as coordinator. Each provincial committee would consist of the officers
responsible for the work of each agency in each province under the chairmanship
of the Governor (Vali) of each province.  The secretary of the two provincial
committees would be the project extension director.
viii.     Increased production of agricultural commodities through higher
yields would provide significant economic improvement for the farm families
of the area.  With the exception of an increase in area planted to wheat,
barley and forage crops due to reduction of fallow land, the cropping pattern
would remain the same as at present. Production of wheat and barley would
increase from 389,000 tons without the project to 883,000 tons at full devel-
opment. Animal production increases would include an increase in milk pro-
duction (cattle, sheep and goats) from 69,000 tons to 116,000 tons, and meat
(all animals) from 7,000 tons to 17,000 tons. The economic rate of return
for the whole project is estimated to be 18%. Even with adverse assumptions
of costs and benefits the rate of return would fall no lower than 8.8%.
ix.       The main beneficiaries of the project would be the approximately
79,000 farm families whose incomes would be raised an estimated 70%, from
an average of about US$980 without the project to US$1,670 at full develop-
ment. Over half of the farms currently have an estimated income of between
US$60 and US$140 per capita. The national per capita income in Turkey in
1973 was about US$550. Based on the criterion of per capita incomes of less
than one third of the national average the majority of families in the project
area fall within the "target population" appropriate to a rural development
project. Incomes of about 1,250 farm families in the various irrigation
sch;mes would rise by an estimated 240% over levels attainable without irri-
gation. Labor required to implement project works and services is estimated
to be 1.55 million mandays from skilled workers and 1.49 million mandays from
unskilled workers during the first five years. It is estimated that addi-
tional employment on farms could total 2.57 million mandays per annum by the
eighth year of development.
x.        Agreement having been reached on the principal issues, subject to
the conditions of effectiveness, the project is suitable for a Bank loan of
US$75 million to the Government of Turkey. An appropriate term for the loan
is 25 years including 6 years of grace.






APPRAISAL OF
THE CORUM-CANKIRI RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
TURKEY
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Turkey has requested a Bank loan to help finance
an integrated rural development project in the provinces of Corum and Cankiri
in Central Anatolia. The proposed loan will be the first rural development
loan to Turkey. The Bank and IDA have made the following loans and credits
for agricultural development in Turkey:
(a)  The Seyhan Irrigation Project.  The first Bank loan, 63-TU
(1952 of US$25.2 million), assisted in financing construc-
tion of the Seyhan Multipurpose Dam. Credit 38-TU (1963
of US$20 million) helped to finance Stage I of the Seyhan
Irrigation Project (57,000 hectares) and has been completed.
Stage II of the project (Credit 143-TU for US$12.0 million
and Loan 587-TU for US$12.0 million, 1969) should be com-
pleted in 1975.
(b)  The Intensive Dairy Production Project.  Credit 236-TU
(1971 of US$4.5 million) became effective December 23,
1971.
(c)  The Fruit and Vegetable Export Project.  Credit 257-TU, of
US$15.0 million and Loan 762-TU, of US$10.0 million (1971)
became effective on May 19, 1972.
(d)  The Irri ation Rehabilitation and Completion Project.  Credit
281-TU (1972 of US$18.0 million) became effective in April
1972.
(e)  The Second Livestock Development Project.  Credit 330-TU for
US$16 million became effective in January 1973.
(f)  The Ceyhan Aslantas Multipuurpose Project.  Credit 360-TU (US$30.0
million) and Loan 883-TU (US$44.0 million) became effective
March 20, 1974.
1.02      This report is based on project preparation by the Government of
Turkey with assistance from the Bank and the FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program, and
the findings of an appraisal mission consisting of Messrs. J. R. Vaughn,
W.G. Donovan, W.A. Hardison, H.E. Walters (PT) (Bank) and D. Curtis and
D. Benor (Consultants).

II. COUNTRY BACKGROUND AND THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
A. Agriculture and Land Use
2.01      In Turkey, the agricultural sector provides about 26% of the GNP,
67% of total export income, and employs 65%-70% of the total work force.
From 1962 to 1972 the value added in agriculture grew at an average com-
pound rate of 3.2% per annum. The growth rates for production of indus-
trial crops, fruits and vegetables have been greater than those for cereals
and livestock, with the result that the share of the latter two categories
in total agricultural production had fallen to 58% by 1972 compared with
62% in 1962. These latter two subsectors of agriculture entirely dominate
the rural economy of Corum and Cankiri provinces, the project region.
2.02      The total cultivated area in 1972 in Turkey was about 25.1 million
hiectares, of which 9.0 million hectares were being fallowed, mainly as part
of the cereal/fallow rotation characteristic of lower rainfall areas. Approxi-
mately 16.1 million hectares were sown to field crops of which about 1.7 inil-
lion hectares, or 19.4%, were irrigated. Thus Turkish agriculture is pre-
dominantly rainfed, which leads to marked fluctuations in yields from year
to year as weather conditions change in the regions of low to moderate rain-
fall.
2.03      In 1972, 82% of the sown area was in cereals, of which 85% was in
wheat and barley.  From 1961 to 1972, the total area sown increased by almost
1 million hectares, and the area estimated to be fallowed by just over 1 mil-
lion hectares. This expansion in cultivated area was at the expense of mea-
dows and pastures whose area fell from 28.8 million hectares in 1961 to 26.1
million hectares in 1972.  Over the same period, cereal production becamre
iacreasingly concentrated on wheat, and the other single crop which registered
the largest expansion was sunflower, whose area rose by almost 380,000 hec-
tares (319%) over the 11 years (Annex 1, Table 1). At present, Governmnent is
encouraging the intensification of both livestock and wheat production through
the adoption of improved practices. With the anticipated improvement in grain
yields, the total area of wheat and fallow may decrease leaving more land
avrailable for pasture and forage crops. Government is also providing direct
assistance to the livestock industry through its General Livestock Development
Program, which includes breeding, dairy production, fattening and the estab-
iishment of additional marketing facilities.
B. Land Ownership and Land Reform
2.04      Under a land reform law promulgated in 1945, about 2 million hec-
tares of land were distributed to 370,000 families from 1947 to 1967, but
the pace of distribution had slowed markedly by the 1960s. Land distribu-
tion was resumed in a moderate fashion by the government in 1967, and a con-
siderably stronger Land Reform Bill was passed by the Turkish National



-3-
Assembly in mid-1973, although this Bill was weakened by modifications be-
tween publication and promulgation. Implementation began in Urfa province
in south-eastern Turkey in November 1974; the implementation rate has not
yet been clarified. Cadastral survey work is needed throughout the country,
both as a basis for land reform and to provide credit collateral for farmers
who do not now possess clear land titles.
2.05      Data relating to the size distribution of holdings are inadequate,
and the documentation is particularly weak for holdings over 100 hectares
in area. Such information as exists, covering about one half of the total
cultivated area of Turkey, suggests that the distribution is significantly
skewed (Annex 1, Table 2). Based on this information, 3.1% of the units
occupy 21.2% of the land area at the upper end of the size scale, and at
the lower end 48.2% of units occupy only 10.2% of the land.
C. Credit Sources
2.06      Credit for agriculture focuses on the Agricultural Bank of Turkey
(ABT), which dominates lending with its provision to agriculture of more
than 95% of the institutional credit flowing to the sector. 1/ It is also
the largest of the country's multitude of banks, holding about 25% of all
bank deposits.
2.07      Established in 1863, the ABT had, by 1971, a total of LT 11,546
million in credit outstanding to agriculture, of which LT 9,611 million
(83%) was short-term credit, generally for less than one year. ABT is
administered as a profit-making institution, reporting to the Ministry of
Commerce, and it receives a prescribed fraction of government receipts from
the land tax and other sources. It has a network of about 850 branches
throughout the country, and about 60% of its short-term lending to agri-
culture flows through some 2,700 credit and sales cooperatives whose ac-
tivities are controlled and supervised by the ABT. In an effort to extend
medium- and long-term lending, a supervised credit scheme was set up in 1964
in which the ABT provides planning and budgeting services to certain farmers
receiving development credit from the bank. This has necessitated an in-
crease in professional staff specializing in agronomy, animal husbandry
and related technical subjects. It is clear, however, that the ABT will
not be able to provide sufficient staff to prepare the farm plans for all
the development loans anticipated under the project, and it is planned that
the requisite technical input will be provided by personnel of the project
extension service to be set up in the Corum-Cankiri project area.
1/   Other institutions lending to agriculture include the Tobacco Growers'
Bank, Cotton Bank, Sugar Bank and Vine Growers' Bank.



2.08      In September of 1974, the ABT increased its interest rates for all
agricultural loans from 9.0% to 10.5% (Annex 2, Table 1). In addition, bor-
rowers pay a conmission charge of 0.5%, making the total effective rate 11.0%,
which is an improvement against a background of high inflation rates in
Turkey, and is generally in line with other interest rates in the economy
(Annex 2, Table 5).
D. Agricultural Policy of the Government
2.09      Turkey's Third Five Year Development Plan (TFYP) was drawn up in
a new 22-year perspective (1973-1995). Because of rapid changes in the
domestic economy and in the foreign sector, targets for 1995 are given for
income per person (four times the 1972 level), and the contribution to the
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by the main sectors (agriculture 16%, industry
34%). It is planned that the growth of the GDP would be 8.4% per year during
1973-87 (1971 factor cost); in order to meet the projected domestic and for-
eign demarld, the gross agricultural output must increase by 4.5% per annum
during the TFYP (1972-77). The share of agriculture in total fixed invest-
ment will decrease to 10% in the 1973-87 period and the share of agricul-
tural products in total exports should fall from 70% in 1972 to only 19%
in 1987 because of a corresponding rise in exports of industrial products.
The value of total agricultural exports are expected to rise 3.8% per year
during 1973-87.
2.10      In the TFYP, LT 33.0 billion have been allotted for agriculture
which is about 12% of the total investment program, and almost equal to
the monetary total (LT 33.3 billion) in both the first and second five year
plans. In the TFYP, more than three quarters of all planned investment in
agriculture goes to the development of land and water resources (43%) and
mechanization (34%). The investment program is mainly concerned with crop
production under irrigation and the equipment for commercial crop farmers
(wheat, cotton, sugar beet, etc.). Little attention is paid to the livestock
sector or small dryland farms. Production targets call for an annual rate of
growth of 4.0% for crops and 5.0% for livestock. The largest annual rate of
growth among crops is that of legumes and oilseeds (5.5% each) and the largest
annual growth rate in the livestock subsector the production of eggs (10.3%).
The objectives of the agricultural policy of the Turkish Government do not
emphasize the development of the rural sector as much as advocated by the
Bank. The Bank priorities for Turkey emphasize the direcr approach toward
helping the rural poor, dampening the rate of urban migration, investments that
contribute to greater regional balance and job creation. The proposed Corum-
Cankiri Rural Development Project meets these priorities.

III. THE PROJECT AREA
A. Area Features
3.01      Corum and Cankiri are adjacent provinces in the northern part of
the Central Anatolian Plateau (map) with a total population of 779,700 people,
601,700 in rural classifications of which 313,400 are employed in agriculture,
including forestry and landless workers (Annex 3, Tables 1, 2). Extensive
mountainous areas, 1 500 m. above sea level, comprise about 1,000 km2 out of
a total of 21,000 km in the two provinces where small areas are cultivated,
the remainder being meadows and forest. Lowland areas are mainly in the
southern part of the two provinces where the topography is mostly plateaus,
gently rolling hilly areas alternating with small narrow valleys. Irrigated
land is primarily in the valleys adjacent to the Kizilirmak river and other
perennial streams. Rainfed cultivation dominates the area suitable for agri-
culture and about 890,000 hectares are cultivated, of which approximately
100,000 hectares are irrigated. Soil information is acceptable enabling the
determination of land capability in the majority of the agricultural areas.
Soils are alkaline and quality is acceptable.
3.02      Rainfall averages about 400 mm per year and is distributed fairly
uniformly from mid-November until mid-June. Irrigation and livestock water
reservoirs are thus filled at the start of the summer. Irrigation is sup-
plied from dams on perennial streams, diversion dams and to a limited extent
from wells. Groundwater surveys to a depth of 150 m. have been carried out
by the General Directorate of State Hydraulic Works (DSI) and show significant
quantities of groundwater of suitable quality only in one basin in the project
area. Abundant mountain springs provide most of the domestic and livestock
water requirements and that for some small irrigated areas.
3.03      The cities of Corum and Cankiri are linked to Ankara by all-weather
asphalt surface roads, and a single track railway from the capital to the
Black Sea coast city of Zonguldak passes through Cankiri. There are no com-
mercial airports in either province. The main towns of both provinces are
served by all weather roads, either hard or gravel surfaced. Access to the
smaller villages is poor and some trails to the smallest villages, and those
in high mountainous areas, are impassable in winter even with four wheel drive
vehicles. People from such villages depend on tractor drawn trailers and
animal pulled carts for transportation.
3.04      All of the cities and large towns are electrified and have tele-
phone services but small villages, in remote areas away from main or branch
transmission lines, lack these facilities. By law, rural electr.Lfication is
carried out by the Turkish Electric Authority (TEK). Any village within
five km of an existing transmission line may apply for electrification.
The village must pay all costs from the transmission line to the village and



- 6 -
must advance, in cash, one fourth of the cost. Each householder must pay for
the cost of house wiring. TEK considers it uneconomical to electrify villages
of less than 400 population. As of March 1973, 23 villages of the 1,240 in
the two provinces had been supplied with electricity and facilities were under
construction for 32 more.
B. Land Tenure
3.05      As discussed earlier, records of land distribution by farm size are
incomplete in Turkey, and a similar situation applies to Corum and Cankiri
provinces, where existing information covers only 47% of the total area cul-
tivated in 1970. The official records show (Annex 1, Table 5) that 55% of the
total holdings cover less than 16% of the total area in the lower size groups
(3 hectares and less), while at the upper end of the distribution (20 hec-
tares and more) 2.5% of holdings occupy 18% of the land. The total cultivated
area (including fallow) is approximately 890,000 hectares, which is cultivated
by about 90,000 farmers in the two provinces, so that the average cultivated
area per holding is just under 10 hectares. This does not include the area
currently in pastures and meadows. Most of the latter represent lands which
are grazed in common by village flocks and herds. The extent of land leasing
in the two provinces is not known. However, inquiries in the villages
indicate that most of the cultivated land is freehold.
C. Production
3.06      Wheat and barley are the most important crops in the area, planted
on 433,000 hectares out of the 890,000 hectares cultivated. The cultivated
area includes 378,000 hectares of fallow under present practices, adding up
to more thian four fifths of the land allotted to these two small grains.
Average production based on 13 years' data is 371,000 tons of wheat and
195,000 tonls of barley. The two provinces also produce 106,000 tons of sugar
beets, 40,000 tons of potatoes, 25,000 tons of legumes, 20,000 tons of rice,
and 38,000 tons of various fruit crops (Annex 4, Tables 1 and 2). Wheat yields
average 1.4 tons per hectare in Corum and 0.9 in Cankiri while barley yields
average 1.7 tons per hectare in Corum and 0.9 in Cankiri (Annex 4, Table 2),
ceflecting land use and ecological variations between provinces.
3 37      Total production and yield per hectare of both wheat and barley were
relatively unchanged over the period 1961-1973, except for yearly fluctua-
tion due to variation in annual rainfall and distribution. The production and
yield of most other crops, especially those under irrigation such as sugar
beets, potatoes and rice, have increased over the same period (Annex 4,
Table 1).



-7-
3.08      The greatest impact on production should come from increased yields
of wheat and barley brought about by adoption of better cultural practices
such as the use of improved seed, adequate fertilizer, better weed control,
and improved seedbed preparation. In areas where rainfall exceeds 400 mm
annually in the 890,000 hectares presently cultivated, the practice of fal-
lowing land in the year following cereals would be stopped, thus allowing
more land to be planted to cereals and forage crops.
3.09      Livestock production in Turkey accounted for about 30% of the value
of all agricultural output in 1972. Although total production has increased
by about 3% annually during recent years, most of the increase was attri-
butable to a rather rapid growth in the production of poultry meat and eggs.
En 1972 in the two provinces, the output of red meat and milk was approxi-
mately 15,000 tons and 102,000 tons respectively.
3.10      A major constraint to increasing the output of livestock products
is the shortage of feed, particularly high quality feed. Nearly 80% of the
total energy consumed by animals comes from low quality roughages which pro-
vide little more than a maintenance diet. Pastures are grossly overstocked
and overgrazed and animals are on a comparatively good level of nutrition for
only a brief period during the spring and early summer when pastures are the
most productive.
3.11      It is estimated that the current net farm income per capita for an
average 10 hectare farm is about US$195 per annum. For smaller farms, which
comprise considerably more than one half of the total number, the average net
farm income per capita is estimated to be between US$60 and US$140 per annum.
rhe GNP per capita in Turkey in 1973 was about US$550 (Annex 1). Based on the
criterion of per capita income less than one third of the national average,
it is clear that the majority of farm families in the project area fall within
the "target population" appropriate to a rural development project.
D. Cooperatives
3.12      Up to November 1973, just over 19,500 cooperatives had been formed
in Turkey, of which about 9,408, or 48%, were closely related to the agricul-
tural sector (Annex 5). The credit and sale cooperatives are important vehi-
cles for conveying loans to farmers from the ABT. In 1965, the movement was
begun to establish new entities called Village Development Cooperatives, whose
numbers have now risen to over 4,500 or 23% of the total. Assistance with the
organization of these bodies has been a major function of the General Directo-
rate of Cooperatives within the Ministry of Village Affairs. The Village
Development Cooperatives have several generally expressed aims, which include
facilitating marketing of farm products, raising profitability of farming,
meeting personal consumption requirements of members, exploitation of natural
resources, establishment of village industries, and attending to "vocational
needs" of members. In practice the latter aim has taken precedence, in the
sense that the cooperatives have facilitated the migration of workers to
foreign countries and have served to some degree as a vehicle for repatriation



- 8 -
of migrant workers' earnings into local project investment. In 1973, there
were 181 Village Development Cooperatives in Cankiri and Corum provinces,
claiminig a total membership of about 11,800 persons and pledged capital of
LT 27.6 million, of which LT 18 million (65%) was paid up capital. 1/ About
44 cooperatives had set up projects, mostly of an agricultural nature (such
as cattle fattening or poultry units), with total fixed investments of LT 21.6
million. 2/ Government aid to these projects had totalled LT 1.6 million, of
which LT 0.5 million was grants and the balance credit. The 44 cooperatives
had a total of 1,086 persons as their quota of workers who would receive
priority for Migration to work in European countries.
3.13      The Ministry of Village Affairs views the multi-purpose Village
Development Cooperatives as an organizational base upon which a super-structure
of agro-industries might be erected, and to this end is continuing feasibility
studies to determine the scope for such enterprises.
E. Marketing
3.14      More than half of the wheat currently produced in the two provinces
is exported to other parts of Turkey, and almost all of this is handled by
private traders who purchase either directly from farmers or from market floors
in main towns (Annex 6). The Soil Products Office (TMO) has an annual uptake
of less than 1% of total production, and it sells more wheat in the provinces
than it purchases there. The TIO has five buying stations in the project
area. Most of the barley cur4ently produced is used for feeding livestock,
and the marketed portion (estimated to be about one third) moves from grain
floors to breweries and other destinations outside the provinces.
3.15      There are four sugar factories near to the project area, in the
adjoining provinces of Amasya, Ankara, Tokat and Kastamonu. Sugar beet
already produced in the project area is processed by these factories, par-
ticularly t:he first two, and beet pulp by-product from the factories is used
for livestock fattening.
3.16      Livestock are slauglhtered in small village establishments or in
municipal slaughterhouses. There are 19 of the latter in the project area,
handling an estimated 15% of current meat production. Live animals also move
to slaughter cstablishments of the Meat and Fish Organization (EBK) in Ankara,
Kayseri and Istanbul, either directly or by way of fattening facilities
associated with sugar factories in adjoining provinces. The EBK acquires
about 10% of all meat produced in Turkey.
3.17      Most of the milk currently produced (from dairy-cows, dairy buf-
faloes, sheep and goats) is hfrme consumed, either in liquid form or after
processing into butter, cheese and yogurt. The Milk Organization (TSEK) has
erected a modern processing plant in Cankiri town, with a capacity of 25 tons
in an eight-hour shift, and is in the process of constructing a similar plant
in Corum town.

- 9 -
3.18      The small proportion of wool not used directly by producing families
is collected from villages by buying agents for larger dealers both inside
and outside the project area. Mohair is purchased both by Mohair Sales Co-
operatives established with government support, and by private dealers. In
recent years purchases by the latter have risen significantly, while opera-
tions of the cooperatives have tended to decrease.
F. Credit
3.19      As for the country as a whole, institutional lending to agriculture
in Cankiri and Corum is totally dominated by the ABT. The Sugar Bank has a
branch in Cankiri.
3.20      In 1973, there were 19 branches of the ABT and 65 agricultural
credit cooperatives in the two provinces with a total membership of just over
66,000 farmers, or 74% of those cultivating land (Annex 2, Table 2). Loans
outstanding at the end of 1973 totalled just over LT 206 million, of which
LT 112 million was handled directly by the ABT and LT 94 million through the
credit cooperatives. During the period 1970 to 1974, total lending rose by
almost 112%, but there was little change in the distribution of loans made by
ABT itself, with about 23,000 short-term loans and 6,000 longer-term loans
handled both in 1970 and 1974. The average size of short-term ABT loans al-
most doubled during the period, while that of medium- and long-term loans more
than tripled, reflecting the increased attention given to supervised credit,
beginning in 1970 in Cankiri and 1972 in Corum, and the effects of inflation.
The total value of overdue loans remained at a relatively constant absolute
level during the period, but as a proportion of total value of outstanding
loans, total value of overdues fell significantly, from about 45% in 1970 to
less than 20% in 1974. To lhandle the increased lending, staff numbers were
increased by only 22%, including five agronomists hired in connection with
the supervised credit schemes.
G. Agricultural Extension and Research
3.21      Agricultural. research and agricultural extension are the respon-
sibility of the General Directorate of Agricultural Affairs of the Ministry
of Food, Agriculture and Livestock. In Corum province there is a branch
research station with a small staff. The national research program has re-
cently included intensive efforts on improving small grains and the cultural
practices for improved production. This work was largely done in Jther areas
of Anatolia but the results and recommendations should be applicable to the
project area.
3.22      Each province has a provincial extension service director with a
small staff of specialists (about 7) located in each capital. In addition
each of thle 19 subprovinces has an office and staff numbering from 1 to as
many as 6. The majority of the staff, both at the specialist and technical



- 10 -
level, are inexperienced, inadequately trained and the number of staff is
totally inadequate to provide for the needs of the farmers. The time of the
present extension service staff is taken up primarily by regulatory work and
this staff will continue to handle this work while the project extension
service will be involved solely in agricultural extension.
H. Social Services
3.23      The 1970 Census indicates that, of the population in the two prov-
inces over six years of age, more than 53% were illiterate. Almost 67% of
females were illiterate and almost 39% of males. The illiteracy rate was
higher in Corum province (55%) than in Cankiri (50%), and in both cases the
national illiteracy rate (45% in 1970) was exceeded.
3.24      In 1967, there were 935 villages with primary schools in the two
provinces and 305 villages without schools. Of the latter, children from
a further 202 villages were able to attend schools in other villages, although
for only 106 of these 202 villages were the access roads to schools passable
the year round.
3.25      For health institutions, both provinces are considerably less well
served than the nation as a whole. In 1970 there were 10.6 hospital beds for
each 10,000 people compared with a national average of 20.2. In addition
there were 0.8 doctors, 1.1 registered nurses and 2.1 midwives per 10,000 of
population, compared with the averages of 3.9, 2.5 and 3.2 respectively at
the national level. Only 0.8% of the total pharmacies in the country are
located in the project area which has 2.2% of the national population.
3.26      By mid-1973, only 23 villages of a total of 1,240 in the two prov-
inces had been provided with electricity and about 42% of settlements had
modern drinking water supply units. The 1970 Census indicated that slightly
more than 18% of the households had electricity (clearly mostly in the major
towns) and 16% of households had running water.

IV. THE CORUM-CANKIRI RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
A.  Objectives
4.01      The-objectives of the Corum-Cankiri project are:
(a)  to raise production, and thereby incomes by:
(i) an intensive extension services including provision of
consultants and in-service training;
(ii) credit through ABT;
(iii) new irrigation facilities for about 12,500 hectares
and on-farm development for about 7,500 hectares of land;
and
(b) to improve rural infrastructure by providing:
(i) new village access roads and upgrading some existing
roads;
(ii) drinking water for 120 villages which have no adequate
supply;
(iii) electricity for 233 settlement areas; and
(iv) some social facilities in 63 villages.
B. Description
4.02      The FAO/IBRD Preparation Mission, recognizing that a project which
had as its goal complete development of the two provinces would be too large,
recommended that project efforts be concentrated on 270 villages which
appeared to local agricultural, veterinary and administrative staff to have
"unusually high physical and social potential for development". These select-
ed villages were scattered quite widely throughout the provinces with some
in each of 16 of the 19 counties. Project preparation, including plans for
farm development and infrastructure, continued within the context of these
270 villages. The pre-appraisal and appraisal missions of the Bank altered
the project concept to incorporate an agricultural extension service and agri-
cultural credit establishment which would reach almost all farms in the dry-
land area. These missions found the scope of proposed major and minor irriga-
tion development to be appropriate, with the exception of one DSI scheme for
which reconnaisance studies showed an unsatisfactory dam site, and insuffi-
cient information available for an alternative site. The infrastructural



- 12 -
program (roads, water supply, electricity and village centers) which had been
proposed for the 270 villages was also judged to be of acceptable size. A
major component dealing with agro-industries was dropped from consideration
because inadequate preparatory studies had been performed and a component
relating to forestry development was dropped at an early stage. During ap-
praisal, the proposed impact of the project on farm development (particu-
larly via the extension service and agricultural credit components) was con-
siderably widened while keeping the infrastructural components at about the
same level in physical terms as originally envisaged.
4.03      The project would provide the means necessary to achieve in-
creased production of crops and livestock. In crop production this would be
accomplished by providing the inputs needed: (a) knowledge of better methods
of seedbed preparation, seeding, weed control, pest control and harvesting;
(b) credit for purchase of seed, fertilizer, pest control materials, and
farm machinery. Similarly for livestock production by providing: (a) better
methods of feeding, health and disease control; (b) improvement in the
quality of the animals by upbreeding; (c) credit for buildings and other
facilities. In addition, new lands would be brought under irrigation and on-
farm development would be carried out thereon. To improve the living condi-
tions of the rural population, water supply, electricity, new and improved
access roads and village centers would also be provided and maintained.  To
provide for a second integrated rural development project, government agencies
would be encouraged to prepare such a project, with assistance from the FAO/
IBRD Cooperative Program.
4.04      To achieve increased production of crops and livestock a project
extension service would be established under the Director-General of Agricul-
tural Affairs in the Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Livestock. This ser-
vice would deal solely with extension work in the project area, an approach
successfully tested in the Seyhan Irrigation Project. The basic unit of
agricultural production in Turkey is the village, and village agents (VA)
would be selected from among the village farmers to serve as the key elements
of the extension service. The VA would receive intensive in-service training
as well as technical support from the extension agents and subject matter
specialists (SMS) of the project extension service. These specialists would
be provided with in-service training and would be backstopped by three inter-
nationally recruited consultants. During negotiations, assurance was obtained
that three extension consultants, acceptable to the Bank, would be appointed
under terms and conditions agreed with the Bank, within three months of the
effectiveness of the loan. There would be a Project Director of Extension
and a Deputy Director for each province. The appointment of the first direc-
tor and his two deputies is a condition of effectiveness. Details of the
extension program can be found in Annex 7.
4.05      The Bank's contribut40n, totalling about US$34.4 million, towards
incremental short-term and medium-term credit needs on farms, would be on-lent
by the Government to the ABT, which would in turn use these funds to finance
about 61% of the estimated farm credit needs of the project development pro-
gram. The ABT would increase its short- and medium-term lending by US$22.1



- 13 -
million from domestic sources of funds in step with funds available from the
Bank, about US$8.6 million of which would be from repayments of medium-term
loans. Approximately US$15.7 million of the Bank's contribution would support
a revolving fund for short-term credit (one year or less) to finance cultiva-
tion expenses, seeds, fertilizers and pesticides used in growing crops. A
further US$18.7 million would contribute to a revolving fund for medium-term
credit (five years) to help finance the purchase of about 3,500 tractors (and
associated cultivation and seeding implements), and the upgrading of buildings
for livestock accommodation (Annex 12). The ABT has indicated that the 2.5%
spread between its borrowing rate from the Bank and its lending rate to sub-
borrowers would be adequate to cover administrative costs.
4.06      The Veterinary Service of the Ministry of Food, Agriculture and
Livestock would be responsible for providing assistance in animal health,
disease control and the improvement of livestock through breeding and artifi-
cial insemination. This would involve an expansion of the existing services
in the project area. The technicians and specialists of the Veterinary
Service would deal directly with the livestock owners, coordinating their
work with the extension staff. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that
the General Directorate of Veterinary Services would provide all the staff
and facilities necessary to carry out the above program in the project area.
4.07      Five irrigation systems, including water supply and distribution
network for 7,450 hectares would be constructed by DSI. In two of these,
construction commenced in 1974, and about US$1 million retroactive financing
is provided for expenditures after September 1, 1974. TOPRAKSU would be
responsible for construction of 13 small irrigation schemes totalling 5,050
hectares and for on-farm development for about 7,500 hectares as well as for
the construction of 17 small dams (under 15 m. in height) which would provide
water for livestock. Construction would be phased over six years.
4.08      The General Directorate of Village Roads, Water and Electricity
Works (YSE), an experienced agency of the Government, would construct 65 km
of new village roads of gravel and/or asphalt surface to provide access to
villages presently served by trails. These would be built to YSE standards
(Annex 8, Table 4). Provision would also be made to rehabilitate 164 km of
existing roads and maintain a total of 904 km of new and old roads. Al-
though the Bank has not previously financed YSE road building, those con-
structed by YSE within Bank-financed projects have been found to be of accept-
able quality. YSE would also provide drinking water to 120 villages, with a
total population of 86,554, through 177 supply units (157 springs and 20 from
wells). The villagers would be required to provide the labor for excavation
of the pipe trenches from the supply source to the village.
4.09      The Directorate of Village Electrification of TEK would provide
electricity for 164 settlement areas in Corum province and 69 in Cankiri.
The cost of these works would be recovered according to Turkish law (TEK Law
1312, Article 4) which states that 25% of the estimated cost is to be collect-
ed in advance and the remaining 75% by means of tariffs over a 30-year period.



- 14 -
4.10      The General Directorate of Land and Resettlement (TOPRAK-ISKAN) of
the Ministry of Village Affairs would construct under the project, over 5
years, 63 area social complexes at village centers, 20 in Cankiri and 43 in
Corum. Such facilities have not been available to villagers in the past. The
complex consists of a community meeting hall, a public laundry and a public
bath, and should result in improving the health of the population, as well as
providing a focus for educational activities.
C. Cost Estimates
4.11      The estimated total project cost, based on January 1975 prices,
is US$161.6 million, including contingencies. Physical contingencies total
15% of the base costs for civil works (DSI, TOPRAKSU and YSE), 10% for other
social infrastructure and farm buildihgs, and 5% for the extension and
veterinary service components. Price contingencies total US$41.4 million,
and are 34% of the total project base cost plus physical contingencies.
Price contingencies allow for annual increases in equipment costs of 12%
in 1975, 10% in 1976, 8% in the period 1977-1979, and 7% from 1980 onwards.
They allow for annual increases in cost of civil works of 16% in 1975, 14%
in 1976, 12% in the period 1977-1979, and 10% from 1980 onwards. The foreign
exchange component of US$54.3 million is 34% of total project cost. Project
costs are summarized in the table below, while detailed estimates are given
in Annex 8.

D. Financing
4.12      The total investment cost of the two farm development components of
buildings and machinery (US$45.0 million including contingencies) would be
initially financed by US$10.9 million from project beneficiaries and US$34.1
million from medium-term credit through the ABT. The Bank would provide
US$18.7 million of this, and the ABT US$15.4 million. Sub-loans would be for
five to seven years with one year of grace. Since ABT would receive about
US$8.6 million in repayments from sub-borrowers over the project period, it
would need to find only US$6.8 million in additional funds. Taking into ac-
count the initial contribution from sub-borrowers (US$10.9 million) and repay-
ments to the revolving fund (US$8.6 million), the initial investment cost for
the whole project to the Government of Turkey would not be US$161.6 million
but rather the lower sum of US$142.1 million, including all contingencies.
The Bank loan would finance 53% (US$75 million) of this total initial invest-
ment cost or 46% of the total project cost. All funds for other than credit
to be provided by Government would pass through normal budgetary channels,
including those for TEK. Financing of project costs would be shared in the
following amounts and proportions:

E. Implementation Schedule
4.13      The project is expected to reach full development in eight years.
With the exception of two DSI irrigation schemes whose construction commenced
in late 1974, construction of civil works would begin in 1975 and be completed
by 1980. Procurement would be completed by 1981. A schedule of the phasing
of costs is given in Annex 9, Table 2, and in Chart 1.
F. Procurement
4.14      DSI, TOPRAKSU, YSE, TEK and TOPRAK-ISKAN would prepare and submit
for the approval of the Bank design and specification documents for construc-
tion of dams, associated irrigation structures, and all other construction
including rural water supply, roads, electricity supply and village centers,
together with bidding documents whenever any items are contracted and amount
to more than US$100,000. Because of the diverse nature of these works, their
small size, scattered locations and construction over a relatively long time,
contracts would be awarded on the basis of local competitive bidding, or by
force account by the organizations responsible for the various works, which
are both acceptable. Embassies of member countries will be notified when
contracts are expected to exceed US$100,000.
4.15      Heavy machinery and equipment totalling about US$8.7 million (ex-
cluding contingencies) to be purchased for the project by the relevant
agencies would be bulked wherever possible, and would be tendered subject to
international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank Group's "Guide-
lines for Procurement". Lists of this equipment are in Annex 8, Table 2.
An assurance was obtained that import licenses would be issued promptly to
all successful bidders for equipment contracts put to international competi-
tive bidding. Goods manufactured in Turkey may be granted a margin of prefer-
ence in accordance with Bank procedures. In the event that equipment and/or
machinery proposed to be purchased under international competitive bidding is
reserved by the Government for local procurement, the cost would be met from
local funds, and an equivalent amount of the loan would be cancelled.
4.16      For other project goods, numerous individual purchases by farmers
over an extended period would make bulking of procurement and therefore
international competitive tendering impracticable. Procurement would
thus be through local commercial channels which include private traders,
state trading entities and cooperatives. These channels offer an adequate
choice of locally manufactured and internally supplied goods.



- 18 -
G. Disbursements
4.17      The proposed loan of US$75 million would be disbursed over a 6-year
period (Annex 9, Table 2) as follows:
(a) at 38% of total expenditures of irrigation, livestock water
supply, roads and domestic water supply civil works;
(b) at 15% of total expenditures of electricity supply and village
centers civil works;
(c) at 50% of total expenditures of the project extension service
and the project veterinary service components during their
first five years;
(d) at 70% of total incremental short-term credit for crop growing
expenses; and 55% of subloans for farm livestock buildings
and machinery;
(e) at 100% of foreign expenditures on imported equipment for DSI,
TOPRAKSU, YSE, TEK, TOPRAK-ISKAN, and the extension and veterinary
services or 100% of the ex-factory cost of locally produced
goods procured under international competitive bidding;
(f) at 100% of foreign expenditures for overseas training of
project staff; and
(g) at 100% of total expenditures on consultants.
For force account work on civil works' components, disbursements would be made
against statements of work performed by the relevant agency, the full docu-
mentation being retained by the executing agency and available for inspection
by the Bank. All other disbursements would be made against the Bank's normal
documentation procedures. Any savings after completion of the project would
be cancelled. Commitment charges and interest on the Bank loan would be met
by the Borrower.
4.18      Retroactive financing for construction of two DSI irrigation schemes
(the Corum Dam and the Kumbaba Pumping Project), incurred after September 1,
1974, up to a total of US$1 million, has been agreed to by the Bank in support
of the initiative of the agency in commencing this part of the project (para
4.07).

H. Environment and Health
4.19      At present, industrial wastes present few problems affecting the
environment in either province and no industries which would be likely to
cause air pollution are anticipated as a result of project implementation.
As elsewhere in Turkey where there is a semi-arid climate, cold winters and
hot summers, serious endemic diseases which might be common in warm humid
climates are not found. Colds, influenza and enteric diseases are common
and sanitary conditions in the villages and towns are poor. Construction
of public baths in village centers would be expected to improve health condi-
tions in the settlements involved. A greater use of chemical fertilizers and
pesticides would increase chances of pollution of water supplies by runoff
of these chemicals. However, this danger would be slight when used at the
rates required for good crop production and under the guidance of the extension
service personnel.
V. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Organization and Management
5.01      The management and direction of the project would be located in the
project area. A central advisory committee would be established within three
months of effectiveness of the loan agreement, located in Ankara, and consist-
ing of the Directors-General or their representatives of the agencies involv-
ed in the project. The Ministry of Finance would also be represented on the
co ittee. It would serve primarily to approve the annual programs of work,
receive and review progress reports and advise on policy matters. The State
Planning Organization (DPT) would be the coordinating agency. Project progress
reports would be sent by DPT to the Bank. At the provincial level, an
advisory committee consisting of representatives of all agencies working in the
project would be established in each province under the chairmanship of the
provincial Governor (Vali). The secretary of each provincial committee would
be the project extension director employed by the Ministry of Food, Agricul-
ture and Livestock, General Directorate of Agricultural Affairs, who would
be the coordinator of field activities. Assurances were obtained at negotia-
tions that the central advisory committee and the two provincial advisory
committees would be established as proposed within three months of the effec-
tiveness of the loan agreement.
5.02      The success of the project would be dependent on the formation of
an intensive extension service for the project and its management. A well-
qualified experienced directcr would be selected, and would be assisted by
two deputy directors, each in charge of extension in one province. There
would be a head of extension in each county of each province reporting to
the deputy director, and under him assistants who together would supervise
the village agents (VA). In each province there would be a staff of subject
matter specialists (SMS), assigned as needed, primarily to provide the county



- 20 -
agents with the necessary information and training, who in turn would carry
out the supervision and training of the VA. Since the administrators,
specialists and technicians would not work with the farmers directly, but
through the VA, this person would be the key individual in the extension
scheme. He would be selected from among the most progressive farmers in
the villages by the county extension agent in consultation with the village
leaders and with the approval of the deputy director. As a local leader, he
would command the respect and confidence of his fellow farmers. The VA would
be supervised by the county agents and his assistants and would be backstopped
by the SMS. All extension personnel would receive intensive in-service train-
ing by staff of the project extension service and of the national training
institute of the General Directorate of Agricultural Affairs. Assurances were
obtained at negotiations that a project extension service would be progressive-
ly staffed and organized as herein proposed, and maintained for the life of
the project, unless modified by mutual agreement. A condition of effectiveness
of the loan is the establishment of the project extension service. Details of
the extension service project operations are given in Annex 7.
5.03      Government agencies responsible for specific aspects of the project
would carry out their work according to the plans submitted to and coordinated
by the provincial committees. The provincial advisory committees would
review all progress reports of the various agencies, transmit these to the
central advisory committee, and would receive oral reports at regular meet-
ings. The committees would meet quarterly. It is expected that initially the
committees may need more frequent meetings and special meetings of the commit-
tees could be requested at any time by any member.
5.04      In order to determine the progress of the project, identify areas
of difficulty, and to provide data on rural development, a system for monitor-
ing production, costs and income and the adoption of new practices would be
established as soon as the project becomes effective (Annex 10). These data
would be routinely collected by the project extension service and would be
included in progress reports. The Government of Turkey would make a base
line survey of the project area and regularly collect data until full develop-
ment of the project for purposes of project monitoring and evaluation. Assur-
ances to this effect were obtained at negotiations.
5.05      The Bank's contribution towards incremental farm credit needs (paras
4.06 and 4.12) would be on-lent by the Government of Turkey to the ABT under
the same terms and conditions as the Bank loan and an assurance to this effect
was obtained during negotiations. The ABT would lend these funds to farmers
in the project area, for project expenditures, at an interest rate of not
less than 10.5% plus a commission charge of 0.5%. In addition, the ABT would
increase lending from its own domestic sources of funds in step with disburse-
ment of the Bank contribution, by providing about 39% of the funds for credit
in the project area. Assurances that such funds would be made available from
Government and that the interest rate charged by ABT would be as stated above
were obtained at negotiations. The phasing of estimated incremental credit
needs (Annex 2) is reflected in estimated disbursement of credit by the Bank
in paras 4.05 and 4.17 above..



- 21 -
5.06      Approval of technical and financial feasibility of credit applica-
tions of farmers or other individuals would be the responsibility of agents
of the project extension service, while the ABT would be responsible for ap-
proval of applications based-on creditworthiness of the applicants. For
processing loan applications, the ABT would use the following guidelines:
(a) for short-term loans for cultivation expenses, seeds, fertilizer
and chemicals, per hectare norms for each crop would be set each
year on the basis of technical recommendations of the project ex-
tension service, who would also be responsible for monitoring
the use of these loans;
(b) for approval of medium-term subloans for farm machinery and
buildings, the ABT would rely on the development plan prepared
by the project extension service, which would have competent
staff to carry out this function, for technical and financial
aspects. ABT would make its own creditworthiness evaluation.
Farmers' contributions would be 20% for buildings and 25% for
investment in farm machinery, and loans would be for five and
seven years respectively, with repayment commencing one year
following disbursement of loan funds. The ABT would develop
sample loan evaluations and subloan agreements which would be
submitted to the Bank for its review and concurrence;
(c) the ABT would accept as security from small farmers not only
real estate mortgages but also chattel mortgages on livestock
and equipment plus guarantees of co-signors;
(d) the ABT would establish and maintain two separate accounts for
project funds, one for short-term and one for medium-term funds.
Deposits into these accounts would be made up of:  (i) govern
ment on-lending of Bank funds; (ii) government contribution of
local currency funds; (iii) repayments from sub-borrowers.
Funds in these accounts would be used for subloans under the
project and repayments to government. ABT would have these
accounts audited annually, and would send copies of the au-
dited accounts in English to the Bank within five months of
the end of its fiscal year; and
(e) except as the Bank shall otherwise agree ABT would not make
subloans to any one borrower exceeding in aggregate US$20,000.
Assurances on the above points were obtained during negotia-
tions.
5.07      Because of the limited number of crops and relatively straight-
forward needs for equipment and inputs, the lending operations foreseen are
expected to be relatively simple and easy to execute. However, to facilitate
administration of lending, following the establishment of the project exten-
sion service, ABT and the extension service would enter into arrangements



- 22 -
satisfactory to the Bank, to define in detail the responsibilities, functions,
and administrative procedures for implementing the general provisions stated
above. Sample loan applications, evaluations and agreements would be sub-
mitted to the Bank. Also, the ABT would ensure that staff in sufficient
numbers and of appropriate competence would be provided to the branches in
the project area to facilitate the increased lending program envisaged by the
project. The ABT would designate its highest ranking official or its repre-
sentative to serve on the ceutral advisory committee, and in the project
area would designate its highest ranking provincial official or its repre-
sentative to serve on each of the provincial advisory committees. The credit
program would be reviewed by these committees and their semi-annual and annual
reports,would be sent to the Bank. Assurances were obtained at negotiations
that the above staffing, organizational representation and review procedures
would be implemented, and that the review reports would be furnished to the
Bank.
B. Operation and 1Maintenance
5.08      The main works of the DSI constructed irrigation projects including
the dam structures, pumping plants, concrete-lined main irrigation canals
and adjacent roads would be operated and maintained by DSI. The lateral canal
systems of these works and of those constructed by TOPRAKSU would be operated
and maintained by the village governing bodies, which is being done in the
case of completed projects in the area. YSE is responsible for operating and
maintaining the roads and village drinking water systems, whether from springs
or wells. TEK would be responsible for the operation and maintenance of the
entire village electrification system as it is currently doing. The village
governing bodies would have the responsibility for the maintenance of the
village center buildings and facilities. TOPRAK-ISKAN will cause the villages
to operate and maintain these facilities in accordance with appropriate
policies and practices and make periodic inspections of the facilities. The
various government agencies listed above are capable of operating and maintain-
ing the works of which they are in charge. Villagers have little knowledge
or experience in this area and where they are given this responsibility,
training progras should be provided by the responsible agencies. This is
particularly important in the case of the irrigation projects. Assurances
were obtained to this effect at negotiations.
C. Consultant Services and Training
5.09      Proposals would be requested from suitable organizations and/or
individuals for consultants for advisory positions with the project extension
service in management and in-service training. Short-term specialists also
will be hired as needed. About 220 man-months of consulting services are
expected to be required for both long- and short-term engagements. Terms of
reference for these consultants are given in Annex 11. Funds have been pro-
vided in the project for short-term in-service training in other countries
for project personnel.



- 23 -
D. Cost Recovery
5.10      DSI.   Under Turkish law, DSI is empowered to levy charges to meet
its operation and maintenance costs on main irrigation works and to recover
investment with interest. Agreement was obtained during negotiations on
application of the following cost recovery: (i) operation and maintenance
costs of the DSI dams and the irrigation and drainage systems based on the
actual annual expenditures incurred in accordance with Law 6200; (ii) invest-
nment costs in the construction of the DSI dams and of irrigation and drainage
systems in accordance with Law 6200 over a maximum period of 50 years. Assur-
ances were obtained, to the extent permitted by the laws of the Borrower,
that the above water and land development charges including reasonable in-
terest on the investment costs would be introduced immediately after con-
struction is completed of such irrigation facilities in any portion of the
project area.
5.11      TOPRAKSU.  Similar provisions under Laws 7457 and 6200 permit full
recovery of costs under TOPRAKSU schemes. During negotiations, assurances
were obtained that within 12 months of the effective date of the loan agree-
ment, the Government would submit a proposal to the Bank, for its concurrence,
as to how it proposes to recover from beneficiaries all or part of the invest-
ment cost of TOPRAKSU works under the project. Operation and maintenance of
TOPRAKSU works are the responsibility of the governing bodies of villages using
the works. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that in the event
that governing bodies of villages fail to adequately maintain and operate
TOPRAKSU works, the government would operate and maintain such works and re-
cover the actual cost from the villages.
5.12      YSE.  In accordance with existing Government regulations, there
would be no cost recovery (either of capital or of operation and maintenance
costs) on roads and rural water supply schemes constructed and maintained by
YSE although, as noted in para 4.08, villagers would contribute labor to the
construction of the water supply systems. The project would provide water to
public fountains in villages. This policy makes it difficult to raise suffi-
cient resources to meet the needs of villages throughout Turkey, but would be
difficult to change for the few villages in this project. Individual house
connections would be installed at the cost of the beneficiary. In this event
the Government would take steps necessary to ensure full recovery of all costs
and YSE would assist in establishing an adequate tariff structure, billing and
collection procedures. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that
Government would ensure that costs for private house connections would be
paid by the beneficiary, and that YSE would assist the village councils to
establish an adequate tariff structure and collection procedures.
5.13      TEK.  A flat rate charge per kwh of electric power consumed would
be levied on the governing body of each participating village.  Under Turkish
law, this charge is intended to recover, over a period of years, that portion



- 24 -
of investment cost remaining after the village has made the one-fourth down-
payment prior to construction.  No charges are explicitly levied for opera-
tion and maintenance, which are usually performed by TEK in practice, even
though the responsibility lies with the villages themselves under the law. 1/
5.14      Village Centers.  There would be no recovery of investment costs
for these structures, but the villages concerned would be responsible for op-
eration and maintenance. Assurances were obtained that TOPRAK-ISKAN would
cause the villages to operate and maintain these facilities.
5.15      Extension Service.  There would be no costs recovery for this ser-
vice.
5.16      Veterinary Service.  There would be no charges for artificial in-
semination of cattle, but flat rate charges, in accordance with existing regu-
lations, would be levied for vaccinations administered to cattle, sheep or
goats.
5.17      Buildings and Machinery.  The full investment costs of farm build-
ings and machinery would be met by farmers with the assistance of medium-term
loans from the ABT.
E. Accounts and Audit
5.18      Separate accounts maintained for their portions of the project by
the DSI, Directorates of the Ministry of Village Affairs, TEK, the ABT and
Directorates of the Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Livestock, would be
submitted to the coordinating agency in Ankara. Annual audit would be by
personnel of the Ministry of Finance, a procedure accepted in previous
projects and found satisfactory. Assurances were obtained that separate
project accounts would be kept by each agency, audited annually and would
be submitted to the Bank within five months of the end of the Turkish fiscal
year.
1/   Under a separate loan to TEK, currently being processed in the Bank and
scheduled for board presentation in June 1975, a nationwide study of
the cost of rural electrification and the tariffs needed to support
these costs is proposed.



- 25 -
VI. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
A. Production
6.01      More than 80,000 farms would be affected by the project and signi-
ficant production increases are expected particularly for wheat, barley and
perennial and annual forage. Additional land would be made available for
cropping in the rainfed areas by a reduction in the fallow area from 46% of
the cultivated area to about 6%. This additional area would allow expansion
in production of crops for livestock feed as well as for wheat and barley.
Five farm models have been used to demonstrate the project effects on differ-
ent categories of farms. Four of the models (three for dryland farms and one
irrigated) have a size of 10 hectares, the mean for the two provinces, and a
fifth model is for a 5 hectare dryland farm. All dryland farms have livestock
and Model 1 represents farms adopting intensive crossbreeding to introduce
Montofon blood into local herds. The irrigated model assumes no livestock
production but illustrates a change from entirely dryland cropping to entirely
irrigated cropping (Annex 12). Following is a summary of estimated production
increases with the project (Annex 12, Table 8):

B. Markets
6.02      Corum and Cankiri already sell more than half of. their production
of wheat for use outside the area. In 1971, wheat production was a record
in Turkey but, in 1973, production was virtually the same as in 1963. Yield
data since 1963 show large fluctuations from year to year but no trends to-
ward increasing total production. Even though increased yields, because of
the project, more than double wheat production in the two provinces, there
should be no problem in marketing the grain through current channels outside
the provinces. Barley is largely used for animal feed and demand should in-
crease both in the project area and in the rest of Turkey. The important
irrigated crops of sugar beets and rice present no marketing problems.



- 26 -
Much of the rice is used by the producers and market demand is steady, while
sugar beet production is controlled entirely by the Sugar Company (Annex 6).
6.03     ]Market prospects for meat are good; retail prices have risen, even
during 1968 to 1972, when production rose steadily. Because of this trend,
it is likely that meat production increases will be absorbed domestically.
The projected increase in milk production of 3.9% per year can be taken care
of within the capacity of the present system. Mohair prices have increased
along with a decline in production since the middle 1960s; projected moderate
production increases can be readily absorbed by the market although prices
may decline somewhat. Wool production in 1973 was 1,265 tons and prices
(farmgate) reached record levels in 1974. A large proportion of the wool
is processed and used by producing families for domestic use (Annex 6,
Tables 2, 3 and 5).
C. Prices
6.04      Prices for inputs.and outputs of the project are based on current
local and farmgate prices collected from various sources in the field. These
financial prices are adjusted for the economic analysis, based on projections
in real terms provided by the Bank's Economic Analysis and Projections Depart-
ment and, where applicable, making allowances for known subsidies and taxes
(Annex 13, Table 2).
D. Farm Income
6.05      At full development under the project the annual net income of a
farmer with an average 10 hectares cultivated, with improved livestock and
dryland crop production, would have increased by 55% over the without-project
level to reach about LT 21,000 (US$1,500), while for a similar farm with 5
hectares cultivated the annual net income would increase by a similar percent-
age to reach about LT 10,500 (US$750). In a new irrigated area a farm of 10
hectares would produce an annual net income at full development of about
LT 92,000 (US$6,570), and a similar farm with 5 hectares would-have an income
of about LT 46,000 (US$3,290). Illustrative budgets for model farms are con-
tained in Annex 12, Tables 2-7.
E. Benefits and Beneficiaries
6.06      Aggregate Economic Return.  Economic benefits of the project would
arise from an expansion of cropped area on to land previously fallowed, in-
creases in yields of wheat and barley, higher productivity of livestock through
improved breeding and feeding, and the introduction of an area of irrigation.
The economic rate of return for the whole project is estimated to be 18%,



- 27 -
based on the benefits mentioned above, a 35-year project life, and a conserva-
tive phasing of the economic benefits (Annex 13). Additional benefits, not
quantified, would arise from the roads, domestic water supply, rural elec-
tricity supply and village community centers constructed under the project.
Labor required to implement project works and services is estimated to be
1.55 million mandays from skilled workers and 1.49 million mandays from un-
skilled workers during the first five years. It is estimated that additional
employment on farms could total 2.57 million mandays per annum by the eighth
year of development (Annex 14). The economic rate of return for the project
excluding social infrastructure is estimated at 23%, and for separate compo-
nents, rates of return are 11% for irrigation, 14% for livestock and 27% for
dry farming (Annex 13).
6.07      Sensitivity analysis indicates that if the benefit stream were 10%
and 20% lower than projected, the rate of return would fall to 13% and 9%
respectively. Increases in the cost stream of 10% and 20% would lower the
rate of return to 14% and 11% respectively.
6.08      Beneficiaries.  The main beneficiaries of the project would be the
approximately 79,000 families on dryland farms (about 400,000 persons) whose
contacts with the extension service and use of improved methods would raise
their farm incomes by an estimated 70%, from an average of about US$980 to
US$1,670 (about US$335 per capita). Incomes of about 1,250 farm families
in the various irrigation schemes would rise by an estimated 240% over levels
attainable without irrigation. Additional employment generated on farms would
be highly seasonal. It is estimated that 45% of additional employment would
be from hired labor, most of which would be drawn from landless families.
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
7.01      The project is technically feasible, economically sound and finan-
cially viable. Agreement having been reached on the principal issues referred
to in Chapters 4 and 5, and subject to the conditions of effectiveness des-
cribed in paras 4.04 and 5.02, the project is suitable for a Bank loan of
US$75 million for a term of 25 years with a 6-year grace period. The borrower
would be the Government of Turkey.

CORUM-CANKIRI RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
TURKEY
Agricultural Credit
Background
1.        Strict control over the entire structure of interest rates has been
an important feature of Turkey's monetary policy for many years. In general,
ceilings on interest rates have been set well below market rates, in the be-
lief that it would stimulate production, enhance international competitive-
ness, and contain inflationary pressures. The allocation of credits towards
sectors whose development the Government wished to encourage has been influ-
enced not by variation of interest rates, but through a rather complex system
of differential interest rates, subsidies and institutional barriers to the
movement of funds. For example, with this mechanism, about 18 percent of in-
creases in outstanding credits were allocated to agriculture in the last 10-
year period, compared to about 45 percent to industry and mining, reflecting
the Government's emphasis on industrialization in its development strategy
for the country. This system, which follows the policy of specifying lower
ceilings on interest rates for priority sectors for development, discourages
private commercial bank credits to these sectors. Consequently, such sectors
are served by specialized inst-itutions, e.g. ABT in the field of agriculture,
which have privileged access to sources of funds such as advances and redis-
counts, government subsidies, official deposits, and those of social security
premiums. By controlling allocations in this manner, the role of interest
rates in allocating credits has been reduced.
2.        In the absence of detailed studies of non-institutional sources
of credit for agriculture, discussion of the subject inevitably focuses
on the Agricultural Bank of Turkey (ABT), which dominates institutional
lending with its provision to agriculture of more than 95% of the funds
flowing to the sector from institutions. 1/ It is also the largest of the
country's multitude of banks, holding about 25% of all bank deposits.
3.        Established in 1863, the ABT had, by 1971, a total of LT 11,546
million in credit outstanding to agriculture, of which LT 9,611 million
(83%) was short-term credit, generally for less than one year. It is ad-
ministered as a profit-making institution, reporting to the Ministry of
Commerce, and it receives a prescribed fraction of government receipts from
the land tax and other sources. The ABT has a network of about 850 branches
1/   Other institutions lending to agriculture include the Tobacco Growers'
Bank, Cotton Bank, Sugar Bank and Vine Growers' Bank.



ANNEX 2
Page 2
throughout the country, and about 60% of its short-term lending to agricul-
ture flows through some 2,700 credit and sales cooperatives, whose activi-
ties are controlled and supervised by the ABT. In an effort to extend
medium- and long-term lending, a supervised credit scheme was set up in
1964 in which the ABT provides planning and budgeting services to certain
farmers receiving development credit from the bank. This has necessitated
an increase in professional staff specializing in agronomy, animal husbandry
and related technical subjects. It is clear, however, that the ABT will not
be able to provide sufficient staff to prepare the farm plans for all the
development loans desired, and it is envisaged that the requisite technical
input will come from extension service personnel in the Corum-Cankiri proj-
ect area.
4.        In September of 1974, the ABT increased its interest rates for all
agricultural loans to 10.5% from the 9.0% which had been previously obtained
(Table 1). In addition, borrowers pay a commission charge of 0.5%, which
makes the total effective rate 11.0%. This rate is generally in line with
otlher interest rates in the country (Table 4).
The Corum-Cankiri Region
5.        As for the country as a whole, institutional lending to agricul-
ture in Cankiri and Corum is totally dominated by the Agricultural Bank of
Turkey. The Sugar Bank has a branch in Cankiri.
6.        In 1973, there were 19 branches of the ABT in the two provinces,
and 65 agricultural credit cooperatives with a total membership of just over
66,000 farmers, or 74% of those cultivating land (Table 2). Loans outstand-
ing at the end of 1973 totalled a little more than LT 206 million, of which
LT 112 million was handled directly by the ABT and LT 94 million through
the credit cooperatives. During the period 1970 to 1974, total lending
rose by almost 112%, but little changed in the distribution of loans from
the ABT itself, with about 23,000 short-term loans and 6,000 longer term
loans handled both in 1970 and 1974. Almost three-quarters of farmers were
members of cooperatives. The average size of short-term ABT loans almost
doubled during the period, while that of medium and long-term loans more
than tripled, reflecting the increased attention paid to supervised credit
beginning in 1970 in Cankiri and in 1972 for Corum. Overdue loans remained
at a relatively constant absolute level during the period, but the propor-
tion of value of total credits which were overdue fell significantly from
almost 45% in 1970 to less than 20% in 1974. To handle the more than doubled
lending, the numbers of staff were increased by only 22%, and this included
5 agronomists by 1974, hired in connection with the supervised credit schemes.
As already mentioned, the rate of interest on all agricultural loans was
raised from 9.0% to 10.5% in 1974 (effective rate, including commission,
11 .0%).



ANNEX 2

Incremental Credit Needs
7.        The project plan envisages significant increases in expenditure
on farm inputs, including improved mechanized cultivation, seeds, fertilizer
and herbicides. In addition there would be a large investment in tractors
and implements, as well as expenditures on improved buildings for housing
livestock. The ABT would need to expand its short-term and medium-term
lending in order to finance a proportion of these increased farm costs.
Estimates of the incremental credit required are described in the follow-
ing paragraphs.
8.        Short-Term Credit.  The cash flow analysis used as a basis for
estimating increased short-term credit (one year or less) is outlined in
Table 3. The table incorporates interest and principal repayments on
medium-term borrowings from the ABT whose levels were estimated a priori
as described below. It is assumed that the cash costs for which credit is
required are those for cultivation, seeds, fertilizers and agricultural
chemicals. 1/ In year zero, the "without-project" situation, the known
current level of short-term lending from the ABT and cooperatives (Table 2)
is subtracted from the estimated cost of the four inputs and the balance is
assumed to be financed by a carryover of farmers' own funds from the prev-
ious year. Specifically, the cash requirement of approximately LT 733 mil-
lion is met by LT 134 million borrowed from the ABT and cooperatives, and
LT 599 million from other sources. Deducting all cash costs (including
short-term credit repayment and interest on this at 11.0%) from the gross
value of production gives a balance of LT 1,413 million, which is viewed
as the return to the farm household, to include a reward for its own labor
(or cash payments for labor as required), and to cover household expenses
and any other costs not included in the analysis. It is assumed that once
project development has commenced, farmers will be willing to keep this
residual at the current level for 3 years but that thereafter they will
want to increase it as quickly as possible. This requires increasing for
several years the cash balance carried over to meet part of the cash costs
of the four expense items mentioned already. The estimates envisage a
levelling off in the aggregate level of short-term borrowing at LT 443 mil-
lion after year 6, and a levelling off in the required carryover of cash at
LT 1,037 million after year 7. The residual "household return" rises rea-
sonably quickly to just over LT 2,200 million in year 7, and thereafter
1/   Labor costs are, therefore, either met from the farmers' own resources,
or are assumed to be a non-cash item (farmers' own labor). The ABT
disburses seeds and fertilizers in kind in specified amounts per unit
area, and provides a further specified cash sum to cover chemicals and
other costs. The specifications vary from crop to crop, so that the
proportion of crop expenses which a farmer can expect to meet out of
ABT credit will depend on both the crop involved and the total level of
expenditure the farmer plans (in relation to fixed ABT specifications).
In practice a borrower may meet from 25% to 50% of crop expenses from
sources other than ABT credit.

more slowly to about LT 2,450 million. Thus it is estimated that the
revolving fund required for short-term credit would rise from LT 134 mil-
lion currently to LT 443 million, an increase of LT 309 million over a
period of four years. If 70% of this is included in the Bank credit,
this would leave LT 93 million in additional funds to be raised domes-
tically by the ABT. This would be an increase of 64% in their short-term
credit funding in the two provinces, compared with an increase of 84% during
the period 1970 to 1974, when short-term credits increased from LT 81 mil-
lion to LT 149 million (Table 2). Total incremental short-term credit needs
(70% to be financed by the Bank) are estimated to be US$3 million in year 1,
US$7 million in year 2, US$10 million in year 3, and US$2 million in year 4.
9.        Medium-Term Credit.  Based on past policies of the ABT, it has
been assumed that farmers would be required to meet 20% of the cost of in-
vestment in buildings, and 25% of the investment in tractors and implements.
Because of the phasing of these outlays, and repayment of loans, however,
the additional medium-term credit fund required by the ABT would not reach
the level implied by applying these percentages to the total investment
cost. It has been assumed that repayments of medium-term loans would be
spread evenly over five years, and that interest at 11.0% would be levied
on outstanding balances. Because aggregate investment in machinery would
be spread over 6 years, the ABT could "recycle" its credit fund as repay-
ments commenced. It is estimated that a minimum additional fund of LT 306
million would be required to support investment in machinery and buildings.
If 70% of this additional fund is included in the Bank credit, the ABT would
need to raise an additional L% 92 million from domestic sources over a four
year period for medium-term credit. During the period from 1970 to 1974,
the ABT expanded its medium-term lending in the two provinces by LT 50 million,
from LT 25 million to LT 75 million (Table 2). Total incremental medium-term
credit needs (70% to be financed by the Bank) are estimated to be US$4 million
in year 1, US$6 million in year 2, US$8 million in year 3, and US$3 million
in year 4.
10.       Credit Expansion.  Although a significant expansion of lending
volume is envisaged under the project, from about LT 223 million (US$16 mil-
lion) to about LT 838 million (US$60 million), the expansion in numbers of
loans processed would be much less than suggested by the volume. It has
been a policy of the ABT to spread its lending as widely as possible among
farmers, and it is likely that at least 50,000 farmers are already reached
by credit, considering the 23,000 loans outstanding from ABT, and more than
66,000 members of credit cooperatives in 1973.  It is envisaged that loans
for farm machinery (which would take up more than 85% of incremental medium-
term credit) would flow to between 3,000 and 4,000 individuals.

/1   Base rates are those subsequent to the revision of September 1974,
while rates obtaining prior to the revision are given in parentheses.
2   Tax is figured at 25% of the base rate, but credits for agriculture
are exempted.
a   For supervised credit for agro-industries, 6% is rebated by the Central
Bank with the proviso that all plans must be followed. The base rate
then becomes 8%, the tax 2% and the total rate 10%. At least 50% of
agro-industrial credits qualify for the rebate.
ur A ision cha  te of 05%i is made on all loans Outstanding to
agricu uare so tnt the total rate is effectively 11.0% on such loans.

documents to the banks and receipt of payments by the banks; and (b) for the preparation
and manufacturing phases of export goods.
/3 Credits made for export-oriented projects are exempt from the 25% Banking Transactions
tax provided a special encouragement certificate is obtained. Credits of any maturity and
from any source of financine are eligible.  Since the exemption also applies to the interest
paid on Central Bank rediscounts, the bank is expected to charge a lower interest rate.

/5 For loans with maturity over 5 years, the interest rate is determined by the bank and
the borrower.
/6 Does not include credits extended for the preparation and manufacturing of exports

CORUM-CANKIRI RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
TURKEY
Marketing of Agricultural Products
Cereals
1.         The two provinces are already net exporters of wheat, and it is
estimated that in 1973 approximately 261,000 metric tons (61%) of the
426,000 tons of wheat produced were available for sale outside the prov-
inces (Table 1). The overwhelming majority of this is handled by private
merchants, with purchases of the Soil Products Office (TMO) accounting for
less than 1% of the uptake.
2.         During the past four years the TMO has consistently sold greater
quantities of wheat in the provinces than it purchased, reflecting an inflow
of soft wheats from other parts of Turkey partially offsetting the large out-
flows of hard wheats produced in the provinces.
3.         Production of wheat in Turkey reached a peak in 1971 with an out-
put of 13.25 million metric tons, or 336 kgs. per capita of population in
that year. There is a marked fluctuation in yields from year to year, how-
ever, and total wheat production in 1973 fell almost exactly to the level
formerly attained in 1963, a reduction of 33% over 1971 production. The
country may be regarded as approaching self-sufficiency in wheat in years
of favorable crop harvests, but needing imports when the weather becomes
adverse. In 1970, approximately 886,000 tons of wheat were imported. By
1972, imports had fallen to 81,000 tons, and in 1973, to approximately
9,600 tons of soft wheat. During 1974, however, wheat imports again rose
sharply, to over 500,000 tons by June and about 1,000,000 tons for the full
year. A further 500,000 tons were to be imported in the first half of 1975.
Projections by the SPO suggest little change in the intermediate term in the
insignificant cereal export level. Additional production in Cankiri and
Corum (estimated to be 453,000 additional tons attributable to the project)
is likely to be consumed within the country, but it is not impossible that
Turkey could become a marginal exporter of cereals at some time in the future.
4.         In the provinces, merchants purchase either directly from farmers
or from market floors to which farmers have brought their grain. The Tmo
has one buying station in Cankiri and four in Corum province at whiich farmers
or merchants may sell grain for a price announced each year prior to hiarvest.
Tmere are many flour miills in the provinces so it is likely that some of the
wlheat leaving the provinces is first processed.
5.        A high proportion of barley output is used for feedinga livestock,
wlhile the fraction which is marketed  moves from grain floors to breweries or
other destinations outside the provinces. It is envisaged in the project
plan that Tmost incremental barley production will be used to support expan-
sion of livestock output, and that additional quantities sold will be readily



ANNEX 6
Page 2
absorbed locally or in neighboring provinces.  The TMO has, on occasion,
purchased small quantities of barley from Cankiri and Corum.
6.        Prices for wheat and barley rose steadily from 1967 through 1972
(Table 4) and experienced a very marked surge during 1973 and 1974, parallel-
ing similar movements in world cereal markets. Currently, farmers are re-
ceiving from LT 2.50 to LT 2.85 per kg for wheat, and from LT 1.70 to LT 2.10
per kg for barley. In the gross margin calculations, prices adopted for the
two crops are LT 2.50 and LT 2.00 per kg, respectively, equivalent to US$178
and US$143 per metric ton.  For the economic analysis, prices adopted are
US$114 per ton for wheat, and US$93 per ton for barley (Annex 13, Table 2).
Meat
7.        Livestock are slaughtered in small village establishments or in
municipal ,laughterhouses. There are 10 of the latter in Cankiri and 9 in
Corum. In addition, live animals move directly to establishments of the
Meat and Fish Organization (EBK) in Ankara, Kayseri and Istanbul, or in-
directly to these establishments by way of fattening facilities such as
that operated by the sugar factory at Amasya, where cattle are "finished"
on beet pu:Lp and concentrates for a period of several months. Animal
slaughterinigs typically reach a peak in the July-September period (as
farmers dispose of livestock prior to the winter) and a trough in the
December-Jcnuary period. This marked fluctuation results in unused ca-
pacity of slaughterhouses and cool stores in offpeak seasons. The EBK
sets out tco obtain a certain quantity of meat throughout Turkey (currently
about 10% of national production) and fixes its.prices to ensure that its
supply will be forthcoming. The organization is currently constructing a
slaughterhouse in Amasya (86 km. from Corum town) with a capacity for 10,800
tons of meat per annum. Achieved throughput will probably be about 5,500
toIIs because of slaughtering peaks. A government decree of September 1,
1974 authorized the setting of incentive prices for various regions and
this policy could play a role in facilitating production in the future.
8.        Market prospects for meat in Turkey are strong.  In spite of
quite rapid growth rates of meat production during the second five year
plan period (1968-1972), average retail prices have continued a steady in-
crease which has taken place from at least 1963 to 1974 (see Table 5 for
retail beef and mutton prices in the Istanbul and Ankara markets from 1963
to 1974), raising the levels to LT 22.25 per kg for beef and LT 24.25 per
kg. for mutton in the Ankara retail market for 1974. Interestingly, though,
these retail prices dipped slightly in 1973, a movement believed to reflect
an increase in livestock slaughterings on account of drought conditions in
that year. Slatughtering statistics are incomplete in Turkey, the only data
officially compiled being those for municipal slaughterhouses, which may
account for as little as one sixth of the total in any one year. Estimates
by FAO suggest that mutton production rose from 98,000 tons in 1968 to
214,000 tons in 1970, followed by a levelling off to about 197,000 tons
by 1972. Beef output followed a similar trend, rising from 101,000 tons
in 1968 to 200,000 tons in 1970, and levelling off to 190,000 tons by 1972.



ANNEX 6
Page 3
9.        It is likely that there is a high income elasticity of demand for
meat in Turkey, so that most production increases will be absorbed domes-
tically as incomes rise. The SPO projects a decline during the third plan
period in the already small level of exports of livestock products. Turkey's
close proximity to the Middle East and Europe, and its associate membership
in the EEC augur well for the country's medium term prospects as a meat ex-
porter, should surplus for export develop, although disease regulations may
somewhat inhibit prospects in Europe.
10.       It is estimated that present production of meat in the two prov-
inces may have reached about 15,000 tons in 1973, and that the project will
increase meat output by approximately 10,000 tons over a 10-year period, an
annual growth rate of 5.2%.
11.       Prices adopted for meat are LT 11 per kg and LT 9 per kg (live
weight) for meat from young and cull cattle, and LT 12 and LT 10 per kg
respectively for young and cull sheep.
Milk
12.       Similar remarks apply to dairy products as to meat, with respect
to relatively high income elasticity of demand, and strong market prospects.
Again, as for meat, estimates of milk production in Turkey are made using
standard coefficients derived from past surveys. These show that during
the second plan period the growth in milk output has averaged close to
that for meat, namely about 4% per annum.
13.       In the provinces milk is obtained from dairy cows, dairy buffaloes,
sheep and goats, and there is a great deal of home processing into butter,
yogurt and cheeses of various types. It is likely that the major propor-
tion of output is home consumed, and some degree of livestock ownership
appears to be almost universal among village families, even those who are
landless but yet have access to common grazing areas.
14.       The Milk Organization (TSEK), as part of a significant planned
expansion of activities throughout the country, has constructed a modern
processing plant in Cankiri town, and is in the process of erecting one in
Corum. To date the Cankiri factory has acquired only cows' and sheep's
milk, for processing into cheese and butter. The capacity exists for pro-
duction of pasteurized milk and ayran (a kind of yogurt) in the future.
The target throughput during the first year of operation is about 25% of
the estimated capacity of 25 tons in an eight-hour shift. The TSEK expe-
riences difficulties with its pricing policies, since it is required to
sell its products at standard prices fixed by government. Workir-, back-
wards from these, the organization calculates what it can offer to farmers
for milk, but in many cases these offer prices are easily overtopped by
small-scale private merchants who face weakly-administered controls on
their owfn prices by municipalities.  The TSEK has tried other methods of
providing incentives to farmer suppliers, such as offering credit for
feedstuffs at zero interest raLes in return for a contract to supply all
milk to TSEIZ. Such efforts seem doomed to be inadequate, however, as pri-
vate merchants reportedly find little difficulty in offering prices more



ANNEX 6
Page 4
than 12% above those of TSEK, thus nullifying the credit incentive. TSEK
studies :Ln process on the cost of processing milk may lead to changes in
governmenit price policies. To date in Cankiri, TSEK buying prices have
been LT 2/kg for cow's milk (3%-4% fat) and LT 3.25/kg for sheep's milk
(6%-9% fat) with the usual variations for cleanliness etc. In the medium
term future, processing capacity is likely to be adequate for the milkshed
areas surrounding Cankiri and Corum towns (a radius of about 100 km. in each
case), although further work is needed on such other elements of the collec-
tion system as village cooling tanks and development of milk cooperatives.
15.       It is estimated that total milk production in the two provinces
reached a peak of just over 102,000 tons in 1972, and that the project may
increase output by 47,000 tons over a ten-year period, or 3.9% per year.
Wool and Mohair
16.       The Angora goats of the Anatolian Plateau have for centuries
brought the region renown for mohair production but output estimates for
Cankiri and Corum exhibit a steady decline since the middle 1960's, and
mohair prices have steadily increased during the same period. It is esti-
mated that production was about 440 tons from the two provinces during 1973,
and villagers reported a 1974 farmgate price of from LT 40 to LT 70 per kg,
representing a sharp increase over the officially reported level in 1972 of
around LT 24 per kg in Corum. Mohair Sales Cooperatives established in the
provinces with Government support in 1969 are authorized to purchase from
producers., and it is reported that in 1970 they acquired about 25% of the
total production. As prices offered by other dealers have increased sub-
sequently., and overtaken those of the cooperatives, purchases by the latter
hiave fallen off. It is likely that moderate increases in production can be
readily absorbed by the market, probably accompanied by some fall in prices.
The project could increase mohair output by 61 tons over a 10 year period.
17.       Estimated output of wool has fluctuated, but the production for
1973, of 1,265 tons, was somewhat higher than levels attained in the early
1960's.  Farmgate prices in 1974 were reported to be between LT 26 and LT
30 per kg, again considerably above the officially reported averages for
1972 (LT 19-LT 20 per kg) which in turn were the highest reached for many
years. A considerable proportion of the wool produced is used by producing
families, being home processed and made into garments and furnishings. It
is not known how much wool is exported from the provinces, but some wool
is collected from villages by buying agents for larger dealers both inside
and outside the project area. It is envisaged that the project will increase
wool production by about 335 tons over 10 years, an average annual rate of
increase of 2.3%.

CORUM-CANKIRI RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
TURKEY
The Extension Service
A. Organization
1.        To achieve the projected production targets of the project, an
intensive extension effort would be necessary. A project extension service
would be established to deal solely with extension work in the project area.
It would mainly be responsible for the efficient training and advising of
farmers, while the existing extension service would deal only with regulatory
work. All extension personnel in the project area would report to the
Director General of Agricultural Affairs in the Ministry of Food, Agriculture
and Livestock, who would coordinate their work.
2.       'The project extension service would be headed by a Director and
assisted by two Deputy Directors, each in charge of extension on one province.
Each provincial country would have a head of extension who would report to
the Deputy Director of his respective province. The actual field work would
be largely carried out by village agents (VA) under the supervision of the
country extension agents and their assistants.
3.        Each ptovince would have a staff of subject matter specialist (SMS),
assigned as needed, with the priim1ary function of providing the country exten-
sion persoinel with the necessary iiformation and training.  The latter in
turn would train the VA.  Intensive in-service training would be provided all
extension personnel by staff of the project extension service and of the
national training institute of the General Directorate of Agricultural Affairs
in Ankara. Consultants would be internationally recruited to assist in train-
ing personnel and in administration.
4.        Nine county extension offices would be established in Corum Province
and ten in Cankiri (Table 1). Each county office would be headed by a county
extension agent wlo would be responsible for all extension activities in the
county. Where the size of the county justifies it, the county agent would
be assistecd by one or more assistant county agents.
5.        The extension fiel t '.ork would be carried out mainly by VA, who
would be recruited from among !'Te best farmers in the area, receive intensive
in-service training, and be supported and supervised by the county agents and
their assistants. The VA would live in one of the villages in their assigned
group.



ANNEX 7
Page 2
6.        To coordinate the project extension work, a coordination committee
consisting of representatives of all agencies working in the project would
be established in each province under the chairmanship of the Provincial
Governor (Vali). The secretary of each committee would be the director of
the project extension service.
B. Extension Work Methods
7.        Most of the working time of the VA, the county agents, their assist-
ants, and the SMSs would be spent in the villages. The VA would concentrate
their efforts on both individual and small group instruction supported by the
use of visual aids, distribution of leaflets, etc.
8.        Each VA would serve about 500 farmers, living in not more than 5-6
villages. Where the number of villages exceeds this figure, the ratio of
farmers to a village agent would be reduced. Each would conduct a group
activity in each of the villages in his jurisdiction every two weeks, held
either in the center of the village or in one of the farmer's fields. All
farmers in the village would, be invited to this activity, which would consist
of lectures, discussions and demonstrations relating to agricultural activities
that would need to be performed in the coming fortnight.
9.        In addition, each VA would visit, on average, 20 farms a week.
Individual farmers should be visited at intervals of one month, if there is
any new activity to be performed by the respective farmers. If not, the visits
would take place less frequently--before a new activity is scheduled--and
meanwhile the circle of farmers visited would be increased.
10.       It is planned that every VA would pay individual visits--during
each season--to about 100-120 farmers out of 500. These visits--with the
support of the group activities should bring a rapid diffusion of information
and the adoption of new practices by most of the farmers.
11.       In each of the villages an agricultural committee composed of 3-6
farmers would be established. The committee would keep continuous contact
with the VA, advise him on the names of the farmers to be selected for inten-
sive extension work, and also help in organizing the group activities. They
would also assist supervision of the farming activities in the village.
12.       Every VA would also select 4-5 farmers to follow all packages of
recommended practices in each of the villages. The fields of these farmers
would serve as "demonstration fields"' and assist to demonstrate and dissemin-
ate the latest information.
13.       Every VA would deal with both field crops and animal husbandry.
During peak seasons for field crops (such as seed bed preparation, sowing or



ANNEX 7
Page 3
harvesting) the VA would devote most of their time to these activities, while
out of season (winter time) they would deal mainly with livestock.  In other
seasons, they would share their time between these two enterprises.
14.       Each county agent would be responsible for the work and training
of the VA in his county. The ratio would be an agent to about ten village
agents, while in the small counties the ratio would be lower.
15.       The county agents would support the village agents and visit each
of them conce in two weeks. It is expected that every county agent will
spend four days a week visiting the VA to supervise their work, help them
professicinally and technically, assist in their group activities and in carry-
ing out the demonstrations, field days, and other activities.
16.       In addition to the county agents and their assistants, special
animal husbandry SMS would assist in the counties. Each such extension agent
would pay regular visits to the VA and visit each of them once in about 4-8
weeks, in accordance with the number of farmers and intensity of the livestock
enterprises in the villages. This intensity of visits requires the ratio
of about 1 agent to 40 VA. It would be arranged so that each of the animal
husbandry extension agents would provide his services to the VA and farmers
in several counties, and his headquarters would be in one of these counties.
17.       One home economics extension agent would work in each of the coun-
ties. Each would select local leaders in the villages and would organize
her activities through them. The main extension method would be "small group
activities" and there would be almost no individual instruction in this
Eield. Local leaders would assist in these activities and take, in time, a
leading role on a voluntary basis.
18.       In each of the two provinces, some SMS would be appointed.  They
would be responsible for the technical development of field crops, horticul-
ture and animal husbandry on the basis of research findings and ozher sources
of information. They would formulate the technical recommendations for the
farmers, support the extension agents, and be responsible for the training
of all the extension personnel. The SMS would visit each of the county agents
once a month.
19.       The project extension service would be headed by a director who
would be responsible for the entire operation of extension in the project
area. He would be assisted by two deputies, each of whom would serve as a
director of a province extension service. Since the work of the director and
his two deputies would involve organization and supervision of a large number
of skilled personnel, administrative competence is required in addition to
professional qualifications and extension experience.
20.       Three expatriate consultants would assist the project extension
service throughout the development stage of five years.  One of these would
act as counterpart of the project extension service director and the other



ANNEX 7
Page 4
two as counterparts of the deputies in the two provinces. Terms of reference
for these consultants are in Annex 11. In addition to these three, short-
term consultants would be employed as need arises.
C. In-Service Training
21.       The success of the extension activities depends on the participants
keeping abreast of the latest developments in their respective fields, thus
very intensive in-service training would be provided. This training would be
composed of two types:  (a) courses of varying lengths--from 3 to 30 days,
and (b) study days. For training purposes, the extension personnel would be
divided into two main groups: (a) extension agents and SMS, and (b) VA.
22.       There would be about 14 SMS, 37 extension agents and 19 home econo-
mics agents in the entire project area. The largest groups of agents would
deal with field crops--17 in Corum and 13 in Cankiri. Seven agents would
deal with livestock and 19 with home economics. Training would be provided
to these three groups separately, except for general matters of interest to
all. All agents would get two days training monthly in their respective spe-
cializations. Field crops and home economics agents would get monthly train-
ing, each in his respective province, while the livestock agents of the two
provinces would have monthly joint sessions. The directors and the training
unit in each of the provinces would be responsible for this training.
23.       Once a year, all agents and SMS would be brought together for an
intensive seminar and workshop of 2-3 weeks. General matters such as project
orientation, extension methods, management, economics, etc. would be taught
to all, while the group would be separated into specialized sections for
professional subjects. The director of the project extension service, with
the help of the two training units, would be responsible for these courses.
24.       Close contacts would be maintained with scientists at the research
stations and at the universities and with the specialists of the relevant
"'special projects", e.g. the wheat project. These experts would be asked to
serve as lecturers and help in maintaining both the courses and the refresher
study days.
25.       The aim of the training program for the VA is to provide the
knowledge, tools and motivation that would enable them to contribute to the
increase in yields and income of the farmers. This would be done by teaching
them up-to-date, practically-oriented, subject matter and technology of the
agricultural enterprises prevailing in the area. All teaching would use the
participative method.
26.       All VA in each of the two provinces would attend an intensive course
and workshop once a year. Bringing together about 170 village agents in Corum



ANNEX 7
Page 5
or 100 in Cankiri may create logistical problems, but it is the best way
to ensure effective utilization of the experts and training personnel that
are available and can be brought to the project. They would have lectures
on the relevant crops and livestock, discuss problems they have encountered,
practice new farming methods, and learn and practice the most effective re-
levant extension techniques. The provincial extension Deputy Director would
be responsible for this training.
27.       All VA would have the opportunity constantly to update their activ-
ities and check themselves continuously. Once in a fortnight, all village
agents wou:Ld have a training session lasting a day. They would discuss the
technical problems that arose in the preceding months, they would listen to
lectures, participate in field visits, and be prepared to perform their duties
in the following fortnight.
28.       For the purpose of these studies the village agents would be grouped
into several study groups in each of the two provinces, as follows:
County                          No. of village agents
Corum
Sungurlu, Alaca Ortakoy                              46

Iskilip, Bayat                                       36
Osmancik, Kargi                                      33
Cankiri
Central, Yaprakli, Eldivan, Sabanozu, Orta           40
Ilgaz, Kursunlu                                      30
Cerkes, Ovacik, Eskipazar                            25
The Deputy Director in charge of each of the two provinces would nominate the
county agents to be resronsible for the training in each group, in rotation.
F. Transportation, Accommodation and Salaries
29.       A provincial office and an office in each of the counties would be
constructed. Local schools, public halls, etc. should be used for the train-
ing sessions. The directors, SMS and the extension agents would live in the
vicinity of their work. Most of them would rent housing and in some places
where it may be difficult to find a rented house, houses would be constructed.
31.       Each of the VA would live in one of the villages in his circle.
Most of thenm would live in their own houses, and for those transferred from
other villages would rent houses; there seems to be no difficulty in renting
proper living accommodation in the villages.



ANNEX 7
Page 6
32.       The VA would be hired on a temporary basis, under a  contract for
10-11 months a year. The contracts would be renewed with those who prove
themselves to be successful agents, while others would be replaced. This
arrangement would last for six years, after which arrangements should be
made with the project farmers to share the cost of employing the village
agents with the Department of Agriculture.
G. Phasing
33.       The extension project would start its operations in the villages
of a few counties in each of the two provinces. The number of counties will
increase so that by the end of the year all counties and villages would be
covered by the extension work. Phasing would be carried out as follows:
Year 1:   Central, Mecitozu counties in Corum Province, and
Central, Yaprakli, Eldivan, Sanaozu, Orta in Cankiri
Province.
Year 2:   Sungurlu, Alaca, Ortakoy in Corum and Ilgaz, Kursunlu
in Cankiri.
Year 3:   Iskilip, Bayat, Osmancik, Kargi in Corum and Cerkes,
Ovacik, Eskipazar in Cankiri.

city, with two main canals totalling 11 km in length. Area to be
irrigated: 1,350 ha.
(b) Kumbaba - 4 pumps to lift water about 40 meters from the Kizilirmak
River to a gravity canal system extending 9 km in one direction and
6 km in the other direction from the point of offtake. Area to be
irrigated: 500 ha.
(c) Kalfat - 33 meter high earthfill dam on Kalfat River, about 10 km
north of Orta town. Area to be irrigated: 1,900 ha.
(d) Guldurcek - 42 meter high earthfill dam on Kizilirmak River, about
12 km southwest of Orta towqn. Area to be irrigated: 2,300 ha.
(e)  Alaca - 32 meter high earthfill dam on Soguyozy River, about 8 km
south of Alaca town. Area to be irrigated: 1,400 ha.
2.        TOPRAKSU Works
(a)  30 small dams (under 15 meters high), of which 13 would be for
irrigation of a total of 5,000 ha (9 dams in Corum, 4 in Cankiri),
and 17 would be for supply of livestock drinking water (5 dams in
Corum, 12 in Cankiri). Feasibility studies and final designs have
been completed for 15 of these dams.
(b) Secondary irrigation delivery systems and on farm works for DSI
irrigation schemes, covering 7,500 ha. Works include a deep drain-
age network on 50% of the area, levelling, surface drainage and
access roads.
(c) Secondary irrigation delivery systems for TOPRAKSU irrigation
schemes, covering 5,000 ha.
3.        Infrastructure
The project would provide adequate access roads and water supply
to selected villages amongst 270 listed hereunder. Electricity reticulation
would also be provided to 233 settlements covering all of the 270 villages
which have been selected by local agricultural, veterinary and administrative
staff for their "unusually high physical and social potential for develop-
tfent".

The infrastructure plan for these villages includes the following
elements in the project:
(a)  YSE Roads - construction of 65 km of new roads (48 km in Corum,
117 in Cankiri) associated with about 35 villages.
- rehabilitation of 164 km of existing roads (142 km
in Corum, 22 in Cankiri).
- maintenance of 904 km of new and existing roads.
(b) YSE Water Supply - construction and maintenance of 177 units in
the 120 villages (among the 270) whose supplies are currently
inadequate on grounds of either quantity or quality (82 villages
irn Corum, 38 in Cankiri). All water systems would be gravity fed
by pipelines from source to villages. Sources would be springs
for 157 units, and wells for 20 units.
(c) TEK Electricity Supply - electrical service to 233 settlement areas
(164 in Corum, 69 in Cankiri) covering all of the 270 villages.
The service would be designed to be capable of supplying electri-
city for both domestic and industrial purposes, and would involve
erection of about 760 km of 30 kv or smaller transmission line in
Corum and 350 km in Cankiri included are about 13,000 KVA of dis-
tribution transform capacity.
(d) Village Centers - construction of community center, public bath
house and laundry in 63 villages each with a total area of about
300 m2, selected from among the 270 as natural centers for groups
of villages, in order to allow some sharing with surrounding
vi:Llages and a demonstration effect. Other criteria in village
selection included adequate infrastructural proposals (roads,
water supply, electricity), existence of a village development
cooperative, and designation by the SPO as a rural development
center. Construction will be concrete block with tile roofs.

Project Monitoring and Evaluation_Stud
A. Proect_Monitoring
1.        Monitoring would be carried out during the implementation phase
of the Project in order to identify those areas where progress is not up
to expectation so that corrective action may be undertaken in the shortest
possible time. In rural development projects it is particularly important
that the components leading to increased production be accurately recorded.
2.        This would necessitate the recording of data at the producer level.
The recording system followed must be simple and the amount of data collected
would be kept to the minimum deemed necessary for accomplishing the stated
objective. It is suggested that at least the following information should
be recorded: use by the Project participants of new innovations (recommended
improved practices, credit, etc.), the effect on crop and livestock produc-
tion, net income and family living conditions.
3.        Monitoring would be carried out by the Project Extension Service.
The basic data would be collected as a routine practice by the County Ex-
tension Agents and passed on to the Project Director of Extension where
the decision on any remedial action to be taken would be made.
4.        All data collected by the Extension Agents would become a part
of the permanent file and be made available to Bank supervision missions.
Also, summaries of such data would be included in the Project Progress
Reports sent to the Bank.
B. Terms of Reference for Project Base Study
5.        A team of local consultants and/or DPT would carry out a base study
of the effects of the project on the region in order to provide: (a) an
effective continuing evaluation of the project; and (b) a basis for use of
the experience of this project for repeater projects elsewhere in Turkey.
The team would report to the project execution authority and would have
access to data routinely collected by the Special Extension Service.
6.        The study would be carried out over the five-year project invest-
ment period by a multidisciplinary team comprising a Coordinator, an Assis-
tant Coordinator in charge of evaluation, and three Research Officers. A
baseline survey would be performed before and after project implementation



ANNI-EX 1 0

to collect data of sufficient accuracy for statistical analysis to be ap-
plied. In addition, inr-depth studies should be made, focused on incoine
distribution, migration and the household economy using botlh participant
observation and the survey method of research.  ITis shoiuld proviee 'con-
tinuous observation of, and qualitative information on the dynamics of
change in society.
7.         The Coordinator (General Economist) would lead the team.  He would
have overall responsibility for the coordination of the study and, with his
issistant, for the final report on the effect of the project on the tw-o prov-
inces as a whole, including multiplier effects of project co.nponeciits.  le
would oversee the execution and analysis of the baselinie surveys.
8.        An Agricultural Economist would assist the coordinator and be
responsible for a continuous evaluation of the project to be repor-ed on
a regular basis to the Director of Project Extension.
9.         Three Research Officers including Economist(s) and Anthrcpolo-ist('),
would carry out the following sub-studies in depth:
(a)  Social Stratification, Distribution of Income, Land and
Livestock.  An analysis of the stratification system in-
cluding the distribution of land and the land tenure sys-
tem, rent, sharecropping and sales practices, disputes over
land, non-economic functions of land; dist:ribuition of lIlve-
stock; the distribution of political power including the
roles of headman, inzam, elders.  The impact of the project
on the system and the effects of the system on the imple-
mentation of the project should be carefully considercd.
(b)  Migration and the Labor Market.  Patterns of migration would
be analyzed in the context of the labor market of the rc:-ions,
and of the household economy.  The impact on the labor r'al-kCt
as a whole would be assessed taking into account the signif-
icance of the family structure and the inheritance systemn.
(c) The Household Economy. A basic micro-economic study would
be made of household production and consumption.  The fnriner
should include sources of income, division of labor and nzigra-
tion.  Consumption should take into account i;ubsistence go,,ds,
prestige goods, education, health, etc.  The dynamics of clianges
in standard of living, expectations, demand and motivation should
be studied.

Consultants Terms of Reference
1.        The Project Extension Service would provide assistance to the
lam-ers by means of village agents, county agents and subject matter spe-
cialists.  The details of the Service and the means which would be used
to carry out its functions are found in Annex 7.  Consultants would be
retained to assist in management, in-service training and provide exper-
tise in subject matter specialties.
2.        Three consultants would be retained initially and would be em-
ployed throughout the development stage of the project and serve as ad-
visors to the Project Extension Director and each of the Deputy Directors
for each provincial service.  The Consultant who wouild act as advisor to
the Project Extension Director would be the most experienced of the three
and would have been involved in in-service training programs for extension
workers.  Each of these individuals would have at least ten years' experi-
ence in extension work, five of which should be in administrative positions.
In addition, these consultants would have professional training beyond the
bachelor's degree level in a subject matter field (preferably in crop science
or animal science) and would have worked in these specialized areas either
in extension or research.
3.        Additional part-time consultants would be hired as needed is the
project develops. The length of their terms of appointment and their spec-
iflic qualifications would depend on needs of the project.
4.        Bank agreement would be obtained prior to appointment of any con-
sultants and interviews by Bank staff of candidates would be arranged when
determined to be necessary.

Farm Models
1.        An estimated total of 80,245 fanms would be affected by the proj-
ect, and four farm models have been used to demonstrate project effects for
an average farm in each category. Model 1 represents 6,000 farms, Model 2
55,000, Model 3, 18,000 and Model 4, 1,245 farms. Each model is assumed to
be 10 ha in size, and the three dryland models (1, 2 and 3) are each assumed,
in addition, to have access to 7 ha of very low-productive common grazing
land, which provides a small proportion of livestock fodder requirements.
Physical assumptions underlying the models are presented in Table 1, fi-
nancial budgets in Tables 2-7, and estimated total project flows of outputs
and inputs in physical terms, in Table B.
2.        On the 79,000 dryland farms (Models 1, 2 and 3), a major effect
of the project would be a reduction in the area fallowed, from 46% of the
cultivated area to about 6%, with the additional area becoming available
for crops, and allowing an expansion of areas of wheat, barley and annual
and perennial forage (see Table 1). 1/ In addition, improvements in cereal
cropping technology would be introduced, including mechanized cultivation,
better seeds, a major expansion in fertilizer use, and application of herb-
icides. It is envisaged that,as a result of the project, average wheat
yields would increase from the current 1.3 metric tons to 2.2 metric tons
per ha, and barley yields from the current 1.4 metric tons to 1.8 metric
tons per ha (see Table 1). For any given farm, changes in the cropping
pattern and in the achievement of higher yields would be phased over 4 to
5 years from when the farm begins to be affected by the project, particularly
by the extension service. Improvement in livestock enterprises would be more
slow, and the farm models allow from 8 to 10 years for full achievement of
project benefits.
3.        Model 1 represents the farms on which intensive cross-breeding
using artificial insemination would introduce Montofon blood into local
cattle herds, with a concomitant increase in both milk and meat production.
Upgrading of productive potential of sheep and goats on these farms would
be achieved by rigorous selection and culling of breeding animals. The
improved feeding of livestock which is common to this model and to Model
2 is based on a seven-fold increase in the area sown to annual fodder crops
(mixtures of vetch and oats) and the introduction of good stands of sainfoin
as a perennial crop renewed once every four years. For each of the dryland
1/   In Models 1 and 2, additional wheat accounts for 29% of newly cropped
land, barley for 2%, annual forage for 34% and perennial forage for
35%.



ANNEX 12
Page 2
farm models, it is assumed that there are 2 breeding cows, 4 breeding ewes
(rising to 6 with the project) and 2 breeding does.
4.        In Model 2, the changes in cropping income would be the same as
those demonstrated in Model 1, but the increment from livestock would be
somewhat lower because of the absence of cross-breeding in cattle. Upgrad-
ing of cattle productivity would come instead from careful selection and
culling (as for sheep and goats) and from improved feeding based on annual
and perennial fodder crops as for the first model. The budget for Model 2A
(Table 4) illustrates similar changes for a farm with 5 ha of cultivated land.
Most figures are approximately half as large as corresponding figures for the
10 ha model, as labor has been fully costed and there are no other significant
scale effects.
5.        No improvement in livestock would be attempted on farms represented
by Model 3. Areas which would have been sown to fodder crops in the first
two models would be used instead to increase the areas of wheat and legumes.
6.        The area to be irrigated is represented by Model 4.  These farms
are assumed to have no livestock, but to change from entirely dryland crop-
ping to entirely irrigated cropping. The 'without project' cropping pattern
would be dominated by wheat, barley and legumes, with levels of output as
high as those induced by the project on other dryland farms. The 'with
project' situation is modelled using four irrigated crops: rice, sugar
beet, potatoes and beans. These are illustrative only, and it is possible
that some of the irrigated lands will eventually be planted in orchards or
other high-value crops.
7.        Budgets for the above farm models, displaying illustrative finan-
cial flows with the project, are presented in Tables 2-7. These have been
built up from detailed costings for individual crops, using financial prices
and costs given in Annex 13, Table 2.
8.        A major item in project investment is the expansion of machinery
required for improving cultivation on farms. It is envisaged that a ratio
of 1 tractor to 100 ha would be required for adequate cultivation. Based
on official data about numbers of tractors in the two provinces, 1/ it is
estimated that the project would require purchase of 3,500 additional trac-
tors and their supporting implements. Machinery investment is modelled by
adopting the following basic 'package' of tractors and implements:
1/   Data from the State Institute of Statistics record 4,400 tractors of
more than 25 H.P. in the two provinces in 1973, and the need for addi-
tional equipment is projected from an estimated base of just over
5,000 tractors in 1974.

109,500 (30% foreign com-
ponent)
9.        In the total regional analysis, investment in additional tractors
and supporting implements is phased over a period of 6 years. Farm IModel 2B
(Table 5) presents illustrative budgets for a farmer with 20 ha who invests
in the above machinery package, with the assistance of a five-year loan from
the ABT to cover 75% of purchase costs. These budgets assume the farmer per-
forms all cultivation required on his own farm as well as that on 8 other
farms (each of 10 ha) for which he charges contract rates as outlined in
Annex 13, Table 2.
10.       For the overall phasing, it is envisaged that 28,000 dryland
farms would enter the project program in the first year, 22,000 in the
second year and 29,000 in the third year. By Project Year 8, therefore,
fuill development of cropping components would he achieved, and by Project
Year 12 full development of livestock components.  Irrigated farms Would
begin entering their development phase in Project Year 2 and the last ,roUp
wouldc have begun development by Project Year 6.  Table 8 presents estL;ates
in physical terms of outputs and inputs in the project farms as the project
proceeds. The column headed 'Year 0' is the 'without project' siftuatton,
and incremental physical changes attributable to the project may be cal-
culated by subtracting quantities in the first column from those i.n the
remaining columns.  Increments to output are discussed further in .AnLrex 6,
which deals with product marketing.

/1  Because outputs have been rounded to the nearest 1,000 metric tors some production increases are concealed,  Data for
barley are for surplus production above that used for feeding livestock.
/2  All meat output is expressed in terms of live weight.  Carcass weight would be about 50%.
/3 Wool production is expected to rise from 711 tons in Year 0 to 1,047 tons in Year 12.
/4 Mohair production is expected to rise from 261 tons in Year 0 to 322 tons in Year 13.
/5 These totals include five kinds of chemical fertilizer. Single superphosphate usage rises from 33,000 tons to 163,000

Economic Rate of Return
1.         Economic rates of return fcr the project as a whole, and
for several of its components were calculated on the basis of data
displayed in Table 1. The following assumptions underly these
calculations:
(a) the shadow rate of exchange is equal to the official
rate of exchange, and the rate adopted is LT 14
US$1.00 ;
(b) the shadow wage for agricultural labor is equal to
the monetary wage, since most additional labor
would be demanded during the traditional harvest
period which is already a time of peak labor
demand;
(c) project costs include physical contingency
allowances as outlined in Annex 9 , Table 1
(d) prices for economic analysis (Table 2) are current farmgate
Drices adjusted on the basis of IBRD projections for 1980;
(e) as far as possible, transfer payments have been
eliminated fram the project; and
(f) no allowance is made for benefits of the social
infrastructural elements of rural electricity and
water supply, and village community centers.
2.         Based on these assumptions, the economic rates of return
are estimated to be as follows:-
(a)  Project as a whole                18%
(b)  Irrigation component              11%
(c) Dryland fanming ccmponent
(excluding road construction
and social infrastructure)    27%
(d)  Livestock component               14%
(e) Project without social.
infrastructure                 23%

Employment Effects
1.        It is estimated that during the five years over which project ex-
penditures would be made, approximately 1.55 million rnandays (7,000 man-years) 1/
of skilled labor, and 1.49 million mandays (6,700 man-years) of unskilled labor
would be required to implement project works and services. Of these totals,
the engineering works and construction would account for 87% of skilled labor
requirements and 74% of those for unskilled labor. The balance in these two
categories would be accounted for by expanded staff numbers in the Extension
and Veterinary service establishments. 2/  The phasing of incremental labor
needs over the five year period is displayed in Table 1.
2.        On farms, incremental labor requirements would be critically
affected by the extent to which the significant increase in wheat production
induced an expansion in the area harvested mechanically. Based on official
figures for numbers of combine harvesters in the two provinces, and making
additional assumptions about the numbers which may enter the area from ad-
joining provinces and their annual work capacities, about 25% of the wheat
area may be harvested mechanically at present. If 50% of the (expanded)
wheat area under the project is mechanically harvested, incremental farm
labor requirements could total 2.57 million mandays per annum by the eighth
year of development. About 67% of this labor would be required for harvesting
crops (including annual and perennial fodder for livestock), representing an
expansion of 45% in labor estimated to be needed for the harvest at present.
1/  It is assumed that the work year is 220 days.
2/   Village agents of the extension service have been arbitrarily classified
as "unskilled". Staff of the two service establishments would, of course,
continue beyond the five years of project investment.

Migration
1.        There is a marked pattern of seasonal migration within Turkey,
in which Cankiri and Corum provinces play a significant role as areas from
which workers move to find employment elsewhere. This seasonal pattern is
imprinted on top of two other migratory movements, namely the long term con-
centration of population within Turkey via permanent migration, and the
movement of workers to Europe for periods of two years or longer.
2.        The more permanent migration within Turkey is documented to some
degree by questions relating to birthplace in the quinquennial census. Based
on responses to these questions, the SPO has prepared maps dividing the coun-
try into net inflow and net outflow regions. For the 1955 census there were
26 net inflow regions, those with the greatest inflows being Istanbul, Izmir
and Ankara which contain the three largest urban agglomerations. By the
1965 census, the number of inflow regions had shrunk to 22, indicating a
continuing concentration of population. In both censuses, Corum and Cankiri
were net outflow regions, the cumulative totals of persons who were born in
Corum and Cankiri but had since moved elsewhere in Turkey being as follows: 1/
Corum     Cankiri      Total
1955      34,915      34,792      69,707
1965      54,021      73,116    127,137
3.        The increase between 1955 and 1965 gives some idea of the incre-
mental outflow during the decade, but it must be noted that deaths among
those included in the 1955 totals would lead to an understatement of the
decadal outflow. The population of the two provinces, as a proportion of
the national total, has steadily fallen, from 2.73% in 1940 to 2.19% in
1970.
4.        Against the background of this permanent outflow, there is the
temporary outflow which takes place each year as workers leave their vil-
lages to find seasonal employment in other provinces. Inquiries in villages
visited indicated that from 10% to more than 50% of village men sought out-
side work for from 3 to 6 months each year in a range of occupations which
included potato harvesting, tobacco planting, forestry, and the construction
industry. To find such work, migrants travelled, among other plhces, to
Ankara, Antakya, Zonguldak, Izmir, Istanbul, Mersin, Bolu, and Kastamonu,
as much as 800 km. away from their homes. The general movement described

ANNEX 15
Page 2
included a proportion of migrants returning to carry out essential agricul-
tural activities, especially at the cereal harvest time, and the return of
most migrants for the winter period. Informants in one village said that
the intensive external search for work had begun in the mid 1950s, stimu-
lated more by the "pull" effect of the opening up of new job opportunities
than by a particular crisis which pushed people out at that time.
5.        According to village inventory surveys carried out in 1966 and
1967, a total of just over 46,000 persons were then leaving the villages
for certain months of the year, and more than 90% of villages participated
in this outflow. 1/ The male population in the age group 15-64 years in
this same period totalled about 170,000, so that the annual outflow was
27% of what may be assumed to be the male working population. Applying
a similar proportion to 1974 population estimates would imply a total
current migration, on a seasonal basis, of about 55,000 persons.
