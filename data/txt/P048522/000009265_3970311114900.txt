THE REPUBLIC OF YEMEN
EMERGENCY FLOOD REHABILITATION PROJECT'
I. BACKGROUND AND STRATEGY
A. Background
1.1   In June and July of this year, heavy rainfall and widespread flooding caused substantial loss of
human lives and resulted in damages to livestock, crops, houses, irrigation infrastructure, flood control
works, roads, rural water supply and other infrastructure. The floods have been the worst in the country's
recent history; the rainfall has been the heaviest in about seventy years. It caused substantial damage and
dislocation in mainly three governorates: Hadramaut, Shabwa, and Marib. It affected, to a lesser extent,
Abyan, Al-Mahra and Al-Jawf Governorates. The total direct damage was very substantial, and estimates
by Bank missions, utilizing information provided by the General Secretariat for Natural Disasters and
Relief, put total damages at more than US$200 million (or 12 percent of GDP). About half of these
estimated damages directly affected the agriculture sector (including farms, irrigation and wadi structures,
and other related agricultural infrastructure) while the remaining damages were in rural infrastructure,
roads and bridges, in addition to housing, health and educational facilities. The main effects of the crisis
are as follows:
(a)    Economic Impact: The economic costs of the damage to rural infrastructure alone is
estimated at about US$200 million. This damage is very costly for a relatively weak
economy. Economic activity in the rural sector has suffered severely as a result of the
floods, and the outlook for 1996 and 1997 remains bleak, unless remedial measures are
intensified to overcome the crop and livestock losses and the disruption to transport,
communications, and other essential infrastructure. Despite continued moderate levels of
investment (about 14 percent of GNP) financed mostly from concessional foreign
assistance, the overall real growth rate this year and next year will be lower than that
expected before the floods.
(b)    Physical Impact: The estimated physical losses to agriculture by the Government include,
among other things, damage to flood protection and spate irrigation earth dikes (500),
masonry dikes (89), irrigation canals (11,020), and flood protection dikes (45). Also,
3,500 ha of arable land have been adversely affected, with 2,380 ha completely destroyed,
and an estimated 37,000 ha of arable land has been severely eroded, with much of the
topsoil washed away. With respect to transportation infrastructure, 16 locations on
highways were severely damaged. In addition, there have been substantial damages to
This Technical Annex is based on the findings of IDA missions to Yemen in July and October 1996. The missions
comprised Messrs. Nejdet Al-Salihi and Tijan M. Sallah (Co-Task Managers), Naji Abu-Hatim (Yemen Resident
Mission) and Farouk Shahin (Consultant Engineer). The Task Team also comprised Messrs. K.S. Venkatraman and Terje
Wolden. Peer reviewers for the project are Messrs. Gert van Santen and Ashok Subramanian. Ms. Conchita Castillo
assisted with the typing of this report. This report was prepared under the overall supervision of Mr. Salah Darghouth,
Division Chief, MN2NE, and reviewed by Ms. Tufan Kolan, Acting Project Advisor (MN2DR). It was approved by Mr.
Inder Sud, Director, MN2, and Mr. Kemal Dervis, Vice President, MNA.

housing, health, education, and public utilities, which are being addressed by the
Government and for which further donor assistance is being sought.
B. Country Assistance Strategy
1.2   In the past, IDA's country assistance strategy (CAS) for Yemen has concentrated on helping
establish the basic economic institutions of a modem state and on providing basic infrastructure. In
addition, IDA, together with several donors, has put considerable efforts in supporting agricultural
development throughout the country and in providing basic education and health services. In the most
recent CAS, given the past experience with the public sector and poor public finances, emphasis is on
laying the foundations for growth through private-sector-led development. To this end, IDA's assistance
strategy, in the next three years, is focused on: (i) implementing stabilization, structural reforms and social
protection measures; (ii) improving portfolio implementation and sustainability of past and future
investments; and (iii) promoting sustainable natural and human resource development. The proposed
emergency project has been designed in conformity with the second objective of the CAS; it would help
restore essential infrastructure damaged by flooding and thereby enable the sustainability of past and future
investments.
II. GOVERNMENT'S EMERGENCY STRATEGY AND RESPONSE BY IDA AND DONORS
A. Government Strategy
2.1    The Govemment has requested urgent assistance from IDA and other donors to respond to the
ongoing flood emergency. The Government has also taken the initiative to create, through the General
Secretariat For Natural Disasters, a Flood Relief High Committee headed by the Deputy Prime Minister
and Minister of Planning and Development, to handle all flood disaster relief activities and to coordinate
with aid donors on the reconstruction effort. Notwithstanding the difficult financial situation facing
Yemen, the Government has also agreed to contribute substantially to meeting the costs of the overall flood
relief and rehabilitation program. The Government has also worked closely with the donor community and
has requested a Donors' Meeting to be convened at an early date to serve as a basis to seek further donor
assistance.
B IDA 's Response
2.2   In response to the flood emergency, IDA missions visited Yemen in July and October 1996 to assist
the Government in assessing the extent of the flood damage and in preparing and appraising this
Emergency Flood Rehabilitation Project. As a result, it was agreed that a three-pronged approach would
be adopted to deal with the crisis. The first prong represented an immediate response to deal with urgent
priority needs within the scope of ongoing IDA-supported projects. To this end, US$14.5 million was
reallocated from existing credits to finance rehabilitation in agriculture, transport, roads and related
structures, water supply, power, health and education.  The second prong is this proposed Emergency
Flood Rehabilitation Project, which includes a study to help prepare the basis for a flood preparedness and
mitigation system. The IDA financing for these two prongs is about US$45 million, representing about 23
percent of the Government's Emergency Flood Reconstruction Program. And the third prong is to ensure



- 3 -
that IDA's country assistance program for Yemen does accommodate investments, in the medium to long
term, to help implement the recommendations of the flood preparedness and mitigation study.
C Donors'Response
2.3    The donor community has also been highly supportive of Yemen. The UNDP Sana'a Mission
began donor coordination efforts almost immediately after the heavy rains with assistance from the United
Nations Disaster Relief Organization (UNDRO). Through its "On-Site Operation Coordination Center"
(OSOCC), the UNDP has mobilized available donors, including international, regional, governmental and
non-governmental organizations in the immediate relief efforts. Many donors provided initial assistance
towards the immediate relief needs of the flood victims through the provision of food, medicines, blankets
and temporary shelter, as well as emergency medical services. Initial donor assistance, offered in cash and
kind, came from multilateral (e.g., United Nations Development Program, World Food Program, Food and
Agricultural Organization, UNICEF, World Health Organization) as well as 20 bilateral donors (e.g.,
Syria, Qatar, Netherlands, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, United Kingdom, Japan, Germany,
Jordan, Oman, Sudan) and 4 international NGOs, and was estimated at about US$14.0 million. The
UNDP OSOCC is also carrying out a full assessment of the flood damage. The study, known as the
'White Paper," is ongoing and its findings are to be presented to the Government by the end of December
1996. As part of the 'White Paper," the Netherlands Government is financing satellite imaging which,
together with ground control surveys, will assist in defining the full extent of flood damage. The damage
assessment in the "White Paper" would help the Government finalize its Emergency Rehabilitation Program
and serve as the basis for the above-mentioned Donors' Meeting (para. 2.1).
III. RATIONALE FOR IDA INVOLVEMENT
3.1   IDA's support for the Emergency Flood Rehabilitation Project is appropriate on several grounds.
First, Government has formally requested IDA's assistance in light of mutual partnership and IDA's
extensive involvement in economic development in Yemen. Second, IDA is a key actor among several
other donors active in the country. Given that, at present, the problems faced by Yemen from flood
damages are huge, and no single donor can shoulder all the burden, IDA's involvement is critical to the
success of the reconstruction efforts. Finally, IDA has extensive experience in emergency operations,
which it can successfully share with Yemen.
IV. DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION
A. Project Objectives
4.1    The proposed project would help to restore the country's essential economic infrastructure (roads,
agriculture, rural water supply) and domestic food production capability destroyed or damaged by the
heavy rains and flooding and facilitate road access to production centers, markets, and social services. It
would strengthen Yemen's institutional capacity to manage disaster recovery programs and develop
programs to mitigate the country's vulnerability to flood damage. The progress towards the achievement
of these objectives would be monitored by performance indicators agreed with Government (Attachment 3).
The project would also serve as a catalyst for donor financing and coordination of the reconstruction effort.



-4 -
B. Project Description
4.2    The project, to be implemented in three years, would provide financing for the following
components:
(a)    Agricultural Infrastructure:  Rehabilitation of embankments and other flood protection
works; rehabilitation of existing irrigation systems, canals and service roads; and
installation of secondary canals, wells, bunds, and weirs in the govemorates most affected
by the floods, mainly Shabwa, Marib and Hadramaut (base cost: US$13.0 million);
(b)    Transport Infrastructure: Rehabilitation of main roads and associated structures (e.g.,
bridges, culverts) in the most affected locations, mainly in Shabwa, Marib, Hadramaut,
Al-Jawf and Abyan (base cost: US$13.0 million);
(c)    Water Supply Infrastructure: Rehabilitation of urban and rural water supply facilities
through the supply of equipment such as chlorinators, pumps, generators, and pipes in all
the affected Govemorates (base cost: US$1.1 million); and
(d)    Consultant Services and Studies: Assistance in the design and implementation of civil
works, contract management and construction supervision, and the preparation of studies,
including a flood preparedness and mitigation study. The proposed terms of reference for
this study is presented in Attachment 6 (base cost: US$2.2 million).
C. Criteria for Selection ofRehabilitation Priorities
4.3    Details of damages in the agricultural and transport infrastructures are contained in Attachments 1
and 2. They have been prepared by consultants and discussed and agreed with Government, and comprise
the priority list of works to be carried out during the three-year life of the project. At appraisal, the criteria
used for selection of priority works were:
(a)    For Agricultural Infrastructure: Priorities are: (i) to rehabilitate wadi embankments and
related structures near rural human settlements and in areas where large numbers of
hectares of agricultural land are involved; and (ii) to rehabilitate and improve irrigation
infrastructure in the areas most severely affected by floods.
(b)    For Transport Infrastructure: Priorities are: (i) to rehabilitate roads and bridges in areas
most affected by the floods and with the greatest traffic intensity to reduce vehicle
operating costs, and (ii) to rehabilitate critical roads to communities which would
otherwise be without access to the larger economy to reduce their socio-economic isolation.
In all these rehabilitation works, flood-resistant design and construction would be used. In
all these rehabilitation works, flood-resistant design and construction would be used.

V. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND STUDIES
5.1    For the transport infrastructure component, an estimated 12 staff months of technical assistance
(engineering services) would be funded in order to: (i) carry out detailed designs of bridges and related
structures including: layout mapping, design drawings, technical specifications, bills of quantities, cost
estimates, construction procedures by force account or direct contracting, and implementation schedules;
and (ii) oversee implementation of civil works, contract management and supervision. Support in the form
of equipment for this TA as well as total estimated cost for this TA is presented in Attachment 2, page 6 of
6. For the agriculture infrastructure component (Attachment 1, page 6 of 8), 15.4 staff years of long-term
technical assistance would be engaged in addition to 0.3 staff years of short-term consultancy services.
Technical assistance would also be employed to prepare studies, including a flood preparedness and
mitigation study (para. 4.2 (d), Attachment 6).
VI. PROJECT COST AND FINANCING
6.1    The total cost of the project, including price and physical contingencies, is estimated at $35.0
million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$25.54 million, which is about 73 percent of
total project costs. The proposed project would be exempted from customs duties and taxes. IDA's
financial contribution to the proposed project would be SDR 20.8 million (US$30.0 million equivalent),
which is about 86 percent of total project costs. Local cost financing by IDA is justified in view of the
emergency nature of the project and the extra-budgetary burdens shouldered by the Government as a result
of the floods. The UNDP would provide US$1.0 million equivalent on a grant basis, as part of the
technical assistanec. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Tables 1 and 2 below.
Because of the urgent need to facilitate early start-up of the emergency activities, a project preparation
advance (PPA) of US$1.0 million has been agreed to by IDA. The PPA would be refunded through the
proposed Credit.

VII. INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS AND PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Project Implementation
7.1    The project would be implemented under the general supervision of a Project Management Unit
(PMU), which would be overseen by an Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC), consisting of the Ministers of
Planning and Development (MOPD); Construction, Housing and Urban Planning (MOCHUP); Agriculture
and Water Resources (MAWR) and other members to be agreed with IDA. The PMU will be attached to
the MOPD and would come under the authority of the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Planning and
Development. It will be headed by a National Coordinator, and will include a Deputy National Coordinator
and two technical advisors, one specialized in agricultural infrastructure and the other in roads and bridges.
As part of the PMU, there will be two sector coordinators for the field project implementation units
(PIUs): one in the MAWR responsible for coordinating the activities of the field PIUs implementing the
agriculture infrastructure component, and the other in the General Corporation for Roads and Bridges
(GCRB) responsible for coordinating the activities of the field GCRB PIUs implementing the transport
infrastructure (roads and bridges) component. The field PIUs for the agriculture infrastructure component
would be the Land and Water Conservation Project PIU in Shabwa govemorate; the Wadi Hadramaut III
2   Net of taxes and duties.



- 7 -
PIU in Hadramaut governorate; and the Eastern Region Agricultural Development Project PIU in Marib
governorate. The field PIUs for the roads and bridges component would be the GCRB PIUs in the
concerned governorates. An organogram of these implementation arrangements is presented in Attachment
4.
7.2    The field PIUs implementing the project belong to agencies which already have technical
departments familiar with IDA procedures. The responsibilities of these agencies, which have long-standing
relationships with IDA, are as follows:
(i)    MAWR will be responsible for rehabilitation of agricultural and rural infrastructure,
irrigation works and flood protection schemes, and for the carrying out of the flood
preparedness and mitigation study;
(ii)    GCRB, under the Ministry of Construction, Housing, and Urban Planning, will be
responsible for reconstruction of roads and related structures and rehabilitation to the
highways network; and
(iii)  the Public Works Project (PWP), under the guidance of the Ministry of Planning and
Development, will be responsible for rehabilitation of damaged water supply
infrastructure.
7.3   In addition to acting as the overall coordinator for the proposed project, the PMU will also
coordinate donor activities with assistance from technical advisers to be provided under the project.
B. PMUStaffing and Project Administration
7.4    The National Coordinator and Deputy National Coordinator for the project would be appointed
full-time. They will be supported by two sectoral technical advisers, one on a short-term and the other on a
long-term contract basis. The PMU would also be supported with an accountant, secretarial staff, and
office facilities. The National Coordinator, the Deputy National Coordinator and the sector coordinators of
the PMU shall be established within one month after effectiveness. The terms of reference of the National
Coordinator and his Deputy and other key project staff need to be agreed with the concerned line Ministry,
MOPD, and IDA (Resident Mission). The proposed terms of reference for key PMU staff are presented in
Attachment 5. Once appointed, the two sectoral technical advisors assisting the PMU will assist in
reviewing annual programs, procurement procedures and evaluations, implementation progress on site,
general technical verification and programming, and monitoring and evaluation.
C. Annual Work Program
7.5    The PIUs would prepare their anmual program  in accordance with the project and discuss and
clear the annual program with their sector coordinators in the MAWR and the GCRB. Once the annual
programs are cleared by the sector coordinators, they would then be brought to the PMU level for
discussion and clearance, after which they would become the official annual program. The PMU shall
verify the annual expenditures of each PIU in addition to reviewing procurement evaluation reports and
recommendations for award.



-8 -
D. Procurement
7.6      Procurement would be carried out as expeditiously as possible in accordance with IDA guidelines
under emergency operations. For small contracts up to US$50,000, the Director of the field PIUs, in
consultation with the PMU, will have approval authority for an aggregate amount not exceeding 20 percent
of their annual investment budget. For contracts with a value greater than US$50,000, up to US$200,000,
the PMU would have approval authority which would be subject to post-contract award review by IDA.
For contracts between US$200,000 and US$1.0 million, the concerned line Minister would have approval
authority subject to IDA's no-objection. Contracts above US$1.0 million would be subject to clearance by
the PMU, IDA and the High Tender Board (HTB). A surmmary of procurement arrangements are shown in
Table 3 below.

E. Disbursement
7.7      Three  special accounts  would  be  established  under the  project, one  for the  agriculture
infrastructure component, another for the transport infrastructure (roads and bridges) component, and the
third for the water supply component. The authorized allocations for the three special accounts would be:
US$0.5 million (Agriculture); US$0.5 million (Roads and Bridges); and US$0.25 million (Water Supply).
The special accounts will be periodically replenished on the basis of withdrawal applications, which should
be supported by appropriate documentation. Payments out of the special accounts would be made only for
eligible expenditures, and are required to be supported by appropriate documentation for periodic audits by
IDA. The disbursement plan and schedule are shown below in tables 4 and 5 below.

F. Accounts andAudits
7.8    The PMU shall maintain project accounts and submit an annual audit report to IDA no later than six
months after the end of the fiscal year. Audits shall be carried out by private auditors to be hired for the
duration of project implementation.
G. Supervision
7.9   IDA will carry out two supervision missions of the project annually with the PMU. One of these
will be an annual implementation review conducted jointly with the Government to assess progress made



- 10-
towards the implementation of the proposed project and agreed monitoring targets and the overall flood
rehabilitation program. Physical works under the proposed project would be implemented over a three-year
period.
H. Environmental Impact
7.10   The project is ranked Environmental Assessment Category "C" in accordance with O.D. 4.01. The
project poses no environmental risks; instead it has built-in corrective measures to mitigate the effects of
future floods (para. 4.2 (d)).
VIII. LESSONS LEARNED FROM PREVIOUS EMERGENCY CREDITS
8.1   In the recent past, Yemen has received two emergency recovery credits: the first was for flood
emergency rehabilitation (Cr. 2073-YDR of 1989) and the second was for assisting resettlement of Yemeni
returnees after the Gulf War (Cr. 2258-YEM of 1991). Of the two projects, the Emergency Flood
Reconstruction Credit (Cr. 2073-YDR) of SDR 7.9 million (US$10 million), approved in December 1989
(Cr. 2073-YDR), was the most directly relevant to this project. It involved reconstruction of housing units,
health centers, and agricultural infrastructure following the 1989 floods. The lessons learned from that
project are that using existing implementing agencies and government timely provision of counterpart funds
are important to the success of emergency operations. These factors were taken into account in the design
of the proposed project. Another lesson learned is that Government needs to place high priority on
following through with a flood preparedness and mitigation study. Under the proposed project, UNDP has
agreed to finance the study. The recommendations from the study would identify investments for which
donor assistance would be sought.
IX. BENEFITS AND RISKS
A. Benefits
9.1    The proposed project would help restore the agricultural infrastructure, the roads network and
bridges and the water supply infrastructure damaged by the floods in the most affected Governorates. It
would directly benefit over 124,000 people who were affected by the floods. To the extent feasible, labor-
intensive methods and beneficiary participation will be used, which are expected to generate about 3,000
new job opportunities in construction activities. The project would also reduce the impact of future floods
by providing the basis for an early warning system and, through studies, define long-term measures for
flood control, prevention and mitigation. The flood preparedness and mitigation study would recommend
administrative reforms and engineering measures which would comprise an investment program to be
carried out in the medium-term.
B. Risks
9.2    The main risk associated with the proposed project relates to potential implementation delays due
to the limited administrative and institutional capacity of the country in general. This risk would be
minimized by the fact that: (i) both the MOA and the GCRB have implement IDA projects in the past; and



- I1 -
(ii) the Government has already established the inter-ministerial committee and appointed the National
Coordinator for the PMU. During implementation, to guard against delays, both the PMU and PIUs would
be provided with technical experts where necessary, and incentive levels of IDA supervision from the
Resident Mission would be provided.
X. AGREEMENTS REACHED
10.1   During negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government that:
(a)    MOPD will establish the IMC for management of disaster relief within one month after
effectiveness of the Credit (para 7.1). Notification has been received that this has been
done, and the IMC comprises the Minister of Planning and Development; Minister of
Construction, Housing and Urban Planning; Minister of Agriculture and Water Resources
and Minister of Electricity;
(b)   for the purpose of ensuring the proper supervision of the implementation of the proposed
project, the Government shall establish within one month after effectiveness of the Credit
and thereafter maintain a PMU under supervision of the IMC (para. 7.1);
(c)    a National Coordinator for the PMU would be appointed within one month of credit
effectiveness (para. 7.1). IDA has recently been notified of Government's choice for the
position;
(d)   the monitoring indicators for the project are those in Attachment 3; and
(e)    a flood preparedness and mitigation study would be completed not later than September 1,
1998.  The study would recommend administrative reforms to introduce a flood
preparedness program and engineering measures to reduce the country's vulnerability to
such disasters (para. 4.2 (d)).

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN
EMERGENCY FLOOD REHABILITATION PROJECT
Study for Flood Emergency Preparedness and Mitigation Program
Proposed Terms of Reference
1.    Major floods affected large parts of Yemen in 1978, 1982, 1989 and 1996. The Government of
the Republic of Yemen (ROY) recognizes the need to develop measures for mitigating the social and
economic impact of such floods and designing an emergency preparedness program to protect the
inhabitants of flood prone areas. This study is being financed under an IDA Credit for an Emergency
Flood Rehabilitation Project, which is in response to major flooding in June 1996 affecting the
Governorates of Shabwa, Marib and Hadramaut. To coordinate and monitor this study, as well as the
implementation of the proposed Emergency Flood Rehabilitation Program, the Government has
established an Emergency Project Coordination Unit (EPCU), working under the guidance of the
Ministry of Planning and Development (MOPD).
2.           It is proposed to recruit consultants to carry out the study in cooperation with staff of
the EPCU, other ministries, national and local agencies and private organizations. The EPCU shall
assist the consultants in obtaining the relevant information, including data and reports listed in paras. 9
and 10 below.
Objectives
3.    The main objectives of the study are to:
(i)    assess the existing arrangements for managing emergency disasters and propose an
appropriate institutional framework, at the national and local levels, which will activate
automatically in the event of future catastrophic events;
(ii)   develop community-based early warning and evacuation procedures and public
awareness programs aimed at protecting population and property and minimizing
disruptions to economic activity; and
(iii)  identifying engineering options to mitigate the impact of torrential rains and flash
flooding, which may be implemented over the medium to long term.
Study Area
4.     Economic activities (mainly agriculture) and population settlements in ROY are mostly
concentrated in 20 major wadis. The area affected covers some 350,000 hectares. The consultants
should draw upon existing studies and other available information.
Scope of Work
5.    The consultant's work involves inter-related tasks comprising the following:



-36 -                                 Attachmentl6
Page 2 of 7
(A)    Institutional Setting and Framework
Task No.1:   Review of Existing Government Response
With the assistance of the EPCU and the High Committee for Coordination of Flood Relief
(HCCFR), the consultants will review the existing emergency management system and specifically the
Government's experience in responding to the 1996 flood disaster in the three Governorates most
effected by the floods. Particular attention should be paid to identifying measures to improve the
organizational and managerial structure related to: (a) early warning and evacuation systems; and (b)
implementation of relief operations. As part of this review, a workshop involving the managers in key
sectors affected by the 1996 flood relief program will be held to assess ways to improve:
(a)    the overall performance of the existing relief and early warning flood evacuation
programs;
(b)    evacuation procedures, storage and provisions for emergency shelter;
(c)    public health issues;
(d)    communications; and
(e)    inter-ministerial coordination, coordination at the governorate and local levels; and
coordination with donor agencies.
Task No. 2.  Assessment of National and Governorate Logistical Capabilities
The consultants, with the support of the EPCU, HCCFR and the administration in the
governorates where the wadis exist, will prepare inventories and assessments of the state of existing
equipment for the emergency logistics at the national and local levels, such as four-wheel drive
vehicles, earth moving equipment, etc. From this list, a plan will be developed for the deployment of
resources in the case of flood emergencies. Lists of equipment needs will be prepared on this basis.
Task No.3:.  Proposals for establishing an Office for Flood Emergency Preparedness
With the support of the EPCU, HCCFR and the Ministry of Planning and Development
MOPD and the sector ministries concerned, the consultants will propose an institutional framework for
coordination, communication and response to flood emergencies. Staffing and budgetary requirements
will be analyzed and a training program for staff of the Flood Emergency Preparedness Office will be
prepared, using international centers for Disaster Preparedness and Management.
Task No. 4:  Preparation of Governorate and Local Level Emergency Action Plan
The consultants will assist the Governorates and district flood relief committees in reviewing
existing emergency flood disaster plans and developing improved procedures covering the following
actions:
(a)    proposing institutional arrangements which would improve the distribution of relief
needs such as food, potable water supplies, medicines, blankets and temporary shelter;



Attachment 6
- 3 7 -                           Page 3 of 7
(b)    conducting search and rescue operations and guiding evacuees to shelters;
(c)    monitoring and controlling communicable diseases;
(d)    assessing flood damage; and
(e)    developing an assistance program  for low-income families affected by the floods,
including cash-for-work projects, short-term loans, grants in kind and food-for-work
approaches.
(B) Community-Based Early Warning and Evacuation Systems
Task No. 5: Preparation of a Public Awareness Campaign
A sustainable flood preparedness program will require extensive and broad-based community
support. A public awareness media strategy will be developed by the consultant to stimulate local
preparedness initiatives. The campaign will also inform the public about the warning system and how
it will work, evacuation routes and procedures, and will identify safe zones where people can move
during floods. It should consider a range of media to test the effectiveness of various public awareness
programs. The materials for such a program will be prepared by the consultant. In areas which have
been flooded previously, flood markers will be erected to remind the public of the levels of the highest
known floods and to serve as a reference point for future warnings.
Task No. 6:  Establishment of a Community-Based Flood Warning and Evacuation System
Ultimately, flood preparedness hinges on the active involvement of inhabitants at the
community level to take the necessary measures to reduce the threat from floods. This will require
establishing community-based warning and evacuation systems as follows:
(a)    appointing flood monitors in each vulnerable community;
(b)    providing the flood monitors with sufficient training, equipment and materials to enable
them to monitor flood threats and organize community evacuations in advance of actual
flooding; and
(c)   incorporation of the flood monitors into an overall National Flood Forecasting and
Warning System.
To carry out this task, the consultants will coordinate with the meteorological authorities and
local agencies and propose the necessary actions and logistics to establish such a community-based
system.
Task No. 7:  Interim Flood Evacuation Protection Improvement
When the housing and agricultural flood mitigation programs (see below) have been fully
implemented, it will be necessary to study evacuation requirements in all areas vulnerable to major
flooding. These investigations will determine the maximum expected flood levels and the facilities
available to shelter evacuees in non-flood prone areas.  The consultants will also recommend



Attachment 6
- 38 -                              Page 4 of 7
emergency flood protection measures that should be taken in order to mitigate the impact of floods with
a 10-year recurrence on major economic assets. Consultants will also give indications of water levels
likely to occur with a 50- and 100- year recurrence and the effect of this on the same assets.
(C)   Economic Development Strategies, Engineering and Investment Options
Task No. 8:   Alternative Economic Development Strategies to Mitigate Flood Risks
The objective of this task is to identify development strategies to lessen the impact of flooding
on the population and the economy, through:
(a)    preparing an inventory of ongoing development projects and investments in order to
identify possible adjustments which could reduce flood losses or contribute to flood
mitigation or prevention; and
(b)    exploring alternative development strategies, projects and investments that could be
initiated to take advantage of periodic flooding under controlled flooding plans (such as
spate irrigation and aquifer recharge).
For this task, the consultants will work together with the MOPD, the Ministry of Agriculture
and Water Resources (MAWR) and the National Water Resources Authority (NWRA).
Task No. 9:   Flood Protection Monitoring Program
Working in conjunction with the Regional Authorities of the MAWR and the Housing and
Roads and Bridges Directorates of the Governorates, the consultants will: (i) assess the maintenance
practices of existing flow control and flood protection structures; (ii) identify low-cost techniques for
maintenance by local communities; and (iii) propose low-cost technology to make emergency repairs.
A Pilot Program will be identified, together with the various specialized Regional Agencies, to define
existing flood protection structures which have previously been prone to difficulties during floods, are
of a substandard design, are in a deteriorated state of maintenance or are located in populated areas
where breaching may cause loss of life and property.
Task No. 1:  Agricultural Flood Control Mitigation
The agricultural flood control mitigation program will be designed to reduce agricultural losses
and to improve water harvesting, aquifer recharge and spate irrigation in flood-prone areas. This task
will be carried out in coordination with the MAWR, taking into account strategic irrigation
development plans.  The report should include maps identifying existing infrastructure and the
identified study areas on the wadi banks prone to 5, 10, 50 and 100-year flood recurrences; this will
involve:
(a)    updating existing assessments of flood damage, proposing detailed rehabilitation or
reconstruction of irrigation and flood control infrastructure, and assessing the quality
and appropriateness of the rehabilitation works already completed or under execution;
(b)    collecting, analyzing  and updating  existing  physical information  (meteorology,
hydrology, geology, hydrogeology, morphology, topography); and reviewing the
existing studies for irrigation and flood control infrastructure in the study area;



- 392-0Attchmet 6
Page 5 of 7
(c)    locating zones vulnerable to the same flood recurrence or return period and plotting
them on a "flood zone map;"
(d)    assessing existing urban and rural infrastructure by type of development and the
population density and other relevant social and economic parameters;
(e)    assessing levels of flood protection works required for each of the above- mentioned
types of infrastructure, and designing a "Flood Protection Requirements Map;"
(f)    overlaying the zoning maps (c) and (e), in order to identify the areas where the level of
flood protection needs to be upgraded, as a matter of priority;
(g)    identifying, at the reconnaissance level, specific sub-projects to meet the required level
of flood protection for various areas as defined in (f) above;
(h)    preparing a program  to implement the flood protection measures described in (g),
establishing priorities based on social and economic factors, with preference to more
densely populated urban and/or rural areas, and proposing a realistic phased
irhplementation schedule. This should include the recommendations for terms of
reference for follow-up steps for further investigations, feasibility studies and detailed
designs as required for the gradual implementation of the sub-projects.
(i)    in the light of the findings, the consultants will propose policies to implement, manage,
operate, and maintain the irrigation and flood control infrastructure, including:
(i)    drafting of legislation to introduce and update the flood zoning maps to reflect
future modifications during the implementation of the long-term program;
(ii)    drafting the requirements to obtain licenses or authorizations for future urban
or rural developments including conditions to avoid conflict of interest among
sectors or among projects within one sector; and
(iii)   modifying construction codes of flood protection control and irrigation
infrastructure. These codes will be customized to take into account the type of
project, the level of the flood zone and the site physical conditions, such as
geological and soil mechanics characteristics, and localized rainfall.
Task No.  11: Roads/Bridges and Buildings Flood Mitigation Program
The consultant will design a Roads/Bridges and Buildings flood mitigation program for flood
prone areas. This program should recommend structural measures that can be used to reduce losses to
these infrastructure facilities. Such measures might include:
(a)    structural design of diversion weirs or raised platforms;
(b)    flood protection embankments for rural population centers in clusters of houses or
small villages and agricultural infrastructure;



Attachment 6
- 40 -                                  Page 6 of 7
(c)    raising road embankments, increased cross drainage capabilities of culverts and
bridges, re-alignment of critical sections of roads prone to flood inundation and at wadi
crossing in addition to protection of roads embankments;
(d)    introducing building standards which insure maximum endurance of buildings under
flood conditions and water resistant construction; and
(e)    improving the site selection of individual buildings to avoid construction in flood prone
areas.
This task would be carried out in cooperation with the Directorate of Local Government, the
Ministry of Construction, Housing, and Urban Planning (MOCHUP), and MAWR.
Time Schedule and Reports
6.     The consultant shall commence field work within 30 days from the effective date of the
contract, which shall be defined as the date of receipt of an advanced payment equivalent to 10 percent
of the contract sum. This will be known as the starting date. The following reports, in English and
Arabic, will be submitted to the Ministry of Planning and Development.
Inception Report: 20 copies of which to be prepared within 45 days of the starting date, to
