1.   Project Context, Development and Global Environment Objectives Design

At the time of project preparation, the Government of Croatia was actively working to
meet the requirements of Croatian accession to the EU described in European Council
Decision COM(2004) 275 on European Partnership with Croatia. Accordingly, the
Government worked actively to meet the requirements and obligations as laid down in the
acquis communautaire (body of laws of the European Union).

Agriculture was a substantial element of the Croatian economy, contributing about 6.0
percent of GDP substantially above Central and Eastern European Countries (CEEC)
average. Some 42 percent of the country’s total population of 4.5 million was living in
rural areas, with agriculture providing about 8 percent of employment and directly or
indirectly a source of livelihood for a significant segment of Croatian society.

With agriculture and environment making up over half of the acquis communautaire, one
of the major challenges for the Croatian government was to create a competitive and
efficient agriculture sector that abides by the environmental cross-compliance
requirements. These requirements apply at many levels including compliance with
institutional and procedural set up, the assurance of adequate food safety and
phytosanitary conditions to allow for the uninhibited flow of trade of agricultural products
across the EU, adoption of transparent financial mechanisms in the payment of
agricultural subsidies under SAPARD/IPARD for future management of the resources
made available under the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). For the agri-
environment policy, the requirements mainly include the application of measures towards
achieving compliance with the EU water directives since in the region the agricultural
sector is one of the main polluters of water resources. Croatian farmers lacked knowledge
and capacity to effectively apply for support for measures to reduce point source pollution
from poor manure and slurry storage and handling as well as adopting farming practices
that would mitigate water pollution of agricultural origin.

1.1 Context at Appraisal

The Government had been running rural development programs aimed at increasing
productivity and diversifying output, conserving natural resources, creating or improving
infrastructure, promoting markets and increasing the incomes of the rural population.
These interventions lacked focus and continuity, resulting in mixed results, with an
uneven impact on the rural population. Food safety regulations and quality standards
were not EU compatible and the Croatian food industry was unprepared for the
competitive environment of the EU common market. Croatian food safety institutions and
inspection services were insufficiently aware of the EU sanitary standards and lacked
infrastructure and capacity that are the key pre-conditions for Croatia’s products future
uninhibited access to European markets.

Implementation of the EU Nitrates Directive, including the development of the Code of
Good Agricultural Practices (CGAP) to address nutrient management has become one of
the major drivers to the country’s commitment to policy and institutional reform in the
agricultural/rural sector. The fact that the Danube River, as well as its tributaries the Sava
and the Drava are draining sixty percent of Croatia’s territory (approximately 33,940 sq
km out of a total of 56,538 sq km) underscores the significant direct impact of the

                                              1
ongoing agricultural practices in the region on the waters of the Danube River and the
Black Sea. More than half of all nutrient loads into the Danube River originate from
agriculture, about one-fourth from private households and about 10-13 percent from
industry.

The Government requested World Bank assistance to fill specific gaps that would
contribute to Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Management’s (MAFWM)
overall preparedness to fulfill the implementation requirements for EU accession as they
relate to agricultural payments systems and food safety requirements. The Bank was well
positioned to assist the Government in these efforts following the experience gained in
implementing the Farmers Support Service Project (FSSP) that assisted the Government
in its early reform efforts and the longer term objective of meeting the EU acquis in the

In the context of EU agriculture and environment acquis, the Bank had a comparative
advantage in helping Croatia institute measures for Nutrient Reduction in the Danube and
Black Sea Basin with a portfolio of over a dozen projects in the basin at various stages of
preparation and implementation aimed at promoting environmentally friendly agricultural
practices.

At the time, Croatia’s committed efforts towards EU accession, the favorable political
climate, the recognition of the links between sustainable agriculture and the environment
and government’s commitment to large scale investments in structural reform seemed to
provide a window of opportunity for the Bank and GEF. The project would assist the
country in piloting a nutrient reduction program that will kick-start a much larger and
longer term investment in agricultural competitiveness and agri-environment management,
including nitrate reduction.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as
approved)

The PDO of the Agricultural Acquis Cohesion Project (AACP) was to develop sustainable
systems and capacities within the MAFWM to ensure timely compliance with EU acquis
conditions in the rural sector. The Legal Agreement has a slightly different PDO wording:
“to develop sustainable systems and capacities within the MAFWM and other public
institutions to ensure timely compliance with EU acquis conditions in the rural sector?
but the meaning is the same. The PDO mentions the MAFWM exclusively, but the
understanding was that this would include the institutions supporting the sector including
the various institutes and accompanying laboratories and inspection services. The primary
project outcome would be more transparent, participatory and market-oriented support to
and regulation of agriculture and rural development in Croatia, implemented within the
framework of the prevailing EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and acquis
communautaire.

Key Indicators included:
   x An innovative, transparent, participatory and environmentally sustainable rural
       investment program;
   x Staff capacity and management and information systems within MAFWM
       commensurate with the demands of EU integration;
   x An EU compliant agricultural policy framework and capacity to inform key
       decision makers and stakeholders of likely impacts;

                                            2
   x   An EU compliant food safety management system that allows availability of safe
       food to Croatia’s residents;
   x   An EU and WTO compliant sanitary and phytosanitary system that protects
       Croatia’s human, animal and plant life and health

1.3 Global Environment Objectives (GEO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

The PDO of Agricultural Pollution Control Project (APCP) was to significantly increase
the use of environmentally friendly agricultural practices by farmers in Croatia's Danube
River basin in order to reduce nutrient discharge from agricultural sources to surface and
ground water bodies. The GEO of the project was to reduce the discharge of nutrients into
waters draining into the Danube River and Black Sea. In support of this, the project was
to assist the Government of Croatia to: (i) promote mitigating measures for nutrient
reduction from agricultural sources to surface and ground water bodies (manure
management); (ii) implement a national agri-environment policy (Code of Good
Agricultural Practices) and the national water protection policy, particularly concerning
nitrates; and (iii) carry out a public awareness campaign that would disseminate the
benefits of project activities with the aim towards replication at the national and regional
levels. Key indicators included:

   x   At least 40% of the farming population in the project areas adopting preventive
       and remedial measures to reduce nutrient discharges;
   x   At least a 10% reduction in discharge of nutrients into surface and groundwater in
       the three project regions;
   x   Increased national awareness of linkages between local actions and impact on
       water nutrient load.

1.4 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

While the AACP was restructured its rather broad definition of the PDO and its key
indicators were not revised.

1.5 Revised GEO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

The AP0.P GEO and its key indicators were not revised.

1.6 Main Beneficiaries

The main direct beneficiaries of the AACP were the institutions that would help with the
implementation of the activities required to build and strengthen the administration of
agricultural subsidies and the monitoring of these subsidies as well as the institutions
responsible for the assurance of food safety in the country to improve the capacity for
trade in agricultural products with EU member states. These institutions include the
Ministry of Agriculture (former MAFWM), Croatian Agriculture Extension Institute
(CAEI), Croatia Food Agency (CFA), National and Regional Veterinary Institutes, Plant
Protection Institute (PPI) and Seeds and Seedlings Institute (SSI). The benefit from
improved institutional capacity would ultimately accrue to farmers in the form of a more
transparent and effective use of SAPARD and IPARD funding envelopes made available
from the EU, and the opening of a larger export potential.
                                             3
The main beneficiaries for the APCP (GEF- funded) activities have been the agricultural
faculties undertaking the research and installation of piezometers for soil monitoring for
increase nitrate leaching and demonstrations, Croatian farmers who benefitted from new
manure storage and handling facilities, as well as individual communities and grant
beneficiaries for off farm income generation as well as rural infrastructure.

1.7 Original Components (as approved)

For administrative reasons the project at the time was developed as two distinct separate
operations each with its own project code (P091715 and P100639), the former for IBRD
funding co-financed by a Dutch Grant, and the latter for the GEF funding. The
components of the two projects were complementary and had conceptual links but did
have completely different descriptions and activities. The IBRD-funded AACP
principally supported capacity development of institutions towards meeting EU
requirements in agriculture while the GEF-funded APCP provided resources to help
develop capacities and demonstration investments towards implementation of EU Nitrate
Directive in agri-environment sector. For brevity, the components of both projects are
combined in an abbreviated form in this section.

The Agricultural Acquis Cohesion Project (AACP) was composed of four components:
(i) Strengthen Capacity for Absorbing EU Financial Assistance in Agriculture; (ii)
Empowerment of MAFWM Administration and Management; (iii) Ensuring Safe Food
and Sanitary and Phytosanitary Conditions; and (iv) Project Management.

Component 1 (IBRD and Dutch TF): Strengthen Capacity for Absorbing EU
Financial Assistance in Agriculture. This component was planned to support the
establishment of a SAPARD program implementing three of the SAPARD rural
development measures and a limited and carefully targeted number of sub-measures. The
output of this investment would be increased capacity, during pre-accession, to
comprehensively implement the acquis communautaire concerning the EU Common
Agricultural Policy (CAP). The following three main activities were planned for
financing:

a) The SAPARD Managing Authority would be established within the MAFWM
   Department for Sustainable Development of Rural Areas (DSDRA) to include a
   SAPARD Monitoring Committee, supported by a small, permanent Secretariat and
   overseeing a contracted SAPARD monitoring and evaluation program. Private and
   public sector SAPARD facilitators would be trained in financial evaluation and
   management, community organization, good agricultural practice, environment
   management and other SAPARD related grant preparation requirements. This sub-
   component would also include the development and implementation of
   communication strategies to (i) inform potential public and private sector SAPARD
   beneficiaries; and (ii) engage key agriculture stakeholders in the EU accession
   process.

b) The SAPARD Payment Agency and Integrated Administration and Control System
   (IACS) would be established, including an accredited SAPARD Payment Agency,
   with the necessary control, implementation, payment, accounting, internal audit,
   monitoring and information technology systems and capacities to rapidly and
   effectively implement SAPARD program. The project would provide supporting
   technical assistance and finance the investment and some operating costs of the
                                          4
   Payment Agency (PA). The sub-component would also establish a comprehensive
   IACS that would build off an improved farm registry.

c) A Pilot SAPARD Pre-finance Facility (the Facility) would be established to serve as a
   cash reserve for guarantees issued under the Facility to cover the risk of failure of
   municipalities in fulfilling SAPARD disbursement conditions.

Component 2 (IBRD and Dutch TF): Empower the MAFWM Administration and
Management. The primary objective of this component was to establish an organized,
cohesive and well-informed MAFWM management and administration team, with
improved overall capacity to address the challenges of EU accession. Investments under
this component would address gaps in MAFWM management and administration
capacity, information technology, and institutional structures that were necessary for the
effective functioning of the MAFWM and conditional to EU accession. Project support
would determine the capacity profiles for key MAFWM management and administration
staff and conduct a skills gap analyses to determine capacity building requirements. On
the basis of this, training programs would be developed in, inter alia, civil service
administration, change management, staff management, information technology and the
EU agricultural acquis. This component would also strengthen the policy analysis
capacity of the MAFWM Policy Analysis Unit, staff post-graduate training, technical
assistance and funding for policy studies. This would include the upgrading of the
Agricultural Information Center (AIC), development of a comprehensive Farm Register
and pilot Farm Accounting Data Network (FADN), and the establishment of a
management information system for MAFWM. Support would also be provided to
upgrade MAFWM’s information technology (IT) to ensure fast, secure data transfer and
storage, both in-house and with regional centers, and establish a video conferencing
capability between major MAFWM centers and agencies.

Component 3 (IBRD and Dutch TF): Ensuring Safe Food and Sanitary and
Phytosanitary Conditions. The primary purpose of this component was to support the
development of the Croatia Food Agency (CFA) and create the necessary conditions for
Croatian compliance with EU sanitary and phytosanitary requirements. This component
would include:

a) Development of the Croatia Food Agency and establish a consolidated, transparent,
   efficient, and risk-based food safety program. This would include the separation of
   human/animal health and food safety responsibilities among inspectors, the
   development of the CFA’s web-based reporting and data management systems, CFA
   risk assessment and communications programs, food health crisis management
   strategies and a public information campaign.
b) Strengthened Veterinary and Plant Health services by developing regionally
   structured, effective veterinary and phytosanitary inspection services supported by
   investments in staff capacity building, transportation, testing equipment, a web-based
   inspection reporting, certification and data management system and civil works and
   office equipment at up to five regional centers. Veterinary animal and public health
   services would be strengthened through the establishment of a veterinary
   epidemiology department including the completion and integration of MAFWM
   epidemiology, residue testing, animal numbering, and border inspection software and
   staff training in its use. The project would also establish national veterinary, public
   health and plant health reference laboratories implementing ISO 17025 testing

                                            5
   methodologies, including investment in civil works, staff capacity, information
   management and some equipment. An International Seed Testing Association (ISTA)
   certified laboratory for genetically modified organisms (GMO) testing would be
   established at the Croatian Institute for Seeds and Seedlings (CISS).

Component 4: Project Management. This component was to finance a small
implementation team within the MAFWM Department for Policy, EU and International
Relations (DPEUIR) that would manage the project. The implementation team would
include a Project Manager, Financial Controller, Procurement Officer and an
administration/secretarial support person. Project impact monitoring would be contracted
out. The team would be responsible for all aspects of project administration, including
overall project oversight, TA, goods and materials procurement, and financial control. A
Project Steering Committee (PSC) composed of key Assistant Ministers within MAFWM
would provide project oversight and ensure national program integration. The SAPARD
Monitoring Committee and the Croatian Food Agency (CFA) Board would ensure public
participation in project program implementation. A Project Working Group made up of
senior technical staff from the participating MAFWM departments would provide
technical guidance to the project implementation team. The APCP management was fully
integrated into the PIU of the AACP.

The AACP components were co-financed through a US$4.75 million Dutch Grant
(TF056498) for the Technical Assistance to support the implementation of the
Agricultural Acquis Cohesion Project. The Grant was provided by the Netherlands
Ministry for Development Cooperation in October 2006. The grant funds were
instrumental in strengthening the administration and management capacity of the staff of
the MAFWM and associated institutions to comprehensively implement the acquis
communautaire concerning the EU CAP during pre-accession. Three amendments to the
Administrative Agreement were made to reflect the extensions of the Project Closing
Dates and the inclusion of stipulation for the training of Croatian farmers and farmer
associations to facilitate their understanding of the process and requirements of the EU
agriculture acquis and EU accession requirements. More than 80 farmers’ associations
(1800 farmers in total) benefitted from the training and study tours to 15 European
countries to exchange experience with their European counterparts. 98 percent of grant
funds were disbursed.

The GEF-funded Agricultural Pollution Control Project (APCP) was composed of four
components: (i) Mitigating Nutrient Loads to Water Bodies from Point-Source Pollution
(Manure Management); (ii) Development and Promotion of Agri-Environment Measures;
(iii) Public Awareness and Replication Strategy; and (iv) Project Management.

Component 1: Mitigation of Nutrient Loads to Water Bodies from Point-Source
Pollution (Manure Management). The main objective of this component was to finance
the following activities:

a) Establish a Nitrates Mitigation Investment Fund of $2.66 million within the Payment
   Agency to finance grants for 75 percent of the cost of manure storage and
   management in the counties of Osije?ko-Baranjska and Vukovarsko-Srijemska, for
   medium-scale livestock farmers. Grants would contribute to the construction of the
   platforms/sumps and associated pumping and agitation and spreading equipment. In
   the Varaždinska county, in addition to cattle farms, poultry farms would be targeted,

                                           6
    eligible for matching grants for manure management systems based on impervious
    storage platforms and drainage sumps. An IPARD-compliant Beneficiary and Public
    Procurement Guide detailing the criteria and processes for awarding grants, and
    sample manure storage facility plans and construction specifications, would be
    developed.

b) Support for Water & Soil Monitoring and Impact Analysis in collaboration with the
   Croatian Water Agency (CWA) and Directorate for Water Management (DWM), to
   install piezometers in selected sites to monitor the quality of water flowing out of
   livestock farms implementing the project financed manure management sub-projects.
   The CWA would take responsibility for monitoring these piezometers as part of its
   national groundwater monitoring program. An operational manual would be
   developed with the aim of ensuring that all procedures, including sampling planning,
   field work, sample handling, laboratory analysis, record keeping and documentation
   would be coherent on all measuring stations and monitoring programs.

Component 2: Development and Promotion of Agri-Environment Measures. This
component was aimed at assisting the implementation of the Code of Good Agricultural
Practices (CGAP). The specific activities would include:

a) Dissemination of the CGAP: Publish user-friendly guidelines that would help farmers
   understand and implement the relevant provisions of the CGAP that dealt with the
   aspects of the Nitrate Directives with particular focus on manure storage and
   application as organic fertilizer based on a healthy soil nitrogen balance. The
   publication of the Guidelines would be supplemented with brochures, messages
   through mass media, agricultural fairs, etc.

b) CGAP Training and Demonstration (T&D) Program: The CAEI would undertake a
   training and demonstration program to educate and train the livestock community
   (extension workers, farmers, enterprises) in sustainable, cost-effective manure
   management practices. The project would build capacity under this sub-component
   by using GEF funds to recruit three technical staff, to be located in the three
   participating counties and trained to implement the manure management program and
   CGAP. This would include: (i) technical assistance to farmers receiving nitrate
   mitigation grants; (ii) nutrient management planning in the project counties to
   promote optimal use of organic and mineral fertilizers in order to reduce the loss of
   Nitrogen (N) Phosphorus (P) Potassium (K) to water bodies; and (iii) demonstration
   of cover crop technology to reduce nutrient loss, protect soil from compaction and
   erosion, maintain soil organic matter, and enhance biodiversity and provides
   additional fodder and/or green manure, and demonstrated on up to 200 ha per annum
   in each participating county. The project would provide some equipment for training
   and demonstration purposes.

Component 3: Public Awareness and Replication Strategy. The main objective of this
component was to support the following activities:

a) Public Awareness: At the project county level, the main audience would be the direct
   stakeholders of the project, including local and county officials, farmers, community
   groups and NGOs. At the national level the project would concentrate on institutions
   and groups, including government agencies, national environmental or professional
   associations, academia, NGOs, etc. and the population at large. The aim would be to
                                            7
   familiarize the population with the project and its benefits and thereby raise the
   interest of potential future clients.
b) Website: The project would assist the CAEI to develop and maintain a website
   containing detailed information on project activities and programs on technologies
   and land management systems appropriate for reducing point and non-point nutrient
   loads from agriculture to surface and ground water bodies.
c) Knowledge Sharing: Provision would be made for government and project staff
   participation in GEF International Waters Learning Exchange and Resource Network

Component 4: Project Management. The APCP management was fully embedded in
the PIU of the AACP established within the MAFWM.

1.8 Revised Components

The project and its components were not substantially revised during implementation
with the exception of the AACP Component 1 where loan proceeds were reallocated from
the envisaged guarantee fund (Facility) towards works and goods of Components 1 and 2.
Some of the original items for procurement were modified mainly because the project
activities were being supported in parallel by the EU-funded programs and the project
thus focused on financing gaps.

The AACP Component 1 in support of the paying system in Croatia was not financed
exclusively from the loan proceeds but also from the EU programs. Consequently, the
component activities were effectively fine-tuned in order to fill the gaps that remained in
the establishment of these structures. Under the first subcomponent, the activities in
support of the SAPARD/IPARD Managing Authority (MA) were essentially delivered as
intended at design and conferral of management has been obtained for the support
measures under it management. Project support has been focused on sector analysis,
supporting an advisor to build beneficiary capacity, and ex-ante evaluation of the Rural
Development (RD) program delivery.

Support to the Paying Agency and IACS was similarly reoriented to essentially build up
pieces that were insufficiently advanced towards EU accession. In this case project
support focused on the establishment of an effective Land and Parcel Information System
(LPIS) which is a crucial piece in the establishment of an effective IACS and the
transparent management of direct payments to farmers. Specifically, the project financed
the LPIS software development and deployment, orthophoto maps, cadastral maps as well
as TA and related IT equipment under this activity.

The delays with the conferral of the third SAPARD measure for Improved Rural
Infrastructure had been postponed for so long that it led to the dropping of the SAPARD
pre-finance facility altogether. The measure would be reintroduced as part of IPARD but
would only happen so late in the project that the impact of the facility by closing would
be negligible. The resources were thus reallocated for more procurement of works, goods
as well as laboratory and diagnostic equipment in particular.

The AACP Component 2 largely remained as it was designed providing a variety of
training to the staff of MAFWM to build capacity and improve Information Technology
                                            8
user capacity, support policy analysis and institutional gap analysis. Resources under this
component also provided support for the establishment of the Agricultural Information
Center, linking all the databases of the Data Centre at the Ministry including support for
FADN, a Veterinary Information System (VIS), and a Phyto-Information System (Phyto-
IS) coordinated along with the activities under Component 3. The Dutch TF underwent a
reallocation and closing date extension to increase support towards farmers training, study
tours and post-graduate scholarship at national and international universities for some 60
individuals.

The AACP Component 3 was largely delivered as intended at project design with few
changes. In terms of support to the veterinary services, during implementation discussions
had evolved around a large single building rehabilitation in Zagreb. With the arrival of a
new Director at the Veterinary Institute and the separation of the Veterinary Inspections
into a separate Directorate, the idea evolved towards the rehabilitation of five regional
offices. The rehabilitation of these buildings became significantly more extensive than
originally intended as laboratory facilities needed full upgrading in line with EU
requirements including upgrading of equipment and accreditation of tests in accordance
to ISO 17025 in order to be able to fulfill their mandate in the food safety sector.

Under APCP Component 1, modifications were made to the Operations Manual in July
2011 to enable Croatian farmers to better access grant funding under the US$2.6 million
Nitrate Mitigation Fund. Due to complex procedures for permits and building
authorizations and poor access to pre-financing from commercial banks, the terms for
farmers were changed in the Manual to reflect an up-front grant disbursement of 55% and
a reduction in processing times from 12 down to 7 months. This led to a dramatic
improvement and full disbursement of grant funding against this activity.

The rest of the sub-components remained substantially the same with minor changes only
to quantities. In the course of project implementation, studies began to show that nitrate
accumulation in Croatian ground waters is in all likelihood more related to excessive
nitrate use, in part as a result of fertilizer subsidies than from livestock. As a response the
Project provided support to Agriculture Faculty in Osijek which has been developing a
simple nitrate monitoring software module to help the Croatian farmers to better estimate
nitrate needs in their soils and reduce long term ground water contamination.

The APCP Components 2 and 3 were substantially delivered as designed.

Component 4 for AACP and APCP was implemented as designed.

1.9 Other significant changes

The project was closely coordinated with EU pre-accession programs with activities
timed to complement each other. Ultimately, the process to accession took several years
longer than intended by the EU which also meant that some support programs that were
to be implemented in a coordinated manner with this project were delayed. Significant
components such as the pre-finance facility had to be dropped altogether due in part to
such a difference from the originally planned timing. As a result the project had to be
very flexible in filling gaps that resulted from some of the delays. The cost overruns in
the PPI laboratory construction and rehabilitation works however largely absorbed these
funds so that the project almost fully disbursed (98.8 percent of loan funds were
disbursed).
                                              9
When the project was restructured in June 2010, much of the resources were reallocated
towards funding of construction of the Plant Protection Institute (PPI) laboratory in
Zagreb and regional veterinary facilities. On the same occasion, the entire project had
been reduced given that the counterpart financing had been dropped and most activities
after restructuring were financed 100 percent from the loan funds. A second reallocation
of resources undertaken along with a project closing date extension for five months in
December 2011 would complete the outstanding works and furnishings of the PPI
laboratory, and the veterinary institute in Rijeka.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

The Government of Croatia needed a substantial support to accelerate its preparedness to
fulfill the implementation requirements for EU accession and to enable its agriculture
sector to capture benefits accruing from the EU accession. The AACP was the first in a
series of projects in the region aiming at supporting the rural institutions to accelerate
their progress along the EU pre-accession/accession path. They were in part developed
due to the realization of the problems the new member states were having in
implementing EU institutional requirements even after accession and the lack of capacity
to administer the very significant financial resources the EU made available to the pre-
accession countries. In the case of Croatia, the project also helped in completing some
activities that had been already identified at the closure of the IBRD financed Farmers
Support Services Project and addressed the institutional gaps that were apparent with
forthcoming EU accession.

The identification mission for this project undertaken in fall of 2004 already defined the
support that the project would provide. An appraisal mission was fielded in May/June
2005 that essentially confirmed the activities recognized at identification. The
preparation team was composed of seasoned specialists from the Bank with significant
local familiarity and Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) support in institutional
development.

The project was in line with government’s intents on EU accession and had broad based
support at the level of the MAFWM but also government overall. Consequently, given the
overall agreement on policy and activities this project supported, there were relatively
few risks attached to the implementation of the project and those were estimated to be
moderate for the most part. The risk that was not foreseen was that the accession could
be significantly delayed and coordinated EU programs could similarly be delayed which
means that the project would have to fill some of the gaps that might emerge during the
project implementation period. Ultimately the institutional arrangements the EU requires
for accession are not so much a matter of if, and how, but much more an issue of when,
given that they also involve significant institutional adjustments with potential political
liabilities. From the Aide memoires, and documents available and discussions of the ICR
team in country, an adequately broad based consultation effort with the client took place
at the design of the project.

Project Preparation Facility - The project was to be substantially prepared from funding
of a Project Preparation Facility (PPF). A number of delays led to lower expenditure than
was projected and the time frame of the PPF was extended by 12 months. The PPF
nonetheless provided vital support to the Ministry in its program for EU integration. PPF
                                            10
resources financed: (i) the appointment of skilled national consultants to the MAFWM
departments supporting EU integration; (ii) the provision of technical assistance in critical
areas of food safety, laboratory design, SAPARD implementation, IPA-RD planning and
Payment Agency (PA) procedures that have enabled the MAFWM to meet EU inspection
requirements. The PPF further supported preparatory studies; (iii) for contracting for the
design and construction for the genetically modified organisms laboratory and design of
the plant protection laboratory; (iv) the procurement of essential office and information
technology (IT) equipment, vehicles and facilities for the SAPARD Management
Authority (MA), the PA and the MAFWM Veterinary Directorate and Sector for Plant
Protection; (v) the processing of policies and procedures in support of the project’s
MAFWM capacity building program, that was to commence at project inception; and (vi)
the establishment of a competent Project Implementation Unit (PIU) including the
introduction of new financial management software.

2.2 Implementation

The AACP project faced significant coordination challenges that were in part due to its
design to fill gaps towards establishing EU compliant institutions in Croatia. Procurement
activities at project start were slow due in part to the understaffing of PIU and to a
significant extent to the project’s broad scope, technical complexity, the lack of
agreement on the actual structure of some institutions that were expected to receive
support from the project and in some cases delayed answers from the Bank to No
Objections requests. Delays were also in part due to the continuous progress in the EU
accession negotiations that led to evolving and sometime changing investment needs.

The project was also affected by elections which brought with them changes in policies
and wholesale restructuring such as the Ministry’s shedding responsibility for water
management, forestry and fisheries in that process. After protracted discussions, and a
series of back and forth as to the location and extent of investments in the sector, it was
agreed to review the whole veterinary laboratory complex in Croatia with a view to
developing a comprehensive strategy for its upgrading and rationalization. This led to the
decision to keep the National Veterinary Institute facilities with minimal investments
while focusing project resources to refurbish and equip the regional veterinary institutes
which also fill the role as reference laboratories.

In regard to establishing Paying Agency, MAFWM management chose to negotiate the
lease/purchase of premises and to use regional Inspection centers for filling of
applications instead of building new regional facilities which led to saving EUR 4.25
million. These resources were instead used to support the development of the LPIS that
lagged behind other activities necessary for the PA Integrated Administration and Control
System (IACS) within EU deadlines. Procurement included IT equipment, software
development, digital orto-photo maps, and specialized surveying and communications
support.

The implementation of the third SAPARD measure - Improved Rural Infrastructure - for
which the project had set aside resources for a guarantee fund, was dropped after several
postponements, and eventual transfer to the IPARD program. This was the result the
delays with the EU’s conferral of management for this SAPARD measure – a process
beyond the project’s control. Due to the need for a new IPARD-based national audit and
accreditation process for this measure, EU conferral of management was not unlikely

                                             11
before second half of 2010, just before the original project completion and it was clear
that the EUR 4 million Guarantee Facility budget was not going to be utilized. Thus it
was agreed to cancel the Facility and reallocate the proceeds to the loan goods category to
cover the costs related to the LPIS and financing of laboratory equipment at regional
veterinary offices.

Ultimately, due to the delays in implementation, the of institutional clarity on key pieces
such as the support to NVI, and at times, long lead times by the Bank to provide ‘no
objections’ (NO), the project was extended twice from the original closing date of
October 31, 2010 to July 31, 2012. The extensions were justified in the context of the
reallocation of the resources away from the guarantee facility to the construction of new
building of PPI laboratory, and the longer than expected overhaul of the food safety
veterinary and sanitary inspection systems and related works and goods procurement.

APCP - Agricultural Pollution Control Project became effective on July 31, 2008 with
engagement of Livestock Nitrates Management Specialist (project coordinator).
Procurement activities in regards to employment of the project staff, advisors and setting
of minimum operational requirements started in September 2008. Documents and
procedures regarding Nitrates Mitigation Fund, representing about 75 percent of grant
funds, were completed and a broad based information campaign was undertaken. In
parallel, a plan was developed for the installation of piezometers and the conceptual
design of a nitrate monitoring software were undertaken before monitoring equipment
was installed. Local agricultural faculties were engaged to make nutrients analyses and
develop simple models for optimizing fertilizer/manure application.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

The AACP project had a very broadly defined PDO which did not adequately reflect the
fact that it played a complementary role alongside ongoing programs funded by the EU to
help the country reach EU accession requirements. While there was a single outcome
indicator that essentially consisted of the successful conclusion of the negotiations of
Croatia’s agricultural chapters with the EU, there were 13 intermediate indicators. Some
of the intermediate indicators had only an indirect link to the PDO objective.

For instance, the indicator dealing with absorption of SAPRD/IPARD funding is
dependent on many variables beyond having a payments system in place. The indicator
reflecting laboratory testing capacity presents a similar case, where Croatia was able to
negotiate with the EU mainly relying on contracts with external accredited laboratories
for much of its plant and plant by-products testing. This practice is perfectly acceptable
from the stand point of EU requirements, but poses a question on the significant
laboratory investments made under this project in GMO and Plant Protection, even
though they do present strengthened local capacity to implement EU food safety
regulations in the future with accreditation processes currently underway.

While most of the intermediary indicators and the overall objective have been
substantially achieved, in part also due to the breadth of their definition, their
achievement was not solely dependent on project activities.

There were substantial delays with M&E implementation. Only in 2010 was an
agreement finally concluded to collect the necessary data to update and maintain the
M&E framework by hiring a consulting firm for this purpose (for AACP). By then, the
                                         12
typical difficulties with establishing a clear baseline before project interventions were
already affecting M&E effectiveness. However, given that in large parts this project dealt
with institutional reforms, the issue with baselines was not so significant.

The data collection and M&E reporting system for the APCP was adequate. The M&E
consultant was hired in 2009 and M&E reports were submitted regularly. Three field
surveys were conducted in 2009, 2011 and the final one in 2012. The surveys provided all
necessary data and helped establish the final assessment of the project indicators (for a
total of some 10 indicators). The most challenging indicator to measure was the second
indicator: “10% reduction in discharge of nutrients? as it lacked precision. Notably,
nutrient levels in surface and ground water while substantially affected by agricultural
practices are not solely the result thereof. Furthermore, changes in the level of nutrients
discharged in surface water take years to be measurable in ground water, and would not
be identifiable within the project duration. The other mostly output indicators dealing
with reduced contamination of surface water were measured and would over time
contribute to a reduction of nutrients in surface and ground water stemming from
agriculture.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Both projects were subject to OP/BP4.01 requiring an Environmental Assessment and
rated as category B. This rating stemmed primarily due to the fact that some construction
works were to be undertaken for institutions and laboratories as well as on private farm
land. Resettlement OP 4.12 was not triggered as no land acquisition was envisaged nor
exercised.

The Bank’s project fiduciary staff, including the Financial Management and Procurement
Specialists, and safeguards staff such as the Environmental Specialist, were located in
country or the region during the whole implementation term of the project. This
arrangement provided for a more continuous implementation support with shorter
response times and more direct interaction with the PIU and project stakeholders.
Implementation issues that arose in this context were addressed promptly and the
counterparts were responsive in its resolution. The biggest difficulties were encountered
with Croatia’s rather complex construction permitting process that led to significant
delays for the construction of manure pits. Given that municipalities play a key role in
permits and land registration, these issues had to be tackled one by one at the local level.
The information campaigns that were held for municipalities led by the 3 regional GEF
coordinators eventually played an important role in resolving these issues in close
cooperation with the safeguards specialists. While there were some difficulties with
timely audit during the implementation of the PPF, once these were resolved, the project
benefitted consistently from unqualified and timely financial audit reports.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

The systems and institutions that were developed and strengthened under the AACP
project are fundamental to Croatia’s accession to the EU and will serve Croatia in
accessing significant resources from the Common Agricultural Policy. As such, the
investments under this project will pay for themselves many times over and are
consequently assured financing from budget resources thus mitigating many of the typical
sustainability risks related to institutional capacity building. Preparedness for EU

                                            13
accession typically means that substantial institutional building needs to take place with
corresponding growing demands on budget resources. Croatia has not been immune to
this reality and compounded by the financial crisis in Europe there is growing pressure on
operating budgets so as to stay within the EU prescribed fiscal deficits envelope. While
Croatia, like most new EU member states, has a relatively sustainable level of public debt
amounting to some 50% of GDP, its budget deficit remains quite high at around 4.5% to
5% of GDP over the past two years due to increasing costs of borrowing and lower tax
revenues and consistently high social expenditures. With reforms that have been
introduced recently, budget deficits are only forecasted to drop slowly over the next few
years according to the IMF. While the country has now managed its formal accession as a
next phase it needs to focus on optimizing the efficiency of the new institutions
established as part of this process. In this context, the Bank is presently implementing a
TA operation to support the government in optimizing the planning and monitoring of its
agricultural and rural development program. This should assist Croatia in optimizing its
absorption capacity of EU funds which has been a problem with most of the recent
accession countries. Similar Bank support has been discussed and agreed in some of the
neighboring new EU member states in the same vein.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The objectives of the project have been highly relevant to Croatia’s path towards EU
accession. EU accession and the necessary competitive and structural adjustments Croatia
needs to make remains the primary policy driver in the agricultural sector today. In
addition to the EU accession agenda, and the need for institutional arrangements that
satisfied EU requirements, the design was influenced to a significant part by the Farmer
Support Services Project (FSSP) that preceded the AACP. This influence was significant
in the decision to support the laboratory investments at the Seed and Seedling Institute
and the Plant Protection Institute that had benefited from Bank support under the previous
project. While the reference capacity for GMO testing and Plant Health are clear
requirements set out in chapter 12 of the EU accession, such testing does not strictly need
to be undertaken in country. However, the overall intent is that the laboratories built
under this project will eventually acquire the necessary accreditation to fill that reference
role to have testing done in Croatia, and in part also by serving neighboring countries as
reference capacity. EU accession and strengthening capacities for the country to
effectively absorb and administer EU funding remains the primary focus of the Banks
ongoing engagement in Croatia.

The GEF project was developed as a result of the requirements for EU accession
countries to adopt the EU Nitrate Directives requiring member countries to reduce
nutrient discharge in rivers and streams and groundwater. The EU also developed a policy
vehicle to support Nitrate reduction with the Good Agricultural Practices, which is a set
of fairly simple and straightforward practices that are in reach of most agricultural
producers to reduce their negative environmental footprint. Given the large area of the
country draining into the Danube, the activities were in line with the Investment Fund for
Nutrient reduction in the Danube and Black Sea Basin and were eminently relevant to the
GEF objectives. The linking of the two projects also offered the option to use the EU
compliant paying mechanisms developed with support of the AACP for the disbursement
of the resources of the GEF.
                                             14
3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives and Global Environment
Objectives

While the PDO indicators have been substantially achieved this can be only partially
attributed to this project alone as previously reflected. Nonetheless, the project provided
for critical pieces in the puzzle that were necessary for Croatia to be able to successfully
negotiate its agricultural chapters as part of EU accession.

AACP Component 1: Moderately Satisfactory
With the big exception of the SAPARD pre-financing facility the activities under the
AACP Component 1 were generally delivered although not necessarily in the proportions
as they had been identified at design. Under IBRD financing effectively a Managing
Authority is active in Croatia that draws up and monitors the results from the
implementation of the annual Rural Development program. A functioning accredited
Paying Agency processes payments in line with IPARD requirements. While fully
functional, the system however suffers from severe capacity problems as less than half of
EU SAPARD allocations could effectively be absorbed. A similar situation prevails with
the capacity to administer IPARD funding. While the guarantee fund was intended to
provide guarantees for municipalities to access credit for the pre-financing of rural
infrastructure activities, the question could be raised on whether rather than eliminating
the guarantee altogether, the guarantee fund objective could have been retargeted so as to
also cover co-financing of SAPARD measures aimed at farmers directly. However, it is
worth nothing that Croatia during the project period also implemented a policy of very
high commodity subsidies (direct payments) which in all likelihood stemmed the demand
for grants and the willingness for farmers to go through a fairly elaborate application
process required by the SAPARD/IPARD programs. Especially small farms with limited
managerial capacity are likely to forego this elaborate application process given that
direct payments require relatively little effort to be obtained. With increasingly tight
government budgets, however, direct payments (for milk for instance) have already
dropped significantly which is likely to drive the demand for investment assistance in the
future.

APCP Component 1: Moderately Satisfactory
A total of some 65 applications were received and 48 investments were made to build
manure platform and pits, as well as some manure spreading equipment to reduce point
source pollution for large livestock farms. The design prescribed fully concrete made
structures, which are expensive to build. Given the cost of the investments, broad
adoption by individual farms on the terms of EU IPARD where 75% of the value of the
investment is self-financed by the farmer and 100% of the investments have to be pre-
financed, is unlikely. It might have been advisable to look at other storage options for
manure and slurry such a steel ceramic, or fiberglass elements, which are quite readily
available and manufactured in a number of the neighboring new EU member states and
could have been demonstrated as cheaper alternatives. Only when the Manual was
modified in July 2011 to allow for an upfront payment of grant funds of 55% and shorter
simplified procedures (fewer on the spot controls, shorter implementation schedule) did
the demand for the grant funding pick up. For comparison, in July 2011, disbursement
stood at 23 percent and by the project closing it reached 100 percent. Also, the small size
of farms with very limited means for investment, the relatively low cost of locally
produced nitrogen fertilizer (from local natural gas) and the fact that manure application
requires substantially more expensive equipment for handling and spreading, the
                                            15
widespread adoption by smaller farms of the types of structures built under this project is
not likely under the current environment. Similarly, the piezometers installed in the
project areas monitoring nitrate level changes in ground water provided inconclusive
results. In part this is due to the fact that the mitigation measures of the project will only
be measurable in ground water after a period of several years.

AACP Component 2: Moderately Satisfactory
The training and capacity building under this component had a varied impact. Clearly the
administrative process, the basic language skills, and user skills of information
technology have significantly improved across the board in the Ministry and affiliated
agencies. However, from discussions with stakeholders, the policy analysis support and
management capacity building has only had moderate impact on policy making. This is
illustrated by the fact that rural development planning remains weak with little apparent
strategic vision to develop programs to help improve the competitiveness of Croatian
agriculture. The AIC on the other hand is a remarkable construction providing a variety of
information from all agricultural sub sectors including information on veterinary and
phytosanitary inspections, borders inspections, FADN information, land use and cropping
data, as well as data from the EU accredited paying system which all provide an excellent
basis for informed policy making. Unfortunately, the vast array of available data remains
to be effectively used to develop an effective agriculture and rural development strategy.

APCP Component 2: Satisfactory
Broad based dissemination of the Code of Good Agricultural Practices was undertaken
and Field Demonstrations were held. The project closing survey seems to reflect a
significant impact of these activities in the project area with some 94% of farms reporting
some type of manure storage. The survey does not go into depth of the type and quality of
storage, there seems to be growing realization that just letting manure run-off the farm
premises is an unacceptable way of manure disposal. There appears to be a growing
recognition of manure as a valuable input and there is a growing awareness and interest in
machinery for spreading manure and slurry. However, application technology especially
for small farms remains manual for the most part, in the winter rather than mechanical
spreading before plowing when the value of manure as fertilizer would be optimized.

AACP Component 3: Satisfactory
The fact that Croatia signed the chapter 11 on Agriculture and Rural Development and
chapter 12 (Food safety, veterinary and phytosanitary policy) demonstrates the progress
the country has made during the project implementation. These are challenging chapters
that required a wholesale reform of the food supply chain including concepts of
traceability, risk analysis and assessment, the introduction of Hazard Analysis of Critical
Control Points (HACCP/ISO 9000) at the level of food processors and food handling
facilities. The main efforts went to building capacity at regional veterinary offices
including laboratories, supporting the mandate of the Croatia Food Safety Agency in
undertaking its analysis of mycotoxins in fodder and dry food products, trainings and
information systems for inspection services linked to the AIC and laboratories to help
improve real time reporting. While as mentioned previously this development cannot be
attributed to this project alone, its targeted investments in closing existing gaps of the
agricultural payment and food safety systems made the closure of these chapters possible.




                                             16
APCP Component 3: Moderately Satisfactory

This component was to substantially integrate the lessons from APCP activities into
greater agricultural policy making to help the country achieve the EU environmental
requirements for agriculture. While awareness campaigns and demonstrations were held,
the Croatian Agricultural Extension Institute (CAEI) never really developed into an
effective advocate of environmental measures in agriculture. Extension services in
Croatia remain weak and largely disconnected from farmers as their primary clientele.
For instance, the application of (locally produced cheap) nitrogen fertilizer is still broadly
advocated instead of making better use of organic fertilizer (manure/slurry) which would
also reverse some of the mineralization and loss of topsoil that has taken place over the
past 50 years as documented by the Osijek Agricultural Faculty. Nevertheless, the
demonstration fields and the accompanying research for fertilizing optimization have
generated significant interest by larger farmers who are increasingly adopting nutrient
planning techniques disseminated under the project. Though all the component activities
were delivered and key indicators met with the above caveat related to extension capacity,
the impact is assessed as moderately satisfactory.

3.3 Efficiency

The Project Appraisal Document (PAD) of the AACP derived its economic benefits
primarily from investments in rural public infrastructure where the grant facility would
have played a major role. Since the measure to support this type of investment never
obtained conferral of management from the EU and the guarantee fund to help
municipalities to access credit for these activities was cancelled as a result, the
assumptions defined in the PAD of the AACP project do not hold and cannot be a basis
for before and after project comparison. No Financial Rate of Return (FRR) or Economic
Rate of Return (ERR) had been calculated at the project preparation.

The project focused its investments on capacity building of public institutions to improve
Agricultural Paying systems transparency and traceability as well as the capacity to
absorb EU funds from SAPARD initially and IPARD later, and the implementation of the
CAP in the future. A second objective has been to strengthen public institutions mandated
to implement Food Safety thus opening the doors to food stuff export to the EU.

Benefit streams: The project contributed to developing the platform from which Croatia
can access substantial EU CAP funds and provides the basis for open trade of food stuff
with the EU. As such the project provided the potential to yield large benefits streams
from the investments made. However, these streams will not be the sole result of this
project but from a number of interventions including most importantly the EU. Given the
difficulty in separating the various investments from the various donors supporting
Croatia’s successful negotiations of Chapters 11 and 12, no quantitative analysis has been
made of the benefit streams.

Cost effectiveness: The project in many ways filled gaps where national resources or EU
funding were not programmed for a specific task necessary for negotiations of the EU
agricultural chapters. As such the project was highly complementary in its investment
contributing to a greater whole that brings more benefits than the sum of its individual
parts. The investments to set up the LPIS which was a critical piece for accreditation of


                                             17
the paying systems for rural development from the EU as part of Chapter 11 negotiations
are a good example of this situation.

Unit costs: It generally appears that works and goods investments generally fell in the
regional averages for similar works and products in the region.

APCP benefits streams: The project identified reducing nutrient pollution of the Black
Sea as the main benefit of the project. This was to be achieved from improved farming
practices that would lead to annual reduction of dissolved nutrients flowing into the Black
Sea at 20 kg/ha N and 2.5 kg/ha P mainly from animal origin. It was assumed that
through improved storage and handling, half of the manure would be prevented from
being flushed into the river systems and hence into the Black Sea. After 10 years, if sixty
percent of the farmers in the project area adopted similar practices, then the estimated
annual reduction of pollutants flowing into the Black Sea would be significant. It is also
notable that with further study undertaken as part of the project, only about 30% of the
nitrate accumulation can be traced back to livestock. Heavy nitrogen fertilizer use
seemingly plays a larger role than estimated at project design.

The project also assumed that project's public awareness campaign, field trials and
workshops, even farmers from adjoining areas would adopt the environmentally friendly
agricultural practices, and result in a larger impact under the project. The survey
undertaken in April 2012 confirms that 94 percent of the farmers interviewed adopted a
practice that lead to a reduction in the nutrient loads promoted under the project.

For the Incremental Cost Analysis a baseline scenario assumed costs from a variety of
projects financed by a number of donors amounting to some US$18.4 million and GEF
would provide increment of some US$ 6.00 million towards achieving Global
Environmental Benefits. The assumption was that the investments themselves would
only have a limited impact on water quality, but that the IPARD approximating measures
developed under the GEF project would become integral part of implementing the EU
CAP and thus have a large multiplier effect.

Cost Effectiveness: The choice of design for manure pits and platforms made entirely of
concrete was in all likelihood not the most cost effective. As mentioned above, given the
high level grant financing on what are relatively larger farms, the project should have
used the opportunity to introduce alternative, lower cost technologies that would have a
better chance of being readily adopted. Nonetheless, unit cost rates for construction
overall remained within the range considered normal in the Western Balkan region in
spite of substantial permit processes and quite stringent building requirements.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome and Global Environment Outcome Rating

Moderately Satisfactory: The AACP substantially delivered on the rather tall order it
defined at design even if it needs to be recognized that many of the indicators and
parameters met cannot be exclusively attributed to the project. On the flip side, some of
the indicators that were not met were also not just caused by the project such as for
instance the low absorption of SAPARD/IPARD funding processed through the Croatian
Paying Agency. With the elimination of SAPARD Pre-finance Facility, substantial
resources were reallocated and made available to invest into activities that were envisaged
to cost less at project design. Though the PDO has been achieved it cannot be attributed
solely to the project activities.
                                            18
Similarly, Moderately Satisfactory rating is for the GEF-funded APCP. Most activities
were delivered and indicators met, though only after some revisions were introduced to
the application terms for the Nitrate Mitigation Fund. Nonetheless, as reflected previously,
most of the project indicators were substantially met and the overall objective of meeting
EU accession criteria were satisfied.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

The project did not have and is not expected to result in substantial changes in poverty or
gender roles and access. However, with EU accession and CAP policy application, there
will be an increasing pressure to favor larger more sustainable family farms. Increasingly,
rural development policy will have to find mechanisms to finance social objectives by
other means than by the agricultural incentives budget. This will lead to the slow
disappearance of subsistence farming in favor of land consolidation and emergence of
larger commercial farms. Programs coordinated between Agriculture and Rural
Development and social affairs filling in the assistance gap currently provided by
indiscriminate direct payments will have to be introduced to manage the social
transformation that this change will produce as observed in other new accession countries.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

As previously reflected, the institutional changes supported by the project fit into the
broader framework necessary for EU accession. These institutions supported by the
project activities will in the future need to report to supra national bodies such as the
European Food Safety Agency, the EU FADN to help formulate and adjust CAP policy,
against which Croatia will receive substantial cohesion funding. This funding mechanism
will ensure that these institutions will have adequate resources to ensure functioning.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

There are not really any unintended outcomes from the project, as it primarily deals with
institutions that have specific functions in a country on the threshold of joining the EU.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

A project closing survey was held as part of the APCP. Discussions with beneficiaries
and institutions in the field reflect an overwhelmingly positive impression and
satisfaction with the project outcomes and achievements. The results of field operations
and achievements were presented and discussed during the regional APCP conference in
Zagreb held from May 31 to June 1, 2012. Survey results are attached in Annex 5.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome and Global Environment Outcome

Moderate: The institutional changes supported by this project fit into the broader
framework necessary for EU accession and membership. The institutions that were
supported under the AACP will in the future need to report to supra national bodies such
as the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA), the EU FADN to help formulate and adjust
CAP policy, against which Croatia will receive substantial cohesion funding. This
funding mechanism will ensure that the institutions supported by the project will have the
                                           19
adequate resources to function and fulfill their mandate. The GEF investments need also
to be seen in the bigger context of EU accession and especially the requirement for
member countries to adopt the EU Water Directives that specify norms on water use and
quality and have stemmed reforms to reduce pollution in all member countries. The
reduction in pollution from agriculture is enshrined in Croatia’s Code of Good
Agricultural Practices and the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) which emphasize
measures to mitigate pollution from agriculture. Funding for environmental measures in
agriculture is therefore assured.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry: Satisfactory

The project was prepared as a follow on to an ongoing agricultural project in Croatia
(FSSP). Several preparation visits were undertaken with an adequate representation of
technical specialties. This offered a good basis for knowledge of the sector and its
institutions but may have at times also have influenced certain decision as to the extent of
investments in laboratories and other facilities that might have had more scrutiny if the
counterpart agency had been relatively less familiar. Conversely, the project’s
investments built capacity beyond the strict requirements of the EU for testing, and also
provide a platform from where research in the sector may also provide the opportunity to
boost agricultural productivity over time. The project activities and the results framework
in spite of some conceptual weaknesses correlated with the PDOs in the case of both
IBRD and GEF financing.

(b) Quality of Supervision: Moderately Satisfactory

All together there were four different Task Team Leaders which led to a lack of
continuity in supervision though the country based staff maintained contact with the client.
In its later phases the project was twice restructured to accommodate the changes in
financing priorities, and disbursements improved dramatically. While there were some
delays in the early part of the project with auditing, the problems were resolved in the
second year. There were no fiduciary issues in subsequent years of projects’
implementation.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance: Moderately Satisfactory

There were some delays in the Bank’s responsiveness to the client’s requests for no
objection. However, the country office staff kept the “ball rolling? in spite of sometimes
poor responsiveness by the Washington based TTL in the mid part of the project
implementation period. Due to pressures to disburse, with a new TTL on board in
January 2010 restructuring and reallocations of funds became swift and major loan
portions were reallocated to works and equipment which improved project performance
and disbursements considerably.

5.2 Borrower Performance

(a) Government Performance: Moderately Satisfactory

                                             20
Although there have been a number of changes in government with a number of new
Ministers, overall the project benefitted from fairly consistent support. However, the
Ministry did not always fully seize the opportunities that the project provided to adjust its
policies towards more fiscal sustainability, better targeting of its agricultural support, and
more environmentally sustainable farming practices.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance: Satisfactory

The Implementation team was very pro-active and it is in large part responsible for the
overall positive outcomes achieved under the two projects.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance: Moderately
Satisfactory

While there have been several changes in Ministerial counterparts, and uncertainty in
institutional policy defining the layout of the various institutions which led to some
delays, the projects’ activities were always seen as priority by the government.

6. Lessons Learned

Timing of EU Pre-Accession and Accession process. When defining broad objectives as
a partner to implement activities such as EU accession negotiations, the Bank has little
control on timing and in phasing its activities requiring a very flexible implementation
approach where procurement often fills immediate needs that may not have been fully
identified at project preparation. The EU Accession process is affected by many variables
that are beyond the reach of the client Country, and often takes longer than the typical
Bank project timeframe. To that effect, the willingness of the Bank to extend the project
closing date and adjust the procurement plan to better reflect the client Country EU
requirements during implementation makes it a valuable partner and provides continuity
to the client Country who has to absorb all the TA and capacity that is being provided by
the EU and other donors as part of the process.

Investments in Laboratory facilities for compliance with EU Food Safety requirements.
This project as most projects of this sort supporting EU pre-accession invested very
substantial portions of the funding in building government owned national reference
testing capacity. The capacity of a country to certify its food production is a requirement
for export to the EU. The question could be posed however whether these investments do
not often go beyond the requirements of the EU. While having systems in place to ensure
the safety of food products is necessary, this capacity for testing can also be contracted
with accredited laboratories beyond the national borders. In the region, for instance, road
and transport infrastructure is relatively good with good communications and countries
are relatively small in size, the building of laboratory capacity could be envisaged at a
regional level in a network of accredited laboratories accepted as reference by a number
of countries. Such an arrangement could potentially have saved significant resources for
each country. This point is particularly well illustrated with the GMO laboratory that has
substantial overcapacity relative to the demand for Plant material GMO testing in the
country. At the very least, such facilities should be proposed based on a feasibility study
or business plan that goes beyond the mandate by the EU for reference capacity and also


                                             21
look at local demand for such testing. Of course, this touches on the issues of national
sovereignty which have aspects beyond the simple economic rational of such investments.

Investments for mitigation of environmental pollution measures in agriculture depend
on public support and incentives and minimum farm size. While switching from mineral
and synthetic fertilizer to better using organic fertilizer especially in farms with
significant livestock holding makes sense economically, it only does so under the right
circumstances. In higher income countries, when farms are very small and fragmented
the cost in labor and time of spreading manure might be prohibitive relative to applying
small quantities of mineral fertilizers. In larger farms with larger parcels the benefit
might be greater, but then depends on very substantial capital investments in
manure/slurry storage and equipment for proper application. These investments in most
countries only take place with a targeted support and adequate information programs.
Such programs however can only make sense on farms of a certain minimum size leaving
out subsistence farmers with numerous fragmented parcels where applying a few kilos of
fertilizer is a lot easier than loading, hauling and spreading several tons of manure in
different locations.

Importance of Coordination and Partnership. Partnering with other donor organizations
such as the EU, FAO, GEF and Dutch Embassy proved to be highly beneficial for the
country and ensured that aid coordination across a common objective to help Croatia
meet the EU accession agenda in the agricultural sector and satisfy the necessary
institutional arrangements. The EU accession agenda, successful partnership with other
donors and strengthening capacities for the country to effectively absorb and administer
EU funding remain the primary focus of the Bank’s ongoing engagement in Croatia. This
approach has a great potential to be replicated in other neighboring countries aspiring for
EU membership. Despite complex administrative procedures and substantial coordination
by all partners, the end results are worth the effort. In the case of Croatia, in spite of
imminent accession, the partnership of the Bank in consort with the EU remains in
demand to assist it towards more effective and efficient administration of the vast
resources and responsibilities that result from EU membership.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

The Borrower submitted to the Bank its Implementation Completion Report in September
2012 together with the Beneficiary Survey Results for the GEF-funded APCP. The survey
results and report are presented in Annex 5 and Annex 7 respectively.

The PIU staff sent a note dated January 18, 2013 stating that they confirm that the text in
final version of the document satisfactorily describes the activities and that the overall
ratings and evaluation are acceptable to them.

(b) Cofinanciers:

No specific comment was received from the representatives of the Dutch Embassy in
Zagreb. During project implementation, they always expressed a great satisfaction with
the project activities as reported in the mission Aide Memoires.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

As reflected earlier in the text, the project financed a number of activities necessary
for the Croatia to successfully complete IPARD compliant paying system, and
restructure its food safety infrastructure in line with EU requirements so as to be able
to successfully negotiate Chapters 11 and 12 of the EU Aquis Communautaire. This
meant that project financing was complementary to a number of ongoing activities to
achieve this objective.

Under the IBRD financed component 1 Strengthening Capacity for Absorbing EU
Financial Assistance in Agriculture - The EC Enlargement Strategy and Main
Challenges 2008-2009 confirmed the defined key elements for the accession
negotiations in Chapter 11: setting up the Paying Agency and establishing an
integrated administration and control system (IACS) including a land parcel
identification system (LIPS). Further to need for urgently strengthening Paying
Agency, and building an EU compliant Payment System for EU SAPARD fund
management with work on the development of IACS including LPIS additional
activities were included in CAAC Project. The Project has supported these
milestones through three major activities that were additionally added in line with the
necessity of immediate action towards the EU requirements on LPIS: Supply and
Installation of application software package (LPIS software); technical services for
the services of producing Digital Orthophoto Maps (DOP 5) and Geodetic – Cadastral
services for production of the Digital cadastral maps. The component development
objective is reached applying a flexible approach where a number of activities
originally envisaged were dropped and new ones added. Project activities were
aligned with the EU delegation in Zagreb in order to avoid overlapping of financial
sources. The Project has contributed substantially to the EU accreditation of MoA’s
Paying Agency and the establishment of the LPIS and IACS. The Pilot SAPARD
Pre-finance Facility and accompanying Regulation/Directive on implementation of
SAPARD in 2008 (3rd SAPARD Measure integrated in IPARD) led to significant
redirecting of funds towards supporting the LPIS, a crucial element in transparent area
based payment systems.

Today, Croatia has an accredited Paying system for IPARD funding that will also
process CAP funds upon accession, farm level statistical data is regularly collected
from a functioning FADN system, the staff of the Paying Agency have been trained
and equipped and an Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS) with a
Land and Parcel Information System (LPIS) to handle area payments (direct
payments) is in place and functioning according to EU requirements and reflected in
the successful negotiations of Chapter 11 of the Aquis Communautaire.

Under the GEF financed component 1 Mitigating Nutrient Loads to water Bodies
from Point-Source Pollution - Despite difficult financial conditions and long lasting
structural crisis in the Croatian agriculture, the project successfully motivated and
engaged group of more than 60 farmers with their application to the Nitrates
Mitigation Investment Fund created under the project. Due to low initial demand 48
projects were contracted on the basis of 25% farmer’s financial contribution in the
very late parts of the project. The Support for Water and Soil Monitoring and Impact
Analysis funded the construction of 30 sets of water analysis stations (piezometers)
that will become part of future Croatia waters control network. These activities
significantly contributed to achieving of the Project outcome targets and contributed
to a full disbursement of grant funds (99.85 percent).

Under the IBRD financed component 2 Empowerment of MAFWM Administration
and Management - Significant Project contribution to staff capacity building
program, financed primarily through the Dutch Grant has enabled MoA staff to
accelerate and deepen its interactions with the EU counterparts by supporting their
participation at numerous Agriculture Acquis related workshops, training events and
short- and long-term graduate study scholarships. Through the Grant Funds a broader
impact was achieved with the standardized European Computer Driving License
training program and foreign language training in parallel. The Amendment to the
Grant Agreement provided short-term financing and training of farmers in the country
and abroad through various forms of training for members of associations of
agricultural producers. The broader framework for all forms of education co-financed
was harmonization of national legislation in area of agriculture with the EU acquis as
well as its sustainable development, and preparation of farmers for EU membership
and the application of the Common Agricultural Policy. The Grant facilitated the
participation in lectures, round tables, conferences, workshops, courses and seminars
in the field of Agriculture and Rural Development, organized by relevant experts,
organizations and institutions in Croatia and the European Union.

The loan funded overall MoA’s ICT (major activities: Implementation of the MAFRD
Data Centre (Refurbishment, installation and implementation); Supply and
Installation of Design, developing and implementation of Veterinary Science IS and
Design, developing and implementation of Phytosanitary sector IS) has provided an
advanced institutional level hardware platform as well as software solutions for the
most demanding EU reporting obligations thus reaching the development objective.

Further to the alignment of the Croatian agricultural support system with the acquis
the Project has contributed to Croatia’s negotiations in the areas related to
strengthening of the administrative managements capacities and supporting a number
of EU policies trainings as well as establishing the farm accountancy data network
(FADN). All activities within this component were successfully finished.

Under the IBRD financed component 3 Ensuring Safe Food and Sanitary and
Phytosanitary Conditions - In 2008 the institutional framework for food safety
management in Croatia required further alignment with the EU requirements related
to Chapter 12. The role of Competent Authority for the management of food safety
was assigned to MoA, and the Croatian Food Agency (CFA) was made responsible
for food risk assessment. Project investments have enabled the newly established CFA
to acquire the basic capacities necessary for performing its risk assessment functions.
Through project supported activities EU compatible Rapid Alert system for Food and
Feed (CRO-RASF system) is developed and established on national level in order to
enable MoA to meet its international reporting obligations and perform its consumer
protection functions. In the area of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in line
with the adoption of implementing legislation relating to conditions for laboratories
involved in testing, control and monitoring, the Project financed the construction of
the GMO laboratory. The GMO laboratory is fully operational using ISTA-certified
tests. The project supported the path of veterinary sector with the adoption of
implementing legislation through refurbishing and equipping NVI regional institutes.
All 4 regional NVI laboratories are operational and using ISO 17025 certified tests.
Strengthening the capacity of phytosanitary and agricultural inspections was
additionally equipped by Project funds enabling better mobility and communication
on the field. Financially most valuable project investment is the construction of Plant
Protection Institute building that has been completed with accreditation to follow. All
activities within this component were successfully finished.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
(including assumptions in the analysis)

Financial and Economic Analysis of the IBRD and Dutch TF financed Acquis
Cohesion Project - Component 1 of the CACP project facilitated the government’s
access to a total of Euro 14.5 million in EU SAPARD/IPARD funds between 2007
and 2012. Unfortunately, like many of its peers before accession, Croatia only
absorbed a small portion of the resources that were made available to it under these
programs. Fortunately, the benefits from the system developed under the project are
not ending with IPARD’s closure and accession. As Croatia becomes a full-fledged
member, assuming a continuation of current CAP policies under the European
Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, Croatia is expected to receive over 300
million Euro per year. It can be concluded that the project with a relatively modest
investment of just short of Euro 11.00 million under this component with its support
to establishing an EU compliant paying system offers potential yearly returns nearly
30 times greater than the original combined IBRD and Dutch TF investments under
the project. While indeed the establishment of the paying system cannot solely be
credited to the project, the potential benefits stream they offer over the coming years
generate a rate of return many times greater than the minimum 12% required for Bank
investments.

Component 2 of the CACP project contributed to maintaining open access to the
EU market for Croatian agricultural produce and processed goods. The value of
Croatian agricultural exports of agricultural products to the EU is estimated at some
170.00 million Euro per year. In order to maintain this export value Croatia just as
any country wanting to export to the EU Croatia had to adopt EU compliant food
safety standards. While the country remains a net importer of agricultural produce
from the EU, the application of EU standards keeps the EU market open to Croatian
products and offers the potential for growth with increasing farm productivity that is
likely to result from consolidation into larger farms as promoted by the CAP.

Financial and Economic Assumptions of the GEF activities implemented under the
project The original economic analysis estimated an average cost for constructing an
above-ground manure storage facility is about 1,350 EUR per Livestock Unit (LU).
Assuming a usage period of 30 years, the average annual depreciation cost is 45 EUR
per LU. With an opportunity cost of capital of 6 % per year, the annual opportunity
cost would be EUR 81 per LU, giving an annual financial cost of around 126 EUR per
LU.

One LU annually excretes about 85 kg of nitrogen (N), of which about 35 % is lost
into soil/water due to improper manure storage. The value of 1 kg of nitrogen as
fertilisers is about EUR 0.6 Assuming 30 kg of preventable nitrogen loss, the annual
benefit would be about 18 EUR.

Similarly to nitrogen, the prevention of P2O5 loss into water also bears an economic
value both for the farmer and for society. An average LU in Croatia annually excretes
about 47 kg P2O5. Assuming a loss of 35 % due to improper manure storage, there is a
loss of 16.5 kg P2O5 per year, which, if purchased as fertilized at an average price of
EUR 0.51 per kg of P2O5 would cost EUR 15.2/LU/year. With estimated externalities
for production and distribution of 0.11 EUR per kg of P2O5 and an external cost of 15


                                          37
EUR for each kg of P2O5 causing P2O5 concentration in water above the MAC, the
annual value of the prevented externalities is 125 EUR per LU per year.

The average annual excretion of K2O per LU in Croatia is 63 kg. With an average
estimated loss of 35 % from the manure heaps, the annual K2O load into soil/water
per LU is 22 kg. To recover this, farmers would have to invest 11 EUR in K 2O
fertilisers. Assuming that 50 % of the lost K2O would raise K2O concentration in
water above the MAC with an external cost of 8.2 EUR per kg K2O and an additional
external cost of 0.11 EUR for each kg of produced and distributed K2O, the total
value of K2O generated external costs are EUR 93 per LU per year.

By investing in this impervious manure storage systems, farmers would incur an
annual charge of EUR 126/annum, while generating a benefit of about EUR
38/LU/year (EUR 15 for N, EUR 8 for P2O5 and EUR 11 for K2O). From the farmer’s
perspective, therefore, it is more cost effective to buy these nutrients as fertiliser then
through investment in a manure heap. A 75 % subsidy from Government for manure
storage construction, however, makes manure storage cost neutral for the farmer.
From the societal perspective, however, the value of the associated environmental
damage and public investments is about EUR 244/LU/year, which is double the
annual cost of the proposed measure and fully justifies public investment in manure
storage.

The average cost for establishing green manure /undersowing (sowing a green crop
between rows of corn for instance) is estimated at EUR 130/ha. Besides preventing
nutrient losses, these measures have several other environmental and agronomic
benefits, including improved soil structure, increased soil microbiological activity,
etc., all generating yield benefits for subsequent crops estimated at EUR 65/ha or
50 % of establishment cost. The average Croatian nitrogen loss to water in the period
2001-2003 derived from farming is estimated at 71 kg nutrients per ha of arable land.
Assuming the same leaching level in the three pilot regions and that the proposed N-
reduction measures on arable land would prevent 60 % of N leaching, this would
result in a reduction of 43 kg nutrients per ha (37 kg /N/ha and 6kg /K2O/ha). Using
the same price for these nutrients as for manure storage, the financial value to farmers
of the prevented nutrient loss is EUR 22/ha, however, the value of the accompanying
external costs is EUR 55/ha. Since the cost of the measure for the farmer is about
three times higher than the benefit (EUR 65/ha vs. EUR 22/ha) an argument exists for
farmers to receive an agri-environment subsidy of about EUR 43/ha, which is nearly
the same as the value of the external cost for society (EUR 55/ha).

Assuming that the logic of the original estimate used at project preparation of the
APCP per Livestock Unit (LU) largely stands, the calculation omits the costs related
to application and transport of manure that affect its economic outcome. While
indeed manure given that it is produced directly on site, incurs little transportation
costs, its efficient application requires equipment or time that costs significantly more
than is the case of mineral fertilizer application. The cost of acquiring this equipment,
along with the fragmented nature of most small farms are likely key reasons
preventing broad based adoption of manure and slurry storage by smaller farms unless
there is also a significant subsidy towards handling and spreading equipment. To get
more widespread adoption it will be critical to communicate to farmers that the
requirements laid down in the EU Nitrates and other Directives protecting water


                                            38
bodies from an excessive load of nutrients contain much more than a simple analysis
on nutrient costs.

For the Incremental Cost Analysis a baseline scenario was assumed costs from a
variety of projects financed by a number of donors amounting to some US$18.4
million and GEF would provide increment of some US$ 6.00 million towards
achieving Global Environmental Benefits. The assumption was that the investments
themselves would only have a limited impact on water quality, but that the IPARD
approximating measures developed under the GEF project would become integral part
of implementing the EU CAP and thus have a large multiplier effect.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

Introduction

Within the Agricultural Pollution Control Project a research was conducted through a
questionnaire for farmers. This is a third research of this kind conducted within the
APCP project with the goal to obtain feedback on results of the efforts made towards
the implementation of Good agricultural practice (hereinafter referred to as GAP) and
raising public awareness. The research goals were also to track progress towards
project’s indicators.

The questionnaire was conducted within the whole territory of the Republic of Croatia
with the assistance of the Croatian Agricultural Chamber (hereinafter referred to as
the CAC) which distributed the questionnaire, collected it and forwarded for
processing to the Paying Agency in agriculture, fisheries and rural development
(hereinafter referred to as PAAFRR).

Methodology

For evaluation, processing and obtaining of measurable results were used the MS
Office and application for relational database in the MS Access in order to obtain
statistical and mathematical (numerical) reports comparable with further researches. A
new database in Croatian language was created in the MS Access with simple table
structure, in accordance with the conducted questionnaire. During the database design
phase specific answers given in the textual form were grouped in accordance with the
respondents’ answers. The processing of questionnaires was made on the basis of
simple mathematical questions for completed tables using SQL (Structural Query
Language) supported by the MS Access. Mathematical questions included counting,
addition and some statistical questions like filtration and average. During the
processing of data from the questionnaire, 34 queries were given in order to obtain
desired information.

Analysis and statistics

The biggest number of respondents was in project counties: Osje?ko-baranjska,
Varaždinska and Vukovarsko-srijemska by 10% compared by other counties of the

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

Agriculture Acquis Cohesion Project

The objective of the project is to develop sustainable systems and capacities within
the MAFWM to ensure timely compliance with EU acquis conditions in the rural
sector.

Project Purpose: to develop sustainable systems and capacities within the MoA to
ensure timely compliance with EU Acquis conditions in the agricultural & rural sector,
including:

(i) increased transparency, accountability, innovation and participation in the design
and implementation of MoA 's rural development program ; (ii) strengthened MoA
management, technical and policy analysis and design capacity ; and (iii) a levelled
and more competitive milieu for national and international food producers and traders
in Croatia’s domestic and export markets.

Agriculture Pollution Control Project

Global Environmental Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
The development objective of the project is to significantly increase the use of
environmentally friendly agricultural practices by farmers in Croatia's Pannonian
plain in order to reduce nutrient discharge from agricultural sources to surface and
ground water bodies.

Situation at Appraisal

Agriculture Acquis Cohesion Project (from Project Appraisal Document)
Agriculture Sector

Croatia has a diverse agricultural resource base, with the capacity to produce most
continental crop and livestock products, plus many Mediterranean crops. Soil fertility
and climate are suitable for agriculture, and in areas such as eastern Slavonia the yield
potential is equivalent to the major agricultural areas of the EU. With 0.73 ha of
agricultural land and 0.34 ha of arable land per capita, Croatia also has
proportionately more farmland than the EU (0.36 agricultural land ha/capita) and most
of the other countries in eastern and central Europe.

Small, private farms dominate production, owning approximately two-thirds of all
agricultural land (2.09 million ha), and 85% of all livestock (measured as livestock
equivalents). Production is very low by western European standards however, due to
small farm size (average 3 ha), a high level of fragmentation and limited use of
modern technology. Marketed surplus is also low, with most production consumed on
the farm. As a result of these factors, only 15% of farm households relied solely on
farming for their livelihoods in 2003 (2003 Census). Large, socially owned agro-
kombinats (AK’s) and agricultural cooperatives farm the remaining 1.07 million ha.
Although the AK’s use more modern, capital-intensive management systems and
obtain higher levels of production, their output and productivity are still well below

                                           60
production levels in Western Europe. Traditionally, the AK’s have also dominated
agricultural markets through their vertically and horizontally integrated processing
and marketing subsidiaries; and together with the co-operatives, they were the major
source of farm inputs. They are also a powerful influence on agricultural policy,
seeking to preserve the high levels of protection and support they received during the
socialist era. Thus, while the AK’s account for less than 20% of total output, they
have historically dominated agricultural sector policy and agricultural markets.
The transition to a modern, market-oriented agricultural economy requires reform of
both components of this dual structure of agriculture. The competitiveness of small,
private farms must be increased through policies and programs to facilitate: farm
consolidation and enlargement, the adoption of more modern management systems
and an increase in production and marketed surplus. A parallel re-structuring of the
AK’s is also needed, based on privatization, disaggregation and more efficient
management. Commodity and factor markets also need reform. Competitive
commodity markets must replace the regional processing and marketing monopsonies
created by the AK’s, and the markets for land and capital need to be strengthened.
These are the challenges that the Croatian agriculture sector has faced since it began
economic reform following independence in 1990.

Following negotiation of a Stabilization and Association Agreement with the EU in
2002, Croatian accession to the EU was confirmed in April 2004, with the principles,
priorities and conditions for accession described in European Council Decision
COM(2004) 275 on European Partnership with Croatia.                  Accordingly, the
Government of Croatia is actively working to meet the requirements of the Decision,
which will enable the country to comply with EU requirements and obligations as laid
down in the acquis communautaire. Towards this, the Government faces substantial
challenges, particularly in the agricultural and rural sectors, that have been deeply
affected by the tumultuous years of the past decade where, inter alia, war and
diplomatic isolation from Western Europe inhibited structural adjustment and
agricultural growth.

Compliance efforts with the EU acquis in agriculture and rural development provide
an excellent opportunity to the Croatian government to streamline the various
piecemeal, ad hoc policies and programs currently being implemented by the different
branches of Government. The EU compliance process will also help the government
to better define priorities and put in place appropriate, revised or new measures using
a transparent, consultative approach (whereby relevant stakeholders at the local,
regional and central levels are actively involved), in accordance with EU
environmental safeguards.

Existing World Bank commitments will, in particular, support improved agricultural
competitiveness together with the associated land reform, while medium term EU
support will focus on aspects of rural development and legislation harmonization.

Agriculture Pollution Control Project

Croatia is committed to improving water quality and reducing nutrient pollution over
its entire territory as agreed under the Danube River and Black Sea Conventions and
is in the process of negotiating its EU accession agreements for the Nitrates and Water
Framework Directives.


                                          61
Although a substantial endeavor is underway in policy, institutional and
environmental reform in the agriculture sector, as outlined above, there remains a
significant unfinished and under-financed government agenda, in particular to reduce
nutrient loads to Croatian water bodies from agricultural sources as well as to put in
place an accredited AE Program. The positive evolution in attitude regarding
agriculture and the environment is encouraging and creates a favorable momentum for
the introduction of the proposed GEF measures that would reduce nutrient discharge
to surface and groundwater in the Pannonian plain.

Agriculture Pollution Control Project

Project development objective and key indicators

The proposed GEF project objective reinforces the development objective of the
IBRD financed Agriculture Acquis Cohesion Project (AACP) that aims at
“developing sustainable systems and capacities within the MoA to ensure timely
compliance with EU acquis conditions in the rural sector?. Towards this, AACP aims
at, inter alia, (i) building capacity for MoA support for sustainable, competitive
agriculture in Croatia compliant with EU acquis requirements: (ii) establishing a
transparent and efficient payment system for the disbursement of GEF-financed and
subsequent government grants for structural reform in the agri-environment sector;
(iii) reorganizing and reinforcing government inspection services supporting
environment regulations and (iv) providing project management. GEF funds will
provide incremental support for nutrient management activities in the agricultural
sector to assist the country comply with the requirements of the EU Nitrates Directive
and thereby assist the government in not only establishing a competitive agricultural
sector but also assist it with honoring its international commitments to improve the
waters of the Danube River and Black Sea.

The development objective of the project is to significantly increase the use of
environmentally friendly agricultural practices by farmers in Croatia’s Pannonian
plain in order to reduce nutrient discharge from agricultural sources to surface and
ground water bodies. In support of this, the project will assist the Government of
Croatia to: (i) promote mitigating measures for nutrient reduction from agricultural
sources to surface and ground water bodies (manure management); (ii) implement a
national Agri-environment policy (Code of Good Agricultural Practices); and (iii) a
public awareness campaign that would disseminate the benefits of project activities
with the aim towards replication at the national and regional levels.

Project Global Environmental Objectives: The global environmental objective of the
project is to reduce the discharge of nutrients into waters draining into the Danube
River and Black Sea. The project will provide an opportunity for the GEF to be a
catalyst for actions to bring about the successful introduction and widespread
adoption of integrated improved land and water resource management practices. GEF
support will help reduce costs and barriers to farmers adopting improved and
sustainable agricultural practices. It will also help develop mechanisms to move from


                                         63
demonstration level activities to operational projects that reduce non-point nutrient
pollution to the Danube River and Black Sea.

Key indicators included:
(iii)  At least 40% of the farming population in the project areas adopting
preventive and remedial measures to reduce nutrient discharges;
(iv)   At least a 10% reduction in discharge of nutrients into surface and
groundwater in the three project regions;
(v)    Increased national awareness of linkages between local actions and impact on
water nutrient load.

Outcomes envisaged under the project include, inter alia, improvement in soil and
water quality, increased awareness of environmental issues in agro-industry and
among farmers, increased number of farmers adopting mitigation measures and an
increased area of agricultural land using resource conservation technologies.

Main Project Beneficiaries

The key beneficiaries of the AACP Project are the MAFWM and associated
institutions: Croatian Agriculture Extension Institute (CAEI), Croatia Food Agency
(CFA), National Veterinary Institute (NVI), Platnt Protection Institute (PPI) and
Seeds and Seedlings Institute (SSI).

The key beneficiaries of the APCP Project are the MAFWM and associated

           9 Development of regionally structured veterinary and phytosanitary
              inspection services supported by investments in staff capacity building,
              transportation, testing equipment, a web-based inspection reporting,
              certification and data management system and civil works and office
              equipment at up to five regional centres.
           9 Establishment of a veterinary epidemiology unit including the
              completion and integration of Ministry epidemiology, residue testing,
              animal numbering, and border inspection software and staff training in
              its use.
           9 Upgrading of the national veterinary and plant health institutes; and
              establishment of the new veterinary and plant health reference
              laboratories implementing ISO 17025 testing methodologies, including
              investment in civil works, staff capacity, information management and
              some equipment.
           9 Establishment of an ISTA (International Seed Testing Association)
              certified laboratory for genetically modified organism (GMO) testing
              at the Croatian Institute for Seeds and Seedlings.
4.   Project Management

A small implementation team within the MoA ex Department for Policy, EU and
International Relations (DPEUIR) managed the project. The implementation induced
Project Manager, Financial Controller, Procurement Officer and an
administration/secretarial support person. The team conducted all aspects of project
administration, including overall project oversight, TA, goods and materials
procurement, and financial control. A Project Steering Committee (PSC) composed of
key Assistant Ministers (Directors) within MoA provided project oversight and ensure
national program integration.

Agriculture Pollution Control Project components:
1. Mitigating Nutrient Loads to Water Bodies from Point-Source Pollution




                                          65
Carrying out of a program to promote sustainable manure management practices with
the objective of reducing nutrient loads to the surface and ground water bodies of the
Recipient, and encompassing the following:
9 Nitrates Mitigation Investment Fund - Establishment of a Nitrates Mitigation
  Investment Fund within the MoA Paying agency to finance Sub¬-Grants in the
  counties of Osije?ko-Baranjska, Vukovarsko-Srijemska, and Varaždinska.
9 Water and Soil Monitoring and Impact Analysis Development and implementation
  of a water and soil monitoring program aimed at assessing the reduction of nutrient
  loads to surface and ground waters from Sub-projects.

Strengthening of CAEI’s capacity to advice and train the farmers working in the
counties of Osije?ko-Baranjska, Vukovarsko-Srijemska, and Varaždinska on the most
cost-effective on-farm technologies for complying with the Nitrates Directive.
9 Dissemination of Code of Good Agriculture Practice
9 Applied Research Program
9 CGAP Demonstration Program

3. Public Awareness and Replication Strategy

Carrying out of nationwide public information campaign to disseminate the benefits
of the proposed Project activities.
9 Public Awareness
9 Website
9 Knowledge Sharing

4. Project Management

The APCP was managed by the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) of the AACP that
has been established within the MoA (financial and procurement management). In
addition, a livestock/nitrates management technical specialist was recruited to manage
project activities. For purpose of managing NMIF applications 2 Grant administration
officers (GAO) were recruited within PAFRD. In each project pilot county one
Nitrates management fund officer (NMFO) assisted farmers to apply for Grants form
Investment Fund.

Significant project changes

Agriculture Acquis Cohesion Project

Dropping the SAPARD Guarantee scheme - Since the Republic of Croatia officially
decided not to implement SAPARD Measure 3 ("Improvement of infrastructure in
rural areas") and Measure 4 ("Technical assistance"), the SAPARD Managing
Authority submitted to the European Commission the request for reallocation of funds
programmed for their implementation to Measure 1 and Measure 2. Amendments to
the SAPARD Programme with the reallocation of funds were approved by the


                                         66
European Commission on August 14th, 2008, based on the Commission Decision EC
(2008) 4530.

Following this decision, there was no more justification for CAACP to keep aside a
fund for the "establishment of a SAPARD Guarantee Facility", as this was designed to
provide guarantees to Municipalities and local government seeking SAPARD
financing under Measure 3.

Last call for applications from SAPARD was launched from 21st February till 21st
April 2009 (OG No. 23/09) and December 31st, 2009 was the deadline for submitting
payment requests on the SAPARD Fund.

In parallel, and as part of its preparations for the implementation of the upcoming
IPARD Programme, in February 2009 the Directorate of Marketing and Structural
Support in Agriculture (DMSSA) was transformed into the Paying Agency in
Agriculture, Fisheries and Rural Development (PAAFRD) by the "Law on
Establishment of the Paying Agency in Agriculture, Fisheries and Rural
Development" (Official Gazette No. 30/2009). On December 18th, 2009, the
PAAFRD was entered into the Court Registry of the Zagreb Trade Court, and of that
date became an independent legal entity.

Following all these evolutions, CAACP proposed to the Bank to officially drop the
financing line established for the financing of SAPARD Guarantee. A Bank
supervision mission in May, 2009 agreed on the justification of reallocating this
money.

After discussion with the new Paying Agency, it was reallocated to the financing of
the creation of the new Land Parcels Information System (LPIS) – as an important
component of the creation of the Integrated Administration and Control System
(IACS) urgently needed for PAAFRD accreditation.

Amendment No 1 to Dutch Grant Agreement - The first extension of the Dutch
Grant

A first extension of the Dutch Grant was done on 30th December 2009, extending its
closing date till 31st August 2010.

Amendment No 1 to Loan – to increase the percentage of financing

In 2009 the WB issued Amendment Letter increasing the percentage of financing of
the Loan proceeds under Category (1) (Works) and from the local expenditures for
other items procured locally under Category (2) (Goods), form 85% to 100% due to
reduction of budgetary funds and the inability to ensure the agreed average of co-
financing by the Borrower and the state budget.

Amendment No 2 to Loan - the first extension of the WB Loan to February, 2012
Through the second Amendment Letter the WB extended the closing date of the
Project to February, 28th, 2012, as well as enacted some reallocation of funds among
the activities planned.
It was followed in parallel by a second amendment to the Dutch Grant on August 10th
2010, to allow the Grant disbursements to be carried on till February 28th, 2012 - in
                                         67
parallel with the WB Loan-, and to extend its domain of activities towards trainings
for farmers sensitisation in order to help them reap the maximum benefits from the
EU membership.

This added a fourth result to the Dutch Grant's Logframe:
   1. Workshops, training & study tours are carried out for farmers, farmers
      organizations & other relevant grassroots stakeholders on the process &
      requirements of Agricultural Acquis and EU accession and requirements for
      sustainable agriculture within EU

The second extension WB Loan to July 2012 and Reallocation of Loan Proceeds

A further amendment of the World Bank loan has been signed in order to authorise
the extension of the Project till July 31st, 2012. The purpose of this amendment was to
enable CAACP to complete safely its last big operation of procurement, namely the
procurement of Laboratory furniture for PPI, which was at risk not to complete within
the deadline otherwise.

At the same time third amendment of the Dutch Grant has been requested, here again
to extend the closing date of the fund in parallel, as well as to authorise a further
reallocation of the fund.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

Implementation

AACP

During life of the AACP project appeared a lot of challenges. Procurement activities
were slow in the start of Project, due, in part, to the understaffing of PIU and, in vast,
to its broad scope, technical complexity, and the continuous progress in the EU
accession negotiations that lead to evolving investment needs. The national elections
in November 2007 generated subsequent restructuring of the Ministry to form the
MoA, shedding responsibility for water management, forestry and hunting in that
process. In April 2007 the Government issued a Decision instructing the Ministry of
Science, Education and Sport (MoSES) and MoA to proceed with plans for the
relocation of the NVI. The approval of the urban plan for a proposed MoSES science
and technology park was pending with the City of Zagreb, despite the best efforts of
the MoA to progress the decision. In the meantime, the newly appointed NVI Director
has upgraded the existing facility to meet medium term EU test quality control
requirements. MoA tried to expedite the clearance of the urban plan for the proposed
NVI site for some time. Finally it was agreed with the NVI Director and the Assistant
Minister for Veterinary Services to review the whole veterinary laboratory complex in
Croatia with a view to developing a comprehensive strategy for its upgrading and
rationalization. After few years decision was made (based on study) not to build new
NVI but to refurbish and equip regional veterinary institutes.

In regard to establishing Paying Agency, MoA management has chosen to negotiate
the lease/purchase of premises and not to develop regional centers in the foreseeable
future apart from data archiving facilities that could be located at the planned regional

                                           68
Inspection centers, thereby releasing the €4.25 million budgeted under the CAACP
for this purpose. The MoA has requested that a part of these funds be used to support
the development of the LPIS, which was an urgent requirement for meeting EU
deadlines for establishing the PA Integrated Administration and Control System
(IACS). Project funds were used for the procurement of equipment, softwares,
development of digital ortophoto maps and its vectorization specialized surveying
services and a communications package in support of the introduction of an LPIS.

The implementation of the third SAPARD measure for Improved Rural Infrastructure
has been postponed and transferred to the IPARD program. This has been necessitated
by delays in the EU conferral of management for this SAPARD measure – a process
that is beyond project influence or control. Due to the need for a new IPARD-based
national audit and accreditation process for this measure, EU conferral of
management was not unlikely before second half of 2010, just before the original
project completion and it was clear that the EUR 4 million Guarantee Facility budget
is not going to be utilized. Thus it was agreed to cancel the Facility and reallocate the
proceeds to the loan goods category.

The PIU’s performance in project administration and implementation (delays in
Operating Plans) are partially caused by PIU staff alterations in second half of 2008.
It is important to emphasize that procurement delays, in part within the Bank systems
and due to protracted government decision taking and processing, have also
contributed to the low disbursement.

The implementation progress of Agricultural Acquis Cohesion Project was slower
than expected in 2008 due to the delays with the processing of a few major
procurement packages; however the project was on track to achieving its development
objectives. This was changed in the second half of 2009 since major procurement
packages with estimated value of EUR 12 million (approximately 50% of the loan)
have either been advertised or contracts had already been signed.

By Y2009 the MoA managed to build strong ownership and implementation capacity
among the participating Departments that has started to deliver tangible results. The
key targets agreed with the previous missions have been reached, and the speed and
quality of implementation had improved. The global financial crisis and its adverse
impact on Government revenues has made the EU accession resources scarcer and
therefore the demand for the project resources has increased substantively. Additional
sizable procurement packages financed from the goods category are being finalized.
The utilization of the loan proceeds was additionally boosted by MoA’s request to
increase the disbursement percentages for civil works and goods categories to 100%.

Project Preparation Facility

While project activities and expenditure were less than was projected and the time
frame of the PPF was extended by 12 months, the PPF has, nonetheless, provided
vital support to the Ministry in its program for EU integration and established a
foundation from which the CACCP was expected to grow quickly. The PPF
committed US$ 840,000, or 45% of available PPF funding, of which US$ 789,000
(43% of available funding) was disbursed prior to project effectiveness. Significant
achievements under the PPF include: (i) the appointment of skilled national

                                           69
consultants to MoA departments supporting EU integration; (ii) the provision of
technical assistance in critical areas of food safety, laboratory design, SAPARD
implementation, IPA-RD planning and Payment Agency (PA) procedures, that have
enabled the MoA to meet EU inspection requirements in these fields (iii) the
processing of contracts for the design and construction for the genetically modified
organisms laboratory and design of the plant protection laboratory; (iv) the
procurement of essential office and information technology (IT) equipment, vehicles
and facilities for the SAPARD Management Authority (MA), the PA and the MoA
Veterinary Directorate and Sector for Plant Protection; (v) the processing of policies
and procedures in support of the project’s MoA capacity building program, which will
commence on project inception; and (vi) the establishment of a competent Project
Implementation Team (PIT) including the introduction of new financial management
software.

AACP-Project Year 1: 2007
The Croatia Seeds and Seedlings Institute Genetically Modified Organisms laboratory
was completed, while design work on the new Plant Protection Institute/Orchard
Institute building was progressing satisfactorily. The Project has supported the
establishment of the SAPARD Payment Agency (PA) within the MoA, through the
appointment of national consultants, supply of office and IT equipment and furniture,
the construction of an EU compliant IT room, regional study tours and the recruitment
of technical advisors in IT, land parcel information systems (LPIS), integrated
administration and control systems (IACS), auditing and EU procurement policy. The
Project was procuring additional office furniture and equipment for the Croatian Food
Agency.

AACP-Project Year 2: 2008
Procurement of Supply and Installation of Information System – application LPIS
software package for PA was signed. Procurement of Consultant for providing the
consulting services for LPIS Promotional Campaign was signed and Project continued
to support establishment of LPIS by procuring expert advisers as technical support to
speed up the LPIS implementation. However, disbursement was very much behind the
schedule due to the delay in the two largest project activities regarding LPIS -
procurement of technical services for production of Digital Orthophoto Maps for
LPIS for PA and procurement of Geodetic – Cadastral services for production of the
Digital cadastral maps that have been put in procurement procedure in the last quarter
of 2008. Both of stated activities were of crucial importance for Croatian EU
negotiations.

The consultancy for the specification of the MoA information technology (IT)
architecture has been successfully completed with the preparation of tender
specifications for the MAFRD data management centre and phytosanitary and
veterinary Directorate information databases. Participants at a final presentation by
consultancy expressed a high level of satisfaction with its outputs. However, three
large activities regarding Information Technology Program were slow down because
of problems regarding finalizing the bidding documentation for tendering.

Project financed consultancy to review the whole of the veterinary laboratory
complex in Croatia was completed and a comprehensive strategy for its upgrading and

                                         70
rationalization has been finalized. In collaboration with the National Veterinary
Institute and Veterinary Directorate, an international consultant was recruited to
review the structure of veterinary laboratory facilities and services in Croatia and
advice on their restructuring, including privatization or relocation as required.
Assessment of laboratory resources and restructuring of laboratory services was found
acceptable by NVI and MoA. NVI clearly gave the priority to the construction or
upgrade of regional laboratories (Regional institutes in: Rijeka, Split, Vinkovci and
Križevci) especially as the existing NVI building in Zagreb was audited and declared
basically suitable to accommodate the central activities of the Institute.

APCP - Project Year 1: 2008

Agricultural Pollution Control Project became effective on July 31, 2008 with
engagement of Livestock Nitrates Management Specialist (project coordinator).
Procurement activities in regards to employment of the project staff, advisors and
setting of minimum operational requirements started in September 2008. The MoA
and CAEI are in the process of recruiting APCP support staff and effectiveness is
expected by end-April 2008. An invitation for 1st round applications for grants for
manure management was planned July 2008 following staff and farmer capacity
building programs in May-June 2008.

AACP - Project Year 3: 2009
The MoA, with project support, has been building an EU compliant Payment System
for EU IPARD fund management with work on the development of an Integrated
Administration and Control System (IACS) including a Land Parcel Information
System (LPIS) proceeded satisfactorily, including the procurement of Digital ortho-
photo maps and Digital cadaster plans. These contracts coupled with the LPIS
promotional campaign contract which implementation was underway. Combined, all
activities given above helped MAFRD to meet critical EU accession milestone in the
agriculture sector.

At the same time MoA started with tendering the ICB for an integrated MoA
Management Information System and supporting data management center. In parallel
the documentation for Phytosanitary and Veterinary databases software development
have been prepared.

In regard to the planned restructuring of the NVI, the details on laboratory condition
improvements and equipment were worked out and two large laboratory rehabilitation
and equipment supply procurement packages estimated at EUR 4.6 million have been
finalized. NVI has in due time prepared the laboratory refurbishment designs and the
associated bills of quantities as well as the necessary building permits. The
specification for the laboratory equipment and the procurement packages was also
prepared

APCP - Project Year 2: 2009
Since appointing the PIU in March, 2009 important progress in the APCP Project took
place. Documents and procedures regarding Nitrates Mitigation Fund, which
represents about 50% of grant funds, have been completed and translated, and
submitted to the Bank for comments. With the contribution of local counties,
dissemination brochures have been designed and printed. These brochures will be

                                         71
posted to 85,000 registered farmers. Posting of the brochures is an important concern
given the associated cost of delivery. The lowest bid from private companies is at
least 5 times higher than the National Post Office cost of delivery. Based on this, the
mission considered reasonable that the distribution be implemented through the Post
Office system, financed under the category of operational costs. The mission will
consult with the Bank lawyer and procurement specialist and provide a formal opinion
in this regard.

The tender for nitrates balance software was drafted submitted to the Bank. The
reference price is equivalent to about 100,000 USD which could be higher in the case
of international suppliers because of the additional costs of translation. The Bank
recommended to analyze the option of using existing free software prior to proceeding
with the bidding process.

The bidding documents for purchase of piezometer wells were completed and sent for
Ministry approval. Also, the draft manual for Good Agricultural Practice
demonstrations plots, which explains the demonstration program in detail as well as
participation conditions, have been completed and sent for Ministry approval. The
target for the program is participation of at least 10 farmers per county, with a total
target of 200 farmers in total. The specific mechanisms and procurement methods for
the implementation of these demonstration plots should be identified and discussed
with the Bank team. It was agreed that this issue would be discussed during a VC
shortly after the conclusion of the mission. A national workshop on manure
management and nitrate pollution risk was planned for the Autumn/Winter 2010.

AACP - Project Year 4: 2010
Due to the Government restriction of budgetary resources, procurement of vehicles
has been postponed. Until then, the MoA inspections have used their private vehicles
for the purpose of performing everyday tasks, for which costs were much higher, but
also the functionality of the inspection services and standards in accordance with EU
negotiations Chapter 12 (Food safety, veterinary and phytosanitary policy) related to
the timely and efficient work of veterinary, agricultural and phytosanitary inspection
was questionable. Project obtained the Government permission to start this activity in
2010. The construction of the Plant Protection Institute (PPI) was formally launched
in April 2010. The equipment for an integrated MoA integrated data management
center and supporting Data Management System has been implemented, while the
development of the supporting veterinary sector and phytosanitary sector information
system has made significant progress in implementation. The upgrading of the
regional veterinary centers infrastructure proceeded satisfactorily; and tender for
veterinary laboratory equipment was in final stage of tendering.

APCP - Project Year 3: 2010

In their first year of the APCP operation, field staff have made 1080 farm visits,
conducted 340 farmer surveys and met 110 farm organizations and businesses. To
date, the project has received just 3 grant applications, of which 2 are in the process of
approval, however, the Coordinator and the field officer met are confident that the
target of 30 farmer grantees is achievable in the project timeframe, with many of the
GAP demonstration farmers’ also potential grantees.


                                           72
The Minister MoA has written to Municipalities requesting their cooperation in
approving building and location permits and the careful application of land use laws,
however, the latter fall under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Environment
Protection and Physical Planning.

The project was making least progress in Varaždin County, the centre of Croatia’s
poultry industry. Most farmers produce under contract to a few large poultry
processors and their poultry operations may not be integrated into larger farming
operations. As such, poultry manure has less intrinsic value and is frequently disposed
of with little care for the environment.

Government passed both GAP and EU cross-compliance legislation in January 2010,
however, considerable training and resourcing of public sector institution and private
farmers was required for its effective implementation. The project is in the process of
contracting over 600 ha of private farmland for GAP demonstrations, has stated in
summer 2010.

In work with the scientific staff of the University of the Osijek Faculty of Agriculture
discussions regarding the design of the field trial. The discussion established that
Phosphorous (P) and Potassium (K) is relatively available in the soils in the Osijek-
Baranja region and thus should not be a variable in the proposed field trials, which
will focus on nitrogen responses. It was agreed upon that, considering the relative
uniformity of soils in the region, two trial sites should be adequate. It was also agreed
that, with a view to deriving a clearer nitrogen-crop yield response curve, the number
of nitrogen treatments would be increased at each trial site, particularly in the range
where the best financial response is most likely. This approach provides a model for
employing the Zagreb Agriculture Faculty to conduct a parallel field research
program in Varaždin County.

The APCP website was about to become fully operational and 85 000 brochures of
Code of Good Agriculture Practice have been distributed to all agriculture producers
in February 2010. GAP and manure management field days were planned on at least
60 sites and existing and new on farm manure management programs over the coming
2 years, with potential to increase the frequency of field demonstrations.

AACP - Project Year 5: 2011
The construction of the Plant Protection Institute (PPI)/Horticulture Institute building,
with minor variations, has been implemented on schedule for completion by the
second extended project closing date (February 28, 2012). The PAAFRD) with
project support, has established an EU compliant system for IPARD fund
management, including an IACS incorporating a LPIS) (http://www.arkod.hr/).
Contracts for veterinary laboratory equipment were signed and fully implemented
until end of 2011. State food risk assessment and management information systems
(CRO RASFF) was fully implemented. The MoA integrated data management center
and supporting Data Management System was operational, while the development of
veterinary sector and phytosanitary sector information system, including a new link to
the SSI database, continued as scheduled. Two project in relation to food risk studies
(food additives and mycotoxins in feed) started. The rehabilitation of the regional
veterinary laboratory institutes was on schedule and key laboratory tests at the
National Veterinary Institute and regional veterinary centers have been ISO 17025

                                           73
certified opening the door for trade with the EU as reflected in the successful
negotiations of the agricultural chapters of the Acquis Communautire. Vehicles for
inspection services and additional veterinary laboratory equipment have been
delivered and in use.

APCP - Project Year 4: 2011

In November 2010 project disbursement was at 23 percent. But commitments were
standing at 52 percent. Total of 15 grants for on-farm manure platforms, valued at
US$ 1.14 million, has been approved. The construction of six platforms has been
completed, while five more have been contracted and their construction was about to
start. Applications from 27 farmers were being appraised for documentation
compliance by the Paying Agency. Farm eligibility has been raised to 150 cows and a
law revision that will simplify procedures and reduce the cost of securing permits for
unregistered and illegally constructed buildings is before the parliament. These two
measures were expected to accelerate farmer application rates for manure platforms
and IPARD grants. Piezometers, for soil water nitrogen measurement, have been
installed at five platform sites.

During the visit of Sector Manger, John Kellenberg, to Croatia, the meeting was
organized with the implementing team on June 7, 2011 in Zagreb. It was aimed at
finding the ways to enhance the Nitrates Mitigation Investment Fund activities so that
the end beneficiaries, Croatian farmers, could better use the grant funds to finance 75
percent of the cost of manure storage and management in a simpler and less time-
consuming manner. To that effect, certain revisions to the IPARD compliant
Beneficiary and Public Procurement Guide (Project Operation Manual) have been
discussed and agreed upon. Though the key IPARD procedures will continue to be
followed, some revisions to the Project Operations Manual will be introduced.
Notably, these included upfront grant payment of 55 percent and time reduction for
administrative processing from 12 to seven months provided that documentation and
on-the-spot control are satisfactory.

The impact of nitrogen application on cereal and vegetable production was being
tested in two respective field trials that will include an economic evaluation, while
about 700 hectares were incorporated in the good agricultural practice demonstrations.
During the fall of 2010, the project delivered workshops in all the main villages and
towns of three project counties. Collectively, the APCP has delivered more than 160
lectures, seminars and media appearances y 2010 and 2011. A project monitoring and
evaluation (M&E) program was now fully operational and undertaking competency
based training evaluation. The Croatian Institute of Agricultural Extension (CAEI), an
important partner in APCP implementation, has been integrated into the Croatian
Agriculture Chamber (CAC), however, the CAC remains a nascent organization and
the achievement of effective farmer representation in extension management remains
challenging.

AACP - Project Year 6: 2012

The construction of the Plant Protection Institute (PPI) building in Zagreb was
completed in February 2012. Due to budgetary restrictions the PPI was unable to
furnish the new building with laboratory and office furniture. In order to make the

                                          74
new PPI building functional the Project financed procurement of laboratory and office
furniture. The laboratory furniture is procured for the new building of PPI: laboratory
for bacteriology, laboratory for herbology, laboratory for mycology, laboratory for
nematology, laboratory for virology and laboratory for zoology. Procurement of the
laboratory furnishing was completed by the project closing date of July 31, 2012.

APCP - Project Year 5: 2012

The final phase of project was focused on finishing of farm investments, completion
of education processes, and cooperation with Agriculture faculties, schools and other
entities. 3 years of field operations and achieving of the results were presented during
the regional APCP conference in Zagreb, May 31-June 01.

Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

Design: The PAD contains the detailed set of monitoring indicators for assessing
progress in meeting the PDO.

Utilization: The data acquired through M&E, gave all stakeholders a clear sense of
the progress that the Project was making. The data was also used to create pressure for
further improvements.

Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

The financial management (FM), disbursement and procurement staff within the PIU
performed capably and all Project audits (AACP&APCP) had clean opinion. The FM
system recorded all transactions and balances, and it permitted clear and concise
reports to be promptly issued. Internal controls and audit further assured the accuracy
of records.

Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
Within the Project M&E two surveys have been conducted: Information technology
survey and CAACP beneficiaries’ staff competency survey (detailed surveys results
are Annex to final CAACP M&E)

3. Lessons Learned

The AACP project has significantly supported institutional efforts in regard the EU
acquis in agriculture and rural development, although facing a number of different
challenges such as:
- Unrealistic planning before the project start:
   x In general, for all international procurements: the procedures are much more
       complicated to deal with.
   x   All procurements linked with IT systems – the ICT is in constant
       change/progress.
   x   In regard to determining the procurement methods (works, goods and
       consultant’s services) in relation to the specific requirement of each activity.
       Insisting on originally envisaged methods may not be the best solution and
       could have significant time consuming effect.

                                          75
   x   As regards construction works – prolonged time for obtaining all necessary
       permits as well as acute problems when the designs of the Projects were not of
       a sufficient quality.
     Lacks in the designs then was translated into sizeable problems revealed at
     implementation stage, making it compulsory to negotiate complementary
     amendments with the contractors – all this translating into unforeseen delays
     in the works progress.
   x Putting more effort on stakeholders’ involvement in project design in early
     stage, and developing stronger project ownership could induce fewer delays in
     all future project implementation phases.

- Staff alterations:
    x PIU
        Although existing PIU somehow managed to pull through with the
        requirements of Project's implementation, it was at the cost of very much
        pressure on staff and some unavoidable delays.
        PIU comprised:
        - 1 project manager (during the maternity leave the substation was not
        provided)
        - 1 procurement officer (3 staff alterations on his position form Y2005-Y2009)
        - 1 financial officer
        - 1 technical/administrative assistant (longer periods of project life this
        position was vacant)

   x WB staff
   The Project suffered for the frequent changes of TTL during its implementation –
   as each TTL needed some time to get acquainted with its peculiarities.

   At some time, it took a long time to get WB answers to requests for instructions,
   or approval for the contracts to be signed.
