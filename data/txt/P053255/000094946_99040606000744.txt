SECOND ECONOMIC COMPETITIVENESS ADJUSTMENT LOAN (ECAL II)
LOAN AND PROGRAM SUMMARY
Borrower:                        The Republic of Tunisia.
Amount and terms:                EURO 138.0 million (US$159 million equivalent) to be disbursed
in two tranches of equal amounts. A fixed rate will be applied, at
the standard Euro Libor interest rate. The loan would be for up to
15 years, including a three-year grace period. Interests and other
charges will be payable semi-annually on April 15 and October 15
in each year. The final reimbursement date is October 1S, 2014.
Loan Description:                The Second Economic Competitiveness Adjustment Loan (ECAL
11) is designed to support a program of reforms in the financial
sector to supplement ongoing reforms in the real sector. Current
reforms in the real sector have been initiated by the ECAL 1,
which was the first of a series of operations to improve the
international competitiveness of the Tunisian economy. In the
context of the Free Trade Association (FTA) with the European
Unioni, signed in 1995 and expanded in November 1997, the
proposed financial sector reform program aims at upgrading the
performance of a critical segment of the service industry and
increasing its contribution to economic growth.  The specific
policy measures would consist of: (a) increasing the financial
soundiness of the banking system through a large settlement of
non-performinig bank loans to public and semi-public enterprises;
(b) improving the quality of loan collateral and foreclosure
procedures; (c) privatizing banks, consolidating the banking
sector, and reforming the governance regime for public sector
banks; (d) modernizing the banking law and upgrading bank
prudential regulations; (e) improving the payments system; (f)
promoting indirect monetary control through a comprehensive
reform of the Government securities market; and (g) enhancing the
regulatory framework of non-bank financial intermediation
performed by mutual funds, securities firms, and insurance
companies.
Benefits:                        The main benefits of the loan would be: (a) a more robust banking
system; (b) reduced Government presence in the banking sector
and stronger market discipline in the management of state-owned
banks, (c) more efficient market-based credit allocation; (d) more
competitive provision of bank services; (e) better capacity of the



ii
banking system to adjust to external and internal shocks through
improved monetary management instruments; and (f) greater
mobilization of domestic and foreign savings through non-bank
financial intermediaries.
Risks:                            Continued trade liberalization may cause financial distress in the
least productive sectors of the economy whichi may hamper
further improvement in the financial performance of the banking
system. A second and parallel risk is a reversal in the government
commitment to reduce its presence in the financial sector, in an
effort to dampen transitionial and sectoral declines in employment,
through directed credit which could impair the banking system's
soundness. There are several couniteractive measures to limit
these  risks: (a) promoting  neutral monetary  management
instrumenits as opposed to preferential refinancing facilities; (b)
enforcing rigorously bank prudential regulation and raising
minimum bank capital adequacy ratios; (c) accelerating the
privatization program to let the private sector assume a larger part
of new investments needed to raise productivity; and (d)
intensifying government initiatives to increase labor market
flexibility. The proposed reform program contributes to the first
three risk mitigating factors. Also, satisfactory implementation of
the related  macroeconomic framework  should  sustain  and
improve the overall employment level.
Estimated Disbursement:          The loan would be disbursed in two tranclhes. The release of the
second  tranche  would  be  conditioned  o01  satisfactory
macroeconomic performance and adequate implementation of the
proposed financial sector reform program, includinig key measures
specified in the Loan Agreement.
Parallel Financing:              European Union grant of EURO 80 million and a parallel loan of
about US$140 million equivalent from the African Development
Bank.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR
RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
SECOND ECONOMIC COMPETITIVENESS ADJUSTMENT LOAN (ECAL 11) TO THE REPUBLIC OF
TUNISIA
I.    INTRODUCTION
1.    I submit for your approval the following report and recommendations on a proposed Second
Economic Competitiveness Adjustment Loan (ECAL II) to the Republic of Tunisia in an amount of US$
159 million in two tranches to support a program of financial sector reforms. The Bank's Country
Assistance Strategy was discussed by the Board on June 13, 1996. The country strategy stresses the
timely implementation of policies to promote economic integration while maintaining social stability and
sustainable environment management.  The proposed program  reflects the close and continued
partnership between the Government of Tunisia (GOT), the World Bank Group, the IMF and the
European Union in providing support to the implementation of these policies. It will be complemented by
parallel financing from the European Union and the African Development Bank for a total amount
exceeding US$200 million equivalent.
2.     The ECAL 11 would be the second program in a series of operations to improve the international
competitiveness of the Tunisian economy. The main objective of the ECAL II is to increase the
soundness, efficiency, and competitiveness of the financial system and raise the financial sector's
contribution to economic growth. In late 1996, the GOT created a commission on the modernization of
the banking system, the "Coniniission Tunisienne sur la Modernisation du Systene Bancaire ". The
World Bank and the IMF expressed the view that the Commission's conclusions and recommendations
constitute a solid foundation for a banking reforn agenda. The proposed financial sector reform program
includes key recommendations presented in the Commission's report.
II.  RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND PROSPECTS
A.    Background
3.     Tunisia's economic adjustment efforts started in 1986 when a decline in oil export earnings and
an excessive level of public investment brought the country close to a balance of payments crisis. Since
theni, prudent macroeconomic managemenit and cautious structural reforms have helped bring back
internal and external balance, as well as consistenitly positive rates of economic growth. At the same
time, Tunisia's emphiasis on the social sectors has generated standards of education and health that are
above the average for countries in its income group.
4.     Strong success in restoring and maintaining macroeconomic stability, in reducing poverty and in
developing a strong middle class has been accompanied by slower progress in structural reform and in the
development of civil society. As a result, the presence of the government in economic and social life
remains larger than in comparable countries, and improvements in competitiveness and governance have
lagged. Recently - and especially since the signing in 1995 of the free trade association with the
European Union - progress in structural reforms has accelerated, especially in international trade and
privatization.



2
5.     The main objectives being pursued by the Government of Tunisia (GOT) under its Ninth
Economic Development Plan (1997-2001) are to consolidate the macroeconomic achievements and
accelerate structural reforms in order to increase economic competitiveness and prepare the country to
integrate confidently with Europe and fully benefit from the global economy in the 215' century.
B.    Recent Economic Performance
6.     Real GDP growth averaged 4.6 percent over the period 1991-1997, with large fluctuations from
year to year that mainly traced variations in agricultural performance which in turn depends heavily on
weather conditions. In 1998, GDP growth is estimated at 5 percent, lower than the Ninth Plan's target of
5.9 percent, in part due to late rains that adversely affected olive production, and to lower-thani-expected
tourism activity.
7.     Developments in international trade during 1991-97 have been characterized by steady growth of
exports of manufactured goods and fluctuating agricultural exports. A current account deficit of 5.3
percent of GDP on average has been largelR compensated for by inflows of capital - mainly medium and
long term. As a result, Tunisia has steadily increased its foreign currency reserves from the equivalent of
1.8 months of imports in 1991-95 to 3.3 months in 1997. In 1998, the current account deficit is estimated
at 3.9 percent of GDP against 3.7 percent in 1997, as a result of a lower value of energy exports -
following the sharp decline in oil prices - and a higher volume of imports of capital goods - in response
to tariff reductions and fiscal incentives implemented in the context of the partnership agreement with the
European Union and the associated mise a niveau program.
8.     External financing proved to be challenging in 1998. Tunisia experienced difficulties in tapping
internationial capital markets - as did the majority of emerging market economies - as a consequence of
the East Asian crisis. Faced with the 1998 high spreads, the Tunisian authorities decided not to borrow
from interinational capital markets. In addition, some delays in the disbursement of external loans from
public sources reduced capital inflows. These adverse developments could not be fully compensated for
by an increase in FDI following the privatization of two large cement companies. By end-1998, foreign
currency reserves had fallen to 2.6 monthis of imports, from 3.3 months at end-1997.
9.     Inflationi averaged 5.2 percent during 1991-1997, and is estimated to be 3.1 percent in 1998.
During the same period, the nominal exchange rate of the Tunisian Dinar (TD) to the dollar depreciated
by 2.7 percent, and the real effective exchange rate index gradually increased from 101 to 104. Thus,
there is room for further reduction In inflation in order to strengthen competitiveness since Tunisia's
trading partners In the European Unioni have reduced inflation to less than 3 percent.

(**) ECAL 11 Targets
10.    These positive economic outcomes have been achieved as a result of prudent fiscal and monetary
policies. On the fiscal front, during 1991-1997 the overall deficit was maintainied at 3.8 percent of GDP,
on average - a level financed through a moderate increase in domestic and external debt. Underlyinig
developments have included a modest decline in tax revenues as a share of GDP - in part as a result of
tariff reductions following the partnership agreement with the European Unioni - and a rising public
sector wage bill. In 1998, the budget deficit is estimated at 3.1 percent of GDP, as a result of successful
revenue collection and expenditure restraint efforts. Moreover, unanticipated additional privatization
proceeds of TD 320 million (actual receipts of TD 420 million against planned receipts of TD  100
million) have reduced the Government's borrowing needs correspondingly.
11.    The monetary stance of the GOT has also been consistently prudent in recent years. In 1998,
growth in the monetary aggregate M2 is projected at 7.0 percent (December 1998 over December 1997),
which represents a significant moderation compared to growth rates of 16.5 and  13.6 percent,
respectively, for December 1997 and December 1996. The growth of the monetary aggregate M4 which
is used by the authorities for financial programming has also experienced a similar trend. Inflation has
been reduced from about 6 percent to 3 percent between 1991 and 1998, and interest rates have decreased
as the interest rate used by the central bank to manage liquidity - and which also serves as reference rate
for commercial banks - has been reduced from nearly 1 1.5 percent in 1991 to about 6.9 percent in 1998.
Macroeconomic Monitoring
12.    The macroeconomic framework of this loan will be monitored on a semi-annual basis during
regular loan supervision missions. The evaluation of macroeconomic developments in the country as they



4
relate to the loan will benefit from data and other informiiationl that the GOT will send to the Bank on a
semi-annual basis, as well as from  information collected in Tuillsia during related bank m11issionls.  The
monitoring of the macroeconomlilc framework and discussiolns of policy responses to deviations from the
macro targets will be done in consultation with the Interinatioinal Monetary Fulid.

13.    The growth of exports, particularly that of manufactured exports, will be used as an indicator of
the program's success in sustaininig improvements in the competitiveniess and the outward orientation of
the Tullisian economy following the ECAL I program. Developmenlts in the external current account (in
relation to GDP) will be used as the main indicator of developmenits in the saving-investment balance of
the economy. Maintainiing an adequate level of reserves in relation to imports is an important objective of
the program, particularly in view of the fact that the capital account will gradually become more open.
Gross foreign reserves will be monitored during the program period as an indicator of the capacity of the
economy to finance imports to further upgrade competitiveness.  The GOT has also committed to
maintain an adequate level of foreign reserves while keeping the level of foreign debt at a sustainable
level. Therefore the ratio of gross external debt to GDP will be considered as a monitorinig indicator for
the program.
14.    A tight fiscal policy is central to preserving macroeconomic stability and creating room  for
increasing private investment. The Government's deficit to GDP ratio will be used as an indicator of the
ability of the public sector to contribute to the increase in national savings. As a key component of
external competitiveness, inflation will be monitored under the program. In order to maintain a stable real
effective exchange rate, the GOT is committed to reducing inflation.
C.     Progress in Structural Reform
15.    Since the beginning of their adjustment efforts, the GOT has implemented structural reforms
consistently albeit at a slow pace. As a result, the share of the private sector in the economy increased
somewhat since 1986, but the public enterprise sector remains large. Private investment is less than half
of total fixed investment; key services for exporters, such as telecommunications, international transport
and port handling, remain under state ownership.
16.    Until recently, foreign direct investment had been limited and remained concentrated in the
energy sector. Privatization, if sustained, will help attract foreign direct investment and diversify its
sectoral distribution. Significant progress was made in 1998, with the privatization by international
competitive bidding of two important cement factories. This operation helped raise foreign direct
investment inflows from 2 percent of GDP in 1997 to nearly 4 percent of GDP in 1998. The success of



5
privatization has not only yielded considerable revenues to the goverrnenlt, it also demonstrated the
merits of transparent and competitive mechanisms for the privatization of state enterprises. However, the
development of the financial system would have been more advanced if bank privatization had proceeded
at a faster pace. As with privatization, trade liberalization has been accelerated in recent years. The
implementation of the free trade association with the Europeani Unioni is on track: in this context, import
tariffs are being gradually reduced and import surcharges have been eliminiated across the board.
D.    Social Development
17.    Tunisia has made significant progress in reducitig the incidenice of poverty and improviig social
indicators as a result of carefully balanced social policies and a continlued strong focus on social
expenditures. The share of the population below the po\erty line stood at 7 percent in 1990, down from
40%  in the 1960s. Althoughi more recent statistics do not exist, there are indicatiolis that the recent
achievements in economic growth and the success in reducinig inflationl have benefited a wide range of the
population. In fact, real per capita income increased by about 2.7 percent per annumil on average between
1990 and 1997. Moreover, several years of targeted safety nets programs have provided much needed
support to the poor. The decline in the impact of poverty was accompaniied by dramatic improvements in
access to health care and basic infrastructure, large gains in school enrollmenit, a declininig population
growth rate, and increasing life expectancy of the population. A key issue however is that increased
competition both on domestic and foreign markets as well as more flexibility on plant closures may have
adversely affected real revenues and worsened unemployment in selected areas. This situation is
carefully monitored by the GOT who has expanded safety nets and micro-credit programs in those
targeted areas.
18.   In addition to good social indicators and continuing progress in social development, a trademark
of Tunisia's policies has been  its consensual decision-making process, characterized  by close
consultations with private sector organizations. But much remains to be done. The extension of the
consultative process to the civil society has remained very gradual, as the Government remains very
concerned about social stability. However, Tunisia's large gains in living standards have created a strong
middle class, which, along with a balanced income distribution, have been extremely effective in
insulating the country from adverse social and political developments in the region. Moreover, it is
expected that the increased economic opening, the country's success in education, and the fast evolution
of information technologies, will accelerate the mainstreaming of consultation processes. Tunisia is
therefore poised to push its social and public participation agenda further so as to reap the full benefits of
the recent economic gains and strengthen its prospects for the 21 5 century.
E.     Medium-term Prospects and Balance of Payments Viability
19.    In 1999 the Tunisian economy is likely to grow at a rate between 5 and 6 percent per annum, with
the possibility of exceeding 6 percent if the reform measures recently introduced or soon to be
implemented are fully effective, and if Tunisia's major trading partners are not heavily affected by the
Asian and Russian financial crises. Growth is, in fact, likely to decelerate in Tunisia's major trading
partners and in the world economy. In 1999, Europe is expected to grow at about 2.5 percent per annum
and the world economy is forecast to grow at only 2 percent per annum. For Tunisia to achieve higher
growth targets, it will be necessary to continue improving external competitiveness and to stimulate
domestic consumption.  This will require a deepening of structural reforms, encouraging private
investment through faster privatization, strengthening the banking sector through a combination of
increased liberalization, tighter regulation and bank privatization, and improving the private sector's
access to credit by reducing public sector domestic borrowing. In addition, a further reduction of inflation



6
to the level prevalent in Tunisia's European partners will depend not only on the maintenance of a
prudent monetary stance, but also on the nominal wage dynamics that emerge from tripartite agreements.
20.    The balance of payments outlook for 1999 is continigenit upoIn an external environment
characterized by many downside risks. Export growth may slow due to slower economilic growth in
Tunisia's iaajor European trading partners as a result of the finanicial crises in East Asia and Russia, and
to intensifying competition from Asian exports brought about by the devaluation of their currencies.
Tourism activities may slow for the same reason. Imports are anticipated to grow faster thani exports as a
result of the new round of tariff reductions beginnilng in 1999, as well as a Governmenit plan to boost
public investment in order to achieve its 1999 economic growth target. The current account is projected
to have a deficit of about 3.9 percent of GDP. Fiianlcinig that deficit will require continiued access to
foreign capital.  Given the 1998 experience, it is not clear whethier the conditionis on interinationial
financial markets will be favorable in 1999.
21.    To reduce the need for external borrowing in the mediuLim term, a tighter fiscal stance will be
needed to generate domestic public savings to offset a likely increase in demand for loanable funds from
the private enterprise sector in the wake of the mise ci niveau program, and in the face of declininig tax
revenues resulting from trade policy reforms. This tighter fiscal stance will require sustained efforts oni
revenue collection, current and capital expenditures control, especially with respect to the public sector
wage bill and public investment. Indeed, the wage bill of the public sector contitnues to absorb close to 41
percent of budgetary revenues, owing to continluous additions to the size of the civil service - with a
yearly net recruitment of about 7,000 in recent years - and salary increases based on cost-of-liviig
adjustments. Reducing the fiscal weight of the wage bill in a sustainable manner will require a reform of
the civil service which is under consideration by the authorities. At the same time, public investment
should be maintained at a level consistent not only with the overall fiscal stance but also with the
objective of creating new room for private investment.
F.     External Financing Needs and Financing Plan
22.    Table 3 summarizes projected financing needs during 1999 and the following three years along
with the main assumptions underlying these projections. In 1999, the total capital needed to finance the
projected current account deficit and to service external debt while increasing official reserves to a level
equivalent to 2.8 months of imports, is estimated at US$2 billion. After assuming that external long-term
public borrowings and grants will continue along current trends, and that foreign direct investment will be
above recent levels but lower than the 1998 amount (which was boosted by exceptionally high
privatization receipts), there will still remain significant financing requirements. Disbursements under the
proposed operation and parallel financing could contribute to US$195 million dollars in 1999 (of which
US$75 million from the IBRD, US$50 million from the EU and US$70 million from AfDB).

23.    This leaves about US$ 900 million to be mobilized from  private sources - a very significant
amount in light of the current conditions in international financial markets. The GOT projects that about
half of that amount could be mobilized through trade financing. Depending on market conditions, the
remaining half would be mobilized through a combination of government bonds issued abroad,
syndicated loans, and additional privatization proceeds that would result from a stronger privatization
effort.
24.    The balance of payments projections on which this financing plan is based may yet prove
optimistic. There are three downside risks relating to the current account. First, there is the possibility of
a low growth of Tunisian exports due to a slowdown in imports by major trading partners in Europe and
elsewhere, and a stiffer competition from East Asian exports whose competitiveness may be boosted by
currency devaluation. Second, a drop in international prices of commodities would also have negative
repercussion, although this risk is minor as primary commodities represent less than 15 percent of
exports. And third, workers remittances may slow down if a fall in the oil price affects economic
activities in the Gulf or if slow economic growthi in Europe stifles the earnings foreign workers. This risk
is also minor as Tunisia does not have a large number of workers in the Gulf and economic growth in
Europe is not expected to fall drastically in 1999.
25.    There are also downside risks concerning the availability of external financing and thus the
maintenance of adequate foreigin reserves. With risks of a global economic slowdown in the aftermath of
the financial crises in East Asia and Russia and the recession in Japan, it is likely that emerging market
economies will not only face prohibitive spreads but also may experience some withdrawal of private
financing through  1999.  Current market sentiment indicates that spreads for Tunisia could be
significantly higher than in September 1997, when the GOT Yankee issue raised US$250 million at 140
basis points above the US Treasury rate on 10-year notes, and at 180 basis points above the US Treasury
rate on 30-year bonds. If borrowing spreads remain high for emerging market economies, the GOT may
find it neither judicious nor easy to mobilize the projected funding from private sources.

III.   PUBLIC ENTERPRISE AND FINANCIAL SECTOR REFORM: PROGRESS AND
CONSTRAINTS
A.    Public Enterprises and Privatization
26.   In the mid-1980s, the public sector represented 40 percent of total investment and accounted for
about 30 percent of total value-added and 33 percent of total official employment. Public enterprises
were experiencing mounting losses and had accumulated a debt burden of approximately TD 3 billion, or
35 percent of GDP. In 1987, the Government undertook its first Bank-supported program to reduce the
weight of the public sector in commercial activities by restructuring and privatizing small and medium-
sized public enterprises, mainly in the textiles, tourism, and construction sectors. The program was
modest. It led to the privatization or liquidation of 43 small-scale enterprises and generated sale proceeds
of only TD 155 million. There were still 232 public enterprises or entities remaining of which 98 were
not operating as business enterprises.
27.    Under the ECAL I program, a second but much more ambitious wave of privatization and
consolidation was initiated; 63 public enterprises were targeted with a total net asset value of TD 1.4
billion. By the end of 1997, a total of 93 public enterprises had been privatized or liquidated, and
cumulative sale proceeds from privatization reached TD 400 million. At the end of 1998, cumulative
privatization revenues doubled to TD 810 million following the privatization of two cement companies
identified under the privatization initiative supported by the ECAL I program. Part of the privatization
revenues is allocated to the Fonds de restructuration des entreprises publiques (FREP) to fund severance
payments and other worker compensationi and to provide financial support to public enterprise
restructuring and workout plans.
28.    The remaining half of the TD 1.4 billion of net asset value from public enterprises identified for
privatization is scheduled to be put up for sale in conformity with the second tranche conditions of an EU
grant and will mark the complete withdrawal of the public sector from the construction, housing, and
electrical supply sectors. As part of this effort and in line with the agreement reached with the EU on a
new enlarged privatization program, the Government will go ahead with the privatization of two cement
plants in 1999, completing the Government's withdrawal from the cement industry. In recent years, five
large public enterprises such as the nationial airline, Tunisair, and the largest insurance company, Star,
have also sold shares on the Tunis stock exchange. Nine other public enterprises are scheduled to sell
shares on the stock market over the next 14 months.
29.    Under a legislative amendment adopted in 1996, the Government introduced a narrower
definitioni of public enterprises in order to segregate enterprises with no commercial activities that are
essentially administrative annexes of governmenlt ministries. Such entities are now formally excluded
from commercial undertakinigs which previously gave them access to bank credit.
30.    Under the ECAL 11, the proposed settlement of noni-performing loans to public and semi-public
enterprises amountinig to TD 800 million would concern 49 enterprises. 24 of them will be liquidated
while 4 enterprises with a combined asset book value of TD 168 million will continue to be operated as
public enterprises. Complete and partial divestitures of the Government and public sector banks' share
ownership in semi-public enterprises will be part of the loan settlement package to be implemented for the
remaining 20 enterprises. One enterprise was recently privatized at a sale price of about TD 200 million.
The asset book value of the 20 public and semi-public enterprises exceed TD 550 million.



9
B.    Structure, Soundness, and Development of the Financial Sector
31.    The Government initiated a gradual liberalization of the financial sector in the late 1980s
beginning with the phased removal of direct credit controls, mandatory holdings of government securities,
and interest rate ceilings. In 1996, mandatory lending requirements to priority sectors and central bank
rediscounting facilities at preferential rates were eliminated.  In spite of important progress in the
liberalization of the financial sector, some interest rate restrictions on deposits persist, and the central
bank's priority refinancing facilities for certain sectors of the economy still influence bank credit
allocation.
32.    As discussed below, the Tunisian financial system is characterized by a significant government
presence in the banking system - public sector banks represent more than 50 percent of total bank assets.
Banks are excluded from the insurance sector but have a dominant market share among securities firms
and control close to 90 percent of mutual fund assets. In addition, bank stocks, including shares of public
sector banks, account for 68 percent of stock market capitalization. The modern prudential regulations
introduced in 1992 requires banks to comply with specific loan classification and provisioning rules. An
outline of these prudential regulations is presented in Annex VII. Despite significant efforts to improve
loan provisioning and capital adequacy ratios since 1992, public sector banks still suffer from poor asset
quality and weak capital.
1. Main Components and Structure of the Financial System
33.    Commercial and development banks dominate the financial system with total assets of TD 19
billion, or 90 percent of GDP at the end of 1997, and provide 85 percent of total credit to the economy.
Central bank assets are TD 3.3 billion. There are 28 securities firms operating in the securities market
which includes TD 3.3 billion of Treasury securities, TD 530 million of commercial paper, a negligible
amount of corporate bonds, and a stock market capitalization of TD 2.6 billion. The other major financial
institutions consist of 19 mutual funds with total assets of TD 750 million and 16 insurance companies
with technical reserves of TD 615 million. State-controlled institutions account for slightly more than 50
percent of bank assets and about 39 percent of the insurance industry.
34.    The banking system comprises 31 banks: 13 commercial banks with a network of 762 branches
(one branch per 12,000 inhabitants), eight development banks, eight off-shore banks, and two merchant
banks. Of the 13 commercial banks, there are seven private commercial banks and five public sector
banks following the privatization of Banque du Sud in 1997. Foreign capital represents more than a third
of the private banks' capital and reaches 40 and 50 percent, respectively, for the first-and second-largest
private banks. Off-shore banks provide mainly trade financing and other short-term bank credits to off-
shore companies, while the two merchant banks offer investment banking and financial advisory services.
Table 4 shows the relative size of the bank categories withiin the system.

Development Banks    14.5%             18.5%           1.3%               33.0%
Off-shore Banks       7.0%             2.3%            0.8%               1.0%

35.    Four of the five largest banks are in the public sector: Banque Nationale Agricole (BNA), Societe
Tunisienne des Banques (STB), Banque de 1'Habilat (BH) and Union Internationale de Banque (UIB).
At end 1997, BNA had total assets of about TD 2.8 billion, and UIB's total assets were about TD 1.4
billion. The two largest development banks, Banque de Developpement Economique de Tunisie (BDET)
and Banque Nationale de Developpement Touristique (BNDT), are also public sector banks with
combined assets of about TD 1.5 billion. The other development banks are joint ventures between the
Tunisian Government and the governments of other Arab countries. The four largest public sector
commercial banks and the two public sector development banks have minority private shareholders and,
like the largest private commercial banks (BIAT, UBCI, BT), are listed on the Tunis stock exchange.
36.    Under the current law on public enterprises (Loi 89-09, article 9), a commercial bank or insurance
company with more than 34 percent of its shares owned by the Government is considered a public
enterprise and is subject to the administrative control of the Ministry of Finance.
37.    The mission of development banks is to finanice investment projects througlh medium-and long-
term credit and through equity participation (which currently represents about II percent of their total
assets). As they are not deposit banks and do not have branch networks, development banks face high
funding costs because they rely on borrowed funds, most of which are provided by bilateral and
multilateral agencies, and a relatively high level of equity capital. Even though they were given the
limited right to accept deposits following changes in the banking law in 1994, customer deposits fund a
decreasing share of credit operations. These deposits reached a low of 5 percent at the end of 1997.
Deposits have been gradually replaced by interbank deposits, mainly from public commercial banks
redistributing liquidity, originating in part from central bank refinancing facilities.
2. Financial Soundness of the Banking System
38.   In the early 1990s most banks were undercapitalized, and loan provisions were less than 25
percent of non-performing loans. Comprehensive prudential regulations adopted at the end of 1991
introduced strict standards for loan classification and provisioning, and in mid-1993 the central bank set
detailed terms of reference for external audits of banks and for off-site reporting requirements.
39.    Quality of bank loan portfolios. The percentage of non-performing loans in Tunisian banks has
been decreasing since 1993 but still remains substantial. Bad loans as a proportion of total bank
commitments reached a peak of about 37 percent in 1993 following the introduction of specific loan
provisioning and classification rules, and stood at about 31 percent at the end of 1997. This percentage is
inflated, however, by unrecoverable loans kept on the banks' accounts for many years, since bad loans are
rarely written off even when fully provisioned. Also, in addition to outright non-performing loans, it
comprises late interest payment charges, equity investments and the face value of contingent off-balance
sheet commitments. As indicated in Table 5, the percentage of non-performing loans has decreased in
deposit banks from about 31 percent to 23 percent while the development banks' poor performance, with
loans in arrears equal to more than two thirds of their total commitments, has been deteriorating.
40.    After the Government buy-back in 1996 of TD 960 million of non-performing loans (5 percent of
1996 GDP) made by BNA to two Government food marketing boards, I 'Office des Cereales and l 'Office
National de I 'Huile, the total gross amount of non-performing loans in the banking system at the end of
1997 is estimated at TD 5 billion. Net of provisions, non-performing loans reached about TD 2.6 billion
and are equivalent to more than 12 percent of GDP. Of the TD 5 billion of non-performing bank loans,
85 percent are in state-controlled deposit banks and development banks (including the recently privatized
Banque du Sud) while the remaining 15 percent are in private deposit banks. About TD I billion of non-
performing loans are attributable to public enterprises while the remaining TD 4 billion are loans to the
private sector. The distribution of non-performing loans is rather concentrated; fifty public and semi-



II
public enterprises account for about 80 percent of noni-performiling loans to this group of borrowers.
Similarly, a high proportion of the total amouint of noni-perforiniiig loans to the private sector is
attributable to a small number of large borrowers.
41.    The large size of non-performinig loans in public sector banks and developmenit banks reflects
their historical role as providers of directed credit for developmenit projects and public enterprises, in line
with the Government's economic developmenit policies. However, Imlost of the noni-perforiniig loans to
the private sector are also on the balance sheets of public sector banks and developmenit banks. Shortfalls
in loan provisions in the banking system  are estimated at TD 365 million (end of 1997) and almost
entirely concern public sector banks (if for historical consistenicy, Banque du Sud remains classified as a
public sector bank).

(I) Total commitments include outright loans and off-balance sheet contingent liabilities.
(2) The 1997 percentage increase for private banks is caused by the classification of Banque du Sud as a private bank
following its privatization. Banque du Sud non-performing loans account for about 35.3 percent of total loans.
(3) The seven percent drop in the percentage of non-performing loans of public sector banks in 1996 was caused
mainly by the govemment buy-back of TD 960 million of non-performing loans (5 percent of GDP) made by
BNA to two government food marketing boards, I 'Office des Creales and I 'Office National de l 'Huile.
42.    Bank Capital Adequacy. The Banque Centrale de Tunisie (BCT) has set the minimum  risk-
weighted capital ratio at 5 percent, based entirely on tier I capital.  Although this tier I capital
requirement is higher than the minimum international norm, the overall minimum capital adequacy ratio
of 5 percent remains lower than international standards and minimum prudential capital requirements in
other countries of the region such as Morocco, Algeria, and Jordan. The BCT definition requires that any
shortfall in the required level of loan loss provisions be deducted from core capital before the ratio is
calculated. With few exceptions, private commercial banks and development banks have consistently
exceeded minimum capital adequacy requirements. In contrast, adjusted for shortfalls in loan provisions,
the aggregate public sector banks' capital adequacy ratio is estimated at about 4.7 percent (end 1997)
despite several capital increases since 1993. This reflects the continuing need for public banks to meet
large loan provision requirements as well as the policy of several banks to distribute annual dividends to
support stock prices in spite of weak capital and inadequate provisioning.



12
43.    Since the end of 1996, unfavorable stock market conditions have reduced the opportunity for
share offerings to increase bank capital. In addition, share offerings by Tunisiani banks on the stock
exchange have often led to share capital dilution, since they were achieved througil pre-emptive rights and
with exercise prices often set much lower thani stock market prices withoLit dividend adjustmeit. Despite
this lack of incentives, the capital base of the Tunisianl bankinlg system has been increasinig steadily. The
largest private bank, BIAT, recently increased its capital through a public share offering on1 the Londoni
market, the first stock issue by a Tunisiani bank on the interniationial market. Banque de l'Habitat (BH) is
in the process of increasing its share capital by 50 percent by issuinlg new shares on the TuLnis stock
exchange.

3. Bank Liquidity, Credit Allocation and Monetary Policy Instruments
44.    Following the liberalization of bank credit allocation, interventions in the money market became
the main monetary instrument of the central bank. In contrast, monetary reserve requirements - set at
two percent of a subset of bank deposits - never played an active role in the conduct of monetary policy.
The current inflation rate is not excessive, and monetary aggregates have been growing commensurate
with nominal GDP. The banking system's credit to the Government is negligible, and the Government's
domestic debt is relatively low, with outstanding government bonds representing less than 16 percent of
GDP.
45.    With an aggregate loan deposit ratio exceeding 100 percent, commercial banks generally have a
high degree of dependence on central bank refinancing facilities. The central bank provides liquidity to
the banking system, mainly through weekly credit auctions orAppels d'Offre (AO). This facility, which
provides seven-day advances, is not, however, a genuine market-based instrument to allocate liquidity,
since banks are not asked to submit interest rate bids in conjunction with their requests for funds, and only
loans to priority sectors, as defined periodically by the central bank, can be presented as collateral.
Priority sectors include mainly agriculture, exports and small business financing.
46.    The interest rate on the AO facility is set by the central bank and has remained essentially fixed
since late 1996. This rate also determines the level of a flat interest rate structure for central bank facilities
with maturities ranging from one day to six months. The central bank also uses reverse AO operations as
needed to absorb excess liquidity in the banking system and to neutralize downward pressure on interest
rates. This form of interest rate peg leads to interest rates that do not promptly reflect changes in market
conditions. In addition, banks have access to an end-of-day liquidity window - operations de fin de
journee - at the central bank to adjust their liquidity. This facility is significantly less expensive than the
seven-day prises en pension, which currently cost 100 basis points more than the rate on AO operations.
Partly as a consequence of relatively inexpensive central bank refinancing facilities, the interbank market
continues to play a limited role as a source of bank liquidity.



13
47.    In comparison with the instrumenits described above, open market operations on governmenit
securities would be a more efficient and neutral monetary instrumlient to regulate and allocate liquidity in
the banking system. However, as discussed in the next section, conditionls for open market operations -
highly capitalized government securities and an efficient clearing and settlemenit system for secondary
market transactions - are not yet in place. Consequently, reforminig the governm1enit securities market is
an essential step towards the introductioni of a market-based meclhaniisimi and the formation of market-
based interest rates. This would gradually replace current monletary instruLmlenits that influjenice credit
allocation. Other remaining restrictions on the creation of market-based interest rates are the two percent
limit on interest paid on bank deposits of less thani three monlthis, whicil constrainis the market for
certificates of deposits, and the interest rate on special savings deposits, whichi has beeni set at the money
market rate mrius two percent since 1987.
4. The Government Securities Market
48.    Government securities outstandinig amounted to TD 3.3 billion, or 15.4 percent of GDP, at thle
end of 1997 and represent 71 percent of governmetit domestic debt. They include Boiis clu Tresor
Cessibles (BTC) in an amount of TD 2.96 billion, and TD 360 million of Bonis du Tresor Ncgociables en
Bourse (BTNB). BTNBs have maturities of 5 and 10 years and are traded on the stock exchange. BTCs
are issued weekly in maturities ranging from  13 weeks to 7 years, and securities with maturities of two
years or more are offered in the conventionlal bullet form or in the forn of self-amortizing securities with
fixed aniual repayments (see Annex Vil). The average initial maturity of BTCs outstandinlg is currently
a little over three years. Banks are the exclusive primary dealers of BTCs and submit weekly bids
containinig the amounts requested and the interest rates per maturity for bonds whichi are issued at par.
This leads to a proliferation of securities with different terms and interest rates and to a large numilber of
single securities, each having a small outstanding amount in circulation. Auction results are not fully
market based, since the effective supply of securities is not revealed to market participants. The Treasury
does not commit to selling at each auction a minimum amount of securities or a predetermined amount of
securities for a given maturity.
49.    BTCs are held by banks through current accounts at the central bank. There is no clearing and
settlement system for secondary market transactions, and consequently there are no outright sales or
purchases of BTCs between market participants. Thus, the yield curve on government securities is fully
determined at auctions, and yields on outstanding Government bonds are not validated by genuine
secondary market transactions. Most of the BTCs bought by banks are nevertheless resold to their
customers through contrats de liquidite, which are a loose form of repurchase agreements (repos)
completed without delivery of securities at an interest rate linked to the money market rate and
redeemable on demand with an initial maturity generally tailored to the customer's needs. Banks have to
assess periodically whether their stock of outstanding repos matches their stock of government bonds in
their accounts at the central bank. Through this practice, banks offer their large depositors interest-
bearing investments redeemable on demand while, by regulation, interest on bank deposits of less than
three months cannot exceed 2 percent.
50.    The Govemment has made significant progress in the preparation of an overall plan for the
reform of the government securities market. A decree was issued in late 1997 to create new benchmark
securities, the Bons du Tresor Assimnilables (BTA) which will allow the development of highly capitalized
government securities as well as a significant reduction in the number of different securities, provided the
BTAs replace most of the currently outstanding BTCs. Also, transactions in the new government
securities will be cleared by the recently established central depository (STICODEVAM) already used for
stock market transactions.



14
5. Mutual Funds, Securities Firms, and the Stock Market
51.    Of the 19 mutual funds in Tunisia, 17 are bank-sponsored mutual funds. These account for 89
percent of total assets of the industry. Mutual funds grew rapidly after the first mutual fund was launched
in 1992 and have total assets of TD 750 million as of March 1998, an amount equal to the mid-1995 level
as a result of a massive bear market sell-off of TD 200 million in 1996. Most of these assets, TD 657
million, are now invested in bond funds following the strong decline in share prices on1 the Tun1is stock
exchange in late 1996 and 1997. Aniex IX shows mutual funds assets by type and sponsor. Mutual
funds are authorized by the Minister of Finance and regulated by the Securities Comm11issioni, the Conseil
du Marche Financier (CMF).  While the regulationi properly emphiasizes investor protection and
transparency, there are no effective "Chinese walls" to limit conflicts of interest and nonl-arimis-length
transactions in a context in which banks act as custodian for their owIn imlutual funids anid fuLid imlanlagers
have close administrative Iinks with bankinlg operations. Other important concernls need to be addressed
to improve investor protection, sucih as the valuation of assets and compliance with custodial and auditilig
rules.
52.    The securities industry is fragmented amonlg 28 securities firms, of whicih 13 are controlled by
banks. Trading securities on behalf of customers accouLIts for almost all of the industry revenues. Since
securities market intermediaries were required to operate througih a dedicated joint-stock company, banks
became technically excluded from the securities industry by virtue of the banking law limitilig equity
investments in a company to 30 percent of a bank's share capital. Banks launched their owIn securities
firms after they were granted a special five-year exemption from this limit by the central bank. As
recognized by market participants, measures are needed to promote consolidation and increase the capital
base of the industry. Also, relative to international standards, the regulation of securities firms remains
incomplete and few of the measures included in the law are accompanied by written directives and
enforcement measures.
53.    Banking institutions represent more than two thirds of the Tunis stock exchange capitalization of
TD 2.7 billion (March 1998) coming from 34 listed companies. Of the nine companies traded on the
continuous trading system, seven are banks, four of which are public sector banks (BNA, STB, BH and
BDET). At 12.5 percent of GDP, stock market capitalization is low relative to countries with a similar
degree of economic development. After a major collapse in trading activity during the 1996-1997 bear
market (which led to price declines of 50 to 60 percent), annual trading remains low, at about TD 590
million in 1997. Half of this comes from off-floor transactions.
54.     The Tunis stock exchange became a private joint-stock company in 1994 and now possesses a
modern infrastructure, including a computerized order flow and trading system in addition to a book-
based central depository for securities and a relatively adequate clearing and settlement system. The
regulation for financial disclosure requirements for initial public offerings would need to be brought more
into line with international standards. This, in particular, would make future privatization through the
stock exchange more transparent as well as potentially more attractive to foreign portfolio investors.
Since early 1997, foreign investors can buy up to 49.9 percent of the share capital of a company listed on
the exchange without prior authorization.
6. The Insurance Sector
55.    The Tunisian market comprises 14 companies collecting a relatively low  level of annual
premiums amounting to about TD 309 million or 1.7 percent of GDP and holding technical reserves of
TD 615 million (1996).  Of the 14 companies, two are state-owned including the largest company,
STAR, with 34 percent of the market, four are mutual, and eight are privately owned companies holding a
58 percent market share. The largest three companies account for 58 percent of the market. The main



15
line of business is automobile insurance accounting for 39 percent of total premiums followed by group
health insurance with 21 percent.  Life insurance represents only 7 percent of total premiums.
Reinsurance plays a big part in the large industrial and commercial risks where ceded premiums amount
to between 60 and 70 percent of gross premiums which are directed mostly to international reinsurance
groups.
56.    Despite some recent positive developments, the insurance sector has continued to suffer from
basic structural weaknesses, such as the chronic technical deficits in compulsory personal lines of
insurance (automobile and group business) and the continuing operation of capital-deficient companies.
The cumulative technical deficit of the industry amounted to nearly TD 100 million over the period 1989-
1996 or about 25 percent of annual premiums. The industry needs to undergo fundamental regulatory and
market reform which should include: (i) restructuring, recapitalizing or closing capital-deficient
companies; (ii) strengthening insurance supervision; (iii) privatizing state-owned companies; (iv) opening
the market to foreign competitors; (v) introducing clear prudential norms and solvency monitoring in line
with international standards; (vi) raising automobile premiums and reforming automobile insurance
practices; and (vii) promoting life insurance through product innovation and private retirement plans.
IV.   PROGRAM OF FINANCIAL SECTOR REFORMS
57.    The Government recognizes the necessity of intensifying financial sector reform in order to
promote higher savings and a more efficient credit allocation. There is also a clear need to modernize the
financial services industry so that it can face the challenge of a more open economy, including free
market access by foreign banks planned for 2001. In late 1996, the Government created a banking
commission on the modernization of the banking system.  The Commission Tunisienne sur la
Modernisation du Systume Bancaire issued its report in the spring of 1997. Both the World Bank and the
IMF (International Monetary Fund) expressed the view  that the Commission's conclusions and
recommendations constitute a solid foundation for a reform agenda to restructure the banking system.
The reforms that would be supported by the ECAL 11 include key recommendations presented in the
Commissioni's report.
A.    Settlement of Non-Performing Bank Loans
58.   Non-Performing Loanis to Public and Semi-Puthlic Enterprises. Under the Government's financial
sector reformi program, about TD 800 million of the total amount of TD I billion of non-performing loans
to public and semi-public enterprises at the end of 1997 will be turned into current loans or removed from
the banks' balance sheets. The settlement involves 180 non-performing loans to 49 public and semi-
public enterprises in more than 15 banks. Three public sector banks, BNA, STB, and UIB, account for 70
percent of the amount of bad loans to be settled. Annex IV shows the distribution of the non-performing
loans across banks. The amount to be settled by the Government will be about TD 700 million after the
exclusion of late interest charges and equity investments. Banks will write off TD 74 million of fully
provisioned late interest charges and will keep their remaining viable equity investments on their balance
sheets.



16
59.    The government settlement will be effected in two rounds. The first round includes 95 loans to 29
enterprises amounting to TD 279 million. Three types of loan settlement are proposed by the Government
as follows:
Table 7. First tranche settlement of non-performing loans to public enterprises
(TD 279 million, 29 public enterprises)
Actual or future status of public    Amount of bad             Type of loan settlement
enterprises                                loans
4 kept as active public enterprises    TD 86.5 million    Government debt service guarantee
I privatized enterprise                TD 48.1 million        Outright cash repayment
24 public enterprises liquidated or to be    TD 144.5 million  Government loan buy-back
liquidated
60.    For the TD 144.5 million of bad loans to be purchased from the banks, the GOT proposes to pay
back the banks over 25 years without interest. The discounted value of this proposed repayment at the
current interest rate on long-term governmenit bonds would be TD 52 million and would add close to TD
90 million to the loan clean-up cost to be assumed by the banks. After deducting the estimated proceeds
from privatization and liquidation, the net cost of settling TD 279 million of bad loans as proposed by the
Government will range from TD 52 million to an amount not likely to exceed TD 70 million.
61.    The second round includes 85 loans to 20 enterprises amounting to TD 409 million excluding late
interest charges and equity investments.  This amount is split about equally between public or
government-controlled enterprises and enterprises where the Government directly or indirectly is a
minority shareholder.  Out of the TD 409 millionl of noni-performing loans, about TD 70 million
represenits off-balance sheet items. A rough estimate puts the expected present value of the net cost of
this settlement at less than TD 150 million. This would bring the total net present cost of settling the
nominial TD 725 million of noni-performinig loans to the 49 public and semi-public enterprises to less than
TD 220 million. The precise actual net cost of this loan settlement cannot be determined in part because
it incIlides contingeint governm1enit liabilities such as debt service guarantees, still undefinied partial
governmiienet finanicial responsibility in loans to enterprises where the Government is a minority
sharelholder and proceeds from the privatization and liquidation of enterprises that are highly uncertain
and may not be settled entirely on a cash basis by the buyers.
62.   iVon-Performing Loans to the Private Sector. In 1997, as a step towards the settlement of non-
performing loans to the private sector whichi amount to TD 4 billion at the end of 1997, the Government
enacted a law for the creation of private debt resolution companies dedicated to the purchase and
collection of bad loans to the private sector. These companies could be useful in settling large numbers of
small non-performinig loans. However, they are not seen by the banking community to be an effective
instrument for the settlement of large loans to large private enterprises. No debt resolution company has
been launched until now partly because of unsettled tax issues regarding the treatment of capital losses
and the reversal of loan provisions arising from the sale of non-performing loans. Under this reform
Program, the Govemment proposes to introduce tax measures that would promote the use of private debt
resolution companies.
63.    The Proposed Loan Settlement and Resolution of Loan Provision Shortfalls. According to central
bank data, the proposed settlement of TD 700 million of non-performing loans will reduce the loan
provision shortfall in the banking system from TD 365 million to TD 165 million and, essentially, all



17
banks except two will become in compliance with loan provisioning requirements. Since, according to
the prudential regulations, shortfalls in loan provisions are deducted from bank regulatory capital,
reducing shortfalls in provisioning would also lead to an increase in bank capital adequacy by about 6
percent.
B.    Privatization, Liquidation, and Restructuring of Public and Semi-public Enterprises
64.    To limit the recurrence of bad loans to public and semi-public enterprises, the Government will
make conclusive decisions about the status and operations of the 49 public and semi-public companies
concerned by the proposed loan settlement. As part of the first tranche measures, the Government will, as
mentioned earlier, retain four of the 29 public enterprises. One enterprise, a cement company, was
recently sold to foreign investors, and 24 have been or will be put into liquidation. The assets' book value
of enterprises removed from the public sector in this first round exceeds TD 200 million.  The
Government's decisions on the 20 other enterprises are part of the second tranche measures.  A
preliminary assessment of these 20 enterprises indicates that at least four of the 20 enterprises are
potential candidates for privatization, four could be liquidated, five could be restructured, and three are
agricultural cooperatives whose future viability is strongly dependent on government policies. The book
value of assets of this second group of enterprises is about TD 550 million. As implied by their high
level of indebtedness, most of these entities are loss-making enterprises. The list of enterprises concerned
by the loan settlement is provided in Annex IV.
C.    The Governance of Public Sector Banks, Bank Privatization, and the Merger of
Development Banks
65.    The latest evidence of the gradual withdrawal of the Government from the financial sector was
the privatization of the Banque du Sud in late 1997. In order to relinquish the administrative control over
the bank, the Government held a public share offering that reduced government ownership below 34
percent. Under the law, government ownership above 34 percent, as opposed to 50 percent for other
types of enterprises, mandates government administrative control of commercial banks and insurance
companies. The Government will remove the 34 percent threshold included in the law on public
enterprises.
66.    Under the proposed reform program, the Government has agreed to privatize IJIB, the fourth
largest public sector bank accounting for 9 percent of total commercial bank assets. UIB will first be
merged with a development bank, BTEI. The core book capital of each bank is about the same size,
around TD 95 million, and the merged bank will have the second largest capital base in the banking
system after BNA, with about 19 percent of the total core capital of commercial banks. Since the risk-
weighted capital ratio of BTEI is above 30 percent, the merger will lead to a stronger commercial bank.
As part of the second tranche measures, the Government will put up for sale through an open bidding
process its participation in the merged bank UIB-BTEI.
67.    The Government plans to consolidate the banking system  through additional mergers of
development banks. The Government will launch a feasibility study on the merger of the two public
sector development banks, BDET and BNDT, with STB, a public sector commercial bank. Also, the
Government will eliminate the development bank category as part of the revision of the banking law to be
completed under this program and will adopt homogeneous bank licensing requirements giving access to
a single type of bank license.



18
D.    Reform of the Banking System's Regulatory Framework and Enforcement of Prudential
Regulation
68.    Revision of the Banking Law. The Government will undertake a modernization of the banking
law under the program. In addition to bank licensing, issues to be addressed will include: (i) increasinig
the accountability of the Board of Directors including the duty to establish an audit committee; (ii)
allowing banks to create subsidiaries for the provision of specialized financial services; (iii) strengthening
the control and restrictions on bank transactions with related parties; (iv) introducinig rule-based indicators
to trigger preventive actions from the central bank for banks in financial distress; and (v) establishing
clear rules and procedures on bank receivership.
69.    Higher Capital Adequacy Standards. As set-out in the Government's development plan for 1997-
2001, government policy is to bring prudential regulations of financial institutions in line with
international standards. With respect to the minimum bank capital adequacy ratio currently set at 5
percent, the Government will raise the minimum ratio to 8 percent, as defined by the Basle Committee.
Since the aggregate private banks' capital adequacy ratios already exceeds the international standard, this
measure will mainly affect public sector banks. To meet this objective, the major public banks listed on
the stock market may have to issue new shares, which will likely dilute the Government's stake.
70.    Compliance with Loan Provisioning Requirements. Under the proposed reforn program, the
Government will take all supplementary measures required to bring public sector banks into full
compliance with the current loan provision and capital adequacy standards. This will include increasiig
the tax deductibility of loan provisions for all banks from the current limit of 50 percent of before-
provision earnings.
71.   Improving Loan Recovery and the Quality of Loan Collateral. As recommended by the Tunisian
banking commission on the modernilzationi of the bankinig sector, a set of legal measures will be presented
to the House of Representatives to improve the quality and foreclosure of loan collateral. The measures
include: introducing a speedier registration process for mortgages at the Conservation de la Propriete
Fonci&re; preserving the priority of first mortgages when borrowers fall under legal bankruptcy
protection; removing the legal interdiction against collecting capitalized interest rates on loans in arrears;
removing the three-year limit on the collection of unpaid interest in mortgage foreclosures; improving
procedures on foreclosure and judicial sale; and enhancinig the quality of liens on farm credit.
72.    Newo Financial Disclosure Standards. A  new  bank accounting framework in line with
interniational standards and requiring presentation of consolidated financial statements will also be
adopted. The new bank accounting framework will be enforced for the 1999 fiscal year and full
compliance with the new standards including consolidated bank financial statements is scheduled for
fiscal year 2000. Clear rules on loan write-offs will be introduced in order to limit the build-up of
outdated non-performinig loans. NPLs that hold no chance of recovery continue to be kept on banks'
balance sheets for tax or legal considerations, or because they are guaranteed by the government, in
contradictioni with international accountinig principles.
73.    Modernizing the Check Clearing and Bank Payments System. The reform program will support
the establishmenit of a reliable and efficient interbank payments system that will allow checks and other
bank payments to be settled within 48 hours. The reform program consists of an electronic interbank
payment system under the responsibility of the central bank, and will require the development of a
performing telecom network for electronic data transmission between the central bank, the banks' head of
offices, and their main branches. An electronic document imaging system will also be introduced to limit



19
the movement of paper documents in the settlement of payment transactionis. Automation of clearing and
settlement will require the standardization of paymenit instrumenlts, and legal improvemenits to create the
proper legal foundation for electronic bank payments and to combat fraud withi the related data
transmission facilities need to be made. The reform program will first imiplemilenit fund transfers and, in a
later phase to begin in mid-1999, will encompass interbanik check clearing and settlemenit.
E.    Reform of the Government Securities Market
74.    Revisions and improvemenits in the program being prepared by the Treasury for the reformi of the
governmenit securities market will consist mainly of: (i) strengthieniilng the role of the central bank in the
issuance and clearance of the new benchmark securities (BTAs); (ii) amenidinig the central bank law to
increase the central bank's capacity for open-nmarket operations; (iii) revising the status, licensilig and
performance requirements of primary dealers to promote a healthy degree of competition from non-banik
participants and to allow banks to operate directly as prinary dealers, as opposed to conducting these
operations throughi a securities firm subsidiary; and (iv) reviewing the auctioln meclhanlisimi for the current
government securities (BTCs) in order to limit the proliferation of different types of securities and enforce
market-based practices. A step-wise program for phasling out new issues of BTCs and for replacing the
TD  3 billion of maturilng BTCs by the new  benchlimark securities (BTA) will be prepared and
implemented, and the first new issues of BTAs will be launciled. The modified and expanded reforn of
the government securities market, included in the first and second tranche measures of this reform
program, is in line with the recommendationis recently issued by an IMF techinical mission oni monetary
management in Tunisia.
F.     Enhancing the Regulation of Financial Market Intermediaries
75.    The Government intends to present to the House of Representatives a new regulatory framework
on1 mutual funds and other types of managed funds. The framework will fill important gaps in the current
regulation on issues such as asset valuation, investmenit policies, non-arms-lengtlh transactions, reporting
requirements and disclosure standards. A draft proposal was recently submitted for comments to market
participants. The Conseil du Marche Finiancier is preparing a new set of regulations and directives on1
securities firms that will increase minimum capital requirements for firms involved in investment banking
services, create a proper separation of functions between brokerage and fund management services, and
introduce explicit prudential standards. Both sets of regulations are part of the second tranche measures.
G.    Improving the Disclosure Standards and Solvency of Insurance Companies
76.    The financial sector reform program will only partially address some of the critical issues limiting
the development of the insurance industry that could be included in a separate comprehensive reform
encompassing insurance companies and pension funds. Under the reform program, a state-owned
insurance company, Lloyds Tunisien, one the two most capital-deficient companies in the industry, will
be recapitalized and restructured to meet the industry's solvency standards.  The company had
accumulated losses of 28.3 million in 1996 against equity capital of 3.1 million and technical reserves of
TD 28.2 million. The Government may later sell the company to existing or new industry participants.
Also, to improve prudential monitoring, a new accounting framework will be introduced.



20
H.    Fiscal Cost of Reforms
77.    The cost of the reform program is mostiy associated with the settlemenit of noni-perforiniig bank
loans to public and semi-public enterprises. For the most part. the cost to the Governmiienet of settliig
these bad loanis will be considered as a finanicinig item included in the governmiienlt financinig needs, as
opposed to a budget current expenditure, in an approacil similar to that used previously for the arrears of
the Caisse Gon&rale de Compensation (CGC) whicil in the case of Office des ('rea/es and Office
National de l'Huile were amortized over a twelve year period. As discussed earlier, dependinig on the
type of loan settlemilenlt to be used by the Governillenit for different groups of loans to public and semi-
public enterprises, the proposed settlement of noni-performiniig loans with a total face value of more thanl
TD 700 million would have a net present value of less thani TD 200 millioll. This lowel amount would
result from the reimbursement of some loans over 25 years without interest, the cancellationi of more thall
TD 70 million of off-balance sheet items associated with the settlemenit of outright loans in arrears, the
settlement of loans by the Governm1lenit throughi continigenit debt service guarantees (for which the actual
cost could be minimal), and proceeds from the privatization of some of public and semi-puiblic enterprises
conicerned by the loan settlemilenit. Loan recovery from the liquidation of public enterprises is likely to be
negligibie since the enterprises to be liquidated have a significanit amounit of unpaid taxes and social
security contributionis tlat have a privileged claim on liquidationl proceeds. Interest expenses of the loan
settlement, if any, will be included in the government budget.
V.   PROPOSED LOAN
A.     Loan Amount and Borrower
78.    The proposed loan, in the amount of EUJRO  138,0 million, will be made to the Republic of
Tunisia in the form of a standard adjustment loan of two tranches in equal amounts with an expected
disbursement period of two years. Second tranche release will be conditional on achievinig satisfactory
completion of the reform  program, including compliance with the core conditions for second tranche
release stipulated in the Loan Agreement. The loan would be at fixed rate and single currency for up to 15
years with a three-year grace period.
B.     Tranching and Conditionality

C.    Disbursement, Financial Management and Auditing
81.    The Borrower will be the Republic of Tunisia. The coordinationi of the reform  program  will
carried out by the Direction des Previsions of the Ministry of Economic Developmenit. The Borrower will
be required to open and maintain Deposit Accounts in its Central Bank. As each tranclie is released, the
Borrower will submit a withdrawal application under the Bank's recently introduced simplified
disbursements procedures against which the Bank will disburse the loan proceeds for the Borrower's use
into the Deposit Accounts. If, after deposit into the Deposit Accounts, the proceeds of the loan or any
part thereto is used for ineligible expenditures, as defined in the loan agreement, the Bank requires the
Borrower to either (a) return that amount to the Deposit Accounts for use for eligible purposes, or (b)
refund the amount directly to the Bank, in which case the Bank will cancel an equivalent undisbursed
amount of the loan. Although the Bank will not routinely require an audit of the Deposit Accounts, it will
reserve the right to do so. The loan will be made on a two-trancile basis in equal amounts. The projected
date for second tranche release would be 12 months after loan effectiveness.
D.    Rationale for Bank Assistance
82.    Financial sector reform  is part of the specific program  objectives included in the Country
Assistance Strategy. The proposed Bank financial assistance follows the completion of a policy based
loan, the ECAL I, and aims at providing sustained support to a series of reforms in the financial sector to
supplement ongoing reforms in the real sector that are designed to meet the challenge of trade
liberalization. Both programs are associated with parallel support from the EU which for the ECAL I
accompanied the "nmise a niveau" program to restructure private sector enterprises and to introduce a
vocational training program for retraining the labor force. Other sectors identified as part of an overall
plan to raise the competitiveness of the Tunisian economy are transport, telecommunications and
agriculture.
83.    Bank support for this reform program in the form of adjustment lending represents a contribution
to the country's external financing needs in a context where the country's balance of payments continues
to be vulnerable to the external environment. This vulnerability is characterized mainly by: (i) the
weakening of the trade balance in the short-term due to the implementation of the free trade association
with the European Union, and (ii) the tightening of lending conditions on international capital markets.
84.   In 1999, the total capital needed to finance the projected current account deficit and meet external
debt service obligations while increasing official reserves to a level equivalent to 2.8 months of imports,
is estimated at US$2 billion. Disbursements under the proposed loan and parallel financing in 1999 could
contribute US$195 million (of which US$ 75 million from the IBRD, US$ 50 million from the EU and
US$ 70 million from AFDB). Assuming that external long-term public borrowings and grants will
continue along current trends, and that foreign direct investment will be above recent levels but lower
than the 1998 amount (which was boosted by exceptionally high privatization receipts), there will still
remain about US$ 900 million to be mobilized from private sources of which about half is expected to



23
come from trade financing. With risks of a global economic slowdown in the aftermath of the financial
crises in East Asia and Russia and the recession in Japan, it is likely that Tunisia and other emerging
market economies will not only continue to face high spreads but may also experience some withdrawal
of private financing.
E.     Benefits and Risks
85.    Completion of the proposed reform program would lead to reduced government presence in the
banking sector by decreasing bank assets under government control from about 52 percent to 43 percent
of total bank assets. It will also improve the soundness of the banking system by supporting compliance
with loan provisioning requirements, and introducing a higher minimum capital adequacy ratio and more
accurate financial statements in line with international standards. In addition to a more robust banking
system, the reform program will promote more efficient and market-based credit allocation, more
competitive provision of bank services and greater savings mobilization throughi noni-banik financial
intermediaries. The reform program will also enhance the capacity of the banking system to adjust to
external and internal shocks throughi improved monetary management instruments.
86.    The proposed settlement of non-performing bank loans is based on the central bank's current
assessment of outstanding loans in arrears to public and semi-public enterprises. The liquidation,
privatization, or restructuring of these enterprises will undoubtedly limit the recurrence of non-performing
loans in the future. However, as further integration wvith the European Union and the world economy will
increase foreign competition, financial performance may yet deteriorate in selected sectors of the
economy and may hamper the continued improvement in the quality of the banking system's loan
portfolio. A related risk, which would amplify the preceding risk, is a possible reversal in Government's
commitment to reduce its presence in the financial sector and adopt a genuine arms-length policy on
credit allocation in the banking system. In particular, loans from public sector banks could be used under
government directives to support employmenit in the most vulnerable and inefficient sectors of the
economy and delay the necessary adjustments towards a more open economy.
87.    There are several counteractive measures to limit these risks: (i) proper enforcement of bank
prudential regulations limiting the possibility of banks to exceed their lending capacity, and raising
minimum capital adequacy ratios; (ii) restricting access to bank credit by non-commercial government
entities; (iii) promoting neutral monetary management instrumenits as opposed to central bank targeted
refinanicing facilities; (iv) increasing discipline in credit risk management through improved loan
collateral and loan recovery procedures; and (v) speeding up the privatization program to let the private
sector assume a larger part of the new investments required to increase productivity.  In parallel,
governmenit initiatives to increase labor market flexibility would also contribute to minimize the social
costs of transitionial and sectoral adjustments.
F.     Social Impact
88.    Losses ofjobs may occur in the short term as a consequence of public enterprise reforms. Under
the proposed reform program, 24 public enterprises will be liquidated. Most of them have been inactive
for months and some for years, and most of their labor force has already been transferred by the
Government to other public sector entities. As an extension of the social safety net, the Government
created the Fonds de Restructuration des Entreprises Publiques (FREP) to which is allocated a portion of
the proceeds from privatization to fund severance payments and other worker compensation and also to
prepare other public enterprises for privatization.  In addition, in parallel with the ECAL 1, the
Government undertook in 1996 a Second Training and Employment Project (Loan N. 4036) to facilitate



24
the placement of unemployed people and retrain the labor force. Also, part of the financial aid that the
EU will provide in conjunction with the ECAL 11 will be targeted to social programs.
G.    Bank Exposure and Other Bank Group Operations
89.    With regard to the external debt sustainability and exposure indicators for Tunisia, the debt to
GDP ratio decreased from 59 percent in 1997 to 52 percent in 1998 because of the absence of borrowing
on external financial markets by the Government in 1998. The debt to GDP ratio, including the proposed
loan and the other parallel financing contributions, is projected to continue its downward trend and is
expected to fall below 50 percent by 2000. The debt service ratio (debt services as a share of export
receipts) fell from 18 to 1 7 percent between 1997 and 1998. It is projected to decrease further in 1999
before reverting to about 18 percent in the year 2000 owing to the beginning of debt servicing of Samurai
bonds issued a few years ago.
90.    During 1999-2002, IBRD debt service as a share of public debt service will remain below 20
percent, and the ratio of IBRD debt service to export receipts will remain around 3 percent. In addition,
the IBRD share in total debt will continue to decrease as foreseen in the Country Assistance Strategy.
91.    As of December 1998, cumulative commitments to Tunisia less cancellations amounted to US$4
billion of which US$3.2 billion have been disbursed. During FY98, gross disbursements were US$130.6
million while repayments reached US$192 million, bringing cumulative repayments to a total of US$1.7
billion. The Status of Bank Operations is detailed in Annex XII.
VI.  RECOMMENDATION
I am satisfied that the proposed loan complies with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and
recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.

LETTER OF DEVELOPMENT POLICY
Mr. James D. Wolfensohn                                                    January 21, 1999
President
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development
1818 H St. N.W
Washington D.C.
Unofficial translation of French version
Dear Mr. President,
While the world is undergoing major changes, Tunisia is entering a new phase in its development,
characterized by a more open economy and increasing integration into the world economy. The signing
of the Association Agreement with the European Union (EU) represents, in this regard, a crucial and
appropriate step toward enhancing the liberalization of the Tunisian economy and intensifying
cooperation with the EU.
This important liberalization offers immense economic potential through market expansion and
increased opportunities for trade. It entails, however, major challenges related, in particular, to a much
higher level of competition, which will require a redoubling of efforts to increase the competitiveness of
the economy and upgrade its comparative advantage.
The Ninth Plan (1997-2001) has the strategic objective of increasing economic competitiveness so
as to achieve deeper integration with the world economy and the highest degree of economic
preparedness for the next millennium. In this regard, the Plan highlights the need to accelerate economic
growth and maintain financial balances - both domestic and external - in order to ensure the
sustainability of economic development and enhance, in parallel, the country's financial credibility in the
international community. The main objectives of the Ninth Plan are: achieving higher economic growth,
which should reach an average of 6 percent in real terms; increasing the level of investment to a ratio of
27.5 percent in 2001, compared to 23.2 percent in 1996; reducing the current account deficit from 2.9
percent of GDP in 1996 to 2.2 percent in 2001; and limiting the budget deficit to 2.0 percent of GDP in
2001 as opposed to 4.3 percent in 1996.
Fulfilling these development objectives will require increased economic competitiveness and more
efficient resource allocation. To this end, the country has undertaken an extensive program to modernize
the economy. In addition to consolidating the basic industrial infrastructure, the main comnponents of this
program aim at adapting and increasing the competitiveness of the industrial base, upgrading its enabling
environment, and improving the performance of professional training initiatives.
In this context, and in order to ensure continued improvement in the competitiveness of its
economy, Tunisia has started to implement a first structural adjustment program (ECAL 1), jointly
supported by the World Bank and the EU. The reform program put forthi in connection with this operation
pertains to a wide range of issues such as foreign trade, the fiscal regime, reduction of Government
presence in the economy, deregulation and facilitation of international trade (i.e., maritime transport and
harbors, telecommunications, legal framework), and the labor market. Tunisia has also demonstrated its
commitment to reform by beginning to implement the EU Agreement of Association two years before its
ratification, and by introducing the necessary related measures - not only the economic modernization
program, but also fiscal reforms such as expansion of the VAT fiscal base and the revision and
harmonization of tax rates.



Annex I
Page 2 of 7
The privatization program has also recently achieved improved results. Privatization initiatives
completed in 1998 involved 23 enterprises, as opposed to an average of 16 enterprises during the 1995-
1997 period, with sale proceeds amounting to about TD 435 million. This is more than the cumulative
privatization proceeds of the last ten years, due mainly to the successful privatization of two large cement
factories.
These various reforms are laying the foundation for the country's deeper integration with the
European market and the world economy. They have already produced some important achievements in
the first two years of the Ninth Plan (1997-1998). For example: the average annual growth rate reached
about 5.3 percent; the budget deficit was brought down to 3 percent in 1998; and the inflation rate was
kept at 3.7 percent in 1997 and 3.1 percent in 1998. These results derived from sound economic
management based, in particular, on rigorous monetary and financial policies that enhanced the
creditworthiness of the country and thus helped to mobilize a large amount of borrowed funds on
international financial markets.
Encouraged by these achievements, Tunisia has committed itself, for the remainder of the period
of the Ninth Plan, to continue and intensify its reform program. For the remaining period of the Ninth
Plan (1999-2001), the country aims to achieve an average growth rate above 6.5 percent, which is
necessary to meet the new demand for jobs and to reduce the pressure of unemployment. Likewise, the
current account deficit shall be reduced from 3.8 percent of GDP in 1998 to 2.2 percent by 2001. The
fulfillment of these objectives requires a sustained level of investment, especially from the private sector,
along with a strengthening of national savings, both of which constitute a serious challenge.
In spite of promising prospects, private investnent in Tunisia remains far below the anticipated
level that would be required to fully meet new aggregate demand in a context in which the Tunisian
economy is facing eminent challenges, namely the dismantling of tariffs for products on List No. 4,
established in the free trade association program with the EU. This list includes products that are similar
to locally produced goods, and which are more heavily taxed than to those found on other lists. This
planned tariff removal may well entail a much more potent impact on customs revenues and on the
country's industrial fabric.
Conversely, further progress on the implementation of reforms and fulfillment of our
commitments with the WTO and the EU will promote greater trade liberalization in important areas such
as financial services and farm products. Undoubtedly, this greater openness of international trade will
provide greater opportunity to speed up economic growth and intensify the country's development, but
also carries with it major constraints which will mainly affect the balance of payments and the state
budget, especially since the world economy is more unstable today than it was at the time of the signing
of the free trade association with the EU. This increasingly competitive environment may well reduce the
attractiveness of foreign direct investment and bring about new challenges.
In order to cope with these challenges and achieve its economic objectives, the Government has
prepared a structural economic reform program and wishes to receive the support of the World Bank in
the form of a quick disbursement operation. The program, which would be jointly supported by the EU
under a structural adjustment facility and co-financed by the African Development Bank will strengthen
progress already achieved through the macro economic adjustments and sectoral reforms introduced in
the last decade.



Annex I
Page 3 of 7
Macroeconomic Framework
Setting up an appropriate macro economic framework is a crucial concern for Tunisia. The macro-
economic policies aim at achieving rapid economic growth while preserving domestic as well as external
financial equilibrium. Greater effort will be devoted to intensify export promotioni. maintaini adequate
foreign exchange reserves and pursue a judicious fiscal policy.
Foreign exchanges reserves will be kept at an acceptable level by giving proper considerationi, on
the one hand, to large capital inflows associated with privatization and, on the other hand, to potential
turbulence in international financial markets leading to reduced foreign borrowing opportunities. As to
fiscal equilibrium, the objective for 1999 is to limit the budget deficit to 2.8% of GDP, or 3.4% of GDP
excluding proceeds from privatization, on the basis of a rigorous fiscal policy aimin1g at controllinig public
expenditures and increasinig budget revenues.
Under this adjustment operation, the Govermiienit will monlitor semianinually the country's macro-
economic performance relative to a periodically updated framework, in collaboration with the World
Bank and in consultation with the IMF, in order to achieve sustainable macro economic equilibrium, to
further liberalize the economy, and to reduce the government debt burden.
Progress achieved towards the fulfillment of economic objectives will be assessed on the basis of
the following indicators: current account deficit relative to GDP; budget deficit relative to GDP; foreign
exchange reserves expressed in number of months of imports; growth rate of exports in manufactured
goods; foreign debt relative to GDP; GDP growth rate; and the inflation rate.
The Reform Program
In this crucial phase of economic and social development, the Tunisian Government is firmly
committed to deepening and accelerating reforms, especially in the financial sector. This strategy reflects
the financial sector's role in achieving increased savings mobilization and greater efficiency in resource
allocation and, hence, in generating the robust economic growth needed to support greater integration
into the world economy and to raise the domestic and international competitiveness of the Tunisian
economy.
In this context, and in addition to the modernization program of the regulatory and operational
framework, the banking sector will be restructured to allow the emergence of larger banks capable of
facing international competition and also to strengthen the private sector participation in the banking
industry.
To this end, the second economic competitiveness adjustment loan (ECAL 11) will support
Government efforts in the following areas: (i) settlement of non-performing loans to public and
semipublic enterprises; (ii) modernization of banking activity; (iii) bank restructuring and corporate
governance; (iv) modernization of the Treasury bond market and monetary instruments; and (v) reform of
the insurance sector.
I.  Settlement of Non-Performing Bank Loans to Public and Semipublic Enterprises
Strengthening the financial soundness of the banking system is one of the main objectives of the
country's current economic and financial policies. The Government intends to work out appropriate



Annex I
Page 4 of 7
solutions to reduce obstacles to bank loan recovery and protect the banks' righitful financial interests.
Appropriate solutions have been identified to settle noni-perforiing loans and improve the quality of bank
loan portfolios.
Immediate actions involvilng 138 enterprises, with iiol-performiinig loans totaling TD 768 million,
are included in the 1999 Finance Law. These actions inclLide:
(i)    settlement of bank loans to CJO amounting to TD 48.2 million;
(ii)    provision of Government debt service guarantees to consolidated bank loans amortized over a 25
year period  without interest for an amount of TD 171 million involvinig 13 enterprises (four
public enterprises, six farm services cooperatives, two regional transport companiies and OPNT)
(iii)   Government buyback of noni-perforiniig loans to 125 public and semipublic enterprises that are
either in the process of liquidation, to be liquidated, or to be privatized. This debt will be
rescheduled over a period of 25 years without interest for a total amounit of TD 549 millioni.
The World Bank-supported program will address the settlemenit of noni-performinig loans to 49
public and semipublic enterprises, totaiing about TD 710 million. This includes tlle CJO bank debt, the
Government debt service guarantee to four enterprises that will remaini in the public sector, and the
Governmenit buyback of bank loans to 24 enterprises that have been liquidated or are in the process of
liquidation.
As for the 20 remaining enterprises, decisions on their privatization or liquidationl will be taken
during 1999. Thereafter, the Government will settle their unpaid loan balances. In the meantime, access to
bank credit by these enterprises will be monitored on a case-by-case basis to limit loan arrears.
Concurrently, measures will be put in place to remove access to bank credit by noni-commercial
public entities. Furthermore, to shorten delays in the liquidationi of public enterprises, a draft law
amending the February 1, 1989 law (No. 89-9) on public enterprises and institutionls will be adopted in
order to limit to a three-year period the completion of formal liquidation procedures for government-
approved liquidation programs.
II.  Modernization of Banking Activity
The Government is paying increased attention to the implementation of the banking system's
modernization program, which will enable banks to improve the provision of financial services, raise the
efficiency of financial intermediation, comply with prudential regulation, and increase the security of
financial transactions. Initiatives outlined in this program cover the institutional, legal, and regulatory
framework as well as logistical and technical areas.
A review of banking legislation is one of the main actions to be undertaken by the Government to
revamp the banking system's legal and regulatory framework. The new measures will promote expansion
of bank services and sound banking practices and will increase the financial system's capacity to
withstand both external and domestic shocks.
New measures will introduce, in particular, a single bank license and uniform bank licensing
requirements. This will remove the current regulatory partitioning of banking activity and allow each
bank to freely use its financial, technical and commercial capacity in the provision of a wide range of
financial services including specialized activities. Also, duties and responsibilities of bank managers and
Board members will be defined more explicitly, and clear conditions and procedures on regulatory



Annex I
Page 5 of 7
intervention for banks in financial distress will be established. In addition to these measures, the
Government will present to Parliament a draft law on an improved legal framework and judicial
procedures for loan collection.
Bank prudential regulation introduced in 1992 will be furthier upgraded in line with international
standards to promote the financial soundness of the banking system. The central bank will issue circulars
to raise the minimum capital adequacy ratio from 5 to 8 percent. and will introduce a new definition of
tier-two bank capital.
The Government plans to introduce additional measures to facilitate bank loan collection. Tax
interpretation bulletins on loan resolution companies will be issued to allow the tax deductibility of
capital losses on loan sales.
The Government also intends to improve the tax treatment of specific loan provisions in order to
promote proper loan provisioning of non-performing loans. To this end, in the 1999 Finance Law, the
ceiling on tax-deductible annual loan provisions was increased from 50 to 75 percent of before-provision
annual earnings. The higher ceiling will help banks address their loan provision shortfalls. Moreover,
banks will be allowed to write off non-performing loans that are fully provisioned and legally recognized
by a court ruling.
Also, the Government is about to publish a new bank accounting framework in line with
international standards. The new framework will increase the uniformity and transparency of banks'
financial statements, and thus facilitate bank financial analysis and management.
Concurrently, the Government is paying particular attention to implementing the technical
component of the banking system modernization program to keep pace with international best practice.
This component includes:
(i)    Improving payment instruments by introducing a modern electronic clearing system
capable of settling payments within 48 hours;
(ii)    Setting up a central information collection system providing reliable data in real time to
help banks assess credit risk and to optimize bank risk management;
(iii)   Setting up computer backup centers under control of the central bank to protect bank
financial data and ensure rapid resumption of normal daily banking operations following
system failures;
(iv)   Creating a specialized transport company to ensure the safe physical movement of funds;
(v)    Strengthening the provision of non-cash and electronic payment instruments through
improved standardization and institutional framework and through better product
development.
III. Bank Restructuring and Management
The Government's commitment to banking system reform is also demonstrated by its strategy to
facilitate the consolidation and restructuring of the banking sector. This strategy aims at creating
synergies among banks, and at supporting the emergence of solid banking institutions with substantial
technical and financial capabilities.
As part of this effort, the Government has decided to merge two banks, BTEI and UIB. First, a
financial advisory firm will be recruited to complete a financial assessment of the two banks. Then, the



Annex I
Page 6 of 7
new banking institution created by the merger will later be privatized as part of this reform program.
Concurrently, the Government has already undertaken a study pertaining to the merger of three other
banks, STB, BDET, and BNDT. As a step towards the merger of these three banks, a finanlcial advisory
firm will also be recruited to conduct the relevant finanlcial assessmenlts.
Government administrative control of public sector banks will be revised to make it more flexible
through the introduction of more modern organizationial structures and manlagemenit control systems. The
34 percent threshold on the government ownership of bank shares, wlicih, if exceeded, allows the
government to transform a bank into a public sector bank, will be revised. Other measures will include
more explicit duties and responsibilities for bank managers and Board memilbers as well as for bank
auditors.
IV. Modernization of Government Securities, Monetary Instruments and the Capital
Market
To improve the efficiency of the financial system, the Governimlenit intends to further hiarmonize
the different compartments of the capital market. To this end, the Govermiienit, after having granted
licenses to a first group of primary dealers in Governmeit securities, will launcih the first issue of new
benchmark securities (BTA) at the beginninig of this year. Likewise, a phased program for replacing the
existing Treasury securities (BTC) by the new benchmark securities ( BTA) and, in parallel, the clearing
of these new securities through the book-based central depository for securities (STICODEVAM), will be
put in place.
To ensure better management of monetary policy instruments, and to optimize refinancing and
resource-allocation mechanisms, the Government will introduce improvements in money market
operations and attributions of money market participants to promote the use of indirect instruments of
monetary control. To this end, the central bank role in the Government bond market will be expanded,
including its capacity to conduct open market operations.
To continue the modernization of the Tunis stock market, the reforn of the capital market would
include in particular specialized financial institutions, such as mutual funds, which are expected to take on
a larger role in the promotion of stock market activity. Regulations governing the mutual funds will be
improved, and new specific accounting rules will be adopted. Likewise, securities firms will benefit from
the introductioni of a more appropriate regulatory framework meeting the needs of modern capital market
operations.
V.  Insurance Sector Reform
The reform of the insurance sector is part of the financial sector development policy included in
the Ninth Plan. The Government's approach is to undertake the financial restructuring of selected
insurance companies, adopt appropriate measures to promote specific insurance services, and to update
the insurance sector regulatory framework.
As part of this reform, the restructuring of the Lloyd Tunisian financial company in line with
recognized solvency standards will be launched very shortly. In addition, particular attention will be given
to upgrading auto insurance services, which is the largest insurance segment of the industry.
In addition, insurance companies will be called upon to modernize their managerial capacity in
order to increase the productivity of the industry in general and be better prepared for greater foreign
competition. A new accounting framework will be adopted to promote uniformity and transparency of
insurance companies' financial statements.

Conclusion
The Government believes that the detailed reform program outlined in this Letter of Development
Policy will improve the competitiveness of the Tunisian economy. Furthermore, it will reinforce the
country's commitment to economic liberalization and to the modernization of the banking sector. In
addition, the reform program will enhance Tunisia's financial and economic credibility in international
markets. The adoption of this program would be greatly facilitated by the World Bank's acceptance of

Annex VII

BANK PRUDENTIAL REGULATION
The banking sector is overseen by the Central Bank with extensive powers to enforce prudential
norms. In 1991. the Central Bank has issued new prudential regulations with the aim of
strengthening the financial soundness of banks. which set new capital adequacy standards.
required specific classification and provisioning of bad debts. and introduced single borrower
limits.
1.   Bank capital. Deposit-taking banks and development banks are required to have initial
minimum capital of TD 10 million while merchant banks minimum capital is set at TD 3 million.
These requirements also apply to all the foreign banks operating in Tunisia.
2.   Capital adequacy ratio. Current capital adequacy requirements are based upon the asset
risk weighting criteria of the Basle Accord. Tunisian banks must maintain a risk-weighted capital
ratio of 5%. Onlv Tier One capital (fully paid in share capital and disclosed general reserves) may
be included in the calculation. Shortfalls in loan provisions are deducted from capital in the
measurement of capital adequacy ratios.
3.   Monetary bank reserves. Each bank must maintain with the Central Bank a non-interest
bearing reserve equal to 2% of its demand and term deposits, savings account and certificates of
deposits.
4.   Loan classification. Banks are required to classify loans into four classes and make
specific provisions depending on the extent of the delinquency. The four categories are described
as follows:
Delinquency                               Required loan loss provision
-  category 0: performing,                        0%
*  category 1: 0 to 90 days past due,             0%
*  category 2: 90 to 180 days past due,           20%
*  category 3: 180 to 360 days past due,          50%
*  category 4: more than 360 days past due.       100%
Sectoral difficulties, insufficient information, a downtum in economic fundamentals, or other
factors may cause a loan to drop to a lower category.
5.   Lending limit. Regulations in 1991 introduced new lending limits. Prior to 1991,
maximum exposure to a single client could not exceed 40% of a bank's equity. Since 1991,
maximum exposure to a single client may not exceed 25% of the lending bank's equity. In
addition, loans which exceed 5% of a bank's equity may not, in the aggregate, exceed ten times
its equity. Loans to directors, administrators, and shareholders who hold more than 10% of a
bank's share capital may not total more than three times the bank's equity.
6.   Foreign exchange risk exposure ratio. Banks must observe a maximum ratio of 20%
between their overall foreign exchange position and their net capital, and a maximum ratio of
10% between their foreign exchange positions in each currency and their net capital.



Annex VII

7.   Equity investments. A deposit-taking bank may not invest more than 10% of its own
capital in shares of a single enterprise. nor may it hold more than 30% of the shares of a single
enterprise. These percentages max be altered by presidential decree. The Central Bank mav also
authorize a bank to participate in an enterprise at a level above the 30% limit, subject to
designated time limits.
8.   Reporting requirements. All banks including foreign banks agents and branches
operating in Tunisia are required to comply with accounting principles and standards set by the
Central Bank, as specified in the 'Circulaire aux Banques et Etablissements Financiers" issued on
July 1993. They are required to prepare year-end financial statements. including a balance-sheet.
a cash-flow statement. and a profit and loss statement as of December 31. of each year and to
submit the financial statements to their respective shareholders no later than 6 months after vear-
end. Bank auditors must submit their annual report to the Central Bank.
The Central Bank is authorized to subject any bank to an extemal audit and banks must submit to
the Central Bank any document and information, requested to examine their operations.
