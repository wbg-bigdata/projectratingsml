REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE INDUSTRIAL FINANCE CORPORATION OF THAILAND (IFCT)
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE KINGDOM OF THAILAND
I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
in an amount in various currencies equivalent to $12 million to the Industrial
Finance Corporation of Thailand (IFCT), to be guaranteed by the Kingdom of
Thailand. Interest on the loan would be at 7 1/4% per annum. The loan would
be repaid in accordance with the composite amortization schedule of sub-
projects up to a maximum of 15 years, including three years of grace.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
1.        An economic mission vis;'ted Thailand in September 1972.  Its
report, entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects of Thailand",
was distributed to the Executive Directors on March 9, 1973 (R73-40 and
R73-41). The report updated the basic economic report which was distri-
buted to the Executive Directors on January 18, 1972 (R72-12). Another
economic mission visited Thailand in Janua;.^y and February 1974, and its
preliminary conclusions are incorporated below. The full report will be
distributed to the Executive Directors shortly. Country data sheets are
attached as Annex I.
A Time of Change
2.        The sudden relinquishment of power by Prime Minister Field
Marshal Thanom Kittikachorn and Deputy Primie Minister Field Marshal
Prapas Charusathien in the face of massive student-led demonstrations in
Bangkok in October 1973, has opened the way for important political,
social and economic change in Thailand. Some changes have already occured
and others will occur when the constitution that is now being considered
and given final shape by a National Legislative Assembly is enacted.
After more than a quarter of a century of military-dominated rule, inter-
rupted by two brief periods of limited democracy, the Thai nation is now
seeking to make a transition to a more open, participative political system.
A measure of uncertainty is inevitable in such a period, but Thailand is
favored with a homogeneous society, a well-developed national identity
and traditional social values which constitute sources of stability in times
of change.
3.        The issue on which the October uprising focused was a political
one: the demand for a democratic constitution. But other pressures
were at work: discontent with immediate economic conditions (after two
decades of growth without inflation, the growth rate had dropped in
1970-72 and its recovery in 1973 was accompanied by an inflation which
was felt keenly by urban consumers); popular disenchantment with some
of the military leaders; and a growing view among the politically conscious
that the political and administrative superstructure should be changed
to reflect a changed society.



4.        The Government that took office in October 1973, led by Dr. Sanya
Dhammasakdi, a university rector and member of the King's Privy Council, is
pledged to enact a new constitution and then hold a general election in the
second half of 1974. Since it came to power neither through election nor by
force of arms and has no base in a political party, the Government depends
for its stability, firstly, on the authority conferred upon it by the King,
who selected the Prime Minister, and secondly on the support of the public,
which has welcomed the government's announced intention to introduce a new
popularly-based constitution as soon as possible. After an initial period
of turbulence in which increased activism on the part of labor and students
caused some alarm, the basic cohesion and restraint of Thai society are
reasserting themselves and it is generally believed that the present govern-
ment will successfully hand over power to an elected government later this
year.
5.        The new political situation has already had an impact on some
major decisions concerning resource allocation. The monopoly on fertilizer
production and import which had maintained fertilizer prices at an artifi-
cially high level, has been abolished, and some major investmLent proposals
of whose economic justification the public was skeptical have! been dropped,
in one case largely as a result of a campaign by student groups and newspa-
pers.
Growth with Inflation
6.        While the country is having to contend with the unf'amiliar
problem of inflation (in 1973, the GDP deflator rose by 8% and the con-
sumer price index by 12%), it is enjoying dramatic gains in the levels of
demand and prices in international markets for its commodity exports, rice,
rubber, tin, maize and sugar; this is in marked contrast to the situation
which existed in 1970 and 1971. Between the end of 1971 and the middle
of 1973, the prices of Thailand's exports rose by 61%, their volume grew
by 24%, and the nation's terms of trade improved by 38%. Cornsequently
the value of exports of goods and services increased by 24% in 1972 and
32% in 1973. This export growth has strongly stimulated aggregate demand;
private investment grew by 11% in 1973 but is believed to have levelled
off since October because investors feel they should act caut:iously in the
face of recent political and social change. The expansion of real GDP was
9% in 1973, after a drop in agricultural production due to drought had
brought it down to 3% in 1972.
7.        Domestic prices for agricultural commodities have rLot been pre-
vented from rising along with export prices: since the end of 1971 the
average wholesale price of agricultural commodities has risen by 50%, the
wholesale prices of paddy and maize by about 100% and of rubber by 150%.
By comparison, the non-food component of the consumer price index increased
by only 16%. In the last two years, these price increases have produced
real income gains outside Bangkok of between one quarter and one half,
depending on the region. While much of the initial profit muLy have accrued
to middle men, farmers have been gaining substantially also. In the next
few years, the question will arise whether the gains of the Less-developed
regions in general and farmers in particular can be maintained.



-3-
Monetary and Fiscal Management and Development Planning
8.        The primary response of Government to the new inflationary
situation has been to restraln the growth of its expenditure. In 1973,
total public expenditures declined in real terms by 2% and dropped as a
percentage of GNP from 21.9% to 19.8%. The FY 1974 budget is likely to
maintain the public sector's share of GDP. Since the share of capital as
opposed to current expenditures in this amount has declined the question
arises whether the Government is providing adequately for public needs.
Tax measures taken since October coupled with a degree of inflationary
buoyancy are likely to reverse the decline in revenues as a share of GNP
but the public sector's fiscal deficit will probably remain as large as in
1973. Domestic savings have maintained their high level. Money and quasi-
money increased by 26% in 1973 as the Bank of Thailand allowed the banking
system to accommodate the price increases originating abroad with a 35%
increase in Bank credit to the private sector.
9.        Development planning suffered during the last two years
because a decline in the influence of the National Economic and Social
Development Board resulted in resource allocations being made on an
ad hoc basis. The recent appointment of a new Secretary-General of the
Board may help to reverse this decline.
10.       The two regional planning studies which have so far been issued,
for the Northeast and North, have not yet had the impact on the economy
which had been hoped for, largely because they have not been translated
into prcgrams and projects. A third study now underway for the South looks
promising; the study team is highly competent and for the first time steps
are being taken to involve operating departments in the consideration and
preparation of specific projects.
The Outlook for the Near Term
11.       There are no supply constraints to prevent Thailand from achiev-
ing 6-8% growth in 1974 and 1975. On the demand side, export markets
should continue to be favorable and consumption demand should respond to
the recent sharp increases in income. Industrial labor is likely to con-
tinue to promote its interests more actively than was the case before 1973,
but no repetition is expected of the extreme activism which followed the
events of October. Cost-push inflation will be present throughout 1974,
with import prices continuing their upward trend.
12.       A question of major importance for the economy in the near term
is the character of the government which will be formed after the elections
later this year. The constitutional debate has been characterized by both
frankness and moderation. There is little to indicate that a government
formed in the near future would depart radically from the economic policies
which have been pursued in recent years, but in an elected parliament strong
expression would be given to the needs of the outlying regions and this would
to some extent counterbalance the influence of Bangkok, of whose political
weight the events of October were a dramatic reminder.



-4-
13.       The newly-demonstrated activism of the press, students and indus-
trial labor is probably reducing the element of paternalism which has char-
acterized relations between government and people, and employer and employee.
A test of the skill of the nation's constitution makers and political leaders
will be whether the institutions they devise and the policies they formulate
can realize the potential benefits of this activism, e.g. a greater display
of economic and social initiative on the part of individuals and groups, more
equal income distribution and a wider sense of participation in the economic
and political process. Providing elections are not delayed too long, private
investors are likely to regain confidence in the course of this year.
Outlook for the Longer Term
14.       The present high population growth rate will create serious
long-term problems in Thailand. The announced goal of the Government's
population policy is to bring the growth rate down to 2.5% by 1976. Birth
control is readily accepted by the population but the Government's pro-
gram is too limited to make feasible even this modest goal. Indeed, there
is no evidence as yet that the birth rate has started to decline: the
population and the labor force continue to grow by 3% per year as they
have done throughout the last decade. In the past, agriculture has been
able to absorb most of the new entrants to the labor force, simply
through extension of the area under cultivation. However, the supply of
new land suitable for cultivation will probably be exhausted before the
end of the 1970s and thereafter employment will have to be created by
increasing the intensity of land use and by transferring larger numbers
to employment in sectors other than agriculture - a much more difficult
and expensive proposition.
15.       Another task relating directly to the rural population which
awaits the Government's attention is the provision of health care in the
countryside. Efforts in this field have been very meagre so far, and
traditional healers remain virtually the only source of medical care
for most country people.
16.       While laissez-faire economic policies have allowed considerable
economic decentralization in Thailand, relations between central and local
government authorities have been characterized by a very high degreee of
centralization. If the regions outside Bangkok are to realize their
full economic and social potential, it will be necessary to strengthen
local administrations and give them greater opportunities to mobilize
local resources and initiative.
Balance of Payments and External Borrowing Program
17.       The recent growth of exports has resulted in a progressive
reduction of the resource gap from $320 million in 1970 (4.9% of GDP) to
$90 million in 1973 (1% of GDP). Reserves increased in 1972 and 1973
and now stand at about $1,080 million which is equivalent to seven months
of 1973 imports. Higher oil prices will increase the cost of petroleum
imports by about $356 million in 1974 (i.e., 3% of GNP), raising the total
import bill by 16%. However, expected capital inflows plus, the favorable



export prices that now exist and the present reserve level, will probably
allow Thailand in 1974 and 1975 to maintain a 7% real growth rate and absorb
the -increased cost of imports (including petroleum). By 1976, however, the
ratio of reserves to imports is likely to have declined to a low level and
Thailand may require a greatly increased capital inflow if it is to maintain
its development efforts. Looking to the longer run, Thailand is well
endowed with potential sources of hydropower and lignite and will be in a
position to slow down the growth rate of the use of petroleum, which
accounted for 83% of energy consumption in 1972.
18.       In May 1973 the Consultative Group for Thailand met to review
the country's development prospects and requirements for external assistance
for the remainder of the Third Plan (1971-76). Because of two devaluations
of the U.S. dollar, considerable increases in the cost of Thailand's imports,
and additions to the list of projects for external financing, the Govern-
ment had revised its projected requirements for commitments of external
public capital during the Plan period from $900 to $1,200 million. This
amount appears likely to be available. In April 1972, the Government of
Japan signed a Y 64 billion credit agreement with the Government of Thailand,
and a year later announced the untying of almost the entire amount.
19.       Considerable progress has been made in project preparation since
the start of the plan. However, external lenders to Thailand are giving
increasing emphasis to projects in agriculture, education and other social
sectors, and this may make it more difficult for the Government to achieve
its target for external borrowing which has traditionally supported projects
in the power, transportation and communications sectors.
20.       Present Government policy is to maintain the private sector's
freedom of access to private credit sources abroad; in consequence, private
capital inflows are expected to continue to finance a significant part of
equipment imports. Since reserves are high and domestic sources of finance
for private investment are not entirely adequate, this policy has been
appropriate so far but may have to be adjusted if the balance of payments
should deteriorate in the future.
21.       At the end of 1973, Thailand's total external debt stood at about
$865 million and the total debt service ratio for the year was 15%. Public
debt forms a small part of total debt and the public debt service ratio was
only 3% in 1973. If commodity prices remain at their recent levels in 1974
and 1975, Thailand's debt service ratio can be expected to decline somewhat
this year and next; thereafter a slowly rising trend is foreseen.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN THAILAND
22.       Since 1950 Thailand has received 28 Bank loans amounting to
$549.4 million, net of cancellations. Most of these have been for trans-
portation ($192 million), irrigation ($69.2 million) and power ($166.0 mil-
lion) with, in addition, one for a dual-purpose power and irrigation project
($65.9 million). The remaining loans have been for education ($21.4 million),
industry ($1 million) and telecommunications ($37 million). In addition,



- 6 -
Thailand has received IDA credits of $19.5 million for education and $12.5
million for irrigation improvement. In general Bank-financedl projects have
been carried out in accordance with expectations. Construct:ion of the third
Bangkok Port project, financed under Loan 702-TH, began 18 months behind
schedule. The delay was mainly caused by the time taken by the Port Authority
of Thailand and its consultants to pre-qualify bidders, amend tender documents
and evaluate bids which were complicated by currency realigmnents. In July
1973, the Executive Directors approved a loan of $55 million to the Metro-
politan Water Works Authority (MWWA) for a Bangkok water supply project.
Signature of this loan was delayed pending the filling of the post of General
Manager of MWWA, which became vacant in August, and the negotiation of an
engineering consultancy contract. A new General Manager has now been ap-
pointed and negotiations for the consultancy contract satisfactorily con-
cluded. In the meantime, however, the estimated cost of the project has
risen greatly and a review of the cost and scope of the project now under
way should be completed before the loan is signed. Annex II contains a
summary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC investments as of
March 31, 1974, and notes on the execution of on-going projects.
23.       The Bank's lending program in Thailand is being diversified.
In the next few years a smaller proportion of it is expected to be devoted
to transportation and power, while projects in irrigation, rural infra-
structure, livestock, education, family planning, industry and forestry
will account for about two-thirds of the program.    Projects are increasingly
selected to achieve a wider geographical spread for development benefits
and one of the main functions of the Regional Mission in Bangkok is to
assist the Government in developing projects which will contribute to this.
A readiness to finance some local costs in appropriate cases will enable it
to participate more fully in projects in agriculture and the social sectors.
24.       In FY75, about three-quarters of the program (by dollar amounts)
is expected to be devoted to projects in the countryside, where incomes are
lowest. It will include a rural infrastructure project and 'Lending for
irrigation, livestock improvement, seed multiplication and possibly rubber
replanting. In addition outlying areas can expect to benefit from projects
now under preparation for educational radio and television and infrastructure
for four regional centers and their environs. Projects of more direct
benefit to towns are expected to include industrial estates and the regional
centers already mentioned.
25.       On December 31, 1972 Bank loans disbursed and outstanding to
Thailand amounted to $205 million, representing 24 percent oJ. the country's
estimated total external debt and 48.4% of the public debt. The level of
Bank commitments is expected to increase substantially over the next
five years, but loans and credits disbursed and outstanding are not expected
to exceeed 30 percent of total external debt by 1978. Servicing of the Bank
debt is expected to account, in 1978, for about 55% of Thailand's public
debt service, but only 15% of its total debt service.
26.       During the last two years we have regarded Thailand as marginally
eligible for assistance from IDA but on the basis of a reappraisal of the



prospects for Thailand's balance of payments in the light of changes in com-
modity prices, and in view of the sharply increased needs of the poorer mem-
bers of IDA for concessional assistance, I do not believe that further IDA
lending to Thailand would be justified. At the same time I believe that
Thailand will be creditworthy for a substantially increased level of lending
from the Bank so that the Bank Group as a whole will be able to make a much
more important contribution to Thailand's economic development than in the
past.
27.       Prospects for IFC operations in Thailand are reasonably good; IFC
began appraisal of a pulp and paper project based on bamboo and bagasse in
the latter part of January 1974.
PART III - THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR
28.       Manufacturing is the second largest sector, after agriculture, in
Thailand's economy and has grown at an average rate of 10% per year during
the period 1967-1973. Its share in GDP increased from 13.6% to about 14.2%
in the same period. In the 1960s, industrial development was characterized
by investment in import substitution industries. However, by the end of the
decade, the opportunities for this form of investment were nearly exhausted
and further import substitution could be obtained only at increasing costs
and behind the protection of steeply rising tariffs. Beginning in the early
1970s, improved market conditions for specific products boosted manufacturing
for export; also in several instances a build-up of unused capacity was
successfully diverted to export. These factors contributed to an increase
in exports of manufactured products from $39 million in 1969 to an estimated
$290 million in 1973 (about 19% of total commodity exports in 1973). Exports
for several industrial products have good prospects and could expand further.
The internal demand that became sluggish during 1969-1971 has since picked
up so that unused capacity of industries producing exclusively for the
domestic market has been nearly eliminated.
29.       The large majority of manufacturing enterprises is concentrated
in the Greater Bangkok and Central Region area. Most firms are family-owned
and very small: 90% of the firms registered from 1967 to 1971 had capital
holdings of less than $50,000 equivalent. The average number of persons
employed by each industrial enterprise is about 14; only one percent of these
enterprises has more than 100 employees. About one million people, or 6%
of the estimated labor force of Thailand, are employed in the industrial
sector. In general, Thai industry suffers from a shortage of skilled labor,
low efficiency and inadequate capitalization, particularly for smaller firnis.
30.       The primary processing industries are still the most important in
terms both of value added and employment. Recently established consumer
goods industries range from food processing and textiles to electrical goods
and motor vehicle assembly, and there has been considerable exparnsion in
the production of intermediate goods, particularly building and construction
materials. From a small base, the capital goods sector has recently started
to expand quite rapidly.



- 8 -
31.       Thailand has very few quantitative restrictions on imports but
import duties are used to protect a wide range of local products. There
are no meaningful data to assess the level and the impact of effective
protection. Although the level of protection does not appear to have led
to gross distortions in the industrial sector, there is a need to review the
whole matter. The Government intends to collect and analyze, with the Bank's
assistance, the necessary data in time for the visit of a Bank industrial
sector survey mission planned for September 1974.
32.       In the third Five-Year Plan private investment is projected to
grow by an average annual rate of 7.3% and to contribute 63% of total invest-
ment. The Plan projects an average 8% annual growth rate in value added for
manufacturing; preliminary estimates indicate this was exceeded in 1972 and
1973. The shift towards non-traditional industries is expected to continue
so that, during the Plan period, value added in consumer goods industries
is projected to increase by about 26%, while that in intermediate goods and
capital goods industries is projected to increase by 44% and 61% respectively.
33.       Investment incentives such as temporary tax concessions or ad hoc
protection are tools used by the Government to encourage private investors
to invest in priority areas. These incentives, the impact of which is
impossible to quantify, are granted through the Board of Investment (BOI).
From 1959 to 1970, BOI granted incentives to 378 enterprises; from 1971 to
1973 to 207 enterprises. Incentives are given to projects generating
employment and using domestic raw material; within the range available,
the most favorable incentives are for export-oriented industries and for
industries in 10 designated development zones, to encourage the decentral-
ization of industrial investment. To be eligible, enterprises have to be
organized as either a limited liability company or a cooperative, with the
intent of broadening the ownership base. BOI is preparing a plan to foster
industrial development in the Northeast region, and the Northern and South-
ern Regional Development Studies include an analysis of the prospects for
industrial investment. To encourage further industrial investment through
the provision of physical infrastructure the Government established the
Industrial Estates Authority of Thailand in November 1972. The Authority
is responsible for planning, establishing and operating industrial estates
in the country. A project for possible external financing is being prepared
with help from UNIDO.
34.       Scarcity of medium- and long-term credit chronically affects the
sector. The main sources of industrial financing are commercial banks,
suppliers' credits, investment banks, the Small Industries Finance Office
(SIFO) and IFCT. Commercial banks are the largest institutional source of
industrial financing; however, their activity is limited mainly to well-
established borrowers and is based primarily on collateral; little weight is
given to the merits of the projects financed. Moreover, the largest part
of the commercial banks' long-term lending is through renewable short-term
overdrafts. The investment banks established in the last few years under-
take mainly short-term lending and their role in the manufacturing sector
is minimal. The use of suppliers' credit has been declining during the
last three years. SIFO is the only institutional source of medium- and



- 9 -
long-term financing for small-scale industries; the maximum amount of each
loan is B. 1.0 million ($50,000). In 1973, SIFO approved loans totalling
B. 16 million ($800,000).
35.       The Bank of Thailand (BOT) determines the maximum interest rates
on commercial bank deposits and loans. The maximum rate for time deposits
of 12 months and over is currently 8% per annum and the maximum lending rate
is 15%. The Thai Bankers Association which is composed of all commercial
banks except one, prescribes a minimum lending rate; this is currently
11-1/2%. Income from interest from commercial bank deposits and government
bonds is tax exempt and are strongly competitive with other types of invest-
ment. In 1973, the IMF conducted a study of the interest rate structure in
Thailand. The study argues that the minimum lending rate and tax exemptions
should be abolished to allow market forces to play a greater role in influenc-
ing interest rates. BOT is currently reviewing the IMF study and a decision
is expected following further consultations with the IMF.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
36.       A report entitled "Appraisal of Industrial Finance Corporation
of Thailand" (No. 336a TH, dated May 3, 1974) is being distributed to
the Executive Directors separately. A loan and project summary is attached
as Annex III.
Background
37.       IFCT is largely a privately-owned development finance company
established in 1959 for the purpose of promoting private industrial invest-
ment in Thailand. At the invitation of the Government in 1963, the Bank
Group helped reorganize IFCT and augment its resources. IFC took up 4,000
($193,108) of an issue of 30,000 shares and the Bank made IFCT a loan of
$2.5 million. Both because of management problems and because of the reluc-
tance of potential borrowers to assume the foreign exchange risk, IFCT was
able to use only $1.045 million of the Bank's loan by the Closing Date in
March 1968; the balance was cancelled. The Bank's loan has now been fully
repaid. In 1971, IFC took up other 4,000 shares ($193,108).
38.       At the request of IFCT, a mission visited Bangkok in the fall of
1973 to appraise IFCT's performance, future prospects and foreign exchange
needs. A follow-up mission was made in March 1974. The proposed loan was
negotiated in Washington from April 4 to April 8, 1974. IFCT was repre-
sented by Dr. Prayoon Kanchanadul, General Manager, and the Government by
H.E. Anand Panyarachun, Ambassador of Thailand to the United States.
Objectives and Policies
39.       IFCT's main objectives are to assist in the establishment, expan-
sion and modernization of private industrial enterprises and to encourage
the participation of private capital, both internal and external, in such
enterprise. The Act establishing IFCT authorizes it to provide financ_al



- 10 -
and technical assistance in almost any form. IFCT's policy statement con-
tains the usual guidelines for the conduct of its business a:Long sound
lines.
Ownership, Board, Management and Staff
40.       IFCT's original share capital has been increased four times and
now amounts to B. 150 million ($7.5 million); the latest increase was
completed in September 1973.   IFC now holds 5.3% of the total.   Ownership
of IFCT is mainly in the hands of commercial banks (73% of total shares of
which 39% domestic and 34% foreign). Holdings of foreign investors (includ-
ing IFC) amount to 47.5% of the share total. Only 16.4% is held by a
government-controlled institution, the Krung Thai Bank.
41.       IFCT's Board of Directors comprises nine members including the
Chairman and the General Manager, ex-officio. The Governmenl: appoints a
Director who is traditionelly elected Chairman. Six members represent com-
mercial banks. An Executive Committee consisting of the Chai:rman, General
Manager, and two representatives of the commercial banks, is authorized to
approve loans not exceeding 5% of IFCT's net worth, about $500,000. It also
acts as a screening body for all matters, before their presentation to the
Board.
42.       The Chairman since 1970, Mr. Renoo Suvarnsit resigned from IFCT's
Boarcl in November 1973. Mr. Sommai Hoontrakool was nominated by the Govern-
ment to succeed him as a member of the Board and he was elected Chairman
in December 1973. Mr. Sommai had a long career in the Bank of Thailand
before becoming IFCT's General Manager in July 1970. He held that post until
October 1972. More recently he was the Deputy Minister of Finance. IFCT can
expect to continue to receive vigorous and able leadership from its Chairman.
43.       The General Manager, Dr. Prayoon Kanchanadul (formerly Under-
Secretary of State for Economic Affairs), succeeded Mr. Sommai in November
1972. The position of Deputy General Manager (DGM) has been filled for the
first time by Mr. Waree Bhongsrej who took office on March 1, 1974. Prior
to his appointment he was Director in the Bank of Thailand. This appoint-
ment and the recruitment of a senior engineer and the plannecl recruitment of
an experienced economist will further strengthen IFCT's top rianagement and
staff. IFCT has a staff of 122 people, of whom 65 are professionals. The
quality of the staff is good. IFCT's management has worked out sound plans
to upgrade further IFCT's existing staff and to recruit new qiualified
personnel.
44.       IFCT is the only specialized institution that provides term loans
to the industrial sector. Since its inception IFCT has approved 210 loans
amounting to B. 1,257 million ($62.9 million), committed B. 1,107 million
($55.3 million) and disbursed B. 940 million ($47 million). During the
last three years more loans have been approved during the entire 1960 -
1970 period. IFCT's operations finance some 10% to 15% of Thailand's
investments in the manufacturing sector.
45.       IFCT's loan operations are well diversified and, although it has
financed some large projects, the majority of its loans are for small and



medium-size enterprises. Its loan operations reflect the geographic dis-
tribution of Thailand's industries and are concentrated in the greater
Bangkok and Central regions. About 40% of IFCT's portfolio consists of
expansion projects, while the remaining 60% consists of new projects, nearly
half of which were undertaken by new entrants to the manufacturing field.
IFCT-financed projects are estimated to have created about 39,000 additional
jobs since 1960; the cost per job created during the past two years was
about $5,000, much lower than the national average.   The incremental capital
output ratio for IFCT-assisted projects of about 1.7 compares favorably to
an estimated national average for the industrial sector of about 2.0. IICT
has increasingly supported export-oriented projects (since 1970, about one-
third of all the projects approved). At appraisal, calculation of economic
rates of return for sample of projects showed satisfactory results.
Procedures
46.       Appraisal standards are satisfactory with respect to the financial
and technical aspects, but IFCT's work on the marketing and economic aspects
need to be improved. The strengthening of staff and a refinement of appraisal
techniques will make the possible. IFCT intends to work closely with the
Bank in introducing economic evaluation of projects into its appraisal process.
It intends to calculate economic rates of return for all sub-loans above the
"free-limit" and for smaller operations involving projects with more Chan
B. 30.0 million of fixed assets. In the past two years IFCT has succeeded
in upgrading the standard of its supervision work and it will continue its
efforts to bring about further improvements.
Resources
47.       As of December 31, 1973, IFCT's total resources (net of repay-
ments) were B. 985 million ($49.3 million) of which domestic resources were
B. 378 million ($18.9 million) and foreign, $30.4 million equivalent.
Domestic resources consist of equity (54% of total), Government loans (25%),
and debentures (21%) taken up mostly by the Bank of Thailand. Government
loan terms range from 15 to 50 years at interest rates from 0 to 6%; deben-
tures carry 10 years maturity and 7% interest. IFCT has raised B. 150 mil-
licn worth of share capital from the public. However, in view of the in-
terest rate structure (para 35) it has been unable to borrow from the public
since to do so IFCT would have to pay an interest rate close to or above its
current lending rate, which is 10-1/2% p.a.
48.       Foreign currency resources net of repayment were made up of (a)
three loans from Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW) ($6.1 million equiv-
alent); (b) two loans from the Asian Development Bank ($11.5 million equivalent);
(c) a special yen loan repayable in baht ($11.7 million equivalent); and (d)
a Danish Government loan ($1.1 million equivalent). On December 31, 1973,
the equivalent of $4.7 million was available for commitment. In January 1974,
IFCT obtained from the Japan Export-Import Bank a tied loan of $36 million
equivalent. The terms of the above loans range from 15 to 30 years, the
interest rates from 5-1/4% to 7% (except for the Danish Government loan which
does not carry any interest).

Exchange Risk and Interest Rates
49.       IFCT's borrowers have been reluctant to accept the foreign exchange
risk since the baht, a freely convertible currency, can be used to purchase
foreign exchange; as a result IFCT has faced considerable difficulty in ex-
tending foreign currency loans. On April 26, 1974, IFCT entered into
an agreement with the Government covering the foreign exchange risk of:
IFCT's foreign currency indebtedness guaranteed by the Government so that
IFCT will no longer need to transfer the foreign exchange risk to its
borrowers under these transactions. Under the agreement IFCT will set
aside 1-1/4% of such outstanding foreign debt as well as any earnings from
parity adjustments into special accounts which will be drawn down, to the
extent provided by the agreement, if losses due to parity realignments occur.
On its part, the Government will reimburse IFCT any losses in excess of the
above drawdowns. IFCT will repay the Government for amounts so paid at the
rate of Baht 1 million ($50,000) a year, irrespective of the number of
reimbursements made to IFCT by the Government. The agreement protects IFCT
adequately. The gross cost to IFCT under the agreement would be 1-1/4% plus
the possible baht one million repayment which in 1976 would correspond to
0.09% of outstanding foreign loans, in total 1.34%. IFCT will be helped to
meet this cost by the recent increase in its foreign currency lending rate by
1% to 10-1/2%, the same rate it charges on local currency loans. The remaining
0.34% is likely to be offset by the benefits IFCT would derive directly and
indirectly from the scheme.
50.       At 10-1/2, IFCT's interest rate would be 1% below the minimum rate
of the commercial banks but higher than that of suppliers' credits, 7-8%.
In the present circumstances and until the review of Thailand's interest rate
structure currently under way between the IMF and the Thai monetary authori-
ties has been completed (paragraph 35), IFCT's interest rate policies are
reasonable. IFCT will keep its lending rate under frequent review to ensure
that it is appropriate on financial and economic grounds.
Portfolio and Financial Results
51.       IFCT's total assets were B. 769 million ($38.4 million) in
December 1973, of which the loan portfolio amounted to B. 601 million
($30.0 million). About two years ago some 22% of IFCT's total loan portfolio
was affected by arrears; determined action by management reduced this
percentage to 11% by December 1973. IFCT's portfolio is now satisfactory.
A detailed analysis of IFCT's portfolio undertaken as of December 31, 1973
showed that only 8% of IFCT's projects had problems serious enough to threaten
their viability. IFCT has made provisions adequate to cover possible losses.
IFCT's liquidity position is good.
52.       IFCT's debt/equity ratio was 2.9:1 on December 31, 1973.   IFCT
has requested that it be allowed under the proposed Bank loan agreement a
total debt/equity ratio limit of 6:1. In the light of IFCT's appraisal
standards, quality of portfolio, and debt service coverage (projected to
be not less than 1.5), this limit is reasonable.



- 13 -
53.       Over the past four years, IFCT's gross income has more than
doubled resulting in net income in 1973 of B. 21 million ($1.05 million),
130% higher than in 1969. Net income as a percentage of average assets
grew from 2.6 in 1969 to 2.9 in 1973, but fell as a percentage of net worth
from 13.2 to 10.4 during the same period, due to share capital increases.
Administrative expenses, while increasing in absolute terms, have remained
constant as a percentage of total assets (1.5%).
Future Role of IFCT
54.       IFCT plans to increase its role in areas important for the economic
and social development of Thailand; in particular, it intends to finance ex-
port-oriented and agro-based industries and to promote regional development
concentrating its efforts in areas which have been unable to attract con-
ventional financing. To accomplish these plans IFCT intends to (i) support
"pilot" projects involving the introduction of techniques and fields unusual
to Thailand; (ii) widen its promotional activities by assisting clients in
the identification and development of new projects; (iii) assist sponsors
of large and complex projects in putting together financial and technical
packages; and (iv) increase its equity participations. IFCT's project
pipeline already reflects in some measure its stated goals; in particular,
IFCT is considering projects to be established in the less developed regions,
in fields such as shrimp farming, commercial livestock, castor oil, and
bagasse and bamboo pulp. In the latter project IFCT has invited IFC's
participation. With its strengthened management and staff IFCT should be
able to expand its role and area of influence.
Projected Resource Gap and Financial Results
55.       IFCT expects to commit B. 2,472 million ($124.0 million) in the
period 1974 to 1978 in loans and equity investment; $34 million equivalent
in domestic currency and $90 million in foreign exchange. Considering the
level of approvals in 1971-1973, IFCT's pipeline of projects, and IFCT's
improved ability to lend foreign currencies because of the foreign exchange
risk agreement (para 49), the forecast appears realistic and should be withiin
IFCT's reach. IFCT's local currency resources, present and to be generated,
should be sufficient to enable it to undertake the baht commitments it has
projected. For imports, IFCT estimates that it will need foreign currency
resources of about $33.5 million equivalent to meet its commitments during
the period mid-74 to mid-76. About $14 million equivalent would involve
procurement from Japan, and could be financed out of IFCT's tied Japanese
funds. About $7 million equivalent is likely to be for small- and r.medium-
scale projects for which IFCT could use its existing and a prospe;czve KfW
loan, the use of which is confined to such projects. For the period mid-74
to mid-76, IFCT will therefore need additional untied foreign currency
resources of about $12 million.
56.       IFCT's assets are projected to increase rapidly by an average of
31% annually from B. 769 million ($38.5 million) in 1973 to B. 2,341 million
($117.1 million) in 1978, primarily because of expanded lending. Reserves
and provisions are forecast to decrease from 9.4% of the portfolio in `973
to 8.3% in 1978. The total debt/equity ratio would increase from 2.9 :1 on
December 31, 1973 to 6.5:1 on December 31, 1977, but IFCT intends to



- 14 -
increase its share capital by B. 50 million ($2.5 million) to maintain the
debt/equity ratio within the 6:1 agreed limit.
57.       IFCT's net income is estimated to grow at about 17% annually from
1973 to 1978 which is a considerably lower rate of growth than that experi-
enced in the last few years. The average cost of term debt is forecast to
fall from 6.3% in 1973 to 5.5% in 1978 while the "spread" is forecast to
rise from 3.4% in 1973 to 4.4% in 1978. This higher interest spread is,
however, partially offset by the costs of the foreign exchange risk agreement.
lhe projections also assume considerably higher equity investments but no
dividend income in the initial two years and only moderate returns in
subsequent years. However, earnings should still be adequate.
Proposed Loan
38.       A Bank loan of the equivalent of $12 million would enable IFCT to
meet a part of its foreign currency needs for imports of machinery and
equipment during the period mid-1974 to mid-1976. The terms of the loan
should be those usually applied for Bank loans to development finance com-
panies, including the standard commitment charge. A free limit of $500,000
is proposed subject to an aggregate free limit of 25% of the proposed loan.
The proposed loan is also justified by the contribution that the Bank could
make to strengthening IFCT as an organization. In particular the proposed
loan would enable the Bank to help improve IFCT's appraisal techniques.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
59.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and IFCT, the draft
Guarantee Agreement between Thailand and the Bank, the Report of the Committee
provided for in Article III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles cf Agreement
and the text of a Resolution approving the proposed loan are being distributed
to the Executive Directors separately. The draft agreements conform to the
normal pattern for loans to development finance companies.
60.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply writh the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
61.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C.        PROJECTS IN EXECUTION -
Loan 514-TH, Sirikit Dam Project; US$26 Million Loan of September 19, 1967;
Closing date: original, June 30, 1973; current, June 30, 1974.
The work on the project has been practically completed. The
closure of the dam was carried out on schedule in June 1971. The total
cost of the project is estimated at US$78 million, as against US$76 million
at appraisal (+2.5%). Substantial increases in the principal civil works
contract (+41%), which resulted from unforseen adverse foundation conditions,
have been largely compensated by savings on other items. The closing date
has been postponed by a year so that two claims by the contractor may be
settled by negotiation or arbitration.
Loan 626-TH, 4th Highways Project; US$23 Million Loan of June 27, 1969;
Closing date: original, December 31, 1973; current, December 31, 1974.
Construction of the project has been completed within the cost
estimates and on schedule except for the fencing of some sections of highway.
The closing date has been postponed to allow completion of the fencing. At
the request of the Government $6.0 million has been cancelled.
Loan 655-TH, First EGAT Power Project; US$46.5 Million Loan of February 10,1970;
Closing date: July 31, 1974.
Foreign exchange expenditures are likely to exceed committed funds
by about US$3 million, due mainly to the revaluation of the Yen, and the
additional costs will be covered by the Borrower.
Loan 702-TH, Third Bangkok Port Project; US$12.5 Million Loan of August 6, 1970;
Closing date: July 31, 1974.
Construction of this project began 18 months behind schedule.
The delay was mainly caused by the time taken by the Port Authority of Thailand
(PAT) and its consultants to pre-qualify bidders, amend tender documents and
evaluate bids which were complicated by currency realignments. Subsequently,
technical problems arose and the relationship between PAT and the engineer
(NEDECO) became somewhat strained. The technical problems were solved satis-
factorily and the relationship has improved greatly.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of
strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Loan 790-TH, South Bangkok Thermal Unit No. 4 Project; US$27 Million Loan
of November 11, 1971; Closing date: November 30, 1976.
Project is on schedule.
Loan 822-Th, Second Education Project (Kasetsart University); US$15.4 Million
Loan of May 24, 1972: Closing date:   June 30, 1978.
The preparatory stage of project implementation is about a year
behind schedule due to delay in appointing the campus planning consultants
but progress now is generally satisfactory and the master plan for the
development of the university's two campuses was presented to t:he University
in November 1973. Construction costs have risen much more rapidly than was
foreseen at appraisal and as a result total project costs are expected to
exceed appraisal estimates including contingencies by about $0.5 million;
this will be covered by the Government.
Loan 864-TH, Telecommuncations Project; US$37 Million Loan of I)ecember 5, 1972;
Closing date: December 31, 1977.
After initial delays due to difficulties with land acquisition,
the project is now moving forward satisfactorily with procurement action
having been taken on a number of major items. The Bank has avproved the
awards of contracts amounting to $13 million, of which $4 mill:Lon has been
disbursed.
Loan 870-TH, Fifth Highways Project; USS28.6 Million Loan of December 26, 1972;
Closing date: December 31, 1977.
Negotiations with consultants to assist in a highway maintenance
study have been protracted, delaying its start by about one year. After
about a year's delay in agreeing terms of reference for consultants' services
to assist the transport planning unit of the Ministry of Communications, pro-
posals have now been received from consultants and contract negotiations are
expected to start shortly. Construction work is proceeding without any major
problem.
Credit 369-TH, Third Education Project; US$19.5 Million Credit of April 11,1973;
Closing date: June_30, 1978.
Project implementation generally is about four months behind
schedule with the fellowship program about eight months behind, but otherwise
progress is satisfactory. Construction costs are likely to exceed appraisal
estimates (including contingencies) by $1.2 million (30%) by the time build-
ing works are contracted; this will be covered by the Government.

Credit 379-TH, Chao Phya Irrigation Improvement Project; US$5.5 Million
Credit of May 9, 1973; Closing date: June 30, 1978.
Physical execution of the project is proceeding on schedule. A
program of strengthening agricultural extension services in the project by
the training of progressive farmers as extension workers has been established.
Project 898-TH, Fourth Railway Project; US$15 Million Loan of June 1, 1973;
Closing date: June 30, 1977.
Since June 1973 SRT has been confronted with a succession of claims
for higher pay as a result of a sharp increase in living costs. In addition,
oil fuel costs have increased substantially. The net effect of these addi-
tional burdens is to increase SRT's operating costs by about Baht 560 million
annually and this, in order to maintain a satisfactory financial situation,
would require increase in rates and fares of the order of about 21i%. It will
not be possible for SRT to comply with the Bank's earnings covenant for
FY 1974 but they have been requested to advise the Bank of action taken to
increase tariffs and to show the expected effect of such increases on finances
for FY 1975 and future years. Availability of diesel locomotives has been
seriously affected by lack of spare parts. Following discussions with the
supervision mission, SRT is to send a representative to the U.S.A. and Germany
to expedite delivery of essential spares by airfreight, where necessary.
