APPRAISAL OF
INDUSTRIAL FINANCE CORPORATION OF THAILAND
SUMMARY
i.        Thailand's economy recovered in 1973, after a slow-down which
started in 1969. Owing to improvements in the terms of trade for key exports,
the overall balance of payments showed a surplus in 1972 and 1973 compared
with deficits from 1969 to 1971. Total fixed investment increased by 5% in
real terms in 1973 after decreases in 1971 and 1972. The oil crisis has
been a problem of prices rather than of supply. Improved export earnings
on Thailand's major export commodities are, however, likely to offset, for
the next two years or so, the higher oil bill.
ii.       With a share in GDP at current factor cost of about 14%, manufactur-
ing is the second largest sector in the economy after agriculture, and has
averaged a growth of 10% per annum over the period 1967 to 1973. Consumer
goods industries, which are mainly small size and family owned, dominate the
industrial sector, which is concentrated in and around the greater Bangkok
area. Thailand has few quantitative restrictions on imports, but many consum-
er goods and intermediary products are protected by tariffs of up to 40-60%.
Some industries are competitive in world markets, and manufactured exports
increased sharply between 1970 and 1973. The Government seeks to encourage,
by an incentive scheme administered by BOI, the growth of export-oriented
and labor-intensive industries and the reduction of regional disparities.
iii.      Institutional finance in Thailand is dominated by the commercial
banks. Their lending policies are not venturesome and they base their
lending on collateral rather than on the merits of projects. Commercial
banks and suppliers' credits are, besides IFCT, the only major sources of
finance for industrial investment. Finance companies, investment banks and
the capital market provide only limited finance to the manufacturing sector
and as with the commercial banks, mainly to large enterprises in the Bangkok
area. The Small Industries Finance Office makes term-loans to small
industrial enterprises, but on a modest scale.
iv.       IFCT is the only specialized institution that provides term-loans
to the industrial sector. Its lending rate is 10-1/2% or 1% below the
prime rate of the commercial banks. IFCT would lose business if it raised
its lending rate, because the commercial banks have minimal disclosure require-
ments and because suppliers' credits are offered at 7 to 8%. However, the
Bank of Thailand is presently engaged in a dialogue with the IMF over the
interest rate structure in Thailand, and IFCT's lending rate of 10-1/2%
should be viewed in connection with this larger dialogue. IFCT has assured
the Bank that it will keep its lending rate under frequent review to ensure
that it is appropriate on financial and economic grounds.
v.        IFCT, a largely privately owned institution established in 1959,
played a modest role in the sixties, but during the last three years it has
been able to increase its volume of business considerably, in both relative
and absolute terms. In relation to loans by commercial banks, IFCT's total



outstanding loans to the manufacturing sector rose from 4% in 1965 to 8% in
1968 and to 11% in 1973. Its influence on project formulation now permeates
directly some 10-15% of Thailand's investments in the manufacturing sector
and, indirectly, more.
vi.       IFCT's loan operations are well diversified in various industrial
branches and, although it has financed some large projects over the last thire
years, the majority of its loans are for small- and medium-sized enterprises..
Its loan operations reflect the geographical distribution of Thailand's
industries and are concentrated in the greater Bangkok and Central regions.
Sixty percent of IFCT's portfolio is accounted for by new ventures, nearly
half of which were undertaken by new entrants in the manufacturing field.
The economic rate of return shown by a sample of fourteen IFCT financed
projects (14% of the total number) is satisfactory.
vii.      Mr. Sommai Hoontrakool, former General Manager of IFCT and
more recently Deputy Finance Minister, returned to IFCT as its Chairman in
December 1973. The present General Manager, Dr. Prayoon Kanchanadul,
formerly a civil servant, succeeded Mr. Sommni Hoontrakool in November 1972.
The vacant post of Deputy General Manager was filled in March 1974. IFCT
has three foreign advisors. Their initial two year terms, which would
have expired in 1974, have recently been extended for one more year.
viii.     While the middle management is competent and the general quality
of staff is good, there is room for upgrading. IFCT's management realizes
this, is looking for an experienced economist and has already hired a senior
engineer. It has also expressed its desire for the Bank Group's advice and
cooperation in improving its operations through staff training and the
upgrading of appraisal techniques.
ix.       IFCT's portfolio is satisfactory, amd its overall financial
position is sound. Its capital structure has been strengthened by a
Bt. 50 million share capital increase completed in September 1973. IFCT's
financial structure, profitability and debt service ability are expected
to remain satisfactory.
x.        IFCT expects to commit Bt. 2,472 million during 1974 to 1978 in
loans and equity investments; Bt. 684 million in domestic currency and
Bt. 1,788 million equivalent in foreign exchange. Considering the level
of approvals in 1971-73 and IFCT's pipeline of projects, the forecast
appears realistic and should be within IFCT's reach. IFCT's local
currency resources are sufficient to undertake the baht commitments it has
projected. For imports, IFCT estimates that it will need foreign currency
resources of about US$33.5 million to meet its commitment during the
period mid-1974 to mid-1976. Loans amounting to about US$14 million wili
involve Japanese procurement and therefore could be financed from the tied
Special Yen and Japan Ex-Im Bank loans available to IFCT. Resources needed
for untied procurement for the same period are estimated at about US$19
million. Some US$7 million of this amount will be provided by the
existing and a new KfW loan, the only untied funds now at IFCT's disposal.
IFCT will therefore need additional untied foreign resources of about US$12
million. A Bank loan of US$12 million would fill this remaining gap.



- iii -
xi.       IFCT expects to play a more important role over the next five years
than in the past in areas which are considered important for the economic
and social development of Thailand. It will continue to lend to and assist
in the planning and financing of some large-scale ventures, particularly
those of national importance. The promotion of smaller projects, especially
agro-business projects located in the provinces, is high on IFCT's priority
list, and it also plans to increase its equity financing. The overall cost
of IFCT's resources is expected to be low enough to provide a margin
sufficient to compensate IFCT for the higher risks and administrative costs
involved in the more venturesome policies contemplated, while still enabling
it to earn a reasonable profit. IFCT intends to strengthen its management
and staff, to improve its procedures and operations including the economic
appraisal of projects, and to undertake more promotional work. It expects
to have a close, beneficial relationtihip with the Bank.
xii.      With IFCT there is considerable scope for the Bank's traditional
role of institution building. The Bank should be prepared to assist IFCT
to the extent possible, through close supervision involving somewhat more
frequent supervision missions than usual, detailed reviews of sub-project
appraisals, support in programs for staff training and recruitment of
advisors, when necessary, and continuing advice on IFCT's work programs.
The proposed loan would be not only a means of meeting a part of IFCT's
capital requiremtents but also, through its administration, a means of
assisting IFCT to implement its objectives.
xiii.          A Bank loan of US$12 million is recommended to enable IFCT to meet
a part of IFCT's foreign currency needs for import of machinery and equipment
under sub-projects financed by it during the period mid-74 to mid-76. The
terms of the loan should be those usually applied for Bank loans to develop-
ment finance companies, including the standard commitment charge. IFCT has
requested a debt/equity ratio of 6.0:1, debt being defined as total long-
term debt including subordinated Government loans. For the reasons given
in para 3.22 this ratio is reasonable and is recommended. An initial free
limit of US$500,000 is proposed subject to an aggregate free limit of 25%
of the proposed loan. The US$500,000 limit should assure that about 75%
(by amount) of the loans would require prior approval by the Bank.






APPRAISAL OF
INDUSTRIAL FINANCE CORPORATION OF THAILAND
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      This report appraises the Industrial Finance Corporation of
Thailand (IFCT), a private development finance company, for a proposed Bank
loan of $12 million to support private industrial investment in Thailand.
This would be the second Bank loan to IFCT; the first loan for $2.5 million
was made in 1964.
1.02      IFCT was established in 1959 for the purpose of promoting private
industrial development in Thailand. The World Bank Group helped re-organize
the institution in 1963 and in the process the Bank made a loan of US$2.5
million and IFC took up 4,000 (US$193,108) of an issue of 30,000 shares in
March 1964. IFCT's operations fluctuated considerably both because of
management problems and because of the reluctance of potential borrowers
to assume the foreign exchangs risk, and only US$1.045 million of the Bank
loan was utilized; this amount has since been fully repaid. Since 1970, IFCT's
performance has improved and there are good prospects for further improvement.
The economic and financial environment is described in Annex 1.
II. INSTITUTIONAL ASPECTS
Objectives and Policies
2.01      Objectives.  IFCT was established by a legislative Act, which has
been amended from time to time. IFCr's main objectives, as set out in
the Act, are to assist in the establishment, expansion or modernization of
private industrial enterprises and to encourage the participation of private
capital, both internal and external, in such enterprises. Industrial enter-
prises, as defined in the Act, include those engaged in "the manufacture,
processing and repair of goods, mining, generation and distribution of
electricity or other kinds of power, transportation, tourist industry,
construction and land improvement and commercial agriculture".
2.02      The Act authorizes IFCT to provide finance in the form of long- or
medium-term loans with or without security, buy, sell and underwrite shares
and securities, issue guarantees, manage investments, provide technical
assistance and borrow funds in Thailand and abroad. It may, in short,
undertake the normal range of activities of a development finance company.
In the future, IFCT plans to be more active in financing sectors or projects
which in the past have received insufficient attention from financial
institutions in Thailand: (i) financing relatively small projects; (ii)
financing projects outside the Metropolitan Bangkok area; (iii) financing
projects in fields such as agro-business and mining; (iv) promoting projects



- 2-
which require considerable work and expertise; and (v) investment in
equity (paras 4.03 to 4.05).
2.03      Operating Policies.  IFCT's Statement of Operating Policies is
similar to those adopted by most of the development finance companies
associated with the World Bank Group. It contains the usual guidelines
for conducting the day-to-day operations of the company on sound and
prudent lines, and for maintaining a healthy financial position. The
policy statement was last amended in July 1973, mainly for the purpose of
redefining its borrowing limit by excluding Government subordinated loans
from its borrowing base, with an increase in permissible indebtedness from
3.5 to 6 times its net worth. The statement which is shown in Annex 2 is
acceptable to the Bank except for the wording in the last sentence of
para 6 which has the effect of valuing foreign exchange liabilities at the
rate prevailing at the time they were contracted instead of at the current
rate. Also, when the foreign exchange risk agreement (para 3.10) becomes
effective, a consequential change will be needed in the wording of para 14.
IFCT has undertaken to make the necessary changes.
Ownership
2.04      IFCT's initial share capital of Bt. 6.1 million has been increased
four times and now amounts to Bt. 150 million; the latest increase, Bt. 50 mil-
lion, was completed in September 1973. IFC now holds Bt. 8 million (US$384,496)
which is 5.3% of the total. A list of shareholders is shown in Annex 3.
Holdings of foreign shareholders (including IFC) amount to 47.5% of the
total, holdings of local and foreign banks amount to 73%, of insurance
companies to 6%, of investment companies to 5% and of other institutions
and individuals to 16%. The latest share capital increase reduced commercial
banks' shareholdings from 83% to 73%. The holding of the only Government-
owned shareholder, the Krung Thai Bank, increased slightly from 14.5 to 16.4%.
Q*anization, Management and Staff
2.05      Organizational Structure.  IFCT's internal structure was reor-
ganized in 1971. The work is now divided among three departments: the
Projects Department, the Operations Department and the Administration Depart-
ment. The Projects Department is responsible for appraisal of projects;
the Operations Department handles all supervision, research and resource plan-
ning; and the Administration Department handles accounting, personnel and
legal affairs. The reorganization has streamlined the overall division of
labor within the institution. The lines of authority are clearly drawn and
the present structure is appropriate to IFCT's needs. IFCT's organization
chart is attached.
2.06      IFCT has no branches or regional offices.  In view of the em-
phasis which IFCT intends to place on financing projects in the less-
developed regions (para 4.04), IFCT is now studying plans for establishing
three representative offices at regional centres.

2.07      Board of Directors.  IFCT's Board comprises nine members includ-
ing the Chairman and the General Manager. The Chairman since 1970,
Mr. Renoo Suvarnsit, the Secretary General of National Economic and Social
Development Board (NESDB), resigned from IFCT's Board in November 1973.
Mr. Sommai Hoontrakool was nominated by the Government to succeed him as
a member of the Board and he was elected Chairman with effect from
December 3, 1973. Mr. Sommai, able and widely respected, had a long career
in the Bank of Thailand before becoming IFCT's Managing Director from July
1970 until October 1972. More recently he was the Deputy Finance Minister.
IFCT can expect to continue to receive vigorous leadership from its Chairman.
Dr. Prayoon Kanchanadul, IFCT's General Manager, is an ex-officio Director.
Six of the remaining seven Directors are commercial bankers, reflecting the
predominance of commercial banks among IFCT's shareholders. The Board as of
December 31, 1973 is shown in Annex 4. The Board usually meets once every month,
and besides deciding on policy and other important matters it has the final
say in most of IFCT's loan and investment proposals (see paragraph 2.08).
2.08      Executive Committee.  The Executive Committee was set up in
December 1972 following an amendment of the IFCT Act. The Committee has
four members: the Chairman, General Manager and two representatives of
the commercial banks (one foreign and one local). The Executive Committee
meets routinely every week and is authorized to approve loans not exceeding
5% of IFCT's net worth (about Bt. 10 million). The Committee acts as a
screening body for larger loans prior to their presentation to the Board.
2.09      Management.  The present General Manager, Dr. Prayoon Kanchanadul,
succeeded Mr. Sommai in November 1972.  Dr. Prayoon, a career civil serv-
ant, was the Under-Secretary of State for Economic Affairs until his
retirement in September 1972. He is receptive to advice, and eager to improve
IFCT's operations. Dr. Prayoon's contract expires in November 1974 but is
renewable. IFCT had no Deputy General Manager until March 1, 1974 when
Mr. Waree Bhongsvej, until then Director and Assistant to the Governor, Bank
of Thailand, was engaged to fill the vacancy. Mr. Bhongsvej has had substan-
tial banking experience and his employment should help IFCT in its efforts
to expand its operations and promotional work (para 3.35).
2.10      Staff.  IFCT's staff at the departmental level is reasonably
competent, and capable of learning new and improved techniques. The
senior staff was strengthened by the employment of a senior engineer,
Mr. Chamras Chayabongse, in November 1973, but IFCT still needs an experienced
economist, for whom the management is presently screening potential candidates.
2.11      IFCT has three foreign advisors:  Mr. Sunit Gupta, a Bank staff
member on leave of absence, as Financial Advisor; Mr. L. Buescher, Economic
Advisor, and Mr. H. Oermann as Engineering Advisor. The initial two-year
term of office of Mr. Gupta, who is serving IFCT under UNDP's auspices, expires
in April 1974, but will be extended for one more year. The services of
Messrs. Buescher and Oermann are provided by the Federal Republic of
Germany under a technical aid program. Their initial two-year terms expire
in mid-1974 but have been extended for one more year.
2.12      As of December 31, 1973, IFCT had 122 staff members, of whom
65 were professionals. Although the staff turnover has been relatively high



- 4 -
in the recent past, IFCT has been able to retain its senior and more experi-
enced staff members. The turnover was high among newly appointed staff,
many of whom decided to undertake further studies or were attracted by
higher positions offered by other financial institutions. The general
quality of IFCT's staff is good; with proper motivation and training oppor-
tunities the staff has potential for further improvement. The staff is
generally sufficient in number to deal with a higher level of activities,
although, as already noted, some additional selective recruitment is
necessary.
Procedures
2.13      Appraisal.  IFCT's appraisal standards have improved considerably
during the last two years or so and, although some weaknesses remain, are now
of generally satisfactory quality. The three foreign advisors have made a
valuable contribution, and the reorganization of 1971 has also helped to
raise IFCT's general efficiency.
2.14      The financial and technical parts of appraisals cover all major
aspects although the depth of evaluation and analysis could be improved. The
weakest parts of IFCT's project appraisal work are the coverage of marketing
and economic aspects. Because statistics on prices and supply are usually not
available and because IFCT's clients are normally not among the sophisticated
entrepreneurs who are able to undertake detailed market studies themselves, or
who can afford to hire consultants to undertake such studies, a thorough and
systematic analysis by IFCT is of particular importance. Although IFCT's capa-
bility in regard to market analysis has improved, greater depth is required
in its appraisal of market conditions. As for the economic aspects, emphasis
is put on partial indicators (value added/output, capital/output, capital/
employment, employment creation, balance of payments effects), while no syste-
matic attempt has so far been made to calculate the effective rates of protec-
tion or the economic rates of return (ERR) as an element in decision-making.
The management realizes that IFCT's market and economic analyses need strength-
ening and, as already noted, plans to recruit a senior economist. To improve
its decision-making process, IFCT has agreed to calculate the ERR for all
projects which will receive IFCT finance of Bt 10 million or more. For other
projects which are large (fixed assets of Bt. 30 mill or more), but where
IFCT finance will be less than Bt 10 mill., IFCT will also calculate the ERR.
2.15      All loan applications go through an initial screening which
determines, usually within one to two weeks, whether IFCT will go ahead with a
full appraisal. If approved, a team of three (a financial analyst, an
engineer and an economist) works simultaneously on the application and
prepares an appraisal report. Depending upon the type of the project and
its stage of preparation it may take as little as three weeks to prepare
the first draft; but usually not all necessary information is readily
available, and it takes an average of three months to prepare a full
appraisal. This is a reasonable period if IFCT is to maintain relatively
high appraisal standards, but it does leave it at a competitive disadvantage
towards a commercial bank that bases a lending decision mainly on an assess-
nmnt of credit standing and collateral security. Before submission to the



-5-
Executive Committee, all loan proposals are considered by an Investment
Committee, 1/ which contributes materially to improving the loan presenta-
tions.
2.16      Supervision.  Considerable effort has gone into strengthening
IFCT's supervision procedures and staff, after serious arrears developed in
1970. To improve the situation, IFCT initially concentrated its efforts on
the problem projects, but has since been able to expand systematic supervision
to all projects. A constant difficulty in effective supervision is the
reluctance of many clients to disclose information to IFCT. Regular project
visits have improved data collection and early detection of problems. All
projects in operation are now visited at least once a year by a financial
analyst. If a client defaults, project supervision is intensified. Projects
at the implementation stage are visited every three months, or before each
disbursement, by an engineer and a financial analyst. The present follow-up
staff (twelve persons) is adequate to deal with the projects under implementa-
tion and in operation.
2.17      Feed-back of information from the follow-up work to the project
appraisal staff is presently limited to the transmission of supervision
reports to the Project Department. IFCT is planning to increase the use
made of follow-up data by undertaking cross-section analyses of several
supervision reports for the purpose of comparing, among other matters,
actual results with those forecast.
2.18      Procurement and Disbursement.  IFCT has well-formulated procure-
ment procedures.  It requires, in all appropriate cases, that its clients
obtain quotations from at least three suppliers.  These quotations are
carefully checked by the Engineering Division and compared with other
projects using similar machinery.  IFCT has found that the sponsors in
general make good choices; in only a few cases has it been necessary,
after advice from IFCT, to change a supplier. IFCT's procurement procedures
appear to ensure that suitable machinery is purchased at reasonable prices.
2.19      IFCT's disbursement procedures ensure that the clients first provide
their part of the financing. IFCT's disbursements are made in stages and
only after checking the physical progress of the project and the relevant
documentation. These include invoices, receipts, etc. in the case of domestic
loans, and letters of credit and bills of lading in the case of foreign
currency loans. IFCT's disbursement procedures appear to be satisfactory.
Relations with the Government and the Business Community
2.20      IPCT has good relations with the Government, which for many years
has taken a benevolent and often actively helpful interest in IFCT's affairs.
Close links and mutual understanding were facilitated in the past by
1/   The Investment Committee comprises the General Manager, the Managers
of the Operations and the Project Departments, the three Division
Chiefs of the Operations Department and the Division Chief in charge
of follow-up.



- 6 -
Mr. Renoo's dual role as Chairman of IFCT's Board of Directors and Secretary-
General of NESDB, and more recently by Dr. Prayoon's connections in Govern-
ment circles and his seat on BOI. Cordial relations with the Government
should continue with Mr. Sommai as IFCT's Chairman. At the working level,
exchanges of views and information between the Government and IFCT are
frequent.
2.21      The Government is important to IFCT as a guarantor and supplier
or channel of funds and as the author of the industrial policies and priori-
ties in accordance with which IFCT has to operate. Current Government
plans envisage an expanding role for IFCT in developing export-oriented
and agro-based industries, in promoting regional development and 'in devel-
oping a capital market in Thailand. There is no indication that the Govern-
ment unduly influences IFCT's individual investment decisions.
2.22      Several commercial banks are shareholders of IFCT and their
nominees are members of IFCT's Board of Directors. The operations of
IFCT and those of some banks and finance companies are complementary and
there are prospects of joint financing in appropriate cases. IFCT's
relations with some other banks, on the other hand, have been somewhat
strained by what IFCT has regarded on occasions as unfair competition.
2.23      Most well-established industrialists have long-standing relations
with the commercial banks and seldom look to IFCT for financing. Many
not so well established entrepreneurs, however, seek and appreciate IFCT's
assistance. The fact that during the last couple of years IFCT has been
active in attempts to promote a few large projects which required substantial
expertise and experience, has increased IFCT's prestige among the business
community. The former Managing Director of IFCT, now back as its Chairman,
and the present Financial Advisor are very active in matters relating to
the capital market, some of the credit for which has brushed off on IFCT.
But to the business and banking communities in general, IFCT probably still
appears to be a relatively small institution, although one with professional,
ethical and developmental standards and objectives that deserve respect.
III. OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND ECONOMIC IMPACT
Loan Operations
3.01      General.  IFCT's lending operations through December 31, 1973 are
shown in Annex 5. Since its inception IFCT has approved 210 loans amounting
to Bt. 1,257 million, committed Bt. 1,107 million (204 loans) and disbursed
13t. 940 inillion. Year-to-year fluctuations have been considerable, reflecting
not only the current investment climate but also IFCT's earlier management
problems. The trend of business has been upward since 1970, with approvals
during the last 3 years greater than total approvals for the period 1960-70.
'The higher levels of approvals in 1971 (Bt. 224 million), 1972 (Bt. 177 million)
and 1973 (Bt. 270 million) were helped by the attractiveness of the Special
Yen loan 1/ and the involvement of IFCT in a few fairly large projects.
1/   The Special Yen loan, which derives from Japanese reparations payments,
is disbursed in Yen, but is repaid in Baht at the rate of exchange pre-
vailing at the date of commitment.



-7-
3.02      Of the loans committed up to Decem3er 31, 1973, 58% derived from
foreign currency resources. This percentage has been higher since 1971
(65%), because of the Special Yen loan which accounted for about 70% of
IFCT's foreign currency commitments during this period. The proportion
of foreign currency loans would undoubtedly have been higher in earlier
years but for the foreign exchange risk problem (see para 3.10).
3.03      SiZe of Commitments.  The distribution of loan commitments by
size, duration and geographical distribution is shown in Annex 6. The
minimum size of IFCT's loans is Bt. 1 million (US$50,000); the upper limit
is prescribed in IFCT's policy statement and now amounts to roughly Bt. 50
million (US$2.5 million).
3.04      The average size of IFCT's commitments has been increasing; during
the last three years it amounted to about Bt. 10 million (US$500,000),1/
about 50% larger than the average size during the preceding three years.
While before 1971 there was no loan of over Bt. 20 million (US$1.0 million),
IFCT has committed seven loans of over Bt. 20 million since then. Nevertheless,
more than half of IFCT's financing has been for medium- and small-size
enterprises: 52% of the number of loans committed since the end of 1970
were below Bt. 6 million (US$300,000) each, and 37% were relatively small
loans below Bt. 4 million (US$200,000) each.
3.05      Duration of Loans.  On a cumulative basis the majority of IFCT
loan commitments averaged 5.6 years by the end of 1970. This average has
been the same during the last two to three years although the structure
of maturities has changed slightly; while by the end of 1970 loans with
maturities of 4.1 to 8 years accounted for 71% of cumulative commitments,
they made up 88% of commitments in the years 1971 to 1973. IFCT has not
extended any loans for less than two years nor for more than ten years since
December 1970.
3.06      Geographic Distribution.  IFCT's operations, reflecting the geogra-
phical distribution of Thailand's industry, are concentrated in the Greater
Bangkok area and the Central region. Of all loans committed, 86% by value
(76% by number) are for projects located in Bangkok and the surrounding
provinces. IFCT's management intends to make a deliberate effort (para 3.35)
to expand IFCT's services beyond the Central region.
3.07      Industrial Distribution.  IFCT's loan commitments by industrial
sector are shown in Annex 7. IFCT's commitments during the last three years
are well diversified among the four large groups of consumer, intermediate,
capital and miscellaneous goods industries, each group accounting for no more
than 33% of the total: Consumer goods industries accounted for 3;S
(Bt. 165 million) mainly because of a sharp increase in loans to food and
textiles industries; intermediate goods industries accounted for 33% where
investments in non-metallic minerals industries (mainly ceramics and cement)
accounted for 17%; capital and miscellaneous goods industries made up 15%
and 21% respectively with metal products and transport showing the fastest
growth.
1/   Excluding seven loans of over Bt. 20 million, the average would be
Bt. 6.4 million (US$320,000).



-8-
3.08      New versus Expansion Projects.  Of the 99 projects 1/ in IFCT's
portfolio as of December 31, 1972, 41 were expansion projects, while 58 were
new ventures, 46 of them in the manufacturing sector. Seven of these
46 projects were undertaken by companies that already had operations in the
same field. Of the remaining 39 new ventures, including nine joint ven-
tures with foreign enterprises, 17 were undertaken by entrepreneurs with
experience as traders, bankers and businessmen, and two by persons with no
previous experience in business or industry. Thus, 22 or 48% of the new
industrial ventures were undertaken by new entrants into the manufacturing
field.
Equity Investments and Guarantees
3.09      Until recently IFCT held shares in only one company (Bt. 250,000).
In 1972-73, however, IFCT approved three equity investments totalling
Bt. 11.7 mill. As of December 31, 1973, total guarantees amounted to
Bt. 58 million for four companies. The guarantees, all extended before 1972
to existing clients of IFCT, were for various purposes such as guaranteeing
an issue of debentures, guaranteeing suppliers' credits and bank overdrafts.
Thereas equity investments are likely to increase considerably in the future,
guarantees are expected to remain at about the present level.
Foreign Exchange Risk
3.10      As a policy, IFCT does not carry the foreign exchange risk but
passes it on to its sub-borrowers. This has adversely affected IFCT's
lending in foreign exchange as sub-borrowers are reluctant to assume the
exchange risk and prefer to borrow Baht resources which are freely convertible.
In March 1974, the Ministry of Finance and IFCT agreed to enter into a
foreign exchange risk agreement (shown in Annex 9), the main features of
which are: (i) IFCT shall pay into a "Claim Account" in the name of the
Ministry of Finance 1/4% p.a. of its outstanding foreign debt; (ii) IFCT shall
set aside to a Provision for Exchange Risk 1% p.a. of its outstanding
debt; (iii) if a net loss occurs owing to a realignment of currencies, the
loss shall be charged: first, against the Provision for Exchange Risk (up
to 75% of the balance of that Provision), and secondly, the balance if any,
against the Claim Account; (iv) in the event that the loss exceeds the sum
of the charges so made, the Ministry of Finance shall reimburse IFCT the
amount of the excess; and (v) IFCT shall repay the Ministry of Finance this
reimbursement at the rate of Bt. one million p.a., irrespective of the number
of such reimbursements made to IFCT by the Ministry of Finance. The agreement
would not relieve IFCT of possible costs as a result of currency realignaents,
but would make it possible for IFCT to meet the costs in an orderly and
1/   Undertaken by 91 companies.



- 9 -
manageable way. 1/ The total expenses to IFCT under the agreement are
precisely determinable and not unduly burdensome in relation to IFCT's
expected earnings. The Bank has reviewed the agreement and found it
acceptable.
Interest Rates
3.11      IFCT's lending rate is 10-1/2% for domestic loans and 9-1/2% for
foreign currency loans with the borrower assuming the foreign exchange risk.
When the foreign exchange risk agreement (para 3.10) has become effective,
IFCT will raise its foreign currency lending rate by 1% to 10-1/2%. IFCT's
lending rate of 10-1/2% appears low compared with the recently increased
prime lending rate of the commercial banks of 11-1/2%. However, commercial
bank lending is based on superficial appraisals, and disclosure requirements
are minimal. This places IFCT under a competitive disadvantage. Moreover,
the commercial banks' minimum lending rate of 11-1/2% is not determined by
the play of market forces, but is established by the Inter-Bank Agreement
(see also para 25, Annex 1) and helps keep lending rates too far above
deposit rates. More importantly, suppliers' credits are freely available at
7-8% interest. Because of the relative short term nature of suppliers' credits,
heavy reliance by Thai entrepreneurs on suppliers' credits is not welcomed
owing to its adverse effects on the balance of payments.
3.12      IFCT increasingly perceives its own role as one primarily of develop-
ment rather than of profit-maximization. It is unlikely to need to raise
local resources for the next few years, and in any event the currently
distorted interest rate structure makes it virtually impossible to raise
such funds by public borrowing. Thailand's interest rate structure was
studied by the IMF in 1973 and its report and recommendations are scheduled
to be discussed by the Bank of Thailand in the summer of 1974. Subsequent
changes in the general interest rate structure are possible, and IFCT has
assured the Bank that it will keep its lending rates under frequent review
to ensure that it is appropriate on financial and economic grounds. In these
circumstances, its proposed lending rate of 10-1/2% for foreign exchange and
baht loans appears appropriate.
Resources
3.13      IFCT's total resources (net of repayments) amounted to Bt. 985
million (US$49.3 million) at December 31, 1973; local resources made up
Bt. 378 million or 38% of the total, foreign resources Bt. 607 million
(US$30.4 million) or 62%. Details of IFCT's resources are shown in Annex 10.
1/   The fact that IFCT would not have to pass on the foreign exchange risk
to its clients will affect its income in two ways. First, IFCT's foreign
currency lending rate will be raised 1% to 10-1/2% (the net "fee" would
in effect therefore be only 1/4%) and secondly, IFCT's foreign currency
lending is likely to increase substantially without a corresponding in-
crease in its expenses. If IFCT were to make a repayment of Bt. 1 million
in 1976, when its outstanding foreign debt is projected to amount to
about Bt. 1,100 million, the Bt. 1 million repayment would correspond to
0.09% of the outstanding foreign debt; this means that the total net cost
to IFCT would be 0.34% (the fee of 0.25% plus 0.09%) of the outstanding
foreign debt in that year. The maximum annual repayment of Bt. 1 million
would have only a relatively insignificant effect on IFCT's profitability,
cash flow and debt service coverage.



- 10 -
3.14      Local Resources.  IFCT's local resources as of December 31, 1973
were as follows (in Bt. million):
Amount            Percentage
Share capital                         150.0               39.7
Retained earnings                      55.2  205.2        14.6  54.3
Government loans (net
of repayments)                              92.9              24.6
Debentures                                    80.0              21.1
378.1             100.0
The maturity of the Government loans ranges from 15 to 50 years and the
interest rate from nil to 6-1/2% p.a.; the weighted average rate of
interest is 3.7%. Government loans amounting to Bt. 68.9 million are
subordinated to share capital. The Government has not extended any
loans to IFCT since 1967. The debentures, guaranteed by the Government,
were issued in 1968 at 7% p.a. with 10 years maturity. On December 31, 1973J
IFCT had Bt. 149 million in local resources available for disbursement against
which it had undisbursed commitments of Bt. 34 million, leaving Bt. 115 million
available for commitment.
3.15      A loan agreement between the Government and IFCT has been drafted
and is expected to be signed soon under which IFCT is likely to receive about
Bt. 50 million from PL-480 counterpart funds. 1/ The funds will be repaid to
the Government over 40 years and will be available to IFCT at a concessional
rate of 2% for financing agro-business and forestry projects. Oaly 3% of
IFCT's spread will be treated as income; the balance will be set aside as
a provision to meet possible portfolio losses in view of the uncertainties
attending projects of the types expected to be financed.
3.16      The debentures issued by IFCT in 1968 were guaranteed by the
Government and taken up mostly by the Bank of Thailand. For all practical
purposes, therefore, IFCT's resource mobilization has been confined to
periodic increases in its equity. IFCT has been unable to raise loan funds
from the public because of the interest rate structure in Thailand. As
commercial banks pay 8% interest tax free on 12 months deposits and Govern-
ment bonds yield 7-1/2% - 8-1/2% tax free, IFCT would have had to offer rates
of interest higher than its lending rate of 10-1/2%, and accept a negative
spread on the borrowed funds. As mentioned in para 3.12, the Bank of
Thailand is presently, in consultation with IMF, reviewing the interest rate
structure in Thailand and IFCT has assured the Bank that it will hold the
appropriateness of its lending rates under frequent review.
1/   The initial amount was for a total of Bt. 300 million, Bt. 150 million
in each of the years 1973 and 1974. IFCT will, however, receive only
Bt. 50 million for 1973 as the commodity shipments which give rise to the
counterpart funds were lower in that year than expected. The outlook for
1974 is gloomy since cotton and tobacco shipments are not moving and IFCT
is unlikely to receive any counterpart funds with respect to 1974.

3.17      Foreign Currency Resources.  IFCT's foreign currency resources
as of December 31, 1973 were as follows:
Amount
Bt. Million   US$ Million       Percentage
KfW (net of repayments)             123            6.1             20.1

IFCT has received three loans from KfW totalling Bt. 195 million equivalent.
As of December 31, 1973, two of the loans were fully committed; the third
loan of Bt. 75 million equivalent (US$3.8 million), signed in August 1973,
was almost entirely uncommitted. By agreement, the proceeds will be used to
finance projects which will create employment, improve Thailand's balance of
payments and contribute to balanced regional economic growth. Only small-
and medium-scale projects will be financed out of the loan. Of the two loans
from AsDB totalling Bt. 298 million equivalent, Bt. 5.6 million equivalent
(US$0.3 million) was still available for commitment as of December 31, 1973;
the interest rate is 6-7/8% and repayments are linked to IFCT's own collections.
The Danish credit, provided to finance two specific projects, is fully commit-
ted. It is interest-free to IFCT but, of the interest received by it, only
3% is allowed to be treated as income, the balance being transferred to reserves.
The Special Yen loan represents part of Japanese war reparations payments
to Thailand and, although it is drawn in yen, the repayments are to be made
in baht to the Bank of Thailand. The interest rate on the Special Yen loan
is 7% and repayments are tied to IFCT's own collections. On December 31, 1973,
IFCT had Bt. 227 million equivalent (US$11.4 million) foreign resources
available for disbursement against which it had undisbursed commitments of
Bt. 134 million equivalent, leaving Bt. 93 million equivalent (US$4.7 million)
available for commitment.
3.18      In January 1974, IFCT obtained from the Japan Ex-Im Bank a loan
of i 10,000 million (about US$36 million). The credit is tied and carries
interest at 5.25%. It has a maturity of 20 years.
Financial Position and Profitability
3.19      IFCT's balance sheets as of December 31, 1969-73 are shown in
Annex 12. Total assets increased by 92% to Bt. 769 million during the 4
year period ended December 31, 1973. The loan portfolio increased by 87%
to Bt. 601 million during the same period and accounted for 78% of total
assets as of December 31, 1973; foreign currency loans amounted to 62%
of the loan portfolio. The equity portfolio amounted only to Bt. 350,000
on December 31, 1973. The increase in portfolio during the four-year
period was financed mainly by draw-downs on the two AsDB loans and the
Special Yen loan and by the 1971 and 1973 share capital increases each of
Bt. 50 million.

3.20      Quality of Portfolio.  Two and a half year ago, IFCT's arrears posi-
tion had become serious, and about a fifth of the portfolio had been affected by
defaults. The arrears position has since been improved significantly. As
of December 31, 1973, total principal and interest in arrears amounted to
Bt. 12.7 million or 2.1% of total loans outstanding, compared with 4.7% and
5.7% respectively on June 30 of 1972 and 1971. Principal of loans affected
by arrears (Bt. 64.4 million) as a percentage of total loan portfolio was
10.6% on December 31, 1973 compared with 22.4% on June 30, 1971. This
improvement was brought about by close management attention, frequent project
visits particularly to problem projects (four times or more a year), legal
actions taken against some delinquent clients and the charging of higher
penalty interest (up to 5-1/2% above the normal rate of interest). IFCT
has also made use of rescheduling where the situation warranted it. Annex 11
gives an analysis of IFCT's artears, which are now reasonably satisfactory.
3.21      A detailed analysis of IFCT's portfolio undertaken as of December
31, 1973 showed that eighteen projects of IFCT's loan portfolio of 85
had some problems. However, except in the case of eight projects, the problems
were of a temporary nature and caused no threat to the viability of the
projects. The eight projects with serious problems had an outstanding
balance of Bt. 20.1 million. Most of IFCT's loans are, however, adequately
secured and IFCT estimates that its probable losses on these projects will
not amount to more than Bt. 3.2 million. In addition, on outstanding
guarantees of Bt. 57.6 million, IFCT expects to lose not more than
Bt. 4.2 million. No losses are expected on the small equity portfolio
of Bt. 350,000. Against these estimated losses totalling Bt. 7.4 million,
IFCT has made provisions of Bt. 8.2 million. IFCT's portfolio is now
sound and provisions appear adequate.
3.22      Debt/Equity Ratio.  IFCT's long-term liabilities (including guaran-
tees) increased by 79% to Bt. 601 million during the 4 years ended December
31. 1973.   Its equity increased by 193% to Bt. 205 million during the same
period. The total long-term debt/equity ratio was 2.9:1 on December 31, 1973.
If subordinated Government loans were included in equity, the ratio would be
1.9:1. IFCT's policy statement was amended in July 1973 to provide for a
maximum total long-term debt/equity ratio of 6.0:1. The same borrowing limit,
namely six times equity is incorporated in the draft agreement for the
proposed Bank loan. This limit is justified by the quality of IFCT's manage-
ment and its sound portfolio. Moreover, according to IFCT's forecasts,
debt service coverage will not be lower than 1.48, in 1976. The debt/equity
ratio is expected to increase to 6.5 in 1977, when IFCT intends to consider
increasing its share capital by Bt. 50 mill. Such increase would keep the
debt/equity ratio within the recommended limit throughout the forecast period.
3.23      Reserves.  IFCT's reserves (Bt. 54.8 million) and unappropriated
earnings (Bt. 0.4 million) totalled Bt. 55.2 million or 8.3% of the port-
folio (including outstanding guarantees) as of December 31, 1973; reserves,
unappropriated earnings, and provisions for doubtful loans amounted to 9.4%
of the portfolio. Reserves and retained earnings have increased by 109%
since January 1, 1971, and are satisfactory.



- 13 -
3.24      IFCT's shares are quoted on the Bangkok Stock Exchange, but trading
is negligible and changes in shareholdings minimal; the market price of
Bt. 1,015 (Bt. 1,000 par) on March 27, 1974 is therefore not necessarily
indicative of the real value. Book value per share was Bt. 1,368 on
December 31, 1973.
3.25      Profitability.  Income statements for 1969 through 1973 are shown
in Annex 13. Gross income has more than doubled over the past four years,
whereas expenses increased at a slightly slower pace, resulting in a 1973
net income of Bt. 21.3 million - 130% higher than that of 1969, but 2%
lower than that of 1972. The slight decrease in net income from 1972 to 1973
is due to a narrowing of the interest spread from 3.9% to 3.4%; average
income from term loans decreased from 9.9% in 1972 to 9.7% in 1973, owing to
the relatively higher increase in foreign currency lending (at 9-1/2%) than
in local currency lending (at 10-1/2%), and the average cost of term debt
increased from 6.0% to 6.3%. Provisions for doubtful loans are not made
as a fixed percentage of loan portfolio; they are determined on the basis of
a review of each loan. The provision for 1971 was Bt. 6.2 million and that
for 1972 and 1973 nil, contributing to a substantial increase in 1972 and
1973 net income over that of 1971. Administrative expenses, while increasing
in absolute terms, have remained constant as a percentage of total assets
(1.5).
3.26      Net income as a percentage of average assets grew from 2.6 in
1969 to 2.9 in 1973, but, due to the 1971 and 1973 share capital increases, fell
as a percentage of net worth from 13.2 to 10.4 during the same period. There
has been no increase in the 9% dividend since 1970. The 9% dividend resulted
in a pay-out ratio of 48.8% in 1973.
3.27      Audit.  IFCT's 1973 accounts were audited and certified without
qualification by the SGV-Na Thaland & Co., a firm acceptable to the Bank.
The audit report was, and IFCT has agreed to continue to provide it, in the
form required of its dfc clients by the Bank.
Economic Impact of IFCT Operations
3.28      An attempt is made in this section to assess the economic impact
of IFCT's operations. In the absence of complete data this assessment
is admittedly not precise but it does give some idea of the importance of
IFCT as a specialized financial institution and of how its operations look
from a broader economic rather than purely financial point of view.
3.29      IFCT is the only specialized institution in Thailand providing
long-term finance to the private industrial sector. Its annual lending
volume is small in absolute terms. Its share in private industrial
investment is about 3-4% but because IFCT finances, on an average, only
about 30% of the total project cost, its influence (generally thought
beneficial) on project formulation reaches some 10-15% of Thailand's
investment in the manufacturing sector. Moreover, IFCT's relative
importance as an institutional source of finance for the private manu-
facturing sector has been increasing. IFCT's total outstanding advances
in relation to commercial banks' advances to the manufacturing sector



- 14 -
increased from 4% in 1965 to 8% in 1968 and to 11% in 1973. 1/ It should
be added that IFCT's project appraisal methods and standards are well
regarded by the financial and business communities and are treated as models.
The influence of IFCT's operations in this respect and in the formulation of
projects may well be more far-reaching than the statistics above indicate.
3.30      22 of the 91 companies in IFCT's portfolio were established by
entrepreneurs new to the manufacturing sector, and to that extent IFCT's
financing has helped to broaden the entrepreneurial base in the country.
Nineteen companies are joint ventures with foreign enteprises, while 39 (in
total 64 percent of its projects) have technical cooperation arrangements
with foreign companies and are, therefore, importing capital and/or new
technical skills and know-how into Thailand.
3.31      Up to 1971 the incremental output amounting to Bt. 1,900 million
of IFCT-financed projects was produced with an approximate capital
outlay of At. 3,300 million. This gives a capital/output ratio of 1.7
as compared to an estimated national average for industry of about 2.0. The
projects financed during 1972 and 1973 are estimated to have a capital/output
ratio of about 1.5. 2/
3.32      Since IFCT's inception in 1959, projects it has financed have
created approximately 39,000 jobs, of which about 30,000 in the manufacturing
sector account for about 11 percent of total incremental employment in
manufacturing. The projects that were financed by IFCT during 1972 and the
first half of 1973 are expected to create over 5,000 jobs at a cost of
little over Bt. 100,000 (US$5,000) per job.
3.33      The impact of IFCT-financed projects on Thailand's export
performance is very difficult to assess because relevant data are not
available. 3/ Before 1970, in line with Government policies, IFCT financed
mainly import-substituting projects. With the shift in industrial develop-
ment policies since then, IFCT has increasingly supported export-oriented
projects which since 1970 have numbered 21 or close to one-third of all
approved projects. Six of those 21 projects produce for exports only. Most
of the projects for which data are available are based on local raw materials
and account for about 10 percent of exports in their respective sectors.
3.34      Promotion.   During the last year, IFCT became more active in
identifying projects in "new" industrial branches and under-developed areas,
with a view to promoting and financing such projects. For example, during
1/   Statistics are not available on the lending volume of investment banks
and finance companies; even after direct enquiries an estimate of their
lending to the manufacturing sector could not be obtained.
2/   This figure is probably on the low side as it is based on the estimates
contained in appraisal reports that show output figures under full capa-
city operation.
3/   Many of the exporting clients have established separate sales companies
for which data could not be collected.



- 15 -
the first nine months of 1973, a study group of IFCT's Planning ard Research
Division has produced seven reports analyzing the potential for establishing
projects in various industrial branches; the respective fields of these
studies are prescribed by management. At least two of the studies are
likely to result in IFCT-financed projects. Also during 1973, an IFCT
team visited the North-East Region to survey, in cooperation with NESDB,
possibilities for setting up agro-industriql projects; further study tours
are to follow at regular intervals. Presedtly, IFCT is working jointly with
IFC on the promotion of a large pulp project.
3.35      IFCT plans in the future to increase its promotional activities
ei;pecially in respect of relatively small projects, those located outside
the greater Bangkok area and in the field of agro-business. The activities
include the preparation of feasibility studies of possible projects based
on local raw materials of the less developed areas, arranging meetings with
upcountry business communities and IFCT's senior staff, and the opening of
representative offices at regional centres.
3.36      Economic Rates of Return on IFCT financed projects.  Up to now
IFCT has not used the ERR concept in its project evaluation process. How-
ever, at the specific request of, and togetber with, the appraisal mission
it did calculate financial and economic rates of return for a sample of
14 projects. 1/ The outcome of the exercise, showing the sample-range of
both estimated financial and economic rates of return, is given below:
Percentage Range       FRR     ERR
0 -  9.9           1       2
10 - 19.9           6       7
20 and more         7       5
Only two projects showed an ERR of less than 10 percent while five projects
had an ERR of 20% or more. Moreover, six projects had a higher ERR than
FRR. On a simple average, ERR (29 percent) was higher than FRR (23 percent).
On a weighted average, ERR and FRR were 13% and 15% respectively. Excluding
one very large steel project, the weighted averages were 16% and 23%. The
two projects that had an ERR of below 10 percent, namely 2 percent and
3 percent, are both engaged in the production of plastic materials which
are heavily protected. On the other hand, four of the five projects
that showed ERR of above 20 percent are using local raw materials (wood,
bamboo grass, rubber) that account for a high proportion in total production
costs. All these results should be taken as indicating orders of magnitude
only, because of the many approximations that were necessary. By the same
1/   The sample represents IFCT's loan operations reasonably well, as 4
projects are from each of the consumer goods and capital goods industries
groups and 6 from the intermediate goods sector. However, within each
group the sampling was guided more by data availability than by scienti-
fic method. Thus the sample is biased towards larger, better-run enter-
prises. It does not include any of IFCT's 21 problem projects. Five
projects had not started operations; for these projects estimates given
in the appraisal were used.



- 16 -
token, some of the ERR values are probably understated because adjustment
could not be made for construction costs, transport, handling charges, etc.
3.37      As already stated, IFCT appraisals do not yet use the ERR cal-
culation. The fairly good results that the sample study showed do not,
therefore, establish a causal relationship. It should be noted however
that four of the five more successful projects (as measured by ERR)
in the sample were approved in 1972 and 1973.
IV. PROSPECTS
General Outlook
4.01      The outlook for the Thai economy is generally good, although
inflation and the oil-related problems introduce an element of uncertainty.
The external trade position has, however, improved and looks favorable for
the next couple of years. Domestic demand hag improved with a consequent
increase in manufacturing production and private investment. Uncertainties
prevailing are apparently causing some hesitation on the part of foreign
investors, while many local entrepreneurs are more confident and seem
determined to go ahead with their investment plans. The emphasis of the
Third Plan is on agriculture, but private manufacturing continues to be
important. Growth of manufacturing in the past was led by import-substituting
industries, but the emphasis in the Third Plan is (correctly) on export-
oriented industries. To promote economic grwtth in the rural areas and to
reduce income disparities, Government policieg also emphasize the development
of agro-based and labor-intensive industries located in the less-developed
areas.
4.02      The expected high level of investment (if realized) in the
private manufacturing sector during the remaining period of the Third Plan
will naturally mean an increase in the demand for term finance. The
sources of finance for industrial enterprises in Thailand depend upon the
size and the nature of projects. Large industrial enterprises have relatively
easy access to commercial bank credit and foreign suppliers' credits.
Smaller enterprises rely mostly on internal cash generation and the unorganized
money market. Smaller projects, those to be located in outlying regions, and
those sponsored by relatively unknown entrepreneurs, find it difficult to
secure all the institutional finance needed.
IFCT Strategy
4.03      For the last ten years, IFCT has operated in a financial environ-
ment dominated by the commercial banks. It has not been able to compete
effectively with commercial banks for the easy and secure business of
financing projects sponsored by well-established entrepreneurs in and
around the Bangkok area. The reasons are principally two: first, IFCT
did not have the influence and contacts of the commercial banks; secondly,
the well-established entrepreneurs could get the money faster from the
commercial banks and with less disclosure of information as long as they
could provide adequate security. Also, IFCT considered that too much
emphasis on financing such projects would be contrary to its stated



- 17 -
development orientation. On the other hand, IFCT has not been very
aggressive in seeking new business.
4.04       For the future, IFCT plans to follow a strategy which would
involve (a) financing smaller projects in the Greater Bangkok area unlikely
to interest the commercial banks, (b) financing a few large projects that
are complex, include promotional elements and require the assembly of a
group of sponsors (possibly involving foreign financial and technical
collaboration), (c) financing (possibly first promoting) projects which
are located in less developed regions, particularly agro-business projects,
(d) increased equity investment, and (e) to the extent possible, competing
mure aggressively with the commercial banks.
4.05      The above mentioned strategy appears in general to be sound.
Implementing it successfully will not be easy. IFCT is not under-estimating
the difficulties, and has already begun to equip itself for the task. The
operations mentioned in (a), (c) and (d) will cause IFCT's expenses to
increase, but its resource-mix is such (see paras 3.15 and 3.17) that the
overall cost of resources will be relatively low, enabling it to meet
higher expenses and still set aside provisions and reserves appropriate to
the risks undertaken. There has also been significant progress in strength-
ening management and staff, as already noted. Moreover, IFCT hopes to benefit
by a close working relationship with the Bank during the life of the proposed
loan.
Business Forecasts
4.06       IFCT's operational forecasts for the period 1974-1978 are given
in Annex 14. Commitments are summarized below (in Bt. million):
Local             Foreign   Grand
Loans   Equity   Total    Loans    Total
1972 (actual)          68        -        68        136      204
1973 (actual)          23        -         23       128       151
1974                   87        47       134      388       522
1975                   80        30       110      310       420
1976                   90        40       130      335       465
1977                   95        50       145      365       510
1978                  105        60       165      390       555
The sudden jump in 1974 commitments, and subsequent decline, need explana-
tion.  First, approvals amounting to Bt. 161 million had not become commit-
ments before the end of 1973 but should do so in 1974, and an additional
Bt. 470 million are expected to be approved during 1974 with most reaching
the commitment stage in the same year. Secondly, IFCT has been working on
a few large projects for some time and some are expected to reach commitment
in 1974. Thirdly, the Government has approved a significant increase in
hotel capacity, and IFCT expects to commit about Bt. 55 million on hotel



- 18-
projects 1/ in 1974. In subsequent years, IFCT's commitments are expected to
fluctuate less.
4.07      On the basis of estimated project costs expected to be committed
in 1974, IFCT estimates that the domestic:foreign currency mix in its loan
commitments will be 25:75. In subsequent years, IFCT expects the domestic
currency commitments gradually to increase and to reach 30:70 by 1978 as
IFCT becomes more involved in agro-business and projects in less developed
regions. This appears reasonable. Equity investments will all be in domestic
currency. Based on IFCT's pipeline of projects, which amounted to about
Bt. 600 million at the end of March 1974, the overall level of estimated
commitments shown in para 4.06 above appears realistic and should be attainable.
Resource Needs
4.03      Foreign Currency.  IFCT's foreign currency resources available
for commitment amounted to US$4.7 million (Bt. 93 million) as of December
31, 1973, but have since been augmented by the tied Japan Ex-Im Bank loan
of about US$36 million (para 3.18), bringing the total uncommitted foreign
exchange resources to US$40.7 million. IFCT expects to commit US$9.8
million in the first half of 1974 reducing uncommitted resources to US$30.9
million.  IFCT's commitments during the period mid-1974 to mid-19762/ are
expected to total US$33.5 million. On the basis of its pipeline of projects,
an analysis of sources of procurement for its own projects and for Thailand's
capital goods imports for the manufacturing sector, IFCT estimates that, on
an average, about 40% of the commitments, or about US$14 million, would
involve procurement from Japan and, therefore, could be financed from the
tied Japanese loans. This leaves about US$19 million to be committed for
procurement from sources other than Japan. About US$7 million is likely to
be for smaller projects to be financed out oftthe existing KfW loan and
another KfW loan of about US$7 million which IFCT expects to obtain in the
course of the 2-1/2 year period, both of which will be restricted to financing
projects not involving more than US$400,000 each. IFCT will, therefore, need
additional untied foreign currency resources of about US$12 million. A
Bank loan of US$12 million would meet IFCT's needs for these additional untied
resources during the period mid-1974 to mid-1976.
4.09      Local Currency.  IFCT's local currency resources available for
commitment amounted to Bt. 115 million as of December 31, 1973, but are
likely to be augmented by Bt. 50 million from PL 480 counterpart funds
(para 3.15), bringing total uncommitted local currency resources to Bt. 165
million. These resources will be augmented through loan collections, net
of repayments, of Bt. 149 million and internal cash generation of about Bt. 135
million during 1974-76, making Bt. 449 million available for commitment
during the period. Although the PL 480 funds of Bt. 50 million can be used
only for agro-business projects, these and other baht resources are sufficient
to meet IFCT's projected loan commitments, Bt. 257 million, and equity commit-
ments, Bt. 117 million, in total Bt. 374 million through 1976.
1/   This estimate is based on IFCT's pipeline of projects at the end of
March 1974.
2/   1976 commitments are assumed to be divided equally in the first and
second half of the year.

Financial Proj,ections
4.10      Projected balance sheets through 1978 are given in Annex 15.  IFCT's
assets are projected to increase rapidly by an average of 31% annually from
Bt. 769 million in 1973 to Bt. 2,341 million in 1978, primarily because of
expanded lending. The loan portfolio, after deduction of provisions, is
expected to nore than double from Bt. 601 million in 1973 to Bt. 1,837 million
in 1978 and the equity portfolio to increase from virtually nil to Bt. 223
million. Reserves and provisions as a percentage of the total portfolio are
expected to decrease from 9.4% in 1973 to 7.7% in 1976, but then to increase
to 8.3% in 1978. The total debt-equity ratio will increase from 2.9:1
on December 31, 1973 to 6.5:1 on December 31, 1977. As mentioned in para
3.22, at such time IFCT intends to consider increasing its share capital by
Bt. 50 million. Such an increase would keep the debt/equity ratio within
the recommended limit of 6:1 throughout the forecast period.
4.11      Projected income statements through 1978 are given in Annex 16.
Net income 1/ is expected to increase from Bt. 21 million in 1973 to Bt. 39
million in 1978 or by about 17% annually, a lower growth rate than that of
the last few years (para 3.25) and also considerably lower than the expected
rate of increase of business. The lower growth rate arises partly because
the return on equity investments is estimated to be low in the initial
years, and partly because IFCT's income estimates are somewhat conservative.
The average income from term loans is forecast to increase from 9.7% in 1973
to 9.9% in 1978. The average cost of term debt is forecast to decrease from
6.3% in 1973 to 5.5% in 1978 so that the interest spread will increase from
3.4% in 1973 to 4.4% in 1978. This higher interest spread is, however,
offset by the 1-1/4% "fee" on outstanding foreign debt relating to the
foreign exchange risk agreement (para 3.10). The concessionary funds at the
disposal of IFCT will therefore not result in a relatively higher net income.
Net income as a percentage of average assets is forecast to decrease from
2.9% in 1973 to 1.8% in 1978 and as a percentage of average net wcrth from
12.1% in 1973 to 11.3% in 1976, but then to increase to 13.9% in 1978. The
dividend which was 9% in 1973, is projected to be 9.5% in 1974 and 10% from
1975 onwards. The dividend pay-out ratio will be at its highest, 57%, in 1975,
but will decrease thereafter to 39% in 1978. Administrative expenses are
forecast to increase by 119% from 1973 to 1978, but to decrease as a
percentage of total average assets from 1.5% in 1973 to 1.1% in 1978.
4.12      Projected cash flow statements through 1977 are given in Annex 17.
These and the projected income statements indicate that IFCT will have a
satisfactory debt service coverage not lower than 1.48 throughout the
forecast period. Assuming IFCT's overall capital structure remains sound,
1/   4.5% of the interest to KfW on its third and fourth loans is to be set
aside to a special fund and is not included in net income. The net
interest under the Danish and USAID loans, not to be distributed as
dividend, 6-1/2% and 5-1/2% respectively, is included in net income
from which the corresponding amounts are allocated to a special reserve
fund.

the debt service cover should remain satisfactory throughout the period of
the proposed Bank loan. A schedule of estimated disbursements of the pro-
posed Bank loan is shown in Annex 18.
V. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
5.01      IFCT, established in 1959, played a modest role in the sixties, but
during the last three years it has increased its volume of business consider-
ably, primarily because of better management of the company. More recently,
management has been further strengthened and management and staff is now
generally competent. IFCT should be able to carry out its intentions of
further expanding its operations and increasing its promotional activities,
especially in respect of projects located outside the greater Bangkok area
and in the field of agro-business.
5.02      IFCT's organizational structure is suitable to its needs.  Its
organizational procedures are generally satisfactory, although some upgrading
of marketing and economic appraisals is needed. Loan operations are well
diversified in various industrial branches, the majority of its loans being
for small and medium-sized enterprises. The economic rate of return shown by
a sample of projects is satisfactory.
5.03      IFCT's overall financial position is sound.  Its portfolio is
satisfactory and provisions appear adequate. Its financial structure,
profitability and debt service ability are expected to remain satisfactory.
5.04      IFCT is creditworthy, and is suitable for a second Bank loan.
IFCT will need about US$33 million for the period mid-1974 to mid-T976 for
financing imports. US$14 million is expected to involve procurement from
Japan and, therefore, could be financed from the tied Japanese loans. About
US$7 million is likely to be financed out of an existing and a prospective
KfW loan. A Bank loan of US$12 million would fill the remaining gap.
5.05      For the second Bank loan, a free limit of US$500,000 with an
aggregate limit of 25% of the loan is recommended. This will ensure that
the Bank receives for prior approval about three-quarters, by amount, of the
proposed loan.
5.06      IFCT has requested a debt/equity ratio of 6:1 (making no distinction
between conventional loans and subordinated loans). For the reasons given
in paragraph 3.22, a contractual limit of 6:1 is appropriate and is recommended.
5.07      A Bank loan to IFCT of US$12 million is recomended.  The proposed
loan should be on the terms and conditions, including the standard commitment
charge, usual for development finance companies.

INDUSTRIAL FINANCE CORPORATION OF THAILAND
Environment and Industrial Finance
Overall Economic Development
1.        For a detailed review of the economic situation, reference is
invited to the latest Economic Report on Thailand, 82a-TH, March 2, 1973.
2.        Gross domestic product (GDP) is estimated to have grown in real
terms by about 9% in 1973, but only by 3% in 1972 compared with an average
growth rate of 8% during the sixties and about 6% during 1970-71. The main
reasons for the slowdown after 1969 were lower export prices for major
commodities in 1970-71, a decline in the growth of investment in 1971-72 and
a drought in 1972, which caused agricultural production to decline. Private
investment, after a decline of 3.5% in 1971, increased slightly in 1972,
whereas public investment declined substantially so that total fixed itnvest-
ment in current prices dropped by about 11% in 1972.
3.        Factors that caused this economic slowdown have since reversed.
For example, the 1973 winter harvest was good and world prices for rice,
sugar, maize, rubber and tin have risen. Thus, starting in 1971, Thailand's
foreign trade situation improved and the overall balance of payments posi-
tion showed a surplus for 1972 and 1973 compared with deficits for the three
previous years. Also, total fixed investment increased by 5% in real terms
in 1973. Private fixed investment, which accounted for about 70% of gross
investment in 1972, increased by 11% in real terms in 1973.
4.        The energy crisis has in regard to Thailand been a problem of
prices rather than of short supply. An adverse balance of payments effect
is, however, not expected since the prices of a number of Thailand's major
export commodities have increased to the extent that improved export earnings
for the next two years or so are likely to offset the higher oil bill. The
rate of inflation has increased. Whereas the consumer price index rose by
a yearly average of about 2% during 1967-71, it increased by 4% in 1972 and
12% in 1973. The GNP deflator rose by 7% in 1972 and nearly 10% in 1973.
The Industrial Sector
5.        The growth rate of manufacturing production has been fairly
steady for the last few years and has averaged about 10% during the period
1967-73, increasing its share in GDP at current factor cost from 11.6% in
1960 to 14.2% in 1972. Manufacturing is now the largest sector after agricul-
ture measured by contribution to real GDP.
6.        The industrial sector is characterized by a large number of
consumer goods, mainly food processing, industries. According to a 1968
industrial census, consumer goods enterprises numbered 31,000 (or 69%)



ANNEX 1
Page 2
out of 45,000 registered manufacturing enterprises; intermediate goods
enterprises numbered 5,000 (or 11%) and capital goods enterprises 7,000
(or 16%). By 1973 the number of registered firms had increased to 63,000.
In terms of value added, consumer goods industries continue to be the most
important industrial group, although their share of total value added in
manufacturing industry decreased fron 58.3% in 1968 to 56.0% in 1970;
intermediate goods industries increased their share slightly from 26.7%
to 27.0% and capital goods industries from 6.5% to 7.7%. This trend seems
to have continued during the period 1971-73.
7.        The large majority of enterprises are small and family-owned.
According to the 1968 industrial census, 99% df total registered units
employed fewer than 100 persons each, and 90% of the firms registered during
the period 1967-71 (11,500) had capital holdings of less than one million
baht. This small size of firms has often prevented the introduction of
modern management techniques and made it difficult for them to compete
with imports, whereas the close family ownershiip has been detrimental
to merger of firms into larger units. The en':ry into the industrial
sector of a new generation of Thais, many educated abroad, and Government
incentives may change the pattern of ownership gradually, but it is likely
to be a slow process.
8.        Employment figures for 1972 suggest that manufacturing industries
employed about one million persons or 5.7% of the estimated labor force of
17.5 million. There is a ready supply of cheap labor in Thailand, but
a shortage of semi-skilled and especially of skilled labor. Some open
unemployment in Bangkok of about 100,000 or fewer developed during the
economic slowdown in 1971, but the situation has since improved. There
is no widespread industrial unemployment.
9.        Most industries, especially the larger, modern ones, are located
in and around Bangkok. It is estimated that 75% of industrial output origin-
ates in Bangkok and the Central Region. Industries in the rural areas are
mainly primary processing industries such as rice milling, sugar and
sawmills. One common problem for many industries has been underutilization
of capacity, for some due to irregular supply of local raw materials and for
others overcapacity in relation to domestic demand. More recently, however,
domestic demand has picked up and some industries have been successful in
turning to exports.
10.       Thailand has few quantitative restrictions on imports, whereas
import duty is imposed on most imported products. In 1973, duties on imports
for certain categories, based on the receipts as a percentage of total imports
for the same categories, were on an average basis 25% for consumer goods, 18%
for intermediate products and raw materials and 13% for capital goods. These
figures, as averages, are indicative only; nominal import duties for some
products range between 40% and 60%. However, there are not sufficient data
available to undertake a reasonably comprehensive assessment of the impact of
effective protection, although the level of protection does not appear to have



ANNEX 1
Page 3
led to gross distortions in prices and consequently to inefficient use of
resources in the manufacturing sector. For the Government to assess and review
existing protection and to develop comprehensive policies for the future,
necessary data will have to be collected. The Government has agreed to
collect the necessary data and, with the Bank's assistance, have it reviewed
in time for the visit of a Bank industrial mission planned for the fall of
1974.
11.       Increase in world demand and prices, and domestic price stability
before 1973 have made some industries competitive on world markets and
stimulated industrial exports. Thus, industrial exports increased from about
U3$40 million in 1969 to about US$290 million in 1973 (about 19% of total
commodity exports in 1973). Industries which have been successful in turning
to exports include cement, steel and other construction materials, clothing
and cotton fabrics. Some industries based on local raw materials such as
canned food have also been able to increase exports.
12.       Higher domestic demand and better export opportunities for
certain industries, causing higher capacity utilization in most industrial
branches, have stimulated private investment. One indication of the future
investment level is the applications which have been granted promotional
privileges by the Board of Investment (BOI). In 1973 these numbered 115 with
projected investment of Bt. 7,765 million compared with 70 with projected
investment of Bt. 4,079 million in 1972. Figures from the first two months
of 1974 suggest that investment interest may be lower in 1974 than in 1973, but
higher than in 1972.
Government Policies
13.       The main objectives of the third Five-Year Plan are to promote
economic and social development, while maintaining price and external
stability. The economic growth target for the Plan period is 7%. Private
investment is projected to grow by an average annual rate of 7.3% and to
contribute 63% of total investment. The Plan projects an average 8% annual
growth rate in value added for the manufacturing sector. Preliminary estimates
indicate that the growth rates of value added in 1972 and 1973 exceeded the
target. The shift towards non-traditional industries is expected to continue
so that, during the Plan period, value added in consumer goods industries is
projected to increase by only 26%, while that in intermediate goods and
capital goods industries is projected to increase by 44% and 61% respectively.
14.       To encourage private industrial investment, the Government
provides a number of incentives through the issuance of promotion
certificates by BOI. An amendment to the Promotion of Industrial
Investment Act in October 1972 has given BOI additional powers to grant
incentives for projects that would create employment, use domestic raw
materials, be export-oriented, and be located in less-developed areas.
Also, in order to broaden the ownership of industries, promoted enter-
prises now have to be organized in the form of a limited company or
cooperative. The Government's attitude towards foreign investment con-
tinues to be liberal, but has become more selective in regard to the types
of industry encouraged and increasingly insistent on Thai majority ownership.



ANNEX 1
Page 4
15.       A promotion certificate may provide exemption from import
duties and business taxes on imported capital goods and from income tax
for 3 to 8 years. New enterprises, oubject to justification of needs,
my be given protection in the form of an import ban, increased import
duties and/or imposition of a surcharge (for a period of no longer than
one year at a time) on foreign competitive products. In order to
encourage exports, BOI may provide exemption from (i) export duties
and business taxes on products exported, (ii) import duties and business
taxes on raw and other materials used for the production of export goods,
and (iii) business taxes for the supplier or producer of domestic raw
materials.
16.       To reduce regional income disparities and ease urban congestion
in the Bangkok area, BOI may grant further benefits to industries located
in designated areas outside the Bangkok provincial region. Potential
industries have been identified for the less-,developed areas and in order
to promote the development of the Northeast region the Government is
considering setting up a special development zorporation; a body (with
IFCT representation) is presently considering the form and objectives of
such a corporation. The most promising possibilities in the Northeast region
relate to increased agriculture processing and the establishment of consumer
goods industries to supply the region's 13 million people. Industrial
development of the less-developed regions will however depend to a large
extent on how incentives are Used, and the implementation of the Government's
plans to expand and improve infrastructure and to create industrial estates.
An industrial estates authority was established in late 1972 and feasibility
studies for possible locations of such estates are being undertaken.
17.       Government incentives as amended in 1972 (para 14) have undoubtedly
encouraged increased investment, but it is difficult at this tiae to measure
their impact, as the investment climate at the same time improved for other
reasons. It is also too early to determine whether incentives and other
Government efforts particularly aimed at increasing manufacturing's con-
tribution to regional development and employment generation are effective.
A Bank industrial sector mission is scheduled to look into industrial policies
and incentives in the second half of 1974.
Industrial Finance
18.       Commercial Banks.  Commercial banks account for about 75% of
assets of financial institutions in Thailand and are the largest insti-
tutional source of industrial finance. Their main supply of funds are
deposits which increased by 49% to Bt. 58 billion over the two-year period
ended December 31, 1973. Time deposits accounted for 70% of total deposits.
The banks lend in local currency and the main forms of lending are loans
and overdrafts (Bt. 33 billion), most of which are on a short-term basis.
Overdrafts are, however, normally renewed each year if the relationship has
been satisfactory to the bank and therefore often become in effect medium-
or long-term credit. Outstanding loans and overdrafts to the manufacturing
sector increased by Bt. 0.9 billion or 20% to Bt. 5.2 billion from December
1971 to September 30, 1973, and accounted for 17% of total outstanding loans
and overdrafts.



ANNEX 1
Page 5
19.       The commercial banks have a comfortable 5-7% interest margin
between their borrowing and lending rates and are assured of good profits
without seeking to reduce excess liquidity by more aggressive lending to,
for example, small enterprises. Their lending policies are not venturesome.
Moreover, their appraisals are superficial and disclosure requirements minimal
as their lending is based on collateral rather than on the merits of projects.
20.       Finance Companies and Investment Banks.  SeveraL finance
companies and investment banks, some of them joint ventures between
local and foreign banks, have been established in the last few years.
The business activities of finance companies have expanded rapidly and
their assets are estimated at about Bt. 5 billion at the end of 1973.
Legislation, giving the Bank of Thailand powers to license and regulate
the activities of finace companies, was passed in 1973; about 150 finance
companies have applied for licenses. Regulations prescribing liquidity
ratios and maximum rates of interest are yet to be issued. Most of the
companies engage only in short-term money market operations and in such
activities as installment credit and accounts receivable financing. A few
investment banks have, however, underwritten several bond and share issues
for which they are trying to create a secondary market. A few of them
also extend term loans, although still on a limited scale. At least
two of the biggest investment banks have reasonable appraisal standards,
but their activities including underwriting business have so far been
limited to large enterprises.
21.       Suppliers' Credits.  Suppliers' credits are often preferred over
other financing due to their seemingly attrsctive terms in the form of
low rates of interest, and they provide some competition to the banking
system. Their importance has, however, decreased during 1971-73. The
inflow of such credits to the private sector amounted to US$150 million
(Bt. 3,000 million) in 1970, but decreased to US$67 million (Bt. 1,300 million)
in 1973; about 50% of the latter amount (Bt. 780 million) was for imports
of machinery and parts, the remaining amount being mainly for cars, buses,
etc.
22.       SIFO.  The Small Industries Finance Office (SIFO) of the
Department of Industrial Promotion, Ministry of Finance, extends long-
and medium-term loans of less than Bt. 1 million (US$50,000) to industries
in the private sector. It lends in local currency and receives its funds
from the Government through annual budget allocations and from the Krung
Thai Bank, a Government commercial bank, in the proportion of 1 to 3.
Its lending, which is undertaken in collaboration with the Krung Thai Bank,
has been modest, and loans outstanding amounted to Bt. 75.3 million at the
end of 1971. Loans approved in 1973 amounted to about Bt. 16 million
(US$0.8 million).
23.       IFCT.  IFCT is the only institution in Thailand which specializes
in extending medium- and long-term loans to private industrial enterprises.
The minimum size of IFCT's loans is Bt. 1 million; since this is SIFO's loan
ceiling, IFCT refers loan applicants to SIFO if the size of the required
loan is less than Bt. 1 million, and SIFO reciprocates. In the sixties,



ANNEX 1
Page 6
IFCT operated on a modest scale, but during the past three years it has
been able substantially to increase its volume of business. Outstanding
loan portfolio amounted to Bt. 601 million on December 31, 1973 and
approvals in 1972 and 1973 to Bt. 177 million and Bt. 270 milllion- (para 3.01).
The Government attaches particular importance to the role, that, for practical
purposes, only IFCT is prepared to play in providing finance to projects in
less-developed areas. From a small base, IFCT has increased its activities
over the past three years and plans, in future, to be more acvtive in financiag
small agro-based projects outside the Bangkok area (para 4.04).
24.       The Capital Market.  Thailand does not have a well-developed
stock or bond market. The Bangkok Stock Exchange founded in 1962 has
been relatively inactive and virtually no trading takes place on a dayw-
to-day basis. There are several reasons: (i) very few good companies
are listed, and many of them are closely held-by families; (ii) deposits
with commercial banks offer very attractive (-ax-free) returns; and (iii)
life insurance business and other forms of contractual savings are quite
limited in Thailand, so that there are no significatit institutional invest-
ments. In 1969, the Bank of Thailand (BOT) commissioned a study of the
stock market. The report recommended the establishment of a new stock
exchange along with several reforms to provide ineentives for private
companies to go public. The report was well received and a committee 1/
was formed in September 1970 to lay the groundwork for the establishment
of a securities exchange. Legislation for the new exchange has been
approved by the Cabinet, but the incentives reform, needed to conduce to
the successful working of the exchange, would require changes in the
revenue code; these changes have not yet been approved. Under the cir-
cumstances, it is uncertain whether the new exchange will start functioning
until late summer 1974.
Interest Rates
25.       The maximum rates of interest of commercial banks, on deposits 8%
and on loans 15%, are determined by the Bank of Thailand (BOT). The minlmum
lending rate of 11-1/2% (increased from 10-1/2% in January 1974) is
prescribed by the commercial banks which act as a cartel through the
Inter-Bank Agreement of the Thai Bankers Association; this minitum lending
rate has resulted in large margins for the commercial banks. / Government
bonds yield 7-1/2% to 8-1/2%. Interest income from commercial bank deposits,
Government 7-1/2% savings bonds and 8-1/2% loan bonds are tax exempt and
therefore at a strong competitive advantage over other types of investment.
Investment banks and finance companies are only marginally involved in
financing industrial investment. Their interest rates are not regulated,
1/   This committee was chaired by the former Managing Director, the present
Chairman, of IFCT.
2/   The average interest rate on deposits was 5.4% in 1971 and the spread
between the average interest rate on loans and that on deposits was
about 6%; this spread is believed to have remained unchanged.



ANNEX 1
Page 7
but of course adapted to those of the commercial banks. They raise funds
through the issuance of promissory notes: 12 months notes carry 9% interest.
Their lending rates vary from 11% to 24% per annum. The coupon rate on bond
issues by large, well-known enterprises, fully guaranteed by a commercial
bank, runs at about 11% to 12%. The lending rate in the unorganized market
varies from 15% to 60% per annum. Export bills and bills arising from the
purchase of agricultural products, which can be rediscounted at BOT, are
charged 7%. The terms of suppliers' credits during the last year or so have
been about 7 to 8% interest and an amortization period of 2 to 5 years with
a short or no grace period. Suppliers' credits are likely to gain in
importance during 1974 partly due to tighter liquidity and higher lending
rates of the commercial banks. SIFO's lending rate is 9%. IFCT's lending
rate of 10-1/2% is discussed in paras 3.11 and 3.12 of the appraisal report.
26.       The interest rate structure in Thailand is distorted primarily
for two reasons: one, commercial bank deposits and Government bonds are
tax-free; and two, the minimum lending rate of commercial banks is prescribed
by the Inter-Bank Agreement and not determined by the play of market forces.
BOT is presently reviewing the interest rate structure in Thailand on the
basis of a study conducted by IMF in 1973. This study argues that the
prescribed minimum lending rate should be abolished, that there is a good
case for abolition of tax exemption on bank deposits and Government bonds,
and that market forces should be allowed to play a greater role in influencing
interest rates. BOT has established a committee to evaluate the IMF study.
The committee is soon to finish its evaluation, and discussions with IMF
are scheduled for the summer of 1974. There is, therefore, hope that
corrective action will be taken in the near future. The GDP deflator in
Thailand rose nearly 10% in 1973. A recent Bank mission to Thailand expects
the deflator to increase by about 10% in 1974, but thereafter to increase
at a substantial lower rate. There is every reason to believe that the
inflationary trends will be taken into account by the Bank of Thailand in
its review of the interest rate structure.

IDU8TRIAL FINANCE CORPOWATIN OF THAILAND
Statement of 2oprating Policies
(Adopted by tho BoArd of Directors on November 15, 1962 and amended on
Daeember 23; 1963, February 7, 1966, May 1, 1967 and July 4, 1973)
1.        IFCT Is an inveatment institution designed to assist in the expan-
.ion of industry in Thailand. To this end, it will pursue an aggressive
policy to promote, finance and otherwise assist private industry.
2.        TFOT will invest in enterprises which are expected to make a con-
tribution to the eoonomio development of Thailand.
3.        It will make its investment decisions only on the basis of sound
investment criteria And standards.
4.        Subjeot to suach oriteria, it will select projects on as broad a
fographical banis an poosible.
5.        TFCT Articles empower it to provide finance in any form it considers
appropriate to its alients and in its own interest. IFCT will, as appropriate,
make use of the entire range of forms of investment. It will give particular
attention to its olients' needs for equity financing and will provide such
S9uity to the extent conaistent with mound finiancial praotice.
6.        It will not incur Any debt in excess of six times its equity, (equity
is defined as paid-in ahare capital plus reaerves plus retained earnings) deter-
mined in accordanoe with sound aconunting practices. Debt in foreign currency
will be valued in Baht based on its par value wit4,the borrowed foreign currencies
on the date of conclusion of the loan agreement. AW
7,        It will diveraify its financing (except for temporary investment of
liquid funds in ahort-term securities) among different types of industries and
different types of financing.
A.    It will not normally commit to any single enterprise (in what-
ever form) an amount greater than 25% of its equity as defined
in paragraph 6.
b.    Tt will not commit to any single enterprise in the form of
equity more than 10% of its equity as defined in paragraph 6.
Q.    The total of its equity investments will not exceed its equity.
c.    It will not normally make a loan of less than Baht 1,000,000.
I/ IPOT has agreed to change the second sentence of para. 6 to read as
follows: "Debt in foreign ourrency will be valued in Baht using the
par value, set at the time each valuation is made,with the borrowed
foreign currencies", or similar wording.  This change will be effected
at IFOT's Board meeting in April or May 1974.

8.        It will not seek to take a controlling interest in an enterprise
or any other interest which would give it primary responsibility for
management of an enterprise; and it will not take up more than 25% of the
shares of any single enterprise. Notwithstanding the foregoing limitation,
in any case of jeopardy, it may take such action as it thinks fit to
protect its investment.
9.        It will conduct its operations in such manner as to assist in
the growth of a capital market in Thailand and to improve facilities for
marketing shares and securities, and will revolve its own portfolio uhenever
it can do so on satisfactory terms. In selling an investment, it will
pay due regard not only to its own interests, but also to the interests
of other participants in such investment, and to the interests of the others
who have directly invested in the enterprise in which it has invested.
10.       It will finance undertakings which are soundly managed and which
appear, on careful economic, financial and engineering investigation,
to be economically viable; and it will carefully watch the operation of
the enterprises it finances and it will promptly make available to them
constructive and remedial advice wherever requisite.
11.       To build and strengthen its own management and staff as well
as to assist clients in the formulation and execution of their projects,
it will rapidly build an effective organization and develop an adequate
staff, including financial and economic analysis, engineering, accountancy
and legal services.
12.       In accordance with normal business practice, IFCT will endeavour
to obtain adequate security for the loans it provides.  However, its
decisions to invest will be based on its judgement regarding the prospective
profitability of its clients' enterprises.
13.       It will levy charges for its loan financing and services which,
together with earnings on investment, will allow the accumulation of
resources and the payment to its shareholders, in due course, of a
satisfactory return on their investment. It will build and maintain
reserves consistent with sound financial practice; these will include
reserves for bad debts and investments and, in addition, legal reserve to
strengthen its equity. To this end, it will set aside at least 30% of its
annual profits consisting of (a) 25% as reserves for bad debts and invest-
ments until such reserves have been built up to 20% of its loan and
investment portfolio and (b) 5% as legal reserve until it has been built
up to 10% of the paid-in capital.
14.       IFCT will not carry the foreign exchange risk on external
borrowings, which it must repay in foreign exchange. It will pass that



Annex 2
Page 3 of 3
risk to its clients or find other suitable means to cover it. y
15. The Board of Directors will use its best efforts to prevent any
one person or company, or group of affiliated persons or companies from
gaining effective control of IFCT,
/ IFCT has agreed to change the wording of para. 14 as follows: "tThe
foreign exchange risk on IFCT's external borrowings, which IFCT
must repay in foreign exchange, will be covered:
a.  For Government guaranteed and qualifying non-Government guaranteed
loans, under the foreign exchange risk agreement between IFCT and
the Ministry of Finance dated          , or
b.  In case the foreign exchange risk is not covered by the said
agreement, IFCT will pass that risk to its clients or will find
other suitable means to cover itt".
(The foreign exchange risk agreement is expected to be signed in
April 1974.) This change will be effected at IFCT's Board meeting
in April or May 1974.

in relation to foreign currencies shall be based on the rate of exchange
prevailing on the date IFCT sells for Baht the foreign currency drawings
from foreign currency loans against the rate of exchange prevailing on
the date IFCT buys against Baht the foreign currency required to effect
repayment of the loan-drawings and/or payment of interest and commitment
charge thereon. Repayments shall be made in the order of the drawings made
from the loans.

(i) The loss shall be deducted from the Exchange Risk
Profit Account under B.
(ii) If the loss is not thus covered, the uncovered amount
shall be deducted from the Provision for Exchange Risk under 5. to such
an extent that it will not reduce that account below 25% of the balance
at that time.
(iii) In the event that the loss still is not covered, it
shall be deducted from IFCT General Reserve but deduction in this case
shall not be in an amount greater than that transferred to IFCT General
Reserve from the Provision for Exchange Risk Account under the second
Paragragh of 6.
(iv) If the loss is still not covered, it shall be deducted
from the Claim Account of the Ministry of Finance under 4.

(i) to (iv) have been taken, the Corporation shall pay off the deficit
amount and shall be reimbursed by the Ministry of Finance at the proper
time.
The Corporation shall immediately inform the Ministry of Finance
after it has taken this action.
9.        After the Ministry of Finance has made the reimbursement under
8.C.(v), IFCT shall pay, in addition to the amount payable under 4., a yearly
fee at the rate of Baht one million per annum, irrespective of the number
of reimbursements made by the Ministry of Finance. Payment in this
connection shall commence with the year following payment made by the
Ministry of Finance under 8.C.(v) until the total sum paid out as fees
equals to the payment made by the Ministry of Finance.
In the event that the Corporation liquidates its business before
the full amount expended by the Ministry of Finance under 8.C(v) can be
paid off,the residual amount of Provision for Exchange Risk Account shall
be utilized to pay the Ministry of Finance an amount not greater than
that paid out under 8.C.(v).
10.       The Ministry of Finance shall assume responsibility to the
foreign lending sources concerned over the consequences of the loss and
profit resulting from the change in Baht value in relation to foreign curr-
encies for all loans contracted by the Corporation against payment of which
the Ministry of Finance provides guarantee. Loans not covered by the
Ministry of Finance's guarantee shall be given a case-by-case consideration.
11.       A detailed account on every loan outstanding to the foreign lending
source under 2. as of June 30 and December 31 of each year shall be prepared
and submitted by the Corporation to the Ministry of Finance within fifteen
days of the aforementioned dates.
