INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON
A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
BANCO CENTRAL DE LA REPUBLICA DOMINICANA
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
FOR THE PUERTO PIATA TOURISM PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Banco Central de la Republica Dominicana (Central Bank) with
the guarantee of the Dominican Republic for the equivalent of US$21.0
million to help finance a project for tourism development. The loan would
have a term of 30 years, including 10 years of graces with interest at
8 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An "Updating Report on the Economy of the Dominican Republic"
(R.73-91) was distributed to the Executive Directors on May 4, 1973. A
further updating economic mission visited the Dominican Republic in August/
September 1974* Its report is scheduled to be distributed to the Executive
Directors in March 1975. Available social and economic data are presented
in Annex I.
3.        During the last decade the structure of the Dominican economy
has changed markedly. Although agriculture still employs over half of the
economically active population, its share of GDP dropped from one-third to
one-fifth as the contribution of industrial activities (mining, ranufac-
turing, construction and public utilities) rose from one-fifth in 1960 to
30 percent in 1970. This change has also been reflected in the structure
of foreign exchange earnings: the share of agricultural exports in current
account receipts declined from 78 percent in 1966 to an estimated 64 per-
cent in 1973, reflecting the initiation of ferronickel exports and rising
revenues from toarism.
4.        GDP is estimated to have grown by 11 percent per annum between
1970 and 1973 as agricultural production recovered from the droughts of
the late 1960's, the Falconbridge ferronickel plant came into operation
in 1972 and sugar export prices rose sharply. The major impact of these
factors has now been absorbed and preliminary figures indicate that GDP
growth in 1974 declined to a still very commendable 7.8 percent rate.  Per
capita GNP in 1973 reached about $530.Yv Growth was spurred by contin-
ued high export prices (which have induced a rapid increase in export
volume and value) and a rapidly rising public investment program.
I/ World Bank Atlas basis.



-2-
50       Exports of goods and non-factor services rose from $158 million
in 1966 to $613 million in 1973. Sugar continues to be the chief export as
well as the most important industry in the country. Production and process-
ing employ about 65!,0o0 wvrkers (about 11 percent of the agricultural labor
force), contribute about 15 percent, of government revenues and about half
of merchandise export receipts. The value of exports of sugar and by-
products rose from $80 million in 1966 to $206 million in 1973 as average
sugar export prices increased from 6.2 JAb in 1967 to 17ft/b in June 1974
and as the volume of exports of raw sugar rose from 600,000 short tons in
1966 to 1.14 million in 1973. Dominican exports of sugar and by-products
will approach $400 million in 1974.o
6.       Other agricultural exports, mainly coffee, cocoa and tobacco,
increased from $44 million in 1966 to $126 million in 1973 as favorable world
prices stimulated production. Ferronickel production added $h7.Q million and
$83.5 million in 1972 and 1.973, respectively, to gross export earnings./
7.       Public investment is estimated to have increased in real terms by
over 29 percent per year between 1970 and 1973 and to have corresponded to
almost 7 percent of GDP in 1973. The rapid increase in public investment
has been supported by a successful savings effort which raised Central Govern-
ment savings in 1973 to almost 6 percent of GDP and has permitted 85 percent
of Central Government investment since 1970 to be financed without borrowing.
8.       Most public investment hps h-en in        'irtvre imJdng the
extension of the road network and the increase of installed electricity
generating capacity. There are, however, indications that the Government now
intends to devote more public investment to the directliy productiive sectors,
especially to agriculture and tourism and to the social sectors in order to
distribute more widely the benefits of recent economic growth.
9.       The rap:id growth of exports and the higher level of public invest-
ment have stimulated other sectors of the economy. Encouraged by liberal
industrial incentives legislation, which permits substantial reductions in
import duties for capital equipment and raw materials as well as access to
foreign exchange at the official rate, plus substantial protection, value
added in manaufacturing has increased over 10 percent per annum since 1970.
Construction has excpanded by over 23 percent per year during the same period.
Private fixed investment increased in real terms by about 16 percent per year
in the last three years, and in 1973 made up almost 13 percent of GD?.
10.      The Dominiican economy still faces serious constraints for the
longer run. A rapid rate of population increase has resulted in high levels
of rural under-emplpyment while the rural exodus has contributed to maintain
a high rate of urban unemployment,despite the recent increases in-public and
private investmenlt. The employmnt generating effects of industrialization
have been rather modest because industrial incentives tend to promote              *
relatively capital-intensive import substitution.
;/ An IBRD loan of $25 million helped finance the construction of the
Falconbridge project.



11.      Despite an impressive export performance, the net foreign reserve
position improved less significantly in the past three years. Ex-ports of
goods and services increased by $258 million between 1970 and 1973 but
imports rose by almost the same amount  The $26 million increase in net
foreign reserves in the same period resulted largely from a greater inflow
of long-term foreign capital. This situation, however, improved signifi-
cantly in the first half of 1974, when net foreign reserves increased by
an additional $40 million, to a level of $54 million, equivalent to more
than one monthts imports.
12.       Equipment and raw material imports have been stimulated by the
industrial incentives legislation. Imports of a wide variety of consumer
goods are not controlled by the authorities when the foreign exchange is
acquired by imorters on the "parallel" market. There has also been a
marked increase in imports of food, attributable in part to domestic
price controls which may have discouraged production of some food staples,
and to uncertainty associated with the Agrarian Reform Law, which had an
initial negative impact on production. Rice imports, which in 1972 amounted
to only 9,000 tons, are expected to reach 60,000 tons in 1974.
13.       Since it is unlikely that the price of sugar will continue to
increase at the same rate as in the past two years, and may even decline,
and since production of ferronickel is now reaching installed capacity,
export growth from these two products is likely to slow down after 197h.
The Government is therefore emphasizing export diversification primarily
through the development of tourism, agro-industries, livestock and mining
of precious minerals. Gross foreign exchange earnings from tourism in
1973 are estimated at $38 million as compared to $14 million in 1970. As
explained in Part III of this Report, prospects for continued expansion
of tourism are favorable.
14.      The Central Bank has recently given priority to financing
industries for processing domestic agricultural products. It is still
too early to judge whether private investors will find it attractive to
invest in export-oriented industries given the fact that nresenrt in-
dustrial incentives favor importaubstitution. Exports -of beef increased
from 7.5 million pounds in 1970 to 15 million pounds in 1972, although
a termporary ban on beef exports held their growth in 1973 to only one
miMlion pounds. Gold and silver mining is expected to start in late l971
or early 1975. At current prices, exports of these precious metals could
amount to about $50 million per year when the mines are operated at full capacity.
15.       Higher petroleum prices are estimated to increase imports of
petroleum and petroleum products to about $160 million in 1974, or about
$110 million more than in 1973. Since fuel purchases by the Falconbridge
plant represent nearly 25 percent of total petroleum imports, the increased
foreign exchange requirements are likely to be partially offset by
smaller transfers of profits or possibly higher export prices for ferro-
nickel* Given favorable export prospects and the low public debt service
ratio, the balance of payments impact of the energy crisis should be
manageable in the foreseeable future.
16.  Higher fuel costs will nonetheless have an impact on the
Dominican economy. -Over 90 percent of power generated by the publicly-
owned Dominican Electricity Corporation (CDE) is from thermal sources



-4-
and the scope for expanding hydro-electric power generation capacity
is limited. In 1974, CDE's fuel costs are expected to increase to
RD$34 million as compared to only RD$5 million in. 1973. To partly off-
set higher fuel costs, CDE expects to extend the fuel cost adjustment,
which now applies only to industrial rates, to residential consumtion
later this year.
17.  As the econonxy strengthened in the last three years there has been
a substantial decrease in the flows of concessionary official bilateral
assistance. Commitments of bilateral assistance from the UJ.S. declined
from an average of $41 million per ann-um in 1966-69, to $20 million
per anrum in 1970-73. Average annual commitments of multilateral assis-
tance on the other hand, remained unchanged at around $15 rillion.
Despite the decline in official external aid, the Government has not re-
sorted much to coumercial credit and the debt profile continues to be
favorabld. At the end of 1973, total medium and long-term public and
publicly-guaranteed external debt, outstanding, disbursed and repayable
in foreign currencies, amounted to $282 million., a:bout 87 percent of
which represented o'bligations to governments and muzltilateral agencies.
The ratio of debt siervice on public debt to earnings from exports of
goods and non-factor services declined from 5*. percent in 1970 to
4 .5 percent in 1973.
18.   The Dominican Republic has followed soumd fiscal and external
debt policies over the last three years and prospects for its balance
of payments are reasonably favorable.  It therefore no longer needs to
receive external assistance on concessionary terms alore, and is credit-
worthy for Bank lending.
PART II - BAIIK GTRO?_ O)PELA'i:T-S_I,3    TE DOMD.ICIA  RSPUBLIC
19     'The World Bank Gro-co has naade one loan and three credits for projects
in the Dominrican, Republic. A $215 million loar was madec by the Batk in FY70
for a ferronickel mining project (T7'alconbridge), which was comrpleted on sched-ul-.

pleted by the original closing dates. A tLird T11A credit for $13 million was
approved in FY73 for a-n irrigation project (fYaqsue del Norte, which is also to
be financed by the 1D3B, The creaeZ,d-, becwa-me effective on tan arv    197!i and
project work began in February 1974.   he ILF  comtitted $7.4 million in F-74
to a cement factory project. Annex If contains a surinary statement of Bank
loans, IDA credits and IFC In ves.tent3 as of August 31, 1974 and notes on the
execution of ongoing projectes.



-5-
20.      When the Bank Group began to lend to the Dominican Republic in the
early 1970's, the counrtry's precaricus econopic and financial situation
required that external assistance be on highly concessionary terms.  There-
fore, with the exception of an enclave export project (Falconbridge) our past
lending was all on IDA terms.  For the reasons explained in Part I, we believe
that IDA assistance to the Dominican Republic should be phased out and replaced
by lending on Bank terms. We propose, however, to ease the transition by
making one more small IDA credit in the Dominican Republic, tentatively for
a population project, and by making the grace and amortization periods of the
present Bank loan somewhat longer than might be required on strictly project
grounds.
21.      Bank Group lending in the Dominican Republic has been primarily
directed at the two major obstacles to economic and social development identi-
fied in the previous section, i.e., excessive dependence of the balance of
payments on one manor commodity and high rates of underemployment. The
ferronickel and livestock projects, as well as the proposed tourism project,
address themselves primarily to the first problem. Our ongoing lending for
education and for irrigation as well as our prospective assistance to the
GUovernment's rural health and family planning services relate to the second
problem. Bank involvement in agriculture, education, family planning, tourism
and a road rehabilitation and maintenance project would also be geared to the
establishment of institutions capable of carrying out effective sectoral plan-
ning, project preparation and execution.
22.      The ongoing IDA-financed education project is designed to improve
the quality and relevanr of secondary education and of primary teacher training.
Technical assistance is also being provided to the Government under the project
for the preparation of a comprehensive long-term education plan. Future Bank
Group lending for education would assist primary education and farmer training
in rural areas, establish a national vocational training scheme, and extend
secondary education reform.
23.      The Government has been carrying out substantial investments in road
construction. There is,however, an urgent need to rehabilitate existing roads
which have been allowed to deteriorate, and to strengthen maintenance services.
The Goverrnent is consc0ous that unless maintenance is improved, much of its
road investment will be wasted, and has requested the Bank to consider financing
a maintenance and rehabilitation project.
24.      The Dominican Republic's population density ranks among the highest
in the hemisphere and the net population growth rate would also be amlong the
highest were it not for substantial emigration to the United States and Puerto
Rico. The Government has begun an active, though limited, family planning
program with the support of UNFPA and AID and has requested IDA assistance in
expanding the program to rural areas.

25.     Sugar exports are -.ikely to remain the Dominican Republic's princi-
pal source of foreign exchange earnings in the foreseeable future.  The Govern-
ment has asked the Bank to consider a project aimed at increasing the prod-uc-
tive capacity of the State Sugar Enterprise to take advantage of favorable
nmrket conditions, improving efficiency so as to enable the Dominican Republic
to remain competitive if market conditions become less favorable, and mking
more effective use of limited land resources.
26      The UXS. Governmenr;, has in the past been tlh,e Dominican Republic s
major source of external fimancing, mainly for budget support and for, projects
ir agriculture., education, health and for industrial credit.  The IDB has
been active in power$ water and sewerage, industrial credit, agicult,-ire and
education. The principal sources of external financing to the Dcmnicar
Republic in the past are sumuarized below (in $ millions);

27.    The Bank Group's share ir the Dominican Republic's publicly-guaran-
teed external debt outstanding and disbursed amounted to less than 10 percent
at the end of 1973. About feur-.fifths of the debt owed to the Bank Group
corresponded to the loan made to the Falconbridge ferronickel operation. The
Bank Groupts share of public external debt service was 1.n;4 percent.  Its
share in the Dominican Republic's external debt is likely to rise to
20 percent by the end of the 1970's and its share of external public debt
service would be of the order of 15 percent.
PART III - THE TOURISM SECTOR
The ite&ional Se,ting
28.   The Caribbean has long been a leading tourist destination.  Jamaica
and the Bahamas have traditionally catered to the North American market in
the winter season and numerous small, luxury hotels have specialized in this
trade. With increased demand during the 1960's, large, high-rise hotels were
built, especially in Puerto Rieo and the Baharmas, to cater to the steadily
growing, affluent North American market. Visitor arrivals, excluding cruise
ship passengers, grew from about 1 million in 1960 to 3.9 million in 1972,
i.e.yat about 11 percent per annurn.
29.    Caribbean tou.ris-m development has been closely tied '-o economic circum-
stanee.s in North America.  ro?th was unlin e,srrupted in the 19601s; it slacken-
ed. in 1970 due to the economic slowdnoin in the U-nited States but recovered
again in 1971-72. Preliminary data for 1973-74 indicate that though growth
may have decreased somewhat for the region as a whole, some countries have
continued to experience healthy growth rates in tourist arrivals.  Lntensive
merchandizinlg is resulting in changes in the tourist trade. There is more
group and less individual travel and though winter is still the high   ason,
the seasonal distribution of visitors is becoming more even.
30.   The hotel industry in the Caribbean had about 65,00o rooms and 130,000
beds in 1972. The a.nnual growth rate in the supply of rooms was in excess of
10 percent between 1968 and 1972. The operating costs of Caribbean hotels are
increasing since food, much of which is imported by t.he,smaller islands, has
become more expensive, and payroll costs have risen sharply in spite of high
unempl'oyment in many islands.  This trend has adversely affected the larger
hotels which, because of relatively expensive rates, hare had sor-e difficulty
in attracting the middle-income tourists for whom they were designed. The
average room occupancy rate was around 66 percent in 1972.
31.    Several conclusions can be drawn on the CGribbean tourism industry.
First, the major source of demand is the North American market. Second,
demand for smsll, luxury hotels remirais strong.  Third, the large, high-rise
hotels have not fully succeeded in attracting the middle-income market because
of rising costs and rates, although the greater incidence of group travel is
helping to fill medium-priced hotels in the summer monthns as well as in the
winter.



32.      The recent rise in fuel costs, through its effect on air fares, may
improve the Caribbean's position as a tourist destination vis-a-vis those
destinations which are more distant from North American markets. Also, charter
air travel may prove to be more attractive to tourists than long distance
travel by car.
The Domiican Rertublic Tourism Sector
33.      The DonrLnican Republic is one of the few Caribbean countries which
did not participate in the tourism boom of the 1960's. Yet it has climatic,
cultural and econoric assets well-su4ited for tourism development. It has a
typical Caribbean climate, good beaches, pleasant scenery and an interesting
historical and cultural background. It is readily accessible from North
America and offers -the opportunity for varied recreational activities.
HIotel operating costs are low in comparison with other parts of the Caribbean
partly because the Dominican Republic has a broad base of agricultural product-
tion;, which many C&aribbean islands lack, capable of supplying the tourist
industry with much of its foodstuff requirements.
34.      Foreign visitor arrivals to the Dominican Republic greri at an average
of 19 percent annually fom :1968 to 1973. Preli-nary figures indicate that
arrivals from the J.S. increased significantly  ir 1574 . Visitors to the
Dominican Republic represented less than 3 percent of all visitors to the
Caribbean in 1972l, and most- were business rather thar tourism oriented.  To
consolidate the Do,nmican Republic's emerging image as a tourist destinations
the Central Bank would underltake to carry out a tourism promotion program as
part of the project, (Section 3,06 of the draft Loam Agreeement). The Government
would fund this program and further andertake to facilitate tourist travel
by adopting expeditious procedures to process passengers through its interna-
tional airports (Sections 3*10 and 3.09 of the draft Guarantee Agreement).
35.      There are abolft. .608J notel rooms of intennational standard in the
Dominican RepubiLe as copared to 9.,000 roon  in neighbouring Puerto Rico
and 6,60u in Jaxam-ica. Hwaever., hote-I co:Lst-uctMon :  Si anto Domir.ngo is pro-

menrt; guaranteed availability of foreign exchange needed for hotel project
imports and for reatriation of capital and profits; and the sale or lease of
improved land  at, reasonable tormrs   The Governmaent would agree to review
tourism investmaent incentive,3 to ensure that they are appropriatej, both from the
investors' and fronm the fisc.l point of view, and to establish obJective
criteria for granting incenai,-ives (Section 3.02(b) of the draft Guarantee Agree-
ment)   A study for this purpose would be funded under the project.



- 9 -
37.      Three government agencies have responsibilities in the tourism sector.
The Banco Central de la Republica Dominicana (Central Bank) which, in addition
to its monetary functions plays a major role in financing development projects,
has been assigned the tasks of preparing and implementing tourism infrastructure
projects and providing credit for hotel construction. To carry out its res-
ponsibilities, the Central Bank has created a Tourism Infrastructure Depart-
ment (INFRATUR). The Corporacion Nacional de Fomento de la Industria Hotelara
y Desarollo del Turismo (a public corporation) manages all publicly-
owned hotels; these account for about half of total hotel capacity. The
National Tourism Directorate (DNT) was created to formulate overall tourism
policy and to carry out tourism promotion campaigns.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
38,      In 1970, the Dominican Government requested that the Bank consider
providing assistance for a project to develop tourism infrastructure in one
of five priority regions selected on the basis of a UNESCO-financed study.
The Puerto Plata region on the North Coast was selected by the Government as
offering the best prospects for developing international tourism. The project
was prepared by consultants under a UlNDP grant for which the Bank was Executing
Agency. A Bank mission visited the Dominican Republic from mid-September to
mid-October 1973 to appraise the project and subsequent missions were sent to
evaluate some of its technical aspects. Loan negotiations were held in
Washington from August 29 to Septeiber 53 1974. The Dominican negotiating
team was led by Mr* Diogenes Fernandez, Governor of the Central Bank and
Mr. Juan 0. Velazquez, Counsel to the Central Bank. Annex III of this report
sumnarizes the project and loan. An appraisal report (No. iiL b-DO  is being
distributed separately.
ProJect Concept and Dscriion
39.      The region selected by the Government for tourism development extends
for approximately 125 kis along the North Coast and includes the town of
Puerto Plata. As tourism in the region is expected to be predominantly beach-
oriented, development will be along a coastal belt,  The inland boundary of
this development strip is an existing road which would separate tne agricultu-
ral hinterland from the tourism area, Resort sites will be separated by green
spaces to allow for recreational uses and to prevent the continuous sprawl of
ribbon-type development which has spoiled other coast-lines in the Caribbean.
40.      Two resort stes have been selected -ithin the North Coast region for
the first phase of development; they are Playa Doraa; daL-ectly easU of Puerto
Plata, and Playa Grande, some 80 kms east of Puerto Plata. Infrastrueture and
other facilities would be provided in both resort sites   The folowing would
be included in the project: site preparation -- including grouand conso-
lidation in Playa Dorada to prevent loss of ground bearing capacity in the
event of seismic movements -- roads, trails and storm water dr- age- water
supply and sewerage; solid waste disposal and environmental sanitatic,n power,
lighting and telephone installations; eartnworks, landscaping and beach i5-
provements; golf courses, clubhouses, stables and riding schools; a shopping
area and public beach facilities. Land within the two resort sites would be
leased or sold by the Central Bank for the construction of hotels, villas



- 10 -
and apartments as well as for recreational and commercial development. Uti-
lities and other services would be provided as common facilities; by concen-
trating their construction in defined areas, planning and infrastructure in-
stallation would be simplified and the cost of services would be reduced.
41.    Puerto Plata (population 33,000) is connected by a good paved road
to Santiago, the country's second largest city, and to Santo Domingo which is
on the South Coas-t. Since the existing international airport at Santo Domningo
is too distant (200 kms) to serve tourists whose destination is the North
Coast, construction near Puerto Plata of a new international airport (where a
runway has already been financed by the government) would be completed under
the project in acccrdance with international air safety regulations.
42.     Since tourism is largely a new activity in the Dominican Republic,
there is a shortage of personnel with the various skills required to provide
tourism services of international standard    A hotel training school would be
constructed at Puerto Plata and technical assistance would be obtained to
operate it under the project. Tourism facilities in the project sites are
expected to provide considerable employment. Site and service works are in-
eluded in the project for employee housing near Playa Dorada, and the village
of Rio San Juan, where many of the Playa Grande resort employees may live,
would be provided with water and sewerage systems.
43.     The proposed developments in the North Coast area are being planned
to conserve the natural beauty of the region and to minimize damage to the
environment. The Government will adopt prior to the effectiveness of the pro-
posed loan, land-use, zoning and building regulations for the North Coast
area earmarked for development (Section 7.01 (a) of the draft Loan Agreement and
Section 3.08 of the draft Guarantee Agreement). More detailed regulations would
also be established for the two resort sites. The main objectives of these
controls will be to prevent the haphazard location and construction of indivi-
dual hotels and residences.
The Market
L4..    The tourist market for Playa Dorada and Playa Grande will be mainly in
the eastern part of North America but a secondary market could be Puerto Rico,
which has strong ctltural ties with the Dominican Republic. Travel promotion
would be made year-round but it is expected that there will be more visitors
in the winter.
45.    The facil:ities at Playa Dorada would be designed to attract a middle-
income clientele. Vacations at Playa Dorada for periods of four, seven and
fifteen days would be marketed through travel outlets in package form i.e.,
including the cost of room, meals and travel. Estimates indicate that
the cost of such vacations would be well below the cost of comparable holi-
days in most other known Caribbean tourist destinations. The use of
charter flights for groups of visitors would reduce their cost even further.
The Playa Grande development, which would include about one-fourth of planned
accommodation, will be aimed at attracting the higbr-income market in North



- 11 -
America and would compete with traditional Caribbean destinations. Vacations
in Playa Grande are also estimated to cost less than at ccmparable locations
elsewhere in the Caribbean.
46.       The build-up of accommodation in the two resort sites is projected to
start with 440 rooms in 1977 and to reach 1,900 rooms by 1984. The Central Bank
would start negotiating with hotel and other tourist facility investors as soon
as the infrastructure project is initiated and would prepare a program to pro-
mote investments in the tourism industry (Section 3.13 of the draft Loan Agree-
ment). The Government will extend to investors in the project sites incentives
no less favorable than those provided to investors in other parts of the
country (Section 3.02(a) of the draft Guarantee Agreement), and the Central Bank
would provide credit at appropriate terms to investors (Section 5.04 of the draft
Loan Agreement). It is expected that hotel and other tourism facility investors
will be attracted by relatively low operating costs, fiscal incentives and
favorable market prospects. However, in the event that private investors fail
to construct a sufficient number of hotel rooms to ensure that the project earns
an acceptable economic rate of return, the Central Bank would cause those acco-
mmodations to be available by the end of 1986, provided that the Bank and the
Central Bank agree that tourist demand for such accommodation exists (Section
3.16 of the draft Loan Agreement).
47.       The size of the project is reasonable in the context of the likely
pattern of tourism development in the Dominican Republic and the Caribbean.
On the assunption that annual growth rates of tourist arrivals to the Domini-
can Republic will, in the long run, decline to the recent growth rate expe-
rienced by the Caribbean as a whole, the number of visitors to the project
resort areas would represent only 19 percent of total demand for tourism
services in the Dominican Republic by 1985. Arrivals at the project areas
would represent only 2 percent of total Caribbean arrivals by 1985 assuming
an annual growth rate of 6 percent for the Caribbean market.
Project Execution and Operation
48.       The Central Bank's DIFRATUR Department would be responsible for
executing the infrastructure project, coordinating the operations of the enti-
ties which would be responsible for providing services, and for concluding
arrangements with investors in tourist facilities. The Central Bank has
acquired the right to use the land for the project sites and would, prior to
the effectiveness of the proposed loan, (1) establish an adequately staffed
project unit within INFRATUR with separate, audited, financial accounts;
(2) engage consultants to provide assistance during the implementation phase;
and (3) ensure the participation of various entities in the operation of facili-
ties to be constructed as part of the project.
49.       The Comision Administrativa Aeroportuaria (CAA), a government agency
which is responsible for operating the Las Americas (Santo Domingo) airport
will own and operate the Puerto Plata airport. To encourage international
flights to Puerto Plata airport, and facilitate tourist travel to the North
Coast, the Government would adopt a policy of only requiring short notice for



- 12 -
the arrival of charter flights at Puerto Plata airport, and would seek to
include in its international air transit agreements, provisions permitting
scheduled flights to use Puerto Plata airport as well as the Las Americas
aii7port (Section 3.06 of the draft Guarantee Agreement).
50.       INAAPA, the Government-owned water company, would own and operate
the water and sewerage systems in the resort sites.  Electzi c installations
would be owned and operated byr the government-owned Corporacion Dominicana
de Electricidad (CDE) and telephone installations would be owned and serviced
by the Compania Dominicana de Telefonos (CDT), a private, nationvide, tele-
phone company,
51.       The Government would, through the Ministry of Health, provide the
necessary environmental sanitation in the project area (Section 3-07 of the draft
Guarantee Agreement),  The Central Bank would enter into service contracts
for solid waste disposal and fire-fighting as well as for maintenance of
roads and storm water drainage in the resort sites (Section 3o09 of the draft
Loan Agreement),  It, would also enter into agreeaents for the operationi of a
hotel training school (Section 3.08 of the draft Loan Agreement), and would make
arrangements to obtain financing for about 200 low-cost houses to be used by
the employees of the tourist fracilities (Section 3.15 of the draft Loan Agreement),
Pizancing Plan
$2,       The project is estimated to cost US$36.0 million including contingen-
cies.  The proposed loan of US$21.0 nillion would cover the foreign exchanige
component of the project Tnne balance of the required financing would be pro-
vided by the Central Bank. Since no grant funds were available to continue pre-
paratior of the pro 4ect after conp.Letion of the feasibility report, and since
the Central Bank financed a considerable share of project preparation costs,
it is recommended tlhat the ±oreign exchange costs of professional services
ra'ained after October 1  1972 (for planning, airport design, soil  tests, topo-
graphic surveys and other ser  ces) amounting to no more than US$775so00  (about
2.2 percent of project costs) be financed retroactively from the proposed loan;
Procurement and Dislbursement
53,       Civil works and eomuIpment contracts would be let on the basis of
international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank guidelines. Horever,
a contract for dymaimc soil consolidation, which appears to be the most appro-
-rDate method of site preparation in Playa Dorada, may be negotiated directly
with the specialized contractor finn or one of its licensees (this contract
would be for less than $,0 million),  Lmported equipment, materials and
supplies would be exempted from import duties.  In evaluating bids for goods,
Dominican mamxzfacturers would be allowed a preferential margin of 15 percent
of the CIF cost of competing imports, or the prevailing imputed level of
customs duties, whichever is lower.



- 13 -
54W.    Disbursements would cover the foreign cost of professional services,
100 percent of the CIF value of imported equipment, 100 percent of the ex-
factory cost of domestically manufactured equipment, 100 percent of the foreign
exchange costs and 30 percent of local costs of civil works contracts, The
latter percentage corresponds to the estimated foreign exchange comporent of
civil works in the Dominican Republic.
Economic Justification
55.     The project is designed to increase the country's foreign exchange
earnings and to create additional empboyment opportunities in tdhe econo ically
depressed Puerto Plata region.  Its overall economic rate of return, on the
basis of a 30-year economic life, is estimated at 15.2 percent.  If un-
skilled labor wages are shadow-priced at 75 percent of prevailing wages to re-
flect the high rates of underemployment in the region,, the project's estimated
economic rate of return increases to 16.7 percent. The rate of return on the
estimated national investment outlays (excl-uding foreign private investment and
the net repayments and other returns accruing to foreigners) would be L692
percent without shadow pricing,
56.    Because a relatively high proportion of the day-to-day needs of visitors
can be supplied from domestic sources (the import comiponert cf operat:`r:  cocts:,
is estimated at about 15 percent) the project's foreign exchange , G£  nfLnig
potential is high.  It is estimated tha  net foreigr exchange gener-"J-on -ill
amount to IM$12 million in 1977., when the first hotels are opernerJ  and that
net earnings would rise to UE$19.0 million per annum when the prnlect 'S i
full operation.
57.     The projectts impact on the North Coast will be felt through -h3igher
employment direct,ly related to tourism activities and through              3,s e rza-n,fiq
for agricultural and other products and services in the regicnra  W,;en fully
operational in 1986, the project is expected to prov^ide direct enplo-yment4 "o
about 3,900 people in hotels and other facilities i-n the res,ovr           Ind?irceL
employment generated in agricujlture, handicrafts,, transportati,-i- ,nC other
ser-vices as well as in construction, can be estimated to amountal, to on-o''er
4h,000 new jobs .
Financial Rate of Ret-urn and Fiscal Benefits
58.     The Central Bank would recover all project costs, except the costs of invest-
ments in the airport and for water and sewerage services, through charges foxr
leasing and selling land and facilities in the resort areass and maintenance
fees.  The Central Bank would re-view its policies on leasing and selling ter  winth
the Bank (Section 3.12 of the draft Loan Agreement ) and would seek to achieve an
overall financial return of 9 percent on projecu investments.  PUerto Plata
airport investment costs would be repaid to the Central Bank by CAA. Becat.se this
airport's revenues are not likely to cover operating expenses and debt service
during the first two years of operationss, the Government would agree to cover
the cash deficit to the extent that CAA could not do so from its other opera-
tions. The Government would also adopt measures to ensure that the Puerto Plata



- 14 -
airportts revenues are thereafter sufficient to meet cash operating expenses
and debt service, and that full costs are recovered from revenues by 1984
(Section 3 04 of the draft Guarantee Agreement). The cost of investments in
water and sewerage services would be repaid to the Central Bank by INAPA which,
under terms of its agreement with INFRATUR, would charge rates aimed at reali-
zing a return of 9 percent on investment.
59.     In 1977, when the first tourists are expected, the project would involve
a net current budgetary cost of RD$0.5 million. There would be small net budge-
tary receipts in 1979 rising to RD$1.2 million in 1986 and to RD$3.5 million in 1993.
Social Iivact
60.     The project 's social impact on the relatively isolated North Coast
region is expected 1o be largely favorable. Dominicans are welcoming and
courteous and their contacts with tourists should lead to mutual cultural en-
richmert. OpportuniLties for invidious comparisons would be minimized by the
location of the two resort areas. Higher-income tourists would be attracted
to Playa Grande, wh-ich is relatively isolated from population centers, while
Playa Dorada, which is near Puerto Plata, would cater to middle-income tourists.
61.     The development of tourism activities in the region will result in higher
standards of living for those directly and indirectly engaged in them. This new
focus of prosperity in a country with high rates of underemployment could, how-
ever, result in migration to the North Coast in numbers greater than tourism
activities could employ.  In order that timely measures may be taken by the
Government to minimize possible undesirable side effects of tourism, a study of
tourism's social andi economic impact would be funded under the project.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
62.     The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Banco Central de la
Republica Dominicana, the draft Guarantee Agreement between the Dominican Repub-
lic and the Bank, the report of the Committee provided for in Article III,
Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement, and the text of a draft Resolution
approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately. Features of the draft loan documents of special interest are
referred to in paragraphs 34, 36, 43, 46. 48, 49, 51 and 58 of this Report.
63.     I am satisfLed that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECCMNMEDATION
64.     I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C. PROJECTS IN 3ECTION
Cr. No. 23Education Project;   s$.0 Million Credit of
February l18, 1971; Closing Date: December 31, 1975.
Proj ect implementation is proceeding satisfactorily. All project
sceools are under construction and should be completed before the Closing Date.
It :Ls expected that some schools will be operating by October 1974. Procurement
of equipment and farniture is expected to be on time for the opening of schools.
Previous problems in recruitment of technical assistance specialists for the
education planning group have been resolved and the specialists are now in the
country. Also, the expert in teacher training is already assisting the Govern-
ment in the training of technical teachers needed for the project schools. The
project is expected to be completed before the Closing Date.
Cr. No. 24t5      Livestock Development Project; US$5.0-Million Credit of
Na_ 19, 1971; Closing Date: June 30, 1976
After an initial delay of about six months in finding a suitably
qualified expert to serve as Assistant for Livestock to the Central Bank, the
executing agency, the project has been progressing satisfactorily.  In view of
the large volume of comnitments already made by the Central Bank, it is expected
that disbursements will be completed on schedule.
Cr. No. 352       Yaque del Norte Irrigation; US$13 million on Credit of
January 17, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1979
The project is 9 to 12 months behind schedule due to delays in
contracting engineering and agricultural consultants. However, consultants
have now been retained and they believe that construction can be completed by
the end of 1978, the original target date. A Loan Agreement was signed in
August 1974 with the IDB providing for $18.0 million of parallel financing for
this project. Inflation (primarily imported) has increased construction costs,
and it is now estimated that total project costs will be US$16 million (h2
percent) more than estimated in 1972. The Government has been advised of this
expected cost increase.s
/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any problems
which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy them.
They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that they do
not parport to present a balance evaluation of strengths and weaknesses in
project execution.
