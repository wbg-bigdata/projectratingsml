under such terms and conditions as the Bank shall specify.
4.    No withdrawal shall be made and no commitment shall be entered
into to pay amounts to or on the order of the Borrower in respect of
expenditures to be financed out of the proceeds of the Loan after
the aggregate of the proceeds of the Loan withdrawn from the Loan
Account and the total amount of such commitments shall have reached
the equivalent of $190,000,000, unless the Bank shall be satisfied,
after an exchange of views as described in Section 3.02 (a) of this
Agreement and Section 3.01 (a) of the Guarantee Agreement based on
evidence satisfactory to the Bank:
      (a)   with the progress achieved by the Guarantor in the
carrying out of the Program;
      (b)   that the Guarantor's macroeconomic framework is
consistent with the Program; and
      (c)   that the actions described in the Schedule to the
Guarantee Agreement have been taken (all calculations "in real
terms" referred to in clauses 1, 2 and 3 of such Schedule to be made
in accordance with methodology and assumptions satisfactory to the
Bank); and that the Bank shall be satisfied with (i) the regulations
referred to in clauses 4 and 8, (ii)  the plan of action referred to
in clause 5 (a), (iii) the progress made in implementing the TELMEX
Privatization Plan referred to in clause 6 in accordance with the
time-table included under such Plan, (iv) the program referred to in
clause 7, and (v) the program of action referred to in clause 9 of
such Schedule; provided, however, that in no case shall any withdrawal
be made and any commitment be entered into in excess of such aggregate
amount of the equivalent of $190,000,000 prior to November 15, 1990.
5.    If, after the exchange of views described in paragraph 4
above, the Bank shall have given notice to the Borrower and the
Guarantor that the progress achieved and actions taken are not
satisfactory and, within ninety days after such notice, the
Guarantor shall not have achieved progress and taken actions
satisfactory to the Bank, then the Bank may, by notice to the
Borrower and the Guarantor, cancel the unwithdrawn amount of the
Loan or any part thereof.
6.    Withdrawal applications for disbursements under paragraph (1)
above shall, to the extent practicable, be consolidated in aggregate
amounts of not less than $20,000,000 equivalent.

                            Procurement
1.    Contracts for the procurement of goods estimated to cost the
equivalent of $5,000,000 or more each shall be awarded through
international competitive bidding in accordance with procedures
consistent with those set forth in Sections I and II of the
"Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits"
published by the Bank in May 1985 (the Guidelines), subject to the
following modifications:
      (a)   Paragraph 2.8 of the Guidelines is deleted and the
following is substituted therefor:
      "2.8 Notification and Advertising
            The international community should be notified in a
      timely manner of the opportunity to bid. This will be done by
      advertising invitations to apply for inclusion in a bidder's
      invitation list, to apply for prequalification, or to bid;
      such advertisements should be placed in at least one newspaper
      of general circulation in the Borrower's country and, in
      addition, in at least one of the following forms:
            (i)   a notice in the United Nations publication,
                  Development Business; or
            (ii)  an advertisement in a newspaper, periodical or
                  technical journal of wide international
                  circulation; or
Page  10
           (iii)  a notice to local representatives of countries
                  and territories referred to in the Guidelines,
                  that are potential suppliers of the goods
                  required."
      (b)   The following is added at the end of paragraph 2.21 of
the Guidelines:
            "As a further alternative, bidding documents may require
      the bidder to state the bid price in a single currency widely
      used in international trade and specified in the bidding
      documents."
      (c)   Paragraphs 2.55 and 2.56 of the Guidelines are deleted.
2.    Contracts for the procurement of goods estimated to cost the
equivalent of less than $5,000,000 shall be awarded:
      (a)   by purchasers required to follow the Guarantor's public
procurement procedures for the importation of goods, on the basis of
such procedures, provided that such procedures shall have been found
acceptable by the Bank;
      (b)   by other purchasers, in accordance with established
commercial practice, provided that such contracts shall be awarded
on the basis of evaluation and comparison of quotations obtained
from suppliers from at least two countries, except that direct
contracting procedures acceptable to the Bank may be used where
considered appropriate under paragraph 3.5 of the Guidelines; and
      (c)   notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (b)
above, in the case of the purchasers referred to therein, if the
estimated cost of the contract is equivalent to less than
$1,000,000, in accordance with established commercial practices
under procedures satisfactory to the Bank.
3.    With respect to each contract referred to in paragraph 1 of
this Schedule, the Borrower shall furnish to the Bank, prior to the
submission to the Bank of the first application for withdrawal of
funds from the Loan Account in respect of such contract, two
conformed copies of such contract, together with the analysis of the
respective bids and recommendations for award, a description of the
advertising and tendering procedures followed and such other
information as the Bank shall reasonably request.
4.    With respect to each contract referred to in paragraph 2 of
this Schedule, the Borrower shall furnish to the Bank, prior to the
submission to the Bank of the first application for withdrawal of
funds from the Loan Account in respect thereof, such documentation
and information as the Bank may reasonably request to support
withdrawal applications in respect of such contract.
5.    The provisions of the preceding paragraph 4 of this Schedule
shall not apply to contracts on account of which the Bank has
authorized withdrawals from the Loan Account on the basis of
statements of expenditure.
