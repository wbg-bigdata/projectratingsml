MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMEN$
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF COLOMBIA
FOR A MUNICIPAL DEVMLOP MET pgQy
1.   The following memorandum and recosuendatlon on a proposed loan to the
Republic of Colombia for US$60 million equivalent is submittod for approval. The
proposed loan would be on standard I8RD terms with 17 years maturity* includlng
5 years of grace, and would help finance a Municipal Development Project.
2.   Backorynd.   Since 1983, decentralisation has been a major focus of
national policy. Law 12 of 1986 transferred to local governments an increased
share of the proceeds of the national sales tax, along with full responsibility
for a broad range of urban services. Zn the abscnce of an adequate support
framework, however, many local governments have been unable to respond to their
new responsibilities for lack of institutional capacity. Many small towne as
well as low-income areas in larger cities still lack basic infrastructure.
Investment needs, though not readily quantifiable given the diversity of sub-
sectors involved, are clearly beyond the absorptivo capacity of sector entities.
The projected aggregate borrowing capacity of local governments in the next five
years is higher than Us$1.2 billion equivalent, but less than half this amount
is expected to materialixe into implementable investments. Conacious of the
limited achievements of its decentralization policy so far, the Goverm ent ha
prepared a Municipal Development Program (NDP) which includess (a) a now policy
for financing municipal investments with stronger conditions on cost recovery and
on the institutional performance of beneficiary entities; (b) the creation of a
training network for sector personnel; and (c) a program to boost the capacity
of the cadauter office ln the National Geographic Institute (lOAC) and to update
property cadast !s nationwide to enhanco own-source municipal revenues.
3.   AD4X A      *s=.  Until 1990, the leading source of finance for municipal
investment was the Urban Development Fund ("DU). a rediscounting facility of the
Central Mortgage Bank (BCO). 0BCH/MJW successfully executed several lines of
external credit for urban infrastructure, and is executing a Bank-flnanced Water
Supply and Sewerage Sector Project (Loan 2961-00). Under Law 57/89 FFmU was
expanded into a self-standing agency, the Finaciera de Desarrollo Territorial
(FINDETER), now operational. The Government hae requested the Bank's agressent
for the assumption by FINDETER of SCH/FIDU's obllgations under Loan 2961-C0. and
a recomemndation to the Bank's Executive Directors is being prepared to that
effect. FINDETER has a subscribed capital of U8$52 mallion equivalent of which
US$22.1 million has been paid ln. It is supervised by the Superintendency of
Banks, and authorised to issue bonds and to contract dibt within a legal debt to
equity ratio cilling of 10t 1. Its lending terms are in line with sound policies
recently adopted by the Government for the financial ector. FINDETER is led by
a team of competent and dedLeated professionals and it. orgalisation and systems.
largely transferred from FFVU, provide for satisfactory controls of portfolio
performance and subproject quality.
4     USaial. frg RAnk Involvement.  The Project would contribute to major
objectives of the Bank's country strategy, lacludlng rationalizing public
investments, improving the fiscal balance of sub-national govern mnt, and
assisting the country in lts efforts to alleviate poverty. The joint involvement
of the Bank and IDB during project execution would help maintain strict standards
of sub-project quality and a strong emphasis on building up institutions. Since
1968, the Bank ha lent a total of Us$70 million for 3 urban development projects

in Colombia. The projects Not their social objectives, but failed to establish
effective institutions. Dank investments in urban water supply proj*cts since
1968 amount to US$675 million, including the Water Supply and Swerage Sector
Project (Loan 2961-CO)  The lessons from Bank and toD exprience in the sector
have been taken into account in design of the proposd project, which places a
greater emphasis than in the past on the overall performance of roject egencies
and relies more on up-front conditionality to ensure effective progres on
institutional matters and cost recovery.
S,   Project obiectIves.    The  Project  would  assist the  Governont  ln
implementing the MDP. specific objectives ar to: (a) improve the coverage and
quality of municipal servlces and urban infrastructuret (b) promote more
effective investment projectsl (c) improve the sklll of sector personnel and the
administrative performance of local government institutions  and (d) reduce
fiscal imbalances at the local level by encouragLng fiscal disciplin and cost
recovery and by updating the base of the property tax.
6-    Proiect DegrintLm o  an Ccots. The total cost of the Project iL estimated
at US$188 million equivalent.   The Project would sunport the folloving
components: (A) (84% of project costs) a ine of credLt undr which PInDUT3R
would rediscount subloans originated by financial intermdr s to subnational
goverments and municipal enterprises for about 300 subprojects to improve urban
Infrastructure including streets, bus terminals, solid waste managemsnt. slum
upgrading, market places, health posts, slaughterhouses, river wharves, local
telephone networks, and to strengthen beneficlary Lnstitutionsl (3) (2% of costs)
actions to develop the operating capacity of FIUDITUR and provide outreach to
develop its subproject pipeline in the regionsp (C) (S% of costs) institutional
support including sector studies, institutional ass_ments of about 700
municipalities, and training of about 6,400 sector peoonnl in area including
planning and budgeting, revenue administration, accounting, and the operation of
local services; and (D) (9g of costs) a program to srnthe  1c and help it
carry out the registration or asesment update of about 4.3 million parcels
nationwide.
7. *  IIuoZM  would execut  Components a and 3.  Component a funds would be
disbursed against expenditures incurred in subprojects meetiag agred crlteria
of technical and economic feasibility, nvironmental soundness, and cost
recovery. Prior to any commitment of subloan fund  for physical investments.
beneficiary entitios would be required to take all legal and pricing actions
needed to achieve specific standards of fiscal and financial prformaon.
Detailed eligibility criteria are set forth in a Credit Regulations statement
agreed to at negotiation.
8.   The National Planing Department (DNP) would execute Component C, with the
technical participation of (a) training agencies, including the National
Administration School (usAP) and the National Apprenticeship Service (5311) to
lead course preparation and delivery; and (b) regional agencies including the
RegLonal Planning Councils (CORPUS) and the Departmental Planning Offices (CoP,s)
to coordinate training and technical assistanc psorom in each region.
Procurement and book-keeping for Cocponent C would be handled by the United
Nations Development Programme (UNDP) under an administration contract acceptable
to the Bank. 10AC would exCUte Component D. IDB would co-finance Component A
and would finance Component S.



-3-
9.   Under Component A. the Government would transfer funds from the IDUD aind
IDB loans to FINDTBR as equity, towards meeting its capital subsorlption
comuitments per Law 57/89. Counterpart funds would be provided by 1!NDIT3R frti
its own funds, financial Intermediaries, and sub-borrower    FINDITR will
rediscount subloans at a variable rates pegged to and at least 1.5 percentage
point above the market fixed-term deposit rato (MP). Financial int.rmedi aris
assume the credit risk, which is low as repayment is secured in cash by the
pledging of revenues. The spread the intermediaries charge to individual sub-
borrowers above FINDTER's rate will be determined competitively, up to an
interest rate ceiling set by the Monetary Board. The ceiling will not be lower
than DTF+5%. and will be rais"d above this level if needed to allow for an
adequate voluntary participation of intermedLres.
10. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
Amounts and methods of procurement and the disbursement schedule ar shown in
Schedule B. A time table of processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in Colombia are given in Schadules C and D. The Staff Appraisal
Report No. 9232-Co is attached. Retroactive financing totalling US$6 million for
eligible contracts procured after october 1, 1990 would be allowed.
11. Aoreed Action. Agreement was obtainad at negotiations thYt (a) 1hb
will (i) carry out by July 1992 a study of the overall onsstency and
targeting of its different program  supporting munli1pal invetmnt in the
sectors financed by the project, and adopt by October 1992 and implement a
satisfactory plan of action to establish improved caordination mecaniems as
needed; (iL) carry out Component C in accordance with th% agreed plua of action,
operating manual and annual implementation program C and (111) participate wLth
FINDITIR IGAC and the Bank in annual reviews of sector and project progress and
implement to the satisfaction of the Bank rsdial action agreed to during the
reviews  (b) PIIM   will (i) lend only for projects meeting the eligibilty
criteria set forth in the Credit Regulations  (11) adhee in all its lending
operations to agreed financial policies and on-lenoding terms  and (L11) earn
annual pre-tax returns on its equity that in real terms shIll be poiLtive in
1991, not lower than 3e ln 1992 and not lower than 5S thereafterp (c) aa will
(i) carry out Compoent D in compllance with agred output targets; and (iL)
develop and implement by June 1992 a systam to better monitor and control its
costs per activity.
12. special conditions of effectiveness Laclude (i) adoption by PIND3!DR of a
satisfactory Lending operational Manual specifying procedures and guidelines to
ensure compliance with the credit regulatLons  (Li) conclusion by DIP for the
execution of Component C of an adminstration contract with UMDP or another
qualified agent, and of operational agreements with USAP, 531A, and at least five
Departments or Regional Councils  and (iII) Prentation by PINDITR of model on-
lending agreeents acceptable to the  ank
13. EhnfYts. The project would help rveove infrastructure bottlenecks and
improve service coverage in a number of municipalities with an aggregate
population of over 5 million, and would benefit a larg number of mostly low-
incom people in beneficiary cities and towns and in their rural hinterland. A
post-evaluation of similar subprojects financed by MWDU under past lnes of,
rodit found that over 60% of benefits accrued to the Voverty group. The project
would bring lndirect benefits by improving investment selection standards.
promoting better matenance of capital assets, and inducing a higher self-

reliance by local government on local resource mobilization.   A positive
environmental impact would be achievod through the implemntation of sound solid
waste dispoeal in participating municipalities and the introduction of improved
methods for the environmental impact asseuments of municipal lnvestments.
14.  Bjkg. Improving local services and municipal management nationwide is an
ambitious undertaking and will require a sustained effort in the yea" ahead.
The project is complex and its execution involves a number of agencies, many of
which are weak. Risks include the possibllity of (i) insufficient capacities at
the local level resulting in low quality of subprojectsg (1i) political pressures
undermining the conditionality of WIUDIETR lendingi (iii) the high turnover of
municipal mayors and staff disrupting the continuity of investment planning and
institutional development at the local level; (lv) the cumberome legal proc sse
of procurement in Colombia resulting in slow project implementationg and (v) a
limited ability of sector institutions to discharge their responsibilities in the
implementation of the Government'"s Municipal Developeent Program.
15.  The project includes meaeures to address these risks. While the project
would help build up subproject preparation capabilitie, the scale of the
proposed line of credit does not entail a substantial lacrease from the past
disbursement pace of   DU, and is consitent with the existing subprojact
pipeline of FISDSTER reviewed by the Bank. The Bank has reviewed subprojects of
a total value in excess of U5$20 million, sufficient to meet first-year
disbursement targets. To ensure adherenc to the agreed eligibility criteria,
the Bank or IDS in turn would revliw larger subprojects (above US$& million for
streets and for multi-community subproject*. and above US$1 million for other
subprojects) before they are approved by IIUDZBTR, and all subproJcts prlor to
related disbursements. An annual review of project and sector issues would lead
to timely plans of action to remedy identifled shortcomings.  Project agencles
would be strengthened under the project and would commit themwsevs to achieve
monitorable targets.
16.   ecomendtion* X am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recemnmd that the Xxecutive Directors
approve the proposed toan.
