MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE DEVELOPMENT BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES,
FOR A MANILA POWER DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan for
US$65.5 million equivalent is submitted for approval. The proposed loan would
be extended to the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) for relending to
the Manila Electricity Company (MERALCO). The Bank loan would have a term of
20 years, including five years of grace, with interest at the standard
variable rate; the Republic of the Philippines would guarantee the loan. The
proceeds would help finance the extension and improvement of the electricity
distribution system serving Metro Manila and its environs.
Background.
2.       MERALCO, a privately-owned company, is responsible for distributing
power in the Metro Manila area. As a result of absorbing the franchises of
failing rural electric cooperatives along its fringes, its service area
expanded by 172% from 3,244 sq. km. in 1982 to 8,813 sq. km. in 1987, and its
number of customers rose by 48? from 1.1 million to 1.7 million during the
same period. Its energy sales, which rose to a peak of 9.2 TWh in 1983, have
fluctuated with the performance of the economy and currently represent about
7O0 of all commercial electricity sold in Luzon.
3.       Financially, MERALCO has been averaging a healthy 8S return on
revalued assets. However, this indicator has masked liquidity constraints
that have kept MERALCO's capital expenditures at less than 702 of the level
needed to sustain its service, especially during the economic recession of
1982-86. (During that period, system losses increased from 12? to 21?, and
accounts receivable increased from 65 days' sales to 105 days' sales. To
generate cash, MERALCO rolled over its short-term loans and long-term debt as
it matured, and delayed its payments for power purchases by more than three
months). The results realized in 1987 and estimated for 1988 indicate a major
turnaround in MERALCO's commercial and financial performance. In 1987,
accounts receivable turnover dropped to about 90 days and losses stabilized at
about 21Z. Estimates for 1988 suggest continuing improvement in both of these
critical indicators; losses have dropped to about 17? and accounts receivable
to about 78 days' sales. MERALCO has now rescheduled its arrears for power
purchases; is meeting its cutrent obligations for power purchases on time; and
is amortizing its long-term debt on time.
4.       To continue improving its technical, commercial and financial
performance, MERALCO needs to strengthen and augment its distribution system.
During 1989-93, MERALCO expects to implement an investment program of about
US$460 million. It plans to finance this extensive program with, inter alia,
(a) a loan of US$32 million from the International Finance Corporation (IFC)
to provide general support for its 1989-91 investment program; (b) a loan of
US$36 million equivalent from the Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW) to
support implementation of a project to upgrade about half of its substations;
(c) two loans, totaling US$56 million equivalent, from the Overseas Economic



- 2 -
Cooperation Fund (OECF) to support extensions of Its iistribution system to
depressed areas within Metro Manila and to unserved rural areas surrounding
Metro Manila that are within its franchise area; and (d) the proposed Bank
loan, which would support the expansion and upgrading of its subtransmission
networks and its remaining substations while improving its distribution lines
in underserved areas. While MERALCO is attempting to tap some private sources
of long-term finance, the current economiic environment necessitates that it
rely heavily on official Government borrowings to meet its long-term financial
needs.
5.       Given the substantial financing requirements the power sector faces
in the foreseeable future, the us8 of Government budget allocations and
official foreign borrowings for financing investments will need to be
supplemented with domestic investment capital mobilized from other sources.
Following its successful restructuring and institutional strengthening during
the last two years, DBP has been designat.d as a wholesale financial
institution responsible for (a) tapping long-term domestic funds currently
available in the Philippines (e.g., funds available for investment from the
Social Security System, insurance companies, pension funds. etc.) for
channeling into capital-intensive sectors through retail financial
institutions; (b) acting as a conduit for official foreign borrowings to be
used for financing private sector enterprises. In keeping with its function
as a wholesale bank, DBP will onlend the proceeds of the Bank loan to MERALCO.
6.       As a result of its restructuring, DBP is tow financially solvent and
is implementing market-based policies. Precluded from relying on interest
free deposits and other goverrnment resources, it is now self-sustaining. In
1988, DBP generated net pretax income of P 898 million, compared to P 800
million in 1987. Earnings indicators look impressive; return on assets is
14.0X; and return on net worth, 32.32. However, if the sale of DBP's holdings
in Philippine Commercial and Industrial Bank (PCIB), one of its subsidiaries,
is excluded from the calculations, DBP's return on assets drops to 7.22 and
return on net worth to 20.12.
7.       As the proposed transaction would lead to DBP exceeding its single
borrower limit, the Bank explored various alternatives for channelling the
Bank funds to MERALCO. The only feasible option which met the requirements of
all parties concerned was for DBP to act as the Borrower, with the Government
guaranteeing the loan.  Given that the investments to be financed by the loan
are needed urgently and that MERALCO is one of the nation's better credit
risks, DBP sought, on an exceptional basis, a waiver of its single borrower
limit for purposes of this project. The Monetary Board has approved the
waiver.
8.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Government is facing major
investments in the power sector over the next several years. These
investments are intended to provide generation and transmission facilities
needed to meet existing demand as well as rapidly increasing new demand
resulting from recent and projected economic growth. However, the benefits of
new investment in generation and transmission cannot be optimized unless
balanced by appropriate investments in distribution. The Government has
developed a strategy for least-cost power development and for strengthening
the policy and institutional framework in the sector. It has requested Bank
assistance in implementing that strategy by supporting a series of projects.



9.       Through the Bacon Manito Geothermal Power Project (Loan 2969-1-PH;
June 23, 1988), the proposed project, and an Energy Sector Loan that is
currently under preparation, the Bank has developed close working
relationships with the principal sector entities and is thus in a position to
assist the Government in achieving much-needed sector coordination.  While the
other operations address issues related to generation and transmission, this
project addresses issues facing the entity responsible for distributing about
half of the country's commercially available electricity. In particular, the
project will support overdue system extensions and improvements and will
ensure that MERALCO maintains investments at appropti, e levels in the future.
Also, the p oject would support specific measures for -crengthening MERALCO's
operational and commercial capabilities.
10.      The proposed loan would also support DBP in its new wholesale banking
role. The Bank's participation in the project will help develop DBP's
capacity to appraise and supervise large loans to the power sector.
11.      Project Objectives.  The proposed project is designed to improve
MERALCO's subtransmission and distribution systems, facilitate better
communication between substations, and revitalize the organization's
maintenance capabilities. In so doing, it will enable MERALCO to meet
increasing load demands in the coming years, reduce losses and enst're more
effective distribution of electricity within its franchise area.  lhe proposed
project will also support improvement of MERALCO's technical and commercial
operations.
12.      Project Description.  The main components of the project are:
(a) Construction and upgrading of subtransmission lines, and addition
of substation capacity;
(b) Construction and upgrading of distribution systems;
(c) Improvement and expansion of the radio-multiplex facilities for
system monitoring and control; and
(d) Provision of equipment and vehicles to improve maintenance.
The total cost of the project is estimated at US$130 million, with a
foreign exchange component of US$65.5 million (50Z), A breakdown of costs
and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in
Schedule B. The project includes a provision of US$1 million to finance
retroactively expenses incurred after March 1, 1989. A timetable of key
project processing events and status of Bank Group operations in the
Philippines are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is
attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No.7754-PH dated May 4, 1989, is
being distributed separately.
13.      Agreed Actions.  At negotiations, agreement was reached regarding
the following: (a) the conduct by DBP, MERALCO, and the Bank, of an annual
joint review of MERALCO's (i) investment program for the next five years;
and (ii) investment accomplishments for the previous two years;
(b) MERALCO's commitment to adopt the mutually acceptable recommendations
from those annual reviews; (c) continued implementation by MERALCO of an



- 4 -
acceptable action program to reduce system losses and maintain accounts
receivable and accounts payable at current acceptable levels; (d) annual
realization by MERALCO of rates of return on revalued assets of 82 per
year; (e) annual realization by MERALCO of debt service coverage ratios of
?.0 during the period 1989-91, and 1.3 thereafter; (f) DBP's furnishing to
the Bank, by June 30 of each year, its annual financial statements
certifi-i by ar auditor acceptable to the Bank; and (g) MERALCO's
furnishing to the Bank, by June 30 of each year, its annual financial
statements certified by an auditor acceptable to the Bank. The execution
of a Subsidiary Loan Agreement between DBP and MERALCO il a Condition of
Effectiveness of the proposed loan.
14.      Benefits and Risks.  The benefits of the project, as an integral
component of the optimized MERALCO investment program, are primarily
(a) the enhancement of the reliability of supply to existing consumers;
(b) the decrease of system losses to achieve greater efficiency in
transmission and distribution; and (c) the provision of additional
distribution capacity to satisfy strongly growing demand.
15.      The project faces no substantial physical risk in implementation.
Acquisition of land and rights-of-way for substations and transmission
lines is not expected to cause any serious problems, as most of the
transmission lines are either second circuits of existing systems or new
lines along existing rights of way. However, as a result of its liquidity
constraints, MERALCO could have difficultv realizing counterpart funds and
thereby keeping to the project implementation schedule. The financial
strengthening of MERALCO, as asiumed in the financial covenants, is a major
step toward minimizing these risks.
16.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

to be drawn down in each year of construction. Interest during
construction on other loans is calculated similarly, using the aggregate
interest rate to MERALCO of 11.32, and adCing applicable costs including
the commitment fee for the undrawn portion of the Bank loan before,
subtracting the amount payable to the Bank.
