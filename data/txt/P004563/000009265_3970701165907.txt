IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
PHILIPPINES
MANILA POWER DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
Preface
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Manila Power Distribution
Project in the Republic of the Philippines, for which Loan 3084-PH in the amount of US$65.5 million
equivalent was approved on June 8, 1989 and made effective on November 17, 1989.
Loan 3084-PH closed on June 30, 1996 compared with the original closing date of June 30,
1995. Final disbursement is expected to take place by December 30, 1996, at which time a balance of
US$ 5.673,769.92 will be canceled.
The ICR was prepared by Ephrem Asebe, Consultant, EA1IN, under the supervision of John
Irving, Senior Power Engineer, Infrastructure Operations Division of the East Asia & Pacific Region,
Country Department I. It was reviewed by Mr. J. Shivakumar, Chief, Infrastructure Operations
Division, and Mr. Walter Schwermer, Project Adviser. The borrower provided its comments that are
included as appendices to the ICR.
Preparation of this ICR began during the Bank's supervision mnission in February 1996 followed
by an ICR mission in October, 1996. It is based on material in the project file. The Borrower
contributed to the preparation of the ICR by preparing its own evaluation of the project's execution
and commenting on the draft ICR.

MANILA POWER DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
(Loan No. 3084-PH)
PHILIPPINES
Evaluation Summary
Background & Project Objectives:
i.     Manila Electric Company (MERALCO) is the major private distribution firm which serves Metro
Manila and the surrounding area. Much of the present project was initially appraised in August 1987 as a
component of the Bacon-Manito Geothermal Power Project. However, the loan negotiations were
delayed until an arrangement for channeling the proceeds of the Bank loan to MERALCO was worked
out. With the successful restructuring of the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP), the project was
re-appraised and a financing mechanism agreed whereby DBP would borrow from the Bank and relend the
funds to MERALCO to finance a component of its five year program (1989-93).
ii.    The objectives of the project were to improve MERALCO's subtransmission and distribution
systems, facilitate better communications between substations, and revitalize the organization's
maintenance. In so doing, the project was expected to enable the company to meet increasing load
demands in the coming years, reduce losses and ensure more effective distribution of electricity within its
franchise area and support improvement of MERALCO's technical and commercial operations.
iii.   The main components of the project were: a) construction and upgrading of the subtransmnission
lines, and addition of substation capacity; b) construction and upgrading of distribution systems; c)
improvement and expansion of the radio-multiplex facilities for system monitoring and control; d)
provision of equipment and vehicles to improve maintenance; and e) action programs designed to reduce
system losses, enhance system reliability and improve management of accounts receivable and payable.
iv.    The project objectives as defined in the SAR were clear. They were important for the overall
achievement of the Government's energy sector strategy plan. The design of the project was appropriate
with clearly set targets to be achieved. The main anticipated challenges: a) occasional liquidity constraints
which are normal to public utility companies; b) procurement delays; and c) delays in acquisition of right of
ways were not foreseen to be beyond the capability of the organization. However, the real challenge came
from another source, delays in decisions being taken by MERALCO on the appropriate primary
distribution system voltage level.
Implementation Experience and Results.
v.    The project appears to have made a greater contribution to the overall fulfillment of the energy
sector strategy objectives than to the specific project targets of the Manila Power Distribution Project.
With respect to the former, the project was successful in advancing the overarching objectives of the
energy sector i.e., implementing a least-cost energy sector strategy; achieving a break-through in private
sector participation in the Philippines' energy sector; mobilizing adequate financial resources; implementing



iii
regionalization, decentralization and separation of generation, transrmission, distribution activities into
separate companies or profit centers.
vi.    More specifically, the project's most significant achievement is the demonstration of a key tenet of
the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy: providing assistance to enable the private sector increase its
involvement in the development of a key infrastructure sector without further resort to official assistance.
In the case of MERALCO, which was precluded from borrowing from the market since 1986, the mere
fact that the Bank was willing to participate in such an arrangement in 1987 opened the door for more
development funding from KfW, OECF between 1988 and 1990, as well as funding from [FC in 1988.
MERALCO resumed borrowing from the market in 1990, and since then it has made a highly successful
public offering of its common stock with 65 percent being traded internationally and 35 percent
domestically. Its stock price has doubled compared to initial offerings and has remained at about that level.
Today, MERALCO no longer needs official development finance. It now meets its financial needs from
the international commercial markets.
vii.   With respect to the specific objectives of the Bank financed component of the five-year
development program, an initial significant system loss reduction, from 22 percent to 14.8 percent, was
achieved during the preparation phase of the project. By the end of 1995, subsequent improvement in loss
reduction reached 13.0 percent. The technical loss portion alone has declined from 11 percent in 1986 to
8.6 percent in 1995. Further loss reduction is expected when the additional investments in the distribution
system are in full service. Reliability of the system was also much improved. The system interruption
frequency rate which rose from 48.8 in 1985 to 278.8 in 1993, during the period of energy brownout, has
declined back to 48.8 in 1995. Better coordination and control between substations were realized. The
organization's maintenance was revitalized. Some improvement in the management of accounts receivable
and payable have been achieved. Overall, the re-estimated ERR for the 1998- 1993 program was 59
percent compared to the 32 percent estimated at appraisal.
viii.   However, project completion was delayed relative to the original schedule. The most significant
delay resulted from management's desire to have a second opinion on the appropriate long-term
distribution system voltage level, causing the completion dates of various subprojects to slide from the
original schedule. As the Bank assumed that the decision on system design standard had been made by
MERALCO, the implementation schedule in the appraisal report did not reflect the time needed to reach a
consensus on that standard. Also, the 1991-93 brownouts in NPC power generation were a major
distraction for MERALCO's management. Other contributing factors to the delays include MERALCO's
lack of experience with the Bank's procurement guidelines and the major expansion and reorganization of
the company since 1988; and further, the company has also reported that it encountered problems in
securing available land for substations and right of ways during implementation.
ix.    The Bank's role in project identification was highly satisfactory. It was carried out on the basis of
the Energy Sector Study (Report 7269-PH), over an extended period in the context of the Philippine
economic recovery. The Bank's assistance to the borrower in the preparation phase was satisfactory.
How-ever, while Bank support for preparation with respect to financial and procurement matters was
strong, initial support for the engineering aspect of the work was weak. The Bank only learned in early
1992 that a firm decision on the distribution system design standard had not been made; this was well into



iv
the implementation phase of the project. This issue had been left hanging mainly because of lack of
continuity of supervising engineers. Thus, although the Bank team did not foresee the consequence of the
delay in the system design decision, in other respects, both appraisal and supervision were satisfactory.
x.    The Borrower's preparation and implementation of the project can also be considered to have been
satisfactory. As noted above (para. viii), delayed choices in primary distribution system affected all
subsequent phases of the implementation work: preparation of detail design, specifications and evaluations
of bids, etc. Early in the project preparation phase, administrative, legal and technical measures were
taken to reduce the system losses from 22 percent to 14.8 percent within eighteen months. System
reliability also significantly improved over the course of the project implementation. MERALCO has
proved that it has mastered the bid evaluation process in the course of implementation as evidenced from
the Bank's note of appreciation for the high quality of its bid evaluation.
ix.    The benefits of the project are likely to be sustained. In fact, the fill benefits will be realized when
the ongoing subtransmission and substation are put into service by 1998. The official develop-ment finance
MERALCO secured has opened up opportunities for the company to access loans from domestic and
international sources, which further enhance the sustainability of the project benefits.
xii.   Overall, the project outcome is satisfactory. The recalculated ERR of 59 percent for
NIERALCO's 1989-93 program is high despite some lag in putting into service some of the Bank-financed
subprojects at the closing of the loan. Implementation is progressing, and the project will achieve well-
integrated transmission and distribution systems which are likely to result in further reductions in system
losses, higher system reliability of supply to existing customers, provision of additional distribution capacity
to satisfy demand, and overall operational efficiency.
Summary of Findings, Future Operations, and Lessons Learned
xiii.   The most important finding of the implementation experience is that the Bank should develop a
keen sense of understanding of the concerns of the private sector to be able to help its development. Much
of the delays could have been foreseen and a realistic implementation plan prepared if the Bank had
detected the delays in the company's decisions on the design standards either during preparation or at
appraisal.
xiv.   MERALCO's main indicators of the success of its future operations remain the same as its current
ones: minimization of system losses, achieving high level of system reliability, and more efficient
management of its accounts receivable and payable.
xv.        In designing future Bank projects with on-lending to private borrowers, the Bank may need
to study the behavior of the private sector's decision making process towards official development finance.
A proper understanding of the private sector may be vital, to find out the level of private sector
commitment and how it is expressed. For example, in MERALCO's case, the time lost in seeking
Investment Coordinating Committee (ICC) and National Economic Development Authority (NEDA)
approval could have been read as a signal that MERALCO was not as prepared as it should have been to
implement the project as anticipated at appraisal.



v
xvi.   The critical issue facing the distribution utilities is to become sufficiently credit-worthy to
secure loans and equity capital on their own in the capital market. As in the case of MERALCO,
available official development finance can help them begin that process. The problem is one of devising
legally appropriate transitional financing mechanisms for channeling development finance. To the
extent that some of the remaining 145 distribution companies in the Philippines, representing some 40
percent of the distribution capacity, become credible borrowers through consolidation program, DBP
could serve as a channel for development finance to recast their operations and finances to be able to
meet their future development finance from the market.



MANILA POWER DISTRIBUTION PROJECT
(Loan No. 3084-PH)
PHILIPPINES
PART I: IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. STATEMENT/EVALUATION OF OBJECTIVES
1.    Background. The Philippines' electric power industry is now divided into three segments: a)
generation, b) transmission, and c) distribution. While National Power Corporation ( NPC) was
dominant in generation, it is likely to reduce its role in the future as Independent Power Producers'
(IPPs) take over new generation. NPC is expected to be responsible for transmission through a
number of grids that serve virtually the entire country except for remote rural areas and small outlying
islands. MERALCO is the major private distribution firm which serves Metro Manila and its
surroundings, and accounts for about 70% of NPC's sales in Luzon and about 59% of NPC's sales
Nation-wide. Today, MIERALCO is the biggest of 146 electricity distribution companies in the
Philippines and rates as the fourth largest industry in terms of gross revenue in the country.
2.    The Manila Power Distribution Project loan was the third in a series of Bank Group-financed
projects to MERALCO, the first two of which were made by the International Finance Corporation
(EFC). IFC's first loan to MERALCO was for US$12.0 million equivalent in 1967. The second was
for US$32 million equivalent in 1988 intended to finance a time slice of MERALCO's investment
program between 1989 and 1991. Much of what is Manila Power Distribution Project was initially
appraised in August 1987 as a component of the Bacon-Manito Geothermal Power Project (Loan
2969-0-PH and 2969-1-PH). However, the MERALCO's component of the Project was dropped
from the loan because, under the Foreign Borrowing Act of the Philippines, the government is
precluded from guaranteeing directly the indebtedness of private institutions. The loan was delayed
until an arrangement for channeling the proceeds of the Bank loan to MERALCO, acceptable to the
Government, MERALCO, and the Bank, was worked out.
3.    With the successful restructuring of Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) and
subsequent designation of DBP as the nation's wholesale bank, the parties agreed that DBP was in a
position to serve as a conduit for official foreign loans to private sector companies, with a waver of the
single borrower lirnit by the Monetary Board. Accordingly, the project was reappraised under the new
condition whereby, DBP would borrow from the World Bank and relent the funds to MERALCO to
finance its five year development program (1989-93) under terms that include a twenty year maturity
and a five year grace period, and a fixed spread not to exceed 3.65% over the Bank's interest rates.
4.    Project Objectives. As stated in the Bank Staff Appraisal Report, the objectives of Manila
Power Distribution Project were to: improve MERALCO's subtransmission and distribution systems,
facilitate better communications between substations, and revitalize the organization's maintenance
capabilities. In so doing, the project would enable the company to meet increasing load demands in the
coming years, reduce losses, and ensure more efficient distribution of electricity within its franchise



2
area. The proposed project would also support improvement of NERALCO's technical and
commercial operations.
5.    Project Components. The main components of the Project were: a) construction and
upgrading of the subtransmission lines, and addition of substation capacity; b) construction and
upgrading of distribution systems; c) improvement and expansion of the radio-multiplex facilities for
system monitoring and control; and d) provision of equipment and vehicles to improve maintenance.
In addition, the project incorporated action programs for reducing system losses and, improving system
reliability, accounts receivable and payable
6.    Evaluation of Objectives. The project objectives, as defined in the SAR, were clear.
Identified project components were clearly tied with each of the project objectives. The expected
benefits from achievement of the objectives had measurable qualitative and quantitative targets. For
example, system losses were targeted to be reduced to 9 percent by 1993 from 22 percent in 1987,
which was on the high side. The capacity to meet increasing load demand was also quantitatively
defined. System reliability was to improve through relieving line over-loading, reinforcing existing
lines, improving operational flexibility and providing alternative sources of power and capacity for
growth.
7.    The project objectives were also important for the overall achievement of the Government's
energy sector strategy, which the Bank supported through a number of generation and transmission
projects. At the time, the overarching concerns of the Bank were mobilizing sufficient resources
through private participation to remove the energy constraints on the growth of the Philippines'
economy. The Bank sought to revitalize economic growth, improve the efficiency of the public
corporations and accelerate privatization in the energy sector. MERALCO's investment in distribution
system was designed to supplement the government least-cost strategy in transmission, generation
projects, and sector coordination. The government was persuaded to guarantee the loan to support
substransmission and distribution system extensions and improvements to help ensure that MERALCO
maintained investment at the appropriate level. The channeling of the loan through DBP was also an
important objective of the Bank, as it would enhance DBP's role as a new wholesale bank for the
private sector.
8.    The project was well designed with clearly set targets to be achieved. First, the load forecast
for Luzon and for MERALCO were assessed. Second, estimated system loss reductions were
targeted. Third, the expected operational and commercial targets were forecasted. Accordingly, retail
power tariffs in the Manila area were indexed with NPC tariffs, and the exchange rate to provide
MERALCO a rate of return higher than 8% based on agreed levels of losses, expected to decline over
the subsequent five years. Finally, these targets were to be made part of the loan covenants and subject
to regular review of Bank supervision.
9.    The project was neither complex nor demanding for the implementing agency. There were few
special institutional changes foreseen which the beneficiary had to undertake as part of Bank
conditionality i.e. reduction of system losses, improving reliability and efficiency of management of
accounts receivable and payable. The main anticipated challenges: a) occasional liquidity constraints



normal to public utility companies, b) procurement delays, and c) delays in acquisition of right of
ways, were foreseen to be not beyond the capability of the organization. However, the real challenge
came from another source; delays in the decision being taken on the appropriate long-term primary
distribution system voltage level.
B. Achievement of Project Objectives
10.   Overall, the project appears to have yielded a greater contribution to the fulfillment of the
energy sector strategy objectives than to the specific project targets. With respect to the former, the
project was successful in advancing the overarching objectives of the energy sector. i.e., implementing
a least-cost energy sector strategy. This was achieved through: major investments in generation and
transmission (Bacon-Manito and the Energy Sector Loans, see table 2 Related Bank Loans) with
appropriate complementary investment; achieving a break through in the private sector participation in
the Philippines energy sector; mobilizing adequate financial resources for financing of the private sector
including developing DBP as a wholesale Bank; and moving towards decentralization and separation of
generation, transmission, distribution activities, into separate companies or profit centers.
11.   More specificaUly, the most significant achievement of the project is the demonstration of a key
tenet of the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy: providing assistance to enable the private sector
increase its involvement in the development of a key infrastructure sector without further resort to
official assistance. In the case of MERALCO, which was precluded from borrowing from the capital
market since 1986, the mere fact that the Bank was willing to participate in such an arrangement in
1987 opened the door for more development funding from KfW, OECF between 1988 to 1990, as well
as funding from IFC in 1988. MERALCO resumed borroving from the market in 1990, and since
then it has made a highly successful public offering of its common stock with 65 percent being traded
internationally and 35 percent domestically. Its stock price has doubled compared to initial offerings
and has remained at about that level. The financial restructuring of MERALCO resulted in raising of
new equity capital and retained earnings. Today, MERALCO no longer needs official development
finance. The Bank's inter-mediation has helped catalyze MERALCO's access into international
markets for financing its investments.
12.    With respect to the non-financial objectives of the project, an initial significant reduction, from
22 percent to 14.8 percent, was achieved during the preparation phase of the project. By year-end
1995, subsequent improvement in loss reduction reached 13.0 percent. The technical loss portion
alone has declined from 11 percent in 1986 to 8.6 percent in 1995. Further loss reduction is expected
when the additional investments in the distribution system are in full service. Reliability of the system
was also much improved. System interruption frequency rate which was 48.8 in 1985 rose to 278.8 in
1993 during the period of energy brownout but has declined back to 48.8 in 1995. Better coordination
and control between substations were realized with the implementation of the telecommunication
component of the project. The provision of equipment and vehicles helped revitalize the organization's
maintenance capabilities. Some improvement in the management of accounts receivable and payable
has been achieved.



4
13.   The re-estimated econornic rate of return for the project is 59 percent, significantly higher than
the SAR estimate of 32 percent not withstanding the delays in the implementation of some of the
subproject components.
C. Major Factors Affecting the Project
14.   There were several internal and external factors which contributed to the delays in
implementation. The most important factor affecting the timely realization of the project's objectives,
was the delay experienced in making the decisions on the appropriate long-term system voltage level of
the primary distribution system of MERALCO. Progress from design to the procurement phase was
rather slow as the company management tried to search for a design standard to optimize its
distribution system operation. MERALCO was initially enthusiastic to get a Bank loan to finance the
project. Preparation of designs of the project did not, however, progress after the Bank and the
govemment agreed to drop the project after failing to find an appropnrate mechanism to channel the
loan. The false start created skepticism that the project would come through. When a financing
mechanism was finally found with DBP serving as a conduit for channeling the Bank loan to
MERALCO, MERALCO was still skeptical that the project would get the loan. As a result,
MIERALCO did not follow through nor made the critical system choice decisions to get ICC and
NEDA clearance.
15.   On the other hand, the Bank being at the early stage of its dealings with the private sector,
appeared not to have understood correctly the significance of the delays MERALCO was experiencing
in getting clearance from ICC and NEDA. In retrospect, the lack of clearance by ICC and NEDA
should have served as a signal that MERALCO's management was not committed to the project's time
table. In fact, MNERALCO's management was awaiting the results of the Voltage System Study to get
a second opinion on the choice of primary distribution system, six months after the project had been
declared effective. MERALCO's management was also uncertain about the progress on the generation
and transmission expansion being executed by NPC.
16.   MERALCO's lack of experience with the Bank's procurement procedures also led to some
delays at different stages of the process (e.g. preparation of specifications, bid opening, contract
signature). The fact that since 1988, MERALCO has been undergoing major reorganization and
expansion, including operationalization of the three regions, introduction of total quality management
and re-engineering, had detracted management's attention from the project. The company has also
reported that it encountered problems in securing available land for substations and right of ways
during project implementation. The Govemment's reluctance to approve necessary tariff increases too
soon after the 1989 December Coup d'etat, also caused MERALCO to fail to comply the 8% rate of
return on its re-valued assets requiring Bank's agreement to waive the 8% rate of return covenant for
1990.



5
D. Project Sustainability
17.   The project is likely to sustain the benefits generated by its components. In fact, the full benefit
of the project will be realized when most of the ongoing subtransmission and substation works are
completed and put into service by 1998. The official development finance MIERALCO secured has
opened up opportunities for the company to get access to loans from domestic and international
sources. Despite the limit on the level of its borrowings because of country risks, MERALCO is left in
a better position to mobilize resources than it was before the loan. MERALCO has also substantially
improved its maintenance capabilities. For example, when Typhoon Katring hit its franchise area on
October 21, 1994, causing a total system blackout, MERALCO was able to restore service in 79% of
its 529 circuits within 24 hours and in 97% in six days.
E. Bank Performance
18.   Identification. Project identification was highly satisfactory being carried out over an
extended period in the context of the Philippine economic recovery. The Energy Sector Study (Report
No. 7269-PH) provided the framework for the identification of MERALCO's five year (1989-93)
investment program. Optimization of the company's five year program was conceived within the long-
term development framework of the Philippines energy sector. The integration of MERALCO's
primary distribution system with NPC's transmission was a significant step in the optimization of the
overall power system efficiency.
19.   Preparation. Bank assistance to the borrower in the preparation phase can be considered
satisfactory. During the preparation phase, the Bank focused on assisting the Government to establish
an acceptable financing mechanism for channeling official development finance to the private sector,
and at the same time finding a less complicated and inexpensive syndication scheme for MERALCO.
The Bank's financial analyst played a prominent role in finalizing the financial aspects of the loan.
Although the Bank's preference was a direct loan to MERALCO, the Govemrnment was not prepared
to guarantee direct loans to private companies. In the end, the Bank and the Govemment agreed to
channel the loan through DBP, and avoided the syndication scheme through a waver of single
borrower limit. Unfortunately, MERALCO did not continue making progress in the critical design
phase of the work, after the project was dropped from the Bacon-Manito Project, while the Bank
assumed that the design was progressing well. This misreading of the company's readiness for
implementation had unintended consequences on the Bank's design of loan conditionality,
implementation schedule, and resource allocation for supervision.
20.   Appraisal. The Bank's performance in the project appraisal phase can be considered
satisfactory. To be sure, the financial packaging and lending instruments were adequate and
appropriate. MERALCO's operational problems of system losses, system reliability and efficiency in
the management of accounts receivable and payable were diagnosed early when the project was first
appraised as part of the Bacon Manito project. Remedial measures required to reduce system losses
were undertaken before project appraisal. A significant reduction of system losses from 22 percent to
14.8 percent was attained between August 1987 and December 1987. Measures were being



6
undertaken to improve perfornance of system reliability, accounts receivable and payable. Bank staff,
being in the early phase of lending to the private sector, appeared to have overestimated MERALCO's
readiness with the design of the distribution system, its technical capacity to deal rapidly with the
changing conditions of demand growth, and its technical capacity to adopt the specification to
coordinate its subtransmission plans into the new generation and transmission capacities of NPC.
Moreover, because of this misperception by Bank staff during the appraisal phase of the project,
MERALCO's problem of implementation was wrongly identified to be a procurement problem, when,
all along, it was lack of progress in the design phase.
21.   Supervision. Overall, Bank supervision was satisfactory. The first supervision mission was
undertaken between November 19 and December 12, 1990. Earlier, in March 1990, the reporting
system to be used was agreed upon. Subsequent supervision visits were of limited scope and focused
on the procurement and financial aspect of implementation. Since at appraisal the Bank saw no
technical risks in the implementation of the project, both the transmission and distribution components
were considered to be within the technical and managerial capabilities of MERALCO. As a result,
while enough attention was paid to the supervision of the procurement and financial aspects of project
implementation, supervision of the engineering aspect was negligible. The Bank only learned in early
1992 that a firm decision on the distribution system design standard had not been made; this was well
into the implementation phase of the project. This issue had been left hanging mainly because of the
lack of continuity of supervising engineers. In retrospect, this was unfortunate. The Bank should have
carefully scrutinized the design and implementation of the technical aspects of the project, just as it
would supervise a public enterprise. A more careful follow up of the engineering phase would have
helped to uncover the reason behind the lack of progress in project implementation.
F. The Borrower Performance
22.   Preparation. The Borrower's preparation of the project can be considered satisfactory. As
noted above, the delay in selecting a primary distribution system affected all subsequent phases of the
implementation works including preparations of detail design specifications and evaluations of bids.
Because of the uncertainties over the availability of Bank loan, MERALCO had not made enough
progress in performing appropriate design studies. Consequently, these delays had cascading effects on
completion dates of the sub-components of the project.
23.   Implementation/Operation. The Borrower's implementation of the project has been
satisfactory. Early in the project preparation phase, administrative, legal and technical measures were
taken to reduce the system losses from 22 percent to 14.8 percent within eighteen months, although
subsequent improvements were marginal. System reliability also significantly improved over the course
of project implementation. initially, MERALCO had its attention deflected from implementation due
to the critical supply situation when NPC was experiencing brownouts. The construction of the three
bulk delivery 230 kV- I 15 kV substations namely Calauan, Sta. Rosa and Duhat were delayed; but
these are expected to be completed by December 1996. Six other substations are expected to
commence in 1997. With respect to the transmission line projects, the Balintawak leg of Marikina-
Novaliches-Balintawak line and Gardner-Pamplona line were completed after delays of two years and



7
one year respectively. Dolores-Marikina 115 kV line is expected to be completed in June 1996. Other
115 kV line subprojects delayed included: Sta. Rosa-Balibago line expected to be in service in
December 1996, Gardner-MCCRRPI in September 1996, and Araneta-Sta. Mesa in October 1988.
24.   Under the project, MERALCO has demonstrated increasing intuitional capacity in managing
procurement, accounting and other project activities. In particular, its demonstrated capability with
Bank bid evaluation process was exemplary. This was evident from a letter the Bank wrote
appreciating the high quality of its bid evaluation performnance, and requesting MERALCO if it would
object to the Bank sharing MERALCO's high quality works with the Bank's clients as a model for
good practice. Moreover, by diligently practicing ICB, MERALCO was able to get savings of more
than 10 % in the prices of goods procured under the loan. Also when the borrower, the Development
Bank of the Philippines, was delinquent with regard to reporting of its June 30, 1990 audited annual
accounts and the reporting of activities in Special Account established for the project, MERALCO
assumed the responsibility for the Special Account successfully.
G. Assessment of Outcome
25.   Taking into account the earlier delays, overall, the project outcome can be considered
satisfactory. The recalculated ERR of 59 percent is high although some of the subprojects of the five-
year program financed under the loan are still ongoing at the closing of the loan. Implementation is
progressing, and it appears likely that the project will achieve a well integrated transmission and
distribution system which is more reliable and with reduction of system losses, increased system
reliability and operational efficiency.
H. Future Operation
26.   MERALCO's main indicators of success of its future operations remain the same as its current
ones, minimization of system losses, achieving high level of system reliability, and more efficient
management of its accounts receivable and payable. MERALCO, as a private public company, is keen
on sustaining higher than the 8 percent rate of return on re-valued assets. With respect to the timing
for OED evaluation of the project, early 1999 may be appropriate. This will be the most probable date
to find out if the full targets for the system losses and efficiency of services are attained.
I. Key Lessons Learned
27.  NMERALCO's experience has two significant lessons for designing and implementation of
future projects in the infrastructure sector:
(i) In designing future Bank projects with on-lending to private borrowers, the
Bank may need to study the private sector's decision making process towards



8
official development finance. A proper understanding of the private sector to
find out the level of commitment and how it is expressed may be vital. For
example, in MERALCO's case the time lost in seeking ICC's and NEDA's
approval could have been read as a signal that MERALCO was not as prepared
as it should have been to implement the project as anticipated at appraisal.
(ii) The critical issue facing the distribution utilities is to become sufficiently
credit-worthy to secure loans and equity capital on their own in the capital
market. As in the case of NERALCO, available official development finance
can help them begin that process. The problem is one of devising legally
appropriate transitional financing mechanism for channeling the development
finance. To the extent that some of the remaining 145 distribution companies in
the Philippines, representing some 40 percent of the distribution capacity,
become credible borrowers through a consolidation program, DBP could serve
as a channel for development finance to recast their operations and finances to be
able to meet their future development finance from the market.

SUBJECT:       Manila Power Distribution Proiect (Loan No. 3084-PH) ICR Mission
Thank you for the hospitality and cooperation to the Implementing Completion Reporting
Mission consistinig of Ephrem Asebe whicli visited MERALCO on October 16, 1996 in accordance with
the terms of reference dated August 23, 1996.
We have included your revised contribution in the ICR for Manila Power Distribution
Project (loan 3084-PH).
We are glad that during the October ICR mission we were able to review together the Bank
draft ICR and MERALCO's contribution to the ICR. From the comments, we noted that we are in
broad agreements on all the major issues raised in the draft ICR. We have reached understanding on a
number of salient points on Implementation Experience & Results, Summary of Findings, Future
Operations and Key Lessons Learned which are reflected in the [CR. In particular, an understanding
was reached on the underlyiig assumptions and data used for the recalculation of thc Economic Ratc of
Returin. As a result, both party arc now satisfied on the overall implementation results and agree that
the overall rating of the project to be "satisfactory".
With regard to the appropriate mechianism of channeling future developmiient finance from
the Bank to MERALCO or the other utilities, you can rest assured that the Bank will consider all
appropriate mechanisms as the situation ariscs, including Philippines Government Guarantee Agency.
It is our hope that not only MERALCO but also DPB has bencfitcd from the implementation cxperience
of the project.
Thank you once again for your cooperation. Copies of the ICR will be sent to you as soon as
they are printed, whicih will be early in 1997.
Sincerely yours,

A ) STATEMENT AND E_ALU,,TION CF PROJ'CT    ItZECTIVES:
The specific cojcjectves of t;,a p.sjct are to:
a) Inmprove .1E'ALCC's su.,a,sr;ssc.  and distribution systems.
F) Facilitate better com......unicati,on between substations.
c) Rev,tal1ze thE OrganZtiZAtsons ma  tnaenancec apabili,tieS.
Th,ese  Objectives  when  real4,zed  is  expected  to  cont ribute  largely  to  the
improvemenrt of electri,c service in its franchise area.  T will enable I4ERALCO
to meet increasing load demands 4in the combs,4,   years, reduce .ts System, losses,
ensure effective distribution  of electricity within  the 'ranchise area and
support improvement of M1ERAL.C 's technica' and commercial operations.
The project is essentially miade up of four (') components namely:
a) Construction anud upgrading of subtransmission lines, and addition of
substaation capacity.
b) Construction and upgr,air.  of distributi4on systems.
c) Improvement and expansion ofl the radio-multiplex facilities for system
monitoring and control.
d) Provisicn of equipme,,t an,d veh,cles to, mprove maintenance.
The  project  has  for  its  centerpiece,  the  Major  Project  Procurement
rac'aga  which  is  essent ially  a  Substa,,a   anou  co.-Preherns,ve  procurement
pac'^age of -major electrical and mech,anical equipment,  and material  resources
needed for the elactric cap.tal  projects proposed over the next five years,
which, covers the cited four project components. The  implementaticn phase as

The  project  objective  of  im,prsv,,n c ERALCRL's  cu"transzmiss on  and
4s.tribution  ysytem wh,ich const.tutes 655%  of the foreign portion coss' of the
project and it s local counterpart to be 77% of the local cost is assessed  as
having been fully achieved. Th,e procurement pack'age as implemented assured the
0vilaibility of the reuired m,ajor equipment and materials for the specific
lined-up  subtransmission  and  substation  projects.  Also,  it  provides  the
required  spare  trans,,iS3- 1,  and  diistribution  line  materials  and  equipment
needed   to  c;arry  ou.t  MERALCO's  operation   and  m ainaenance   activities.
Construction  of  the  11  kY  subtrans,mission  line  projects  andu  15  k'V'
substations proceeded and carriled out as scheduled although some changes were
made in. the original  line up.

activities. Procurement- resulted in reinforcing MERALCO's limited fleet of
special construction and maintenance equipment and provided the optimum. stores
inventory. These observations lead to the conclusion that the aforementioned
objectives Ihave been achieved successfully.
The resulting improvement in MERALCO's subtransmission and distribution
system,  communication  system,  and mainte.nance  capabl'ities  as derived  from
these World Bank Projects and from the balance of the overall electric capital
project  played  a  vital  role  and  impact  .n  achieving  the  company  goals
specifically  in  system  loss  reduction,  system,  reliability,  and  improved
operations.
From  these  observations  and  the  very  satisfactory  results  of  the
Economic Internal Rate of Return and Financial Internal  rate of Return,  the
Project is rated highly successful.
B) ACHIEVEMIENT CF PROJECT OBJECTIVES
Originally,  the Manila Power Distributicn Project was mo..de a component
Part Co  NiPVC-PINOC's Bacon ,ar.ito Geothermal  Power  Project.  It was however
oropped frc,-,-, t,,e 15aco,. ,'a..to Ik act.e rmal P ower Project when the arranaen .

Govern.men,t, "ERALCO a      e  an) could not  Fe established. Later, DBP after
its restructuring and designation as the tNation's principal wholesale bank,
established Itself as a conduit for official foreign loans to private sector
cc..panies which paveA the way for the reappraisal of the project by the ','orldu
Bank i.n 18uO. The project was approved and the loan arrangement was signed on
August 2, 1982. The project was expected to be completed by December 31, 1994.
Original  closing  date  was  set  on  June  "V,  199I.  As  disbursements  were
projected to incur beyond the original loan closing date, an extension has
been granted by the vank for the loan to close by June  ^0, 199c.
In the course of project implementation,  EERALCCO relied heavily on lts
em-placed   L           c rprI p   a r9aOz a Uns  s u_ 3.h  as  Planning,  Engineer e ,

electric  capital  p-rojects  that were  l,ned  up  to  meet  project  objectives,
Project  ..plemaentation went on. However,  aid project i.mplementation suffered

in August 1997, Nlovemb er 1997 and AuguSt 1997, respectively.
With regards to the construction of major subtrans,,is3ion li,ne projects,
the Balintawak leg of Marikina-Nosvaliches-Balintawak line and Gardner-Pamplona
line were completed,  incurring delays of two year and one year, respectively.
Dolores-Marikina 115 kV line is ongoing and expected to be completed in June
1996. Other 115 kV line projects being delayed are:  Sta. Rcsa-Balitago line
which  is expected  in  Dece-mber  1996;  Gardner-'lCCRRPI  which  is expected  in
ceptember 1996; and ^ranata-Sta. Mesa 115 kV line which is expected in October
199°3.
C) MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROJECT:
I) PRE-IMPLEMErNTATIONl PHASE
a)  Project  feasibility,  appraisals  and  approval  have  long  gestation
periods. Process took approximate'y two (2) years frcmT project identification
to loan signing.
'b) Long approval of project was experienced due to delayed forvmulation
of guidelines by the government. for private firms av'ai'in o,  . OA funds.

As to the "Highly Successful rating of the proiect. we would like to cite the following reasons
which led us to wive this rating in the over-all assessment of the Project.
1)     Wc considered that a 1.49.o svstcm loss reduction from 1989 to 1995 (14.7%° to 13.3%) is
substantial when related to net system energy input. As svstem's loss decline. operazini
cost is reduced resuJLing in increased benefits coming from improved operations. Utility
Economics projects a continuing svstem loss improvement which we believe is
sustainable as the rest of the delaved World Bank- subprojects are commissioned and
Mieralco continues to develop in the coming years its eiectnic sVstem.

Table 5 Kev Indicators for Project Implementation indicates a completion rate of 53.3%
(8 out of 15') for substation project and 50%,o (3 out of 6) for subtransmission line
projects. \W`ith substantial departure from their original timetable of completion for most
subprojects, the delav cannot serve as justification for giving a "Highly Successful"
rating to the Overall Project. We believe however that due credit should be given to the
accomplishments made on other subprojects such as the Upgrading of Distribution
Svstem. Radio Multiplex. Procurement of Maintenance Vehicles and Equipment, Point
to Point Radio Mlultiplex and 230L' Protection equipment where considerable success
in the project cycle (identification to implementation) was achieved. We also thought
that the collective progress and success we have made in resolving difficult ROW
problems and land-site acquisition for the delaved substation and subtransmission
projects should be highly regarded and credited as it serves to place the vital substation
and subtransmission line projects on track and provide firmed up completion target
dates.
On the other hand, upon further consideration of other facts surrounding the Project particularly
the effects of a svstem voltage stud' and selection which delayed project implementation processes such
as detailed design and specificationr evaluation of bids and the cascading effects on target completion
targets, we accede and conciude that a -satisfactoryW rating of the outcome is just fitting.
To set the records properly we are attaching herewith revised pages 33 and 34 of our ICR portion
with the proper rectification of the affected sections.
We hope that you would understand our position. whereby assessment of the World Bank Project
tookl into consideration not onlv the Substation and Subtransmission subprojects but the whole Project
Package which revolves around a Substantial Procurement Package, to support and complement other
\leralco Projects such as the upgrading of Distnbution. Operational Maintenance and Communication
Equipment. which constitutes an integral part of Meralco's investment prozram, and to which we believe
we achieve a creditable success wvith iLs overall implementation.
Kindlv convey further comments regarding this report.
Best Reiards.

We ar glad to leamn during the visit of Mr. Ephrem Asebe on Octobier, 1996 that
the bank bas finally received and i5. satsfied with the results of our recalculiiion of the
Project)s ERR together with its supporting documents that was sent by fax oniter 6,

-_Wfth these results, the final value of the ERR and other interrelatedfgures    be
reflected in the ICR for the BankWs finalization. We have reviewed the draft ICR.upon receipt
and discussed salient points with Mr. Amebe particularly on ImpIementationeicnce &
Results, Summary of Findings, Futurr Operations and Key L,ssons Learned. In general, we
am of the opinion that the ICR is aLccurato and candid on its presentation azIstatements
in identfing the problemes and factors affecting the project, in aseain   the Bank's
perfoirn1an1ce and that of the Borrower's as well. We also mentioned to Mr Asebe our
obServations listed hereunder which we feel the BarLk should know and evaluate if worth

L PeHf-nMce of DBP accait bank. - It was observed that DBP as our conduit bank
has a very lean staff with only om personnel assigned to handle ODA loans from vanous
organizations. Ae such, MERALCO's disbursement and contract monitoring encountered
some setbacks which rendered delays in the preparation of progress reports for submission
to the World Rank Starting the third quarter of 1995, acquisition of disbursemcnt and
drawdown data from DBP exceeds 30 days after the end of each quarter, thus defeating our
earlier commitment to the World Bank of submitting the required Quarterly Progrss
Reports within one month at most after the end of each quarter. Meralco apy-ears to be
beter off in terms of communication and reptng with the World Bank without any
conduit bank and only a Philippmne government  arantee agency acting on its behalf - a
set up similar to the loan arranement  tenM        and the Asian Development
Bank (ADB).
A    - -:
EL Xinernstianal Competttvo ldindg (lCV). - By pracucing ICB, Meralco was able to
avail of lawer oompetitive prices without sacrificing the quality of goods in most of the
Meralco packages. Huge savings in the prices of goods (minimum of 10 percent) have been
noticed in companson with our tied loan from other institution and even with Meralco's in-
house procurement.
4.
It'. an opportune time to convey Meraco Management's sincere appre za±tion and
saafaction to the World Bank in providing the official Development Asaistance to
Meralco's Manila Power Distributicon Projcct, and the whole support extended by its staff
during the entire phase of the project, without which gains and project experiences could
not have been attained. The World Bank finan-ial asaistance was made available at the
time when Meralco needed it moor to put up the electic infrastrucrure facilities now found
vital and essential in meetng the increased power demand brought about by the rapid
industrializaion and the country's economic recovery.
The ICR will sere as a ready reference for other utilities in developing countries
desiring to undertake similar kind of project and to which we would gladly share with them
our valuable experience derived from our transaction with your bank.
Again, we thank you for your full support and we look forward to reciving a final
copy of the ICR.

Senior A8at. Vice President
