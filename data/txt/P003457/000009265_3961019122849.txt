IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
CHINA
BEILUNGANG THERMAL POWER PROJECT
(LOAN 2706-CHA)
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Beilungang
Thermal Power Project in China for which Loan 2706-CHA in the amount of $225 million
was approved on May 29, 1986 and made effective on August 27, 1986.
The loan was closed on June 30, 1994, 24 months beyond the date originally
envisaged, June 30, 1992. Final disbursement was made on October 31, 1994 when the
balance of the loan, $630,741.76, was canceled.
The ICR was prepared by Shigeru Kataoka and Alice Huang, Industry and
Energy Operations Division, China and Mongolia Department of East Asia and Pacific
Region, and reviewed by Mr. Richard Newfarmer, Division Chief, and Mr. Yo Kimura,
Project Advisor. The Borrower/Beneficiary provided comments, which are included as an
annex to the ICR.
Preparation of this ICR was begun during the Bank's final supervision
mission in April 1994. It is based on the Staff Appraisal Report, the Loan and Project
Agreements, Supervision Reports, correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower/
Beneficiary, internal Bank memoranda and interviews with Bank and Borrower/Beneficiary
staff involved in project implementation. The Borrower/Beneficiary contributed to the
preparation of the ICR by commenting on the draft ICR, preparing an evaluation of the
project's execution and implementation, and by contributing views reflected in the
mission's aide-memoire.

CHINA
BEILUNGANG THERMAL POWER PROJECT
(LOAN 2706-CHA)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Project Objectives
1.          The Beilungang Thermal Power Project was designed to support industrial
growth in East China by increasing electricity supply to the East China Grid, which was
suffering from acute power shortages.  The project was also used as a vehicle to:
(a) transfer the latest technology in plant design and construction management of 600 MW
thermal power units-then only recently introduced in China; (b) introduce more
appropriate techniques of least-cost investment programming; (c) initiate modernization of
utility management and financial planning; and (d) transfer up-to-date tariff analysis
methodologies and provide a reference for future tariff adjustments.
2.          Financing under the project was provided for: (a) construction of a coal-
fired thermal power plant, including coal unloading facilities, at Beilungang, with one
generating unit of 600 MW, two single-circuit, 500-kV transmission lines and associated
substations; (b) a training program to enhance the capacity of the Zhejiang Provincial
Electric Power Bureau (ZPEPB) to implement the project, address its long-term manpower
needs, and manage the utility; and (c) a tariff study for the Grid.
Implementation Experience and Results
3.          Project implementation was generally successful and the above objectives
were achieved within the budget. The project provided a fully integrated state-of-the-art
600 MW coal-fired unit that set technical and economic performance standards for a series
of same size units that were subsequently installed in China. This was the first such unit
designed, constructed and operated by ZPEPB and only the third in China. As such, it
represented a remarkable technical achievement.  The project's successful training
programs for modernization of utility management, financial planning, and investment
programming established an institutional capability primed for further development under
subsequent operations. In addition, the project's tariff study introduced marginal cost
pricing principles that are now widely accepted throughout China. The final cost was $225
million in foreign expenditures and Y 1,330 million in local costs, compared to an
estimated $289 million in foreign costs and Y 1,038 million in local costs. The local cost
increase resulted from inflation-related cost increases for both labor and materials.
4.          Commercial operation of the power plant was about 18 months later than
expected at appraisal due to the need to correct deficiencies in equipment quality, delayed



- iii -
procurement of equipment for one transmission substation, and difficulties in coordinating
suppliers. The subsequent commissioning period was also prolonged by some technical
difficulties and foundation settlement problems.   Throughout, ZPEPB  performed
satisfactorily, and responded to problems appropriately by taking firm measures with
contractors, expanding its project management staff, and reinforcing its quality assurance
system.
5.          However, on March 10, 1993, a serious accident in the power plant's boiler
caused the death of 23 people and injuries to 24. Three independent Chinese groups
investigated the accident and concluded that it was caused by the formation of a large
amount of ash slag in the furnace. No agreement was reached between the Chinese and
the boiler manufacturer regarding reasons for the formation of such a large amount of slag,
although various factors were identified that could lead to this, including a variety of coal
characteristics.  The immediate cause of the accident was also disputed, with a gas
explosion, steam blow-out due to falling slag, and furnace pressure increases due to tube
failure variously cited.
6.          Eventually, the Chinese and the boiler manufacturer agreed that both sides
equally shared responsibility for the accident and noted defects in manufacturing, an
incomplete operational manual, lack of ZPEPB's operational experience, and high variation
in the coal quality used in the boiler. ZPEPB introduced a range of measures to prevent
the recurrence of such accidents, including revised operational manuals and improved coal
supply management and quality control. The boiler manufacturer contributed $2.5 million
to repair the boiler and paid ZPEPB another $2 million in compensation for its loss from
the power outage. Compensation of Y 7.6 million was provided to the families of those
killed and injured in the accident, in accordance with Chinese rules and regulations.
Summary of Findings, Future Operations and Key Lessons Learned
7.          The project was instrumental in laying the basis for ZPEPB's future
development, in terms of its facilities, manpower, financial strength and commercial
orientation. First, the project facilitated the transfer to ZPEPB of up-to-date technology
for the construction and operation of a 600 MW coal-fired unit, which was followed up
with a second 600 MW unit and 500 kV transmission line under a subsequent Bank
project, the Beilungang Thermal Power Extension Project (Ln. 2955-CHA, 1988), and by
three additional 600 MW units and major transmission expansion under the Zhejiang Power
Development Project (Ln. 3846-CHA, 1995). Second, institutional development under the
project was followed up under the subsequent operation by a study for reorganizing
ZPEPB's operations and further strengthening its management. Implementation of the
study's recommendations realized the study' s goal of introducing managerial autonomy and
accountability as well as modern management organizations, systems and procedures.
Corporatization, the logical result of the previous efforts, is occurring under the current
project. Third, the project's tariff study was followed up under the second operation by
a tariff reform study, which resulted in ZPEPB's adopting an improved tariff structure.



- lv -
8.           Under the project, ZPEPB was introduced to new, state-of-the-art technology
and constructed a power plant of much greater dimensions than it had previously
attempted. The project's rate of return calculated at completion is more than 10 percent,
compared to the appraisal estimate of 8.5 percent. The higher return resulted from larger-
than-anticipated tariff increases.
9.           As might be expected, implementation of this technically very challenging
project was not problem-free. Procurement was somewhat protracted, and construction
and commissioning delays occurred due to contractual interface problems and project
management deficiencies. A serious boiler accident also occurred after commissioning.
In response to these problems, the Borrower has taken the following precautions under the
two subsequent operations: (a) increased grouping of equipment supply contracts to reduce
interfaces between contractors and suppliers; (b) timely staffing and training of the project
implementation organization; (c) use of model procurement documents developed by the
government with Bank assistance; and (d) provision of increased consultant assistance to
the designers and project managers.  In light of the boiler accident, boiler design
parameters such as furnace heat liberation and furnace exit gas temperatures have been
reviewed; operator training and operational manuals are being improved continually; and
coal supply management and quality control have been strengthened. The successful
implementation of the subsequent project and the challenging technical, institutional and
financial agenda under the third, most recent project testify to how well the Borrower has
internalized these initial lessons.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
CHINA
BEILUNGANG THERMAL POWER PROJECT
(LOAN 2706-CHA)
PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES
1.          In the mid-1980s, when this project was identified, East China was already
one of the country's most important industrial areas, accounting for about 25 percent of
total national production. However, a shortage of electricity supply forced industries in
the area to operate only four to five days a week, with consequent underutilization of plant
facilities and manpower. The development of transmission lines and substation facilities
also failed to meet demand, and the highest transmission voltage was 220 kV.
2.          Of necessity, the Government's commitment to industrial development
entailed a commitment to modernize and expand the power sector and make it more
efficient.  To this end, it encouraged:  (a) increased financial autonomy of sector
enterprises; (b) gradual introduction of a more rational pricing system; (c) modern
techniques in project design and system planning; (d) development of additional generating
capacity; (e) construction of extra-high-voltage transmission lines; and (f) improved energy
efficiency. The Beilungang project responded to these goals by providing additional
electric power and constructing 500 kV transmission lines to transfer power between
optimal generating sites and load centers and to facilitate eventual regional
interconnections.
3.          In 1984, the Zhejiang provincial power grid had a total installed capacity of
2,714 MW, or about 22 percent of total installed capacity of the East China grid (including
Jiangsu, Anhui and Zhejiang Provinces and Shanghai Municipality). Of total capacity,
44 percent was thermal and 56 percent was hydro. Peak demand in Zhejiang, at 1,560
MW in 1984, was expected to grow at almost 12 percent a year until 1992 owing to strong
projected growth of industry. A long-range power development optimization study for the
East China grid showed that the Beilungang Thermal Power Project, with four units of 600
MW each to be commissioned from 1990 to 1993, formed part of the system's least-cost
expansion program. Until 1991, when Beilungang would come into operation, power
supply in the area would continue to be inadequate.



- 2 -
4.          The Beilungang Power Project for construction of the first of these 600-MW
units was intended to: (a) transfer the latest technology in plant design and construction
management of a 600 MW thermal power unit; (b) introduce more appropriate techniques
of dynamic, least-cost investment programming; (c) initiate modernization of utility
management and financial planning; and (d) transfer the most up-to-date tariff analysis
methodologies and provide a reference for future tariff adjustments.
5.          The project financed:
(a)   construction of a coal-fired thermal power plant, including coal unloading
facilities at Beilungang with two generating units of 600 MW each;
(b)   construction of two single circuits of 500 kV transmission lines from
Beilungang to Pingyao substation (about 245 km) and two associated
substations (Pingyao and Shaoxin) to interconnect Beilungang plant with the
East China power grid and the existing provincial transmission system;
(c)   consultant services for engineering, detailed design, procurement and
construction management of the thermal power plant;
(d)   a training program to assist the Zhejiang Provincial Electric Power Bureau
(ZPEPB) address its long-term manpower needs and modernize utility
management and financial management, among other things; and
(e)   a tariff study for the East China power grid.
B. ACHIEVEMENT OF PROJECT OBJECTIVES
6.          The project provided a fully integrated state-of-the-art 600 MW coal-fired
unit that set technical and economic performance standards for a series of same size units
that were subsequently installed in China. This size unit was, and remains, the most
efficient, economic and environmentally acceptable. The smaller units of 50 MW or less
that have dominated China's power sector consume over 60 percent more coal per unit of
electricity produced, and result in 60 percent higher sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide
emissions (depending on the coal used) and proportionally even higher particulate
emissions.
7.          This was the first 600-MW  unit designed, constructed and operated by
ZPEPB (and only the third in China). It represented a remarkable technical achievement
and set the stage for the Beilungang Thermal Power Extension Project (Ln. 2955-CHA,
approved in 1988) for, inter alia, construction of a second 600 MW unit and 500 kV
transmission line, and for the Zhejiang Power Development Project (Ln. 3846-CHA,
approved in 1995) for construction of three additional 600 MW units and a major
transmission network expansion.



- 3 -
8.           Project studies and institutional development support similarly laid the
groundwork for major reforms.   The project's successful training programs for
modernization of utility management, financial planning and investment programming (see
Table 5) established an institutional capability primed for further development.
Consequently, under the subsequent project, a study was carried out for reorganizing
ZPEPB's operations and further strengthening its management. Implementation of the
study's findings realized the study's goal of introducing managerial autonomy and
accountability as well as modern management organizations, systems and procedures.
Corporatization, the logical result of the previous efforts, is occurring under the most
recent project.
9.           The project's tariff study similarly set the stage for improvement of
ZPEPB's financial performance. The study reviewed the level and structure of power
tariffs for the East China power system, and introduced the marginal cost pricing principles
now widely accepted in China. A tariff reform study carried out under Ln. 2955-CHA
resulted in ZPEPB's adopting the improved tariff structure.
C. IMPLEMENTATION RECORD AND MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROJECT
Implementation Schedule
10.         The project power plant was put into commercial operation in July 1992, 18
months behind the appraisal estimate. The delay resulted from: the need to correct
deficiencies in equipment quality; delay in procurement of equipment for the Shaoxin
substation; and difficulties in coordinating suppliers. However, the appraisal timetable was
unrealistic in setting a three-month interval between synchronization of the new unit to the
system and the start of commercial operations. A six-month period would have been more
appropriate. The project's first 500-kV transmission line between Beilungang and Pingyao
(145 km) was completed to coincide with commissioning of the unit. The second
transmission line (100 km) was completed at end-1993.
Implementation Difficulties
11.         Construction proceeded satisfactorily for the most part. However, as might
be expected in carrying out such a large project for the first time, ZPEPB experienced
some problems, particularly in the early stages of implementation. The following were
observed:
(a)   some subcontracted steel structures, including those for the boiler and
electrostatic precipitator, were not manufactured to specifications,
necessitating repairs and modifications on site;
(b)   leakage in the boiler economizer was repaired and its cause investigated
jointly by ZPEPB, the Chinese authorities and the manufacturer. After
repairs, the boiler performed satisfactorily during testing and was found
ready to send steam to the turbine;



- 4 -
(c)   interfacing  problems  occurred  between  various  contract  islands
(instrumentation, boiler, turbine generator, ash-handling, electrical, etc.).
Changes in the suppliers' designs for the turbine generator were responsible
for one major interfacing difficulty; and
(d)   the instrument and control (I&C) system required final adjustments due to
software modifications, missing items and deviations from contract
specifications.
ZPEPB took firm action with contractors to resolve these problems, and the project unit
was successfully synchronized to the system on March 21, 1991.
12.         During the subsequent commissioning, performance tests and trial operation
of the unit in 1991-92, two major problems were experienced-low reheater steam
temperature and condenser tube leakage, the latter caused by insufficient expansion of the
condenser plate and tubes, and resulting in corrosion of the inner steel plate of the
compound plate. Other defects encountered were: (a) the need to replace welds of 38
tubes in the reheater; (b) settlement differences between piled and unpiled building, with
particularly uneven settlement of the unpiled circulating water pumphouse due to the
turbine generator plant's foundation in high-compression soil, with a depth of more than
20 m. Concrete was used successfully to reinforce the foundation; (c) a number of
corrections needed to the I&C system, due in part to ZPEPB's lack of experience in
adjusting and tuning a state-of-the-art microprocessor-based distribution system; and
(d) frequent mistripping of the medium voltage (MV) protection relays.
13.         All of this resulted in a prolonged commissioning period and delayed start
of commercial operations.  Throughout this period, however, ZPEPB performed
satisfactorily. It responded to the problems appropriately, by expanding its project
management staff and reinforcing its quality assurance system.
14.         Boiler Accident. On March 10, 1993 at about 2:00 pm, a serious accident
occurred in boiler No. 1 of the power plant, killing 23 people and injuring 24. When the
accident occurred, the unit was operating with a 400 MW load or 67 percent of full
capacity. The main steam pressure was 15.22 MPa, the main steam temperature was
513°C, and the main steam flow was 1,154 tons/hour. The overly high pressure and
temperature registered in the Furnace Safety System, which, correctly, shut the boiler
down. However, large amounts of hot slag and steam were emitted, killing and injuring
workers engaged in boiler maintenance. Unfortunately, a routine check-up of the boiler
scheduled for that day meant that more people than normal were in the boiler area. Prior
to the accident, the boiler had been operating satisfactorily.
15.         The accident tore out and toppled the rear side of the bottom ash hopper,
broke tubes in the lower part of the wall downward from the 20 m elevation, and severely
damaged backstays of the ash hopper at the 14.7 m level. Both side walls were bowed.
The explosion occurred at about the 14 meter level.



- 5 -
16.          The accident was investigated by three independent groups from the East
China Electricity Power Bureau, ZPEPB, and universities, under the leadership of the
Ministry of Electric Power (MOEP). After thorough studies and discussions, it was
concluded that the accident was caused by formation of a large amount of ash slag (about
800 tons) in the furnace. No agreement was reached between the Chinese survey teams
and the boiler manufacturer regarding reasons for the formation of such a large amount of
slag, although lower reheater temperature, a change in the firing angle of burners, the soot-
blower design, and a variety of coal characteristics seemed to relate to the formation of
slag. The survey teams also had different opinions about the cause of the accident. A gas
explosion, steam blow-out due to falling slag, and furnace pressure increases due to tube
failure were variously cited. Eventually, the Chinese and the boiler manufacturer agreed
that both sides equally shared responsibility for the accident and noted defects in
manufacturing, an incomplete operational manual, lack of operational experience and high
variation in coal quality.
17.          A number of measures were taken to prevent recurrence of such accidents,
including:
(a)   the reheater surface was increased during a 90-day overhaul starting on
April 1, 1994;
(b)   all soot blowers were replaced by new, higher-quality blowers, and two
retractable soot blowers were added to the furnace;
(c)   burners were improved to reduce the gas temperature difference between the
left and right sides of the furnace;
(d)   observation doors for the furnace were added;
(e)   operational manuals were revised to include flame observation and limitation
for burner tilting-down operations; and
(f)   coal supply management and quality control were reinforced to ensure rigid
compliance with operational specifications and with air pollution guidelines
agreed with the Bank.
Repair works cost about Y 27.2 million, and parts for the repairs about $1 million. The
boiler manufacturer contributed $2.5 million to the cost of repair work and, in addition,
paid $2 million to compensate ZPEPB for its loss from the power outage. Compensation
to the families of those killed and injured and medical care for the injured were provided,
with support from local authorities, in accordance with Chinese rules and regulations. The
amount of compensation totaled Y 7.6 million, of which Y 5.0 million was paid by China
People's Insurance Company and Y 2.6 million by the Beilungang Power Plant. In
addition, the boiler manufacturer donated $1.1 million to the family members of the
deceased and the permanently disabled.

18.         Power Generation.  The operation record during 1991-94, following
completion of the 72-hour full load test on August 27, 1991, is summarized below:

Note: FH = first half; SH = second half.
19.         Project Costs. The estimated cost of the project at appraisal (excluding
interest during construction and other financial costs) was $289.0 million in foreign costs
and Y 1,038.5 million in local costs, equivalent to a total of $659.9 million (Y 1,847.7
million). The final cost was $225.34 million in foreign costs and Y 1,329.92 million in
local costs, equivalent to a total of $378.20 million (Y 3,290.38 million) (see Tables 8a-1
and 8a-2 for details). As compared with the appraisal estimate, the project had a cost
underrun of about 43 percent when expressed in US dollars and a cost overrun of about
78 percent when expressed in local currency. These variations were mainly caused by the
devaluation of local currency from an exchange rate of Y 2.8 to $1 at the time of appraisal
to Y 5.7 to $1 by the end of 1992, when the main components were completed. The
average exchange rate over the construction period (1987-92) was Y 4.5 to $1. Project
costs, expressed in Yuan terms, increased for three reasons:
(a)   an additional Y 60 million needed for steel pipes and other materials that
were originally included in ICB procurement but were changed to local
procurement;
(b)   an additional Y 65 million for substantial inflation-driven salary increases
of local laborers for civil and erection works; and
(c)   an additional Y 13.5 million for foundation costs because of unexpected soft
soil conditions.
20.         A summary comparison of the estimated disbursements at appraisal with the
actual disbursements is given in Table 4. The original loan closing date was June 30,
1992. The actual closing date was June 30, 1994, after two extensions due to delayed
completion of the unit and delayed procurement of the training simulator ($2.9 million),
the third set of the 500-kV protection relay system ($0.2 million) and the ash-handling



- 7 -
system for Unit 2 ($7.0 million). A total of $0.63 million was canceled from the loan on
October 31, 1994. The total loan amount disbursed was $224,369,258.24.
21.         Procurement. The project included 49 procurement contracts, of which 20
were entailed international competitive bidding (ICB).  The total amount of the
procurement contracts was $219.8 million, of which $214.0 million was under ICB
packages. All procurement activities for the project were performed in accordance with
the Bank's procurement guidelines and were generally carried out satisfactorily, although
clearance by the State Evaluation Committee of bid evaluation reports for the 500-kV
Shaoxin Substation power transformers was unusually delayed. Model bidding documents
agreed between the Chinese and the Bank were used for the ICB procurement.
22.         Consulting Services and Training. A foreign firm was selected to carry
out consulting services in two phases. Phase I, funded by the Bank Group's Technical
Cooperation Credit (Cr. 1412-CHA), provided services for preparation of the project,
including review of designs prepared by the East China Electric Power Design Institute
(ECEPDI), preparation of bidding documents, and assistance to ZPEPB for bid evaluation
and contracting. Phase II, financed under the project, provided services for assistance in
engineering and detailed design, review of vendors' drawings, support to ZPEPB for
interfacing management among the various contract islands, and assistance in construction
management and commissioning of the plant. The performance of the consultants was
satisfactory and met the requirements of their terms of reference. However, in spite of
their assistance, ZPEPB experienced some problems with project construction management
and interfacing management (see paras. 10-12). One lesson learned under the project was
the need to reinforce consulting services, with particular regard to construction
management.
23.         Both domestic and overseas training was provided under the project (see
Table 5). The domestic training included:
(a)   training of operation and maintenance staff [542 men, 7,498 man-months
(MM)] in technical schools in Hangzhou and Shanghai;
(b)   on-the-job training with consulting engineers for design (174 MM);
(c)   training by vendors of major equipment (161.8 MM);
(d)   training for plant managers (12 MM);
(e)   training for financial staff (12 MM); and
(f)   training for plant chiefs (12 MM).
24.         An extensive overseas training program in power plant operation for the
plant managers and chief electrical mechanical engineers (60.9 MM) and shift engineers
(56 MM) was carried out in Australia with the assistance of the Electricity Commission



- 8 -
of New  South Wales.  The program  involved (a) instruction on safety rules and
regulations; (b) shift organization and system operation; and (c) practical training at three
power stations. Although three months of intensive English courses had been provided for
the trainees prior to departure for Australia, assessment of their English capability showed
that there were two distinct groups-one fluent in English and the other assessed in the
range of 2.5-4 on a scale of 0-7. An additional evening English training course had to be
provided to the weaker group in Australia. Since English training abroad for short-term
trainees was not cost-effective, ZPEPB was advised to strengthen both technical and
language preparations for overseas training.
25.          Economic Performance. At appraisal, the ex-ante internal economic rate
of return (IERR) was estimated at about 8.5 percent, based on measurable economic costs
and benefits associated with the 1,200 MW development. The ex-post IERR is about
10.5 percent (with shadow price adjustment as shown in Table 9). The higher IERR came
from increases in tariffs.
26.          Financial Performance. Salient features of ZPEPB's finances during the
period 1985-93 are summarized in Annex 1. ZPEPB's overall operating results and
financial position were satisfactory even though its actual average rate of return on fixed
assets, 7.9 percent, fell short of the expected 8.1 percent at appraisal. ZPEPB adjusted
the tariff aggressively from an average rate of 7.6 fen/kWh in 1985 to 26.3 fen/kWh in
1993, a nominal increase of 17 percent and a real increase of 7.1 percent a year. Energy
sales were largely within expectations although the volume slowed since 1991 due to
market controls introduced to slow the rapid growth of inflation. However, increases in
operating costs during 1985-93, particularly fuel costs and costs for purchased power that
increased annually by about 34 percent compared to an appraisal estimated 19 percent,
outpaced growth of revenues and thus caused higher operating ratios and a lower-than-
expected rate of return. On the other hand, as a result of national controls in late years,
investments and actual borrowings were less than expected, about 78 percent of projections
for both items. Consequently, ZPEPB achieved other financial covenant requirements for
a minimum self-financing ratio and debt service coverage ratio. The debt/equity ratios
were kept at a conservative level with the highest of 62/38 in 1992.
27.          In 1993, new accounting regulations came into effect, and ZPEPB has acted
to bring its accounting procedures fully in line with Ministry of Finance regulations. More
recently, ZPEPB started to restructure its accounting department's functions in line with
the government's goal of enhancing effectiveness and efficiency of accounting tasks and
financial reporting.
28.          The Bank's objective to promote prudent financial management was achieved
through ZPEPB's efforts to comply with project financial covenants, which required it to
prepare long-term financial plans, focusing on its trends in production costs, future
investment program, and related financing arrangements, and to review such plans annually
with the Bank.

29.          Environment and Resettlement.  The Beilungang site is located in a
scarcely populated agricultural area along the seacoast. The project was designed to meet
environmental standards of Chinese and World Bank guidelines. ZPEPB carried out
periodic environmental monitoring before and after commissioning of the first 600 MW
unit. The monitoring showed that no excessive impacts were observed in the environment.
30.          The project required very little resettlement, all of which was carried out
satisfactorily, with standards of living sustained. Compensation levels were adequate, as
indicated below:
(a)   The power station site (103.8 hectares), was developed from an alluvial
plain at the beach. The only impact was on an office building of a local
village (total area of 1,474 m2) that had to be rebuilt and three families that
were resettled with a total house area of 294 m2. This was finished in June
1987. The total compensation paid was Y 28,781,276.
(b)   The two 500-kV transmission lines between the Beilungang power plant and
Shaoxin substation had 599 towers for which 60 families comprising 288
people 1/ were resettled.  Houses with a total area of 11,670 M2 were
rebuilt for the families. The total cost of land acquisition and resettlement
was Y 3,054,652. Relocation was mostly completed in 1990, but partly in
1993 for the second unit's second line.
(c)   The single 500-kV line between Shaoxin and Pingyao substations had 213
towers. Buildings and houses with a total area of 1,068 m2 and 12 families
with 95 people 1/ were relocated.  The cost for land acquisition and
resettlement was Y 299,556.
(d)   The Shaoxin substation was constructed in a hill area and no resettlement
was needed.
D. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
31.          The project is sustainable. First, demand for the plant's full output exists
since power shortages continue to be acute and economic growth has been sustained at a
high level. The unit is therefore being operated with a high plant-load factor. Second,
current and future provincial average power sales tariffs are designed to fully recover
capital and operating costs. From 1984 to 1993, the electricity sales of ZPEPB grew at
an average annual rate of 11.4 percent.
32.          Through this project and subsequent power projects supported by the Bank,
the Chinese have made good progress in evaluating the economic costs of electricity and
coal, and in suggesting approaches to gradual price reform. For electricity, long-run

marginal costs and target tariffs were established for East China in 1988. Since then, the
Bank has continued to sponsor the formulation of tariff action plans adapted to the specific
conditions of regional power grids.
33.         With respect to institutional development, managerial and financial staff
training provided under this project and the subsequent project (Beilungang II, Ln. 2955-
CHA) have resulted in an increasingly strong organization.
E. BANK PERFORMANCE
34.         Bank performance from  project preparation through completion was
satisfactory. The Bank maintained good relations with the borrower, the beneficiary and
the consultants throughout project execution. During implementation, the Bank regularly
supervised the project, including the construction schedule, procurement, financial aspects,
loan covenants, project cost updating, and training activities, to ensure smooth
implementation. In addition, with this project and two subsequent operations, the Bank
established a basis for cooperation and dialogue between the borrower/beneficiary and the
Bank in the development of the power subsector in China, including institutional
restructuring and electricity pricing reform.  To date, the Bank has assisted in
implementing 14 power projects in China with total assistance of about $2.7 billion.
F. BORROWER PERFORMANCE
35.         ZPEPB successfully completed the major project components-its first
600 MW coal-fired unit and associated 500 kV transmission line and substations-virtually
within the planned schedule. It overcame problems as they arose, including the boiler
accident, and translated the lessons learned under this project into good performance under
the two ensuing operations. ZPEPB introduced and absorbed the latest design technology
and construction management and operational management techniques for the power plant,
with the assistance of foreign consultants and training activities.  It also developed
institutionally and, under the recently approved Zhejiang Power Development Project, is
fully commercializing its operations.
G. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
36.         The project outcome is rated as satisfactory. ZPEPB achieved the project
objectives, and completion of the project contributed significantly to mitigating the
shortages of power supply in the East China grid and promoting industrial production and
regional economic development. Training for technical personnel in design, construction,
commissioning, operation and maintenance contributed to transferring the up-to-date
technologies needed for large-capacity coal-fired plants. Project training for utility and
financial management staff as well as the tariff study for the East China power system
contributed to institutional development that provided the basis for future reform.



- 11 -
H. FUTURE OPERATION
37.         Project achievements in institutional development were expanded on in the
subsequent operation, the Beilungang Extension Project (Ln. 2852-CHA), which included
ZPEPB's reorganization and management improvement. This was followed up by the
recently approved Zhejiang Power Development Project, which, inter alia, provided for
a major expansion of the power station, with three 600-MW coal-fired units, as well as
technical assistance aimed at commercialization and corporatization of what is now the
Zhejiang Provincial Electric Power Company (ZPEPC) and its affiliated enterprises. An
Action Plan for Power Sector Reform under this last project would develop ZPEPC into
a power company separated from government, with operational autonomy, accountability
for profits and losses, and self-sufficiency in its development. ZPEPC's institutional
improvements already carried out have allowed the latest project to be funded in part by
a Bank partial guarantee for long-term commercial funds, as well as a security package for
a joint-venture-developed cogeneration plant. The three projects therefore show the value
of incremental reform fostered under our operations in this sector.
I. KEY LESSONS LEARNED
38.         This project was only the Bank's third power project in China and its first
to assist the Chinese in constructing a large-capacity (600 MW) coal-fired power plant.
It was also the first power plant of this size to be designed, constructed and operated by
ZPEPB. As might be expected, implementation of this technically very challenging project
was not problem-free.  Procurement was somewhat protracted, and construction and
commissioning delays occurred due to contractual interface problems and weak project
management. A serious boiler accident also occurred after commissioning. In response
to these problems, the Borrower has taken the following precautions under the two
subsequent operations: (a) increased grouping of equipment supply contracts to reduce
interfaces between contractors and suppliers; (b) timely staffing and training of the project
implementation organization; (c) use of model procurement documents developed by the
government with Bank assistance; and (d) provision of increased consultant assistance to
the designers and project managers.  In light of the boiler accident, boiler design
parameters such as furnace heat liberation and furnace exit gas temperatures have been
reviewed; operator training and operational manuals are being improved continually; and
coal supply management and quality control have been strengthened. The successful
implementation of the subsequent project and the challenging technical, institutional and
financial agenda under the third, most recent project testify to how well the Borrower has
internalized these initial lessons.

ANNEX 2: PROJECT REVIEW FROM
THE BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
1.          The project was implemented well and progressed smoothly under the help
and support of the World Bank. The main objectives of the project were met on schedule
as originally predicted. By putting into operation of the first unit of the Beilungang Power
Station, our provincial power plant standard improved upto a high parameter and large unit
stage, and have an important effect on the construction of provincial super-high voltage
power grid. Unit 1 not only relieved the provincial power shortage condition, but also
added an important coal-fired power base to East China power grid.
2.          In the process of project implementation, the Borrower carefully followed
the Loan Agreement and the Project Agreement and met all supplemental letters and also
strictly respected relevant Bank's guidelines for procurement, use of consultants, and the
disbursement handbook.
3.          The Beneficiary introduced and absorbed the latest and advanced technology
on design, procurement, construction and operation and maintenance of 600 MW coal-fired
power plant and 500 kV transmission line and substations.
4.          Lessons learned from the project are:
(a)   Unit 1 adopted the international procurement based on individual island
biddings (8 main islands are: Boiler, Turbine/Generator, Instrument and
Control, Switch yard, Electrical equipment, Ash handling, coal handling and
simulator).  Interfacing management and coordination among contract
islands were complicated. It was the first time for ZPEPB to use a World
Bank Loan. ZPEPB was also lacking experience for individual island
bidding. ZPEPB's capability in handling and coordination with the interface
between each island was not strong, which affected the project construction
process. In future, it is necessary for ZPEPB to suitably reduce the number
of bidding islands.
(b)   The existing units of coal-fired plant in the ZPEPB system had low
capacities and design parameters. This project was the first construction of
high design parameters for 600 MW coal-fired plant, through which the
level of ZPEPB's management was raised and staff members have been
trained. But ZPEPB is still lacking the actual experience of construction
and management for large capacity power stations, it is needed for ZPEPB
to learn the lessons and to make the improvement and enforcement on
construction management, improving the quality control during construction
and commissioning and shortening the construction period.

(c)   During the operational period, an accident happened to the boiler on March
10, 1993, resulting in serious losses on equipment and death and injury on
persons.  We should remember this bloody lesson.  Besides some
insufficiency on the design and manufacture of the boiler equipment,
ZPEPB was also lacking the experience for operation and management on
large type coal-fired power plant, and the sources of coal for power plant
was complicated. In future ZPEPB needs to further improve power plant
management including the coal management, to ensure the normal power
plant operation and gain the efficiency.
