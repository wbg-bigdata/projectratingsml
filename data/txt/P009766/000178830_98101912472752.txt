/1   Until September 24, 1975, the Rupee was officially
valued at a fixed Pound Sterling rate. Since then
it has been fixed against a "basket" of currencies.
As these currencies are floating, the US Dollar/
Rupee exchange rate is subject to change. Conver-
sions in this report have been made at US$1.00 to
Rs 8.60 which represents the projected exchange
rate over the disbursement period.

DEFINITIONS
Crude Birth Rate          Number of live births per year per 1,000 population.
Crude Death Rate          Number of deaths per year per 1,000 population.
Rate of Natural           Difference between crude birth and crude death rates;
Increase                usually expressed as a percentage.
Rate of Population        Rate of natural increase adjusted for (net) migration,
Growth                  expressed as a percentage of the total population in
a given year.
Age Specific Fertility   Number of live births to women in a given age group
Rates                   per 1,000 women in the same age group, in a given
year. It is usually calculated for five-year age
groups.
Total Fertility Rate      The average number of children that would be born
per woman if she were to live to the end of her
childbearing years, and bear children according to
a given set of age-specific fertility rates. The
Total Fertility Rate often serves as an estimate
of the average number of children per family.
Net Reproduction Rate    The number of daughters a woman would have under
prevailing fertility and mortality patterns, who
would survive to the mean age of childbearing.
Infant Mortality Rate    Annual number of deaths of infants under one year
per 1,000 live births during the same year.
Maternal Mortality Rate  Number of maternal deaths per 1,000 births attri-
butable to pregnancy, childbirth, or puerperal
complications (i.e., within six weeks following
childbirth).
Life Expectancy           Average number of years expected to be lived by
children born in a given year if mortality rates
for each age/sex group remain the same in the
future.
Age Dependency Ratio      Number of people 14 years and under plus people 65
years and over, divided by the population aged 15
to 64 years.
Tehsil/Taluk              Sub-divisions of districts.
Equivalent Steriliza-    An index of overall family planning performance
tions                   calculated by adding the number of sterilizations
performed over a period of time, one-third the
number of IUDs inserted, one-eighteenth the number
of equivalent conventional contraceptives users,
,and one-ninth the number of equivalent oral con-
traceptive users. These weights are derived from
an assessment of numbers of births averted by
different contraceptive methods in India.

I. POPULATION GROWTH AND HEALTH SITUATION
A. All-India Trends
Population Size
1.01      India's population, currently estimated at 652 million in mid-1979,
is the second largest in the world, exceeded only by the People's Republic of
China. According to the 1971 Census, the population numbered 548 million at
the end of March 1971 (see Table 1 below).

1.02      Data from decennial censuses dating back to 1871 provide reasonably
good information about the growth rate of India's population. Population
growth was slow up to 1921 because of frequent epidemics of plague and
cholera, famines, and the influenza epidemic of 1918-19. During 1921-51,
the average decennial growth was around 13%; during 1951-61 it increased
rather sharply to 21.6% and 24.8% during 1961-71. The sharp acceleration of
the rate of population growth during 1931-51 is generally attributed to the
control of malaria and infectious diseases, including tuberculosis, during the
1950s. International migration has had virtually no effect on India's total
population size in this century.
1.03      India's rate of population growth of 2.1% is moderate by developing
countries' standards. Comparison with growth rates of India's neighboring
countries shows India among the moderately growing: Bangladesh, 2.8%; Iran,
2.6%; Nepal, 2.6%; Pakistan, 3.0%; Sri Lanka, 2.0%; Thailand, 2.4% (all 1977
figures). The average annual rate of population growth for low income develop-
ing countries as a whole in 1977 was 2.5%. It is the magnitude of absolute
growth--presently about 14 million additional people a year--together with
widespread poverty and pressure on the land which creates severe difficulties
in India.



-2-
Fertility
1.04      The trend of fertility over the last intercensal decade (1961-71)
was undoubtedly downwards. Most studies suggest a crude birth rate (CBR) of
44-45 at the beginning of the decade (as opposed to the official figure of
41.1; see Table 1 above), or a total fertility rate of 6.4-6.6, and a decline of
about four points in the CBR between 1961-71. It is difficult to know precisely
when this decline occurred, but a large share of it can certainly be explained
by the considerable advances in family planning which occurred after 1965.
(Since the family planning program was most successful in urban areas, this
is corroborated by the appearance of a significant rural/urban fertility differ-
ential at the end of the decade.) Some of the decline is attributable to
changes in the age-distribution and a modest rise in the age-at-marriage; but
the major share of the decline seems to reflect reductions in marital fertil-
ity. This trend in fertility decline appears to have continued in the 1970s,
and a 1976 CBR of about 36-37 is probably correct. The official CBR for
1976, the latest year available, was 34.4, but the nationwide average marks
wide state differentials ranging from 40.0 in Uttar Pradesh to about 28.0 in
Karnataka and Kerala.
Mortality
1.05      Table 1 also shows the long-run downward trend in mortality as
measured by the crude death rate (CDR). As in the case of the CBR, the offi-
cial figures are likely to be an underestimation of the true value of the
CDR. A CDR of about 19 per 1,000 for the latter half of 1961-71 is implied
by most studies on life expectation.
1.06      Mortality decline seems to have slowed down in the latter half of
the 1961-71 decade. This trend has continued in the 1970s. The official
CDR figure of 15 per 1,000 for 1976 (the latest year available) is almost
identical with the comparable figure for 1971. In previous decades, reductions
in mortality were largely won through eradication programs and communicable
disease control. Most of these campaigns did not depend greatly upon the
active participation of the population itself. The resulting mortality
decline need not necessarily have been associated with corresponding declines
in morbidity or socio-economic improvements. But beyond a certain mortality
level, further gains depend upon various forms of socio-economic development,
particularly improvements in nutrition, sanitation and housing. Since improve-
ments in these areas are occurring very slowly in India, the observed levelling
off of the mortality decline is not surprising. Official estimates of infant
mortality range between 130 to 140 for rural areas during 1968-71 and around
81 to 86 for urban areas during 1970-71. The extent of under-reporting of
infant deaths normally exceeds that for other age groups; for the country as
a whole infant mortality is estimated to be quite high, between 130 to 150
per 1,000. About 30% of all children die before the age of five. Over the
last 50 years, the infant mortality rate has fallen less rapidly than adult
mortality. The CDR has decreased by two-thirds during this period while
the infant mortality rate has only dropped by half, with the result that the
differential between infant and adult mortality rates is greater now than 50
years ago.



-3-
Morbidity
1.07      It is estimated that in any given week in India, one quarter of the
nation's population is ill. The prevalence of illness in the course of one
week is 29.5% in rural areas and 13.1% in urban areas, for an overall rate of
26.2%. Most of those who are sick are reported to be afflicted with dysenteries,
diarrheas and respiratory diseases, implying inadequate potable water supplies,
substandard sanitation facilities and inadequate housing.
1.08      The disease patterns in India have shifted dramatically over the
last 50 years. Starvation and major epidemic diseases have disappeared as
statistically significant causes of death. Despite this, malnutrition is still
of major importance as an underlying contributor to death. The interaction
between malnutrition and infection throughout the developing world has been
widely documented. In the case of India, although malnutrition rarely appears
as an overt cause of death, it has been estimated that it is responsible for
more child fatalities than all other causes combined.
1.09      The leading causes of death in India now appear to be non-specific
dysenteries, diarrheas and upper respiratory infections. A 1969 Government
survey listed "cough" as the cause of 24.5% of deaths, "fever" of 20.6%, and
diarrhea of 9.2%. These are all linked to gastro-intestinal and respiratory
illnesses. India's Five-Year Plan for 1978-83 cites tuberculosis, gastro-
intestinal infections, malaria, filariasis, infectious hepatitis, rabies,
hookworm and other infectious diseases as accounting for 17.2% of morbidity
and 20.8% of mortality in 1970. Preventable diseases such as diptheria,
whooping cough, polio, tetanus, smallpox and measles contributed 9.4% of
mortality and 1%. of morbidity. Smallpox, however, has since been eradicated.
Age and Sex Distribution
1.10      The population of India is a youthful one.  In 1971, 40.8% of the
population was under the age of 15 and the median age of the total population
was 19.4 years. Sex distribution data from the 1971 Census show that males
outnumber females in the total population and in all age groups until age 65.
In fact, there is evidence that the ratio of males to females has been growing
larger for perhaps as long as a century. This striking trend and the resulting
sex distribution reflect traditional cultural norms which have placed greater
value on male children, and which have consequently led to greater male life
expectancy.
Population Projections
1.11      Table 2 below shows a projection of the likely course of population
growth in India, assuming that a net reproduction rate (NRR) equal to one
(replacement level) would be achieved around the year 2020. At this time, the
total population would have reached 1.2 billion persons, an increase of about
83% over present levels. Because of the in-built momentum for growth, however,
the population would continue to grow for many decades after achievement of a
NRR equal to one, and would stabilize at about 1.6 billion by the middle of
the 22nd century.

1.12      A population experiencing declining fertility after a period of
rapid growth will exhibit some relative contraction of the base of the pop-
ulation age-pyramid. Table 2 only shows population totals, but the more
detailed projection on which this table is based forecasts a decline in the
population 0-4 from 16.2% of total population in 1971 to 11.7% in 2000, and a
slighter decline in the age group 5-14 (the school-age population) from 24.7%
in 1971 to 22.1% in 2000. In absolute terms, the projection implies a large
growth of the school age population--with concomitant need for additional
expenditures in this sector just to maintain present percentages of literacy--
in the period 1971-80, from 137.6 million to 174.5 million, or an annual
growth rate of about 2.7%.  By contrast, average growth rates for 1980-90 and
1990-2000 would be about 0.8% and 1.2% respectively.
1.13      The population of working age, 15-59, would increase both in absolute
and relative terms. In relative terms, it would increase from 53.4% of total
population in 1971 to 59.6% in 2000. In absolute terms, it would increase
from 297.6 million in 1971 to 579.7 million in 2000. The labor force would
increase from 219.3 million in 1971 to 475.6 million in 2000, or at an average
annual growth rate of about 2.7%. As a percentage of the total population,
the labor force would go up from 39.4% in 1971 to 48.9% in 2000. Thus, as
fertility declines, the ratio of dependents to persons in the labor force will
fall, and if work opportunities can be provided for the growing labor force,
the growth of per capita income will accelerate. However, the task of provid-
ing productive employment to a labor force growing at 2.7% per year would be
very challenging indeed.
1.14      India does not conform to the experience of many developing countries
reporting fast urbanization. It remains a predominantly rural society, with
about 20% of the population residing in urban areas. There is little basis



-5-
for envisaging 'any sharp alteration of past trends in this regard, and recent
projections of the future urban population are that it will be about 29% of
the total by 2000. This does not imply a very high rate of urbanization,
but at the same time there is no ground for complacency with respect to the
problems faced by India's cities and towns. Even with the low and slowly
increasing rate of urbanization, India's urban population in 1971 numbered
about 109 million, and it will grow to about 282 million by 2000 (according
to the population projection of Table 2), or at an average annual growth rate
of about 3.3%. India's urban centers already find their infrastructure over-
strained, and fairly large investments will be necessary to prevent a further
deterioration in civic amenities.
1.15      If fertility does not decline to the extent assumed in Table 2, the
tasks of employment creation, of providing enough additional school facilities
to prevent a deterioration of present educational levels, and of allocating
additional resources to urban areas infrastructure to prevent deterioration in
current per capita levels of urban public services, would be correspondingly
enlarged. Attainment of the fertility reduction assumed in Table 2 would
imply a considerable increase of efforts by the family planning program; the
percentage of couples effectively protected by contraception would have to
increase from about 22.7% at present to about 51.6% by 2000, or an increase in
absolute terms from about 25 million couples to about 85 million. This will
require a substantial increase in resources allocated to the family welfare
program.
B. Project States and Districts
1.16      The project will be implemented in six districts of eastern Uttar
Pradesh--Azamgarh, Basti, Deoria, Ghazipur, Mirzapur and Varanasi--and three
districts of south-eastern Andhra Pradesh--Anantapur, Chittoor and Cuddapah
(Map: IBRD 14519r).
Uttar Pradesh (U.P.)
1.17      The state of U.P. had an estimated population of about 99.3 million
in March 1979, which makes it by far the most populous state in India. The
official estimated CBR in 1976 was 32.5 per 1,000 in urban areas and 41.2
per 1,000 in rural areas (combined 40.0 per 1,000), which are considerably
above the corresponding all-India figures (28.3, 35.8 and 34.4 respectively).
Official CDRs in 1976 were 12.9 per 1,000 in urban areas, 21.7 per 1,000 in
rural areas, and 20.5 per 1,000 combined. These figures are also well above
national averages, which were 9.5, 16.3 and 15.0 respectively. The percentage
of population residing in urban areas was 14% in 1971, considerably below the
national average of 20% in that year.

1.18      The six project districts in U.P. had an estimated combined popu-
lation of about 15.9 million in March 1979, or about 16% of the total state
population. Analysis of the socio-economic data summarized in Table 3 above
indicates that the project area in U.P. is average in terms of industry,
literacy, and institutional infrastructure compared to the state.
1.19      Morbidity patterns in both U.P. as a whole and the six project
districts do not deviate significantly from national patterns. Hospital
statistics for the 1971-73 period indicate that 35%-40% of all cases treated
in hospitals pertain to gastro-intestinal and respiratory diseases. Other
major categories are anemia, 3.7% in the six districts and 3.2% in U.P.;
diseases of nervous system and sense organs, 8.0% and 7.3%; diseases of the
genito-urinary system, 6.0% and 2.5%; diseases of the skin and muscle-skeletal
system, 10.3% and 9.9%; and accidents, poisoning and violence, 6.4% and 8.9%.

Andhra Pradesh (A.P.)
1.20      The state of A.P. had an estimated population of about 49.7 million
in MWrch 1979, being the sixth largest state of India in population size.
The official estimated CBR in 1976 was 29.8 per 1,000 in urban areas, 34.7
in rural areas, and 33.8 combined; these figures do not differ markedly from
all-India averages. Official CDRs in 1976 were 9.4 in urban areas, 15.6 in
rural areas, and 14.5 combined. Again, these figures are very close to
national averages.
1.21      The three project districts in A.P. had an estimated combined popu-
lation of about 6.8 million in March 1979, or about 13% of the population of
the state. Analysis of the socio-economic data summarized in Table 3 indicates
that the project districts in A.P. are average or marginally better in terms
of literacy and institutional infrastructure but are less developed in terms
of agriculture, industry and housing compared to the state.
II. NATIONAL FAMILY WELFARE PROGRAM
A. Historical Overview
2.01      Voluntary family planning activities started in the 1920s but were
very limited in scope. Private interest in spreading the idea of limiting
family size resulted in the formation of the Family Planning Association of
India in 1949. Although there was clear recognition of the problem of exces-
sive population growth by Indian leaders, there was no consensus as to how
this problem should be solved, primarily because of the influence of Gandhian
philosophies of self control. In April 1952, however, the Government of India
(GOI) appointed a Population Policy Committee under the chairmanship of the
Minister of Planning and a Family Planning Cell was created in the Directorate
General of Health Services. The First Five-Year Plan documents, presented to
Parliament in December 1952, referred to a program for "family limitation and
population control" for which Rs 6.5 million was allocated. This was the
genesis of the first official national family planning program in the world.
2.02      Initial activities under the First Five-Year Plan (1951-56) were
limited to a few pilot projects and some studies. One conclusion of the
Family Planning Research and Programs Committee established in May 1953, was
that "as far as possible, new family planning centers should be developed
in association with institutions for the health protection of mothers and
children." Under the Second Five-Year Plan (1956-61) Rs 50 million was
allocated for the establishment of rural and urban family planning clinics and
the provision of grants to states, local bodies and voluntary organizations
for family planning work. This essentially clinical approach was modified
in the early 1960s by the establishment of a nationwide community extension
program in family planning through the extension health services provided in
rural areas. The new program was to undertake educational work to produce
group support for the program and to supply contraceptives. A program goal
was proposed to accelerate the adoption of family planning in order to reduce



- 8 -
the birth rate to 25 per 1,000 by 1973. To emphasize the link between family
planning and family health, the family planning centers were renamed Family
Welfare Planning Centers. A "cafeteria approach," which provided a broad
choice of contraceptive methods including sterilization, various mechanical
ancL chemical methods, and rhythm, was to be a key element of the program.
2.03      To carry through these new program approaches, a Commissioner for
Family Planning was appointed in 1965 and a Department of Family Planning
established in the Ministry of Health in April 1966. Time-bound targets were
introduced and, after trials, the Intra-Uterine Device (IUD) became an impor-
tant program method. In 1968, the GOI launched the innovative scheme whereby
condoms were distributed through the retail channels of leading distributors
of consumer goods. At the GOI request, the United Nations sent two advisory
missions to evaluate the program, one in 1965 and a second in 1969. In
November 1969, a special meeting of the India Consortium was devoted to a
review of the national family planning program and the need for external
assistance. Expenditures between 1966-67 and 1969-70 increased by three times
for India as a whole.
2.04      Prior to 1966, national performance statistics are incomplete.  The
intensified activity of the late 1960s resulted in a significant increase in
the numbers of acceptors. From just under 1 million equivalent sterilizations
in 1965-66, 2.1 million were recorded in 1967-68. In the 1970s the national
program was administered on the basis of the structure which had been estab-
lished, with the objective of consolidating program approaches and successes
of the earlier period. It was marked by innovative approaches and by efforts
to inject momentum into a program which had begun to show a decline in program
performance. In 1972, the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act came into
force, providing for the termination of pregnancy on health, humanitarian and
eugenic grounds. IUD insertions had declined rapidly from a peak of 910,000
in 1966-67 to 355,000 in 1972-73. The number of sterilizations had also
fallen from a 1967-68 peak of 1.84 million to 1.33 million in 1970-71. In
response to this decline, the program organized mass vasectomy camps which
resulted in a peak of 3.1 million sterilization cases in 1972-73. This policy
was discontinued because of administrative shortcomings, poor quality of
services, and questionable motivation practices. This resulted in a dramatic
decline to 942,000 sterilizations in the following year. As performance
varied so did the national targets. In 1968, the stated goal was to reduce
the birth rate from 41 to 23 per 1,000 by 1978-79 whereas the Fourth Five-Year
Plan (1969-74) declared its objective to be a reduction in the annual birth
rate to 32 per 1,000 by 1974, and to 25 per 1,000 "in another 5 to 7 years"
(i.e., 1979-81). These goals were amended in the draft Fifth Five-Year Plan
to achieve a reduction in the birth rate of 30 per 1,000 by 1978-79 and 25 per
1,000 by 1983-84.
2.05      By 1975 it was clear that the program continued to lose momentum,
despite steady increases in the distribution of condoms from 961,000 equivalent
users in 1968-69 to 3.5 million in 1975-76. A surge in performance coincided
with the declaration of a national Emergency on June 25, 1975. Although not
included in the Government's comprehensive 20-point economic program, commit-
ment to the success of the family planning program became a feature of the



- 9 -
following months. In April 1976, the Ministry of Health and Family Planning
produced a formal statement of national population policy. Recognizing the
relationship between population and development, the statement lists 16
specific population-related measures. They included increasing the minimum
age of legal marriage, making the volume of central government financial
assistance'to state governments partly dependent on family planning perform-
ance, freezing the representation in the Parliament and the State Legislature
on the basis of the 1971 Census, according higher priority to female literacy,
increasing sharply the amounts of monetary compensation for individual
sterilization acceptors, and permitting interested state governments to
propose legislation for compulsory sterilization.
2.06      Between 1975 and early 1977, there was a dramatic increase in
family planning performance, as a result of a vigorous, and sometimes over-
zealous, pursuit of acceptors by the machinery of government. As a result
of these efforts, 8.3 million persons were sterilized in 1976-77--some 6.5
million alone in the period July-December 1976. Sterilization was the method
most emphasized during this period, with the number of IUD acceptors actually
falling and condom acceptors increasing only marginally. As 1976 drew to a
close, there were rapidly mounting indications that substantial resistance to
the intensive family planning drive was developing, especially in the northern
region and particularly against vasectomies. Monthly performance figures,
although high in comparison with pre-drive levels, were beginning to decline.
Reported program excesses became an issue in the elections which led to the
change in Government in March 1977.
2.07      Despite early assertions that the Government supported a family
planning program which would henceforth be completely free of pressure,
the program came virtually to a halt, particularly in the northern Hindi-
speaking states of U.P., Bihar and Madhya Pradesh. Following an evalua-
tion, the Government committed itself to following existing policies
closely. In a policy statement issued on June 29, 1977, the Government
called for a purely voluntary program, rejected "hard targets" for performance
and directed the thrust of the new Health and Family Welfare program to those
underserved, primarily in rural areas; in other respects the statement was
similar to that issued 14 months earlier. The Government has subsequently
reiterated its commitment to the program, reiterating the need for the inte-
gration of family planning with basic health, particularly maternal and child
health (MICH). In October 1977, the rural health scheme was launched which
features the training and support of village community health workers (CHW).
An act fixing the minimum legal age-at-marriage at 21 for males and 18 for
females was passed in March 1978.
2.08      In 1977-78, the year following the Emergency, program performance
fell to a level characteristic of five years earlier as the following table
shows:

Performance, as measured by equivalent sterilizations, improved in 1978-79 by
63% over the previous year but was still 42% below that of 1975-76, the pre-
Emergency year.
B. Current National Goals and Strategies
2.09      By early 1978, it became clear that a reduction in the targeted
CBR to 30 could not be achieved by mid-1979. In only nine months since
the end of the Emergency, it became clear that the severe drop in performance,
particularly sterilization, was having an adverse effect on the percentage of
eligible couples effectively protected by contraception, normally an indicator
insensitive to performance shifts over short periods. Accordingly the Central
Council for Health and Family Welfare declared in January 1978 that the goal
of attaining a birth rate of 30 per 1,000 would be deferred back until 1983.
To attain this, the percentage of couples effectively protected would need to
be raised from the then current level of 22.8% to about 36%, an increase from
27 million to 42 million couples. On the basis of present performance, it is
doubtful whether even this target can be achieved; there is evidence that the
prevalence rate is still declining slightly. Whilst a CBR of 30 by 1983
remains the official target, there is evidence that further revision may not
long be delayed. Late in 1978, the Planning Commission established a working
group on population policy which produced an interim report in March 1979.
The report is a significant pointer to recent thinking on population policy.
One of the major recommendations is the adoption of a long-term goal of a
NRR of 1 by the year 1996 for all-India, which implies a birth rate of 21
per 1,000 or a reduction from the current official estimate level of 33
per 1,000 by 12 points. Achievement also implies a contraceptive prevalence
rate of about 60%.  Although acceptance of this target would not deny the
continued use of short-term goals, it does reflect a growing consensus that



effective population control implies considerable socio-economic development
and that the whole process of moderating fertility can be viewed only in the
long term.
2.10      The Government's first priority was to dispel concerns about
the program which had built up prior to March 1977. To some extent this has
been achieved but there remain in many parts of the country a latent suspi-
cion that family planning (or family welfare) is equated only with sterili-
zation, a feeling which pre-dates the Emergency period by many years. In
addition to reaffirming the voluntary nature of the program, the following
points have been emphasized:
a.   integration of family planning with basic health,
particularly that of mothers and children, in a family
welfare program;
b.   direction of the program towards those now underserved,
mainly in rural areas;
c.   expansion and redirection of the program's motivational
activities from heavy reliance on mass media to a more
interpersonal approach;
d.   encouragement of participation by community organizations
and voluntary bodies;
e.   establishment of village level, voluntary CHWs and
intensification of the dai (indigenous midwife) training
program; and
f.   involvement of all departments of Government in the
program.
C. Family Welfare Program Organization
2.11      Under the Constitution, policy-making for population matters,
including family planning, is the joint responsibility of the states and the
central government, but program implementation is a state responsibility.
The family welfare program (which comprises family planning and MCH care),
however, is of national importance and is centrally sponsored to the extent
that all expenditures incurred by the states are met from GOI funds. The GOI's
Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is responsible for overall program
direction, guidance and evaluation. At central level, the Central Health and
Family Welfare Council, headed by the Union Minister of Health and Family
Welfare, meeting annually, advises on broad policy issues. The Council's
membership comprises all state health ministers, representatives of selected
voluntary and labor organizations, some Members of Parliament and eminent
personalities active in the field of family welfare. In overall charge of the
Department of Family Welfare in the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is



- 12 -
a Secretary to the GOI. The Additional Secretary and Commissioner of Family
Welfare coordinates the activities of five major divisions dealing with
policy, technical matters, information activities, the organized sector
(industries and major national organizations such as the railways), and
evaluation. Throughout India, stationed in the capitals of the major states,
are 16 Regional Directors of Health and Family Welfare responci.ble to the
center for liaising with and advising state governments on program implementa-
tion and feeding back information.
2.12      In U.P. the Health and Family Welfare functions are under the overall
guidance of the Health Minister. He is supported by a Commissioner-cum-Health
Secretary and staff in the State Secretariat. Program implementation is the
responsibility of the Director of Medical, Health and Family Welfare Services,
who reports to the Health Secretary (see Chart 1). One of the seven Additional
Directors is responsible for Family Welfare. His office (known also as the
State Family Welfare Bureau) has five divisions dealing with operations,
education and information, training, demography and evaluation, and MCH.
Two state-level committees are responsible for providing policy guidance for
the family welfare program. One of these is a sub-committee of the Cabinet
with the Chief Minister as Chairman. This is the most important policy
decision-making body. A second committee, chaired by the Commissioner-cum-
Health Secretary, is the State Family Welfare Publicity Coordination Committee,
which takes decisions on information and media campaigns. U.P. is divided
into 11 Revenue Divisions, in each of which is a Joint Director, Ministry of
Health and Family Welfare, responsible for coordinating the program in the
districts in the Division. The functions of the Joint Directors are, however,
limited and essentially those of review; reference to the need to strengthen
their ties to the organization is made in para. 4.65(c). At district level,
implementation is the responsibility of the District Chief Medical Officer.
Districts are now divided into three areas, in each of which a Deputy Chief
Medical Officer is responsible for all health and family welfare activities.
Throughout India, three deputies are posted per district regardless of the
size of the district, its population or number of health facilities. In the
project area in U.P., districts vary in population from 3.3 million to 1.8
million and in number of primary health centers (PHCs), for example, from 32
to 16 for the same districts. The peripheral rural unit of administration of
the family welfare program is the PHC, in charge of a medical officer,
and covering an average population of about 100,000.
2.13      In A.P., the administration of health and family welfare services
is similar to that of U.P. (see Chart 2). In the Directorate of Medical and
Health Services, there are two Directors, one dealing with medical education,
large teaching hospitals and specialized hospitals, and the other responsible
for all other health and family welfare services. The latter is assisted by
six Additional Directors, one of whom is responsible for Family Welfare and
MCH services. There are six administrative regions in A.P., each having a
Regional Director of Medical and Health Services to whom have been delegated
functions relating to finance and staff. In the districts, the District
Medical and Health Officer administers a structure similar to that in U.P.
An analysis of administrative strengths and weaknesses and proposals to remedy
the latter are contained in the following sections.



- 13 -
Delivery of Family Welfare Services
2.14      The base from which family welfare services are delivered is the
PHC, an organizational unit which provides basic health and family welfare
services for a community development block with an average population of
about 100,000. The medical officer in charge is supported by a second doctor,
both of whom are heavily involved with curative services. These doctors are
mostly male and the treatment of women and, to a lesser extent, children
is frequently left to a Lady Health Visitor (LHV) or an Auxiliary Nurse
Midwife (ANM). A third doctor will be posted to the FHC in response to
demand for services expected to be generated by the CHW scheme. The doctors
share the supervision work and hold clinics in the subcenters attached to the
PHC. Each subcenter, staffed by an ANM, serves a population of about 10,000.
It is recognized that it is impossible for a paramedical worker to cover a
population of that size and the area covered is divided into an intensive area
(3-4,000 people) and a twilight area where services are available only on
request. The ANM's most important functions concern the health of mothers
and children, delivering babies, providing family planning education and
distributing condoms, supporting CHUWs and dais, and arranging for clinics run
by the PHC doctor and LHV. ANMs and LHVs are allowed to prescribe oral
contraceptives and, once trained, LRVs may insert IUDs. At the PHC, there are
also several unipurpose workers employed by vertical health programs such as
malaria.
2.15      Three schemes introduced in the last five years which affect the
delivery of family welfare services are being phased in gradually throughout
India. The first was the Multipurpose Workers Scheme introduced to provide
an integrated approach to delivering a package of primary health care services
including, inter alia, family planning, MCH and nutrition services to the
community. Under this scheme, comprehensive services are provided by a team
comprised of one male and one female worker at the subcenter level, at a rate
of one subcenter for 5,000 persons to be achieved by the end of the Seventh
Plan (1988). The Multipurpose Worker Female (NPWF) is an ANM whose training
and functions will not change. The former unipurpose male workers will now
become the Multipurpose Worker Male (MPWM). After an 18-month retraining
period, the MPWM will be concerned primarily with detecting malaria cases,
identifying communicable diseases, motivating family planning acceptors and
distributing condoms, identifying cases of malnutrition, environmental sani-
tation, and record-keeping. The supervisory system will also be intensified;
LHVs will be designated Health Supervisor Female (HSF) and male workers such
as Sanitary Inspectors and Family Planning Assistants will become Health
Supervisor Male (HSM).
2.16      In October 1977, the GOI introduced its Rural Health Scheme by
starting the training of CHWs in selected districts. CHWs are appointed by
village communities at an average ratio of I CHW to 1,000 people. The com-
munity is responsible for supervising the CHW's work which is done in his or
her spare time after normal employment. After three months' training at a
nearby PHC, the CHW is given an honorarium of Rs 50 per month and provided
with medical supplies and drugs for a maximum of Rs 600 per year. The CHW
is expected to educate and involve the community in measures of promotive and
preventive health care, treat minor ailments, motivate the community towards
acceptance of family planning, report communicable diseases and vital events,



- 14 -
and be concerned with improving environmental sanitation. The GOI also
announced in 1977 that it would intensify the training of dais. The objective
is to train at least one dai per village of about 1,000 people. The four-week
training period emphasizes hygienic deliveries, the need for immunization,
family planning motivation, and case referral to the subcenter or PHC. The
dai is provided with a delivery kit, replenished as necessary. She is not
paid an honorarium but receives Rs 2 for reporting a birth.  During training,
the dai works closely with the MPWF who works in her village area.
Status of Services
2.17      The six districts of eastern U.P. selected for program intensifica-
tion under the proposed project have poor coverage of services. Each of
the 148 community development blocks in the project area has a PHC staffed
by two doctors. The overall doctor/population ratio is, however, very low.
In 1971, there was one doctor for 9.770 people in the six project districts,
which compared with 1:7,105 for U.P. as a whole and 1:3,140 for India.
Comparable ratios for countries at a similar stage of development include
1:18,160 for Indonesia, 1:9,350 for Bangladesh and 1:3,970 for Pakistan. By
contrast, there was one doctor for every 515 persons in the United States in
1976. With respect to subcenters, 1,355 had been established in the project
districts by March 1979. This yields a ratio of 1:9,810 based on 1971 popula-
tion (the present norm for establishment of subcenters being 1:10,000 based
on 1971 population figures), but the growth of population to mid-1979 eroded
this ratio to 1:11,500. The Fifth Five-Year Plan had aimed at a target of 1
subcenter for 8,000 people by March 1979. Using the 1973 Committee on the
Integration of Health and Family Planning's estimate that an ANM could effec-
tively serve a population of 4,000 at most, about 10 million people in the
six districts are beyond the range of effective MCH services. Of the 148 PHCs,
42 are located in inadequate, rented quarters which fail to meet the lowest
standards of adequate space and hygiene. Only 150 of the 1,355 established
subcenters have a properly constructed building. Equipment at PHCs and
subcenters is, by and large, old, insufficient or broken.
2.18      The status of services in the three selected districts of A.P. is
very similar. The doctor/population ratio for doctors in government service
is 1:17,900 compared with 1:13,000 for the state as a whole. The estimated
overall doctor/population ratio is 1:3,500 for A.P. There are 62 PHCs, each
currently serving an average population of about 93,000 people. The work of
14 PHCs is carried on in rented quarters. Of the 508 established subcenters,
219 have adequate buildings. The subcenter/rural population ratio using 1971
Census data is 1:9,984 and using the mid-1979 projection, 1:11,378. Sub-
centers effectively serve about 35% of the rural population. Their equipment
and vehicles are inadequate and old; of 190 health/family welfare vehicles in
the three districts, 29 have been condemned and 76 are over 10 years old.
Program Support Activities
2.19      The delivery of services is supported primarily by three sets of
activities--information, education and communication (IEC) activities, train-
ing, and research and evaluation. Although since the 1960s the program was



- 15 -
directed towards community extension, the emphasis in IEC work has been on the
use of such mass media as press, radio, films, wall posters and exhibitions.
Controlled by a mass education and media unit in the Department of Family
Welfare national IEC programs have been heavily centralized.  In 1975, in an
effort to redirect activities, the Association of Advertising Agencies of
India (AAAI) was retained to prepare strategies in U.P., A.P. and West Bengal.
Although imaginatively designed, only part of the strategies--particularly
the use of films--was put into effect. This circumstance was due to the weak
infrastructure for IEC activities. Although District Chief Medical Officers
and PHC doctors are responsible for directing such activities, they have not
had any training in this work and specialized staff support is inadequate.
At the PHC level, the Block Extension Educator (BEE) and at district level,
the District Health Information and Education Officer (DHIEO) are supposed
to carry out IEC work under the technical guidance of an Assistant Director,
Evaluation and Information, at state level. In practice, neither educators
nor officers spend sufficient time in their ascribed functions. IEC activities
have contributed to creating a significant degree of awareness of the family
planning program. However, many believe that family planning only consists of
sterilization and much needs to be done to translate awareness into motivation,
for acceptance of contraception.
2.20      Training of staff for the family welfare program is carried out by
medical colleges, paramedical training schools and Regional Health and Family
Welfare Training Centers (RHFWTCs). The training of doctors is carried out
in medical colleges, largely on classical western patterns, with emphasis on
curative medicine. MPWFs receive 18 months' training at basic paramedical
schools. The RHFWTCs are responsible for training district IEC staff, trainers
(PHC doctors) for multipurpose worker training, and short courses for district
medical staff. In the U.P. project area there are medical colleges at Gorakhpur
and Varanasi, a RHFWTC at Varanasi and six basic paramedical schools. The
A.P. project districts are served by a medical college at Tirupathi and one
outside the project area at Kurnool; the RHFWTC serving the area is also at
Kurnool. There are no basic paramedical schools in the project districts.
PHC doctors and LHVs receive instruction at RHFWTCs in order to train multi-
purpose workers, CHWs, and dais at PHCs.
2.21      At state level, responsibility for research and evaluation rests
with a Demographic and Evaluation Cell under the Additional Director for
Family Welfare. These cells collect service statistics relating to MCH
and Family Welfare work from the records of ANMs (or multipurpose workers).
These returns from ANMs are collated by a statistical clerk at PHC level and a
statistical assistant at district level. Data are routinely checked by staff
from the Demographic and Evaluation Cell but little evaluation is carried out.
Other primary health statistics are collected by the same mechanism but
collated at state level by a Vital Statistics Unit. Performance data for all
India are compiled by the Evaluation Division of the Department of Family
Welfare in New Delhi. Most of the program's evaluation is contracted by this
Division to other organizations such as the National Institute of Health and
Family Welfare or the 12 Demographic and Research Centers around the country.
The latter are attached to universities and wholly subsidized by the Government



- 16 -
which has not, in the past, made maximum use of their resources. Important
program evaluation work is carried out by an evaluation unit in the Planning
Commission. Much program evaluation in India is demographic rather than
operational in orientation, but the population centers established under the
first project have made very useful operational evaluation studies.
D. Program Performance
2.22      Even before the Emergency, the family planning program's perform-
ance was showing a gradual upward trend. In 1973-74, 14.9% of eligible
couples were effectively protected, a measure which takes into account the
varying effectiveness of contraceptive methods. Two years later, it had
risen to 17.2% and in 1976-77 jumped to 23.9% after the intensive drive.
Since then there was a slight decline to 22.8% in 1978-79, but, by June 1979,
the percentage of couples effectively protected had risen to 23.9%. This
compares with 27% in the Philippines, 16% in Bangladesh and 18% in Indonesia. 1/
Program progress has, however, been cyclical in nature, swinging from peaks
during which particular methods have received attention to troughs in which the
reaction to these methods has become apparent. With vasectomy, for example,
2.6 million operations were performed in 1972-73 when the special camp approach
was tried on a massive scale. Loss of impetus and administrative shortcomings
produced a slump in the following year when only 400,000 vasectomies were
reported. The decline between 1976-77 (the Emergency year) and 1977-78 from
6.2 million vasectomies to 190,000 was even more dramatic. The peak year for
IUD insertion, 1966-67, when 900,000 acceptances were recorded, has never been
matched. With the exception of 1976-77, the number of tubectomies has risen
gradually and even after the intensive drive of that year, the fall-off, from
2.1 million to 736,000 cases, was not as great as that of vasectomy. In
1978-79 there were estimated to be 3.36 million users of condoms--distributed
free through clinics or at nominal cost through retail outlets--a figure
slightly below the 3.69 million recorded in 1976-77. In February 1979, 89.3%
of the couples effectively protected were protected by sterilization, 4.0% by
IUDs and 6.7% by conventional contraceptives (mainly condoms).
2.23      Oral contraceptives have thus far been available only on a very
limited scale in pilot programs. In 1978-79, (11 months) the number of
year-round users, calculated from the number of cycles distributed, was
estimated at only 91,000 nationwide. Since the passage of the Medical
Termination of Pregnancy Act in 1972, considerable care has been exercised
in the approval of facilities and staff licensed to perform abortions. In
1978-79, 313,000 abortions had been performed compared with 247,000 in the
previous year. Estimates of the number of illegal abortions range from 2 to
4 million annually.
2.24      Not unexpectedly in a country as large and diverse as that of India,
there are considerable variations in inter-state family planning performance.
From the 23.97% all-India average of couples effectively protected in June
1/   Statistics for Bangladesh and the Philippines from survey data; for
Indonesia from program data.



- 17 -
1979, the range in the major states was from 34.1% in Maharashtra and 30.5% in
Haryana to 12.2% in Bihar and 11.4% in U.P. The comparable figure for A.P.
was 26.2%. Criticism of program performance results, in part, from the
program's failure to achieve its targets or "expected levels of performance"
(as they were termed since April 1977 for IUDs and conventional contraceptives,
and subsequently for sterilizations). The family planning targets have been
predicated on the basis of targeted reductions in the all-India birth rate.
As noted above (para 2.04), the demographic goals on which the targets have
been premised have had to be continuously revised downwards. Nortman has
pointed out with specific reference to Indian target setting that "too great a
disparity between aspiration and achievement is frustrating and demoralizing."
1/ Tension has been created between policy-makers and administrators and the
result has been urgent, short-term solutions to a problem which can be
resolved only in the long-term. Adherence to the goal of reducing the birth
rate to 30 per 1,000 by 1983 implies a 67% increase in contraceptive use over
five years, a task Nortman describes as of "extraordinary magnitude." A level
of 2 million equivalent sterilizations per year is required merely to keep the
birth rate from rising; in 1978-79, this level was 1.9 million (Table 4).
Performance in U.P. and A.P.
2.25      Of the 15 most populated states, U.P. has the lowest percentage of
couples effectively protected--11.4% in June 1979. Of these, 80% were pro-
tected by sterilization, 14% were protected by IUDs, and 6% by other methods
(mainly condoms). U.P.'s performance in family planning has fluctuated with
national performance. In 1976-77, 927,500 equivalent sterilizations were
recorded; in the following year, only 70,362. Performance doubled last year
to 134,000. U.P. was particularly affected by the intensive drive in 1976-77.
In that year 690,000 vasectomies and 148,000 tubectomies were performed; the
corresponding figures for 1977-78 were 1,290 and 12,200 and, for 1978-79,
4,489 and 24,300 respectively. IUD acceptors have shown a gradual upward
trend since the introduction of this method in 1965-66 and reached their
highest peak last year. Of the estimated 1 million couples effectively
protected by IUDs in India in June 1979, about 30% are attributed to the U.P.
program. Legal abortions have also risen steadily from 350 in 1972-73 to
65,300 in 1978-79. Performance in the six districts reflects that of the
state as a whole with the percentage of couples effectively protected ranging
from 14.5% (Mirzapur District) to 7.2% (Basti District).
2.26      Performance in A.P. has been substantially better, 26.2% of eligible
couples being effectively protected. Of these couples, about 98% were pro-
tected by sterilization and the rest by IUDs and other methods. Here the
effects of the intensive drive were less marked. By February 1979, A.P. had
achieved 58.5% of its expected level of sterilization performance for 1978-79,
whereas U.P. had achieved only 3.8%. Over the last six years, A.P. has
consistently ranked seventh of the major states in the percentage of couples
effectively protected. Although the number of vasectomies in 1978-79 (47,000)
is well below that of 1976-77 (572,000) the number of tubectomies was higher
last year than in any previous year, 1976-77 excepted. The number of IUD

- 18 -
insertions has fluctuated markedly since 1965-66, showing an upward trend since
1973-74 to a total of 192,000 last year. Condoms distributed without cost
have dropped severely from a peak of an estimated 569,500 users in 1974-75 to
29,000 in 1978-79. Measured in terms of equivalent sterilizations, performance
in A.P. is well above the pre-Emergency levels but lower than the peak years
1968-69 to 1972-73. Here, as in U.P., there is clear evidence of rising
demand for female contraceptives and a marked fall in demand for contraception
from males. The demand for abortions, however, appears to have levelled off
at about 11,000 annually over the last three years. In the three project
districts, the percentage of couples effectively protected varies from 30.6%
in Cuddapah District to 23.1% in Ananthpur District. In all three districts
performance was better in 1978-79 than in the previous five years, 1976-77
excepted. The choice of methods in the three districts shows the same charac-
teristics as that of the state as a whole.
MCH Performance
2.27      With respect to MCH services, there are six programs for which
official targets are set annually: (a) tetanus toxoid immunization (TT) for
expectant mothers, (b) diphtheria, whooping cough and tetanus immunization
(DPT) for children aged 0-2 years, (c) diphtheria and tetanus immunization
(DT) for children aged 2-11 years, (d) prophylaxis against nutritional anemia
among mothers, (e) prophylaxis against nutritional anemia among children, and
(f) prophylaxis against blindness among children due to vitamin "A" deficiency.
For India as a whole, progress in all these programs has been significant.
Between 1975-76 and 1977-78, the annual number of beneficiaries for all six
programs combined increased nationwide from 16.8 to 44.1 million. The increase
in U.P. was from 1.1 to 3.4 million beneficiaries and in A.P. from 1.6 to 3.3
million. In spite of this progress, coverage is still very limited. Thus,
for example, in the six U.P. districts included in the First Population
Project, the percentage of children with immunization against DPT by the end
of 1977-78 was only 6.6%. The corresponding percentage for DT was 6.2%.
2.28      An important indicator of the status of MCH services is the percent-
age of deliveries conducted by trained personnel (including trained dais).
For A.P., this amounted to about 11.5% in 1975-76, the latest year available.
For the combined six U.P. districts included in the First Population Project,
it amounted to 11% in the same year (but had climbed to 20.7% by 1977-78).
The percentage of pregnant women who registered with health staff in A.P. in
1975-76 amounted to 38%. For the six U.P. districts mentioned above, in the
same year, it reached 9.8% (and was up to 23.9% in 1977-78).  These figures
indicate that, despite about a 200% increase in U.P. and about a 100% increase
in A.P. in TT and DPT immunizations over the past four years, MCH coverage in
the sates to be included in this proposed project is far from satisfactory.
The same situation also prevails in most of the rest of the country.
E. Current National Policy
2.29      Following the elections of March 1977, the Government's priority
was to dispel concerns about the family planning program built up prior
to that date, establish its commitment to the program, and evaluate



- 19 -
its policy. The steps taken have been enumerated in para 2.10 above. In
essence, the Government's strategy has been to exert steady pressure for the
provision of integrated health and family planning services whilst increasing
public support for a voluntary program to reduce fertility. The Government
has tried to avoid major pushes that cannot be sustained and which, quite
apart from their political implications, have resulted in the past in damaging
cycles in program performance. In addition, the Government is concerned with
directing the program towards underserved groups, particularly in rural areas.
Although voluntary sterilization will be retained as a terminal method sug-
gested for families with three or more children, greater emphasis will be
placed on spacing methods, including IUDs and oral contraceptives. There is
also evidence that the Government is turning away from the monolithic, central-
ized program with assistance based on rigid input/population ratios to one
in which resources are channelled to the areas now poorly served by family
welfare services and where fertility and mortality remain at comparatively
high levels. Increasing emphasis is being placed on state initiatives.
The past year's performance holds out the hope that the demand for family
planning services and the capacity to deliver these services is returning
to the level of pre-Emergency years. This reversion would provide a stable
base on which to build an effective program and so make progress in lowering
fertility and mortality levels.
F.  Program Constraints and Weaknesses
2.30      Despite limitations induced  by low levels of income, literacy, and
industrialization, and high levels of infant and child mortality, the perfor-
mance of the India program has not been as poor as many analysts have suggested.
Fertility declined by 16% during the period 1965-75, one of the larger declines
among countries with a similar socio-economic background. The effectiveness
of expenditure in the Indian program was at least average for countries in
this region as suggested by an analysis of average annual expenditures on
family planning programs during the period 1972-76, and the percentage of
married couples of reproductive age practicing contraception by 1977. The
program, however, fell short of the expectations. If there is to be sustained
growth, the program's capacity to deliver good quality family welfare services
must be improved and expanded. In order to ensure effective growth, the
following weaknesses and constraints need to be removed:
(a) Services. Coverage for MCH services is inadequate, with,
at most, services available to 25% of the rural population.
Peripheral facilities are often in rented, inadequate premises
which are unattractive. Inadequate public transportation and
the absence or inadequacy of rural roads curtail the acces-
sibility of the community to the PHC or subcenter. Equipment
is old and inadequate, as are vehicles;
(b) Staff. Apart from lady doctors, staff is not generally in short
supply at the present ratios laid down by center and state govern-
ments, but these are inadequate to provide effective service
coverage. There are serious problems of staff motivation and



- 20 -
orientation. The training of doctors is strongly oriented
towards curative medicine with little, if any, attention
to preventive and community medicine and management. Paramedical
staff training tends to be mechanical. In U.P., ANM's have had to
be recruited from Kerala because of local attitudes which regard
nursing as a less than desirable profession and low educational
standards among the classes who have not such attitudes;
(c) Support strategies. Activities aimed at motivating potential
acceptors of family planning services and informing communities
about the benefits of family welfare have lost direct contact
with the people. They have relied mainly on the use of mass
media, even in situations where the reach of media was limited
to, in the case of U.P., 12% of the population. Although ANMs
and BEEs were considered to be the principal agents of the pro-
gram's IEC activities, they receive little or no training and
no direction. Not even in the state health and family welfare
services are the new Government policies and programs, which
should do much to redress these deficiencies, fully understood;
this is even more true of other state departments w:Lth whom there
is little cooperation and less coordination;
(d) Administration. The managers of the program and the PHC doctor,
District Chief Medical Officer and State Directorate staff have
had no special training in management and their ability to direct,
coordinate and supervise the planning and delivery of services is
less than adequate.   These circumstances are also in part due to
an overly-centralized organizational structure, especially in U.P.,
which inhibits consultation and decision-making at the appropriate
levels. With organizational reform, the introduction of the Multi-
purpose Workers Scheme and its reassertion as a firm Government
policy, there is much better integration between family planning
and health services than previously, but improved management,
particularly at district and PHC levels would speed up the process.
Consultation between the Directorate of Health and Family Welfare
and other Government departments is minimal;
(e) Planning. In the past, there has been little, effective planning
of family welfare programs. Although states are responsible for
implementation, the center's sponsorship and 100% financial support
often resulted in weak state commitment, poor integration of state
and center funds in providing facilities, and the inhibition of the
integration of family planning and health services. Performance
targets do not adequately take account of availability or quality
of services. The professional ability to plan and develop programs
on a rational basis needs to be strengthened. Programs tend to be
developed intuitively or on the basis of political and/or adminis-
trative pressures. Until recently, MCH services were given very low
priority vis-a-vis family planning work; and



- 21 -
(f) Evaluation and research. Service statistics are collected and
published in a timely fashion but feedback to district and block
workers is negligible. There is little analysis except to cal-
culate how far requested levels of performance have been achieved;
reporting and evaluation are essentially quantitative in character.
India has considerable resources for research and the resultant
literature regarding the country's family planning policy and
program is vast. Such research has, however, largely been the
preserve of academics. The program has not been able to trans-
late research findings into operational terms adequately.
In order to remove these constraints, the rate of expenditure on the program
to provide a wider and more effective program coverage is being accelerated
by the GOI. Outlays for the health and family welfare sector for the period
1978-83 are planned about 78% higher than those planned for the period 1974-
79. Efforts are being made to seek a substantial increase in external assis-
tance for this sector.
G. External Assistance
2.31      The earliest forms of foreign assistance to the program, fellowships
and consultants, have been provided by the Ford Foundation and the Population
Council since 1964. In that year India requested the United Nations to send
an advisory mission on family planning and an evaluation mission was mounted
in 1965. Towards the end of the 1960s, the annual population growth rate of
2.5% and the addition of some 13 million people annually to its population were
matters of serious concern to the Government in relation to its socio-economic
development programs. The Government enlisted support from bilateral sources--
the Governments of Denmark, Japan, Sweden and the United States--for the pro-
vision of commodities. The principal criteria in the acceptance of this aid
was the unavailability of commodities--such as condoms, printing presses and
audio-visual equipment--in India. Some assistance from multilateral sources--
experts, equipment, fellowships--was also provided. In March 1969, a second
United Nations mission provided an external review and evaluation of the
program.
2.32      In November 1969, at the request of members of the Aid Consortium,
the Bank organized a special meeting in Stockholm for representatives of the
Consortium countries and of the GOI to consider the India program. In parti-
cular, the United Nations' report evaluating India's family planning effort
was discussed. In a series of informal discussions which took place in the
preceding months the donors had examined the need for and extent to which
foreign assistance could assist the program. The Government's view expressed
at the Stockholm meeting was that "...the import requirements of the program
are marginal and in this sense, the family planning program needs very little
straight foreign exchange support. Any assistance from abroad will, therefore,
need to finance local currency which can be used for augmenting the allocation
of Rs 300 crores for the program in the Fourth Plan. It also follows that
such assistance should in principle be an add-on to the normal forms of aid
available to India and unless this is so, external assistance cannot in real



- 22 -
terms supplement domestic resources." 1/ Although it was not a pledging
meeting, several donors present, including the Bank, gave notice that they
were interested in assisting the India program.
2.33      External assistance to the program continued throughout the 1970s
although direct assistance provided by the U.S. Agency for International
Development (USAID), which had amounted to some US$30 million by 1972, was
terminated in 1973.  In June 1972, an agreement was signed between the GOI and
the states of U.P. and Mysore (now Karnataka) on the one hand and Inter-
national Development Association (IDA) and Swedish International Development
Authority (SIDA) on the other hand, for a project with a total cost of US$31.8
million equivalent (see Section III below). In 1974, the Government signed an
agreement with the United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA) under
which the UNFPA committed US$38 million to the program for five years. The
assistance covers some thirty projects encompassing activities such as support
for the expansion of the sterilization program (US$15.0 million), multipurpose
workers training program (US$8.6 million), training of dais (US$7.1 million),
appointment of ANMs and female health workers (US$4.6 million) and
strengthening field-level infrastructure (US$2.7 million). Other United
Nations agencies such as UNICEF, WHO, ILO and UNDP assist in the implementa-
tion of some of these projects. By December 31, 1978, US$32.4 million had
been utilized. Support has also been forthcoming from bilateral agencies such
as SIDA (condoms), the British Overseas Development Administration (ODA)
(improvement of sterilization facilities), Norwegian Agency of International
Development (NORAD) (hospital postpartum program), Danish Agency for Inter-
national Development (DANIDA) (building for the National Institute of Health
and Family Welfare and equipment for drug research) and Federal Republic of
Germany's Kreditanstalt (KFW) (printing equipment and raw film stock).
Non-governmental assistance has been provided by a number of agencies,
including the International Planned Parenthood Federation which supports the
activities of the Family Planning Association of India.
2.34      In 1978, the Government made approaches to several international
agencies for assistance in financing family welfare activities under the Sixth
Plan (1978-83). The Bank, SIDA, UNFPA, DANIDA and the ODM were requested to
assist in the development of the family welfare program in selected districts
of selected states. Project preparation is underway in U.P. and A.P. (IBRD
and SIDA), Rajasthan and Bihar (UNFPA), Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu (DANIDA)
and Orissa (ODM). Discussions on possible assistance from USAID have just
started. The UNFPA sent a basic,population needs assessment mission to India
in November 1978 and, as a result, proposes to provide grants amounting to
US$100 million equivalent over the period 1980-84. Of this, US$48 million
would be made available for general budget support for agreed projects at
national level, US$32 million for the area-specific projects in Rajasthan and
Bihar, US$10 million for assistance to non-governmental activities, and US$10
million would be held as an unprogrammed reserve.

III. FIRST POPULATION PROJECT
3.01      Following the Consortium Meeting in November 1969, the Government
requested the Bank to assist in the development of a comprehensive demonstra-
tion program in selected districts of U.P. and Mysore (now Karnataka) states
covering a population of some 20 million. These states were selected because
they reflected different levels of socio-economic development. In contrast
to most multilateral and bilateral assistance which had been providing one or
two program inputs, the Bank-assisted project was designed to provide a variety
of inputs to the program in a specific geographical area. The project was
appraised in 1971 and agreements with the GOI, U.P. and Mysore, as well as
the Kingdom of Sweden, were signed in June 1972. IDA made available a credit
of US$21.2 million and SIDA a grant of US$10.6 million to cover project costs.
A. Project Description
3.02      The first population project is an experimental demonstration proj-
ect intended to test the efficacy of various program inputs, and to evolve,
through experimentation, ways and means for attaining better performance of
the national program to reduce the rate of population growth. The Govern-
ment's planned primary health service pattern was only partially complete in
the selected districts due to shortage of staff and facilities. The project
objective was to complete the health infrastructure and provide training
facilities and equipment to implement the program. Additional inputs for an
urban program, intensive rural program and supplementary nutrition program
were provided to assess their impact on fertility decline within the existing
socio-economic conditions. Population centers in each of the two state
capitals, Lucknow and Bangalore, were established to refine experiment design,
develop a management information and evaluation system (MIES), evaluate
performance and recommend changes in the program for improving performance.
The project also supported development of health management units at the
Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, and Administrative Staff College
of India, Hyderabad. These units assisted the state governments, parti-
cularly the population centers, in research and management systems design
as well as management training. Project inputs included the construction
and equipment of facilities, including inter alia, paramedical training
schools, the provision of transport, equipment, technical assistance for
overseas training, and the provision of staff salaries, maintenance and
commodities which constituted the incremental costs of supplementing the
Government's program.
3.03      The project became effective on May 17, 1973.  Implementation of
project infrastructure proceeded steadily. Approximately 1,400 of a total
1,545 buildings were completed by January 1976, a period of 2-1/2 years.
The need to strengthen the professional supervision of civil works was iden-
tified for future projects. Staffing patterns were substantially completed
and the necessary vehicles were procured by the end of 1976. After some
initial staffing problems, the population centers gradually built up an
institutional capability. Early implementation problems related to the



- 24 -
relationships among the various project units, the Management Institutes and
state Governments were resolved, and there is now complete, functional inte-
gration of the project units with the ongoing state health and family welfare
programs.
3.04      In 1976-77, just as the project infrastructure was completed,
and the supporting institutes were becoming functionally effective, intensive
family planning drives were launched during the Emergency. These drives
affected the research work and experimental strategies, masking the result
of the project inputs and inhibiting evaluation. The project. was, therefore,
extended by two years to June 30, 1980. By December 31, 1979, US$20.2
million (95.3%) of the IDA credit and US$10.1 million (95.3%) of the SIDA
grant had been disbursed.
B. Assessment of the Project
3.05      The discussions on the project began in 1969 and it was appraised
in May 1972. The intervening years since have seen marked changes in both
conceptual basis (from narrow family planning programs to multi-sectoral popu-
lation activities characteristic of the current state of wisdom in the field)
and operational conditions (the drives during the Emergency). These provide
the broad contextual background in which the project was implemented.
C. Service Levels Achieved
3.06      Since the project is not complete and a project evaluation is cur-
rently in progress, it is difficult to estimate the impact of the project on
mortality and fertility rates.  An analysis of available service statistics
suggests:
a.   Family planning services in U.P.  During the 10-month period
April 1978 to January 1979, project districts (11.4% of state
population) accounted for 16.8% of sterilizations, 19% of IUDs
and 15.4% of other methods in the whole state, nearly 50%
higher than non-project districts. Since 1977, the rate of
medical terminations of pregnancy per 1,000 population is
three times that of non-project districts. During the five-year
period 1974-79, the project districts had 30% higher performance
in terms of equivalent sterilizations compared to socio-
economically matching districts;
b.   MCH services in U.P.  In terms of percentages of antenatal
women registered and percentage of deliveries conducted by
trained staff during 1977-78, the project districts averaged
50% to 100% more (roughly 20% to 30% of all pregnant women
were covered) compared to matching districts. The target
achievements for TT, DPT and DT from 1974-75 to 1977-78
increased from 21.5% to 87.2%, 6% to 151.5%, and 20.5% to



- 25 -
111.1% respectively as compared to an increase from 13.1% to
58.6%, 6.4% to 109.2% and 24.0% to 77.8% in the whole state.
Thus in 1977-78 the target achievements were 40% to 50%
higher in project districts;
c.   Family planning services in Karnataka.  The project areas
have consistently increased their share in state performance
in terms of acceptance of family planning methods as measured
by equivalent sterilizations. During the ten-month period
of April 1978 to January 1979, project areas, constituting
31.4% of population and targets, accounted for about 39.0%
of the state's total performance, whereas in 1973-74, the
project areas accounted for 31.7% of the state's performance;
and
d.   MCH services in Karnataka.  During the period April 1977 to
December 1978, the project areas, constituting 31.4% of the
state's population, contributed about the same for DPT and
DT immunizations and 42.7% for TT immunization to the perform-
ance in the whole state.
3.07      Utilization of beds in maternity homes in urban areas, annexes to
district hospitals, and selected PHCs has consistently improved over time.
However, it continues to remain low for the 24-bed annexes to PHCs.  Investiga-
tions into causes of low utilization have suggested the need for changes in
working methodology, sorting out problems of organizational control and the
need for popularization of these annexes, and steps have been taken to this
effect.
D. Other Project Programs
3.08      Although the nutrition component in U.P. faced several difficulties,
the nutrition component in Karnataka showed that it is feasible to establish
an organization to distribute supplementary food in the context of the delivery
of family welfare services, as about 95% of target beneficiaries attended
distribution centers for more than 90% of distribution days. The most recent
survey reports prepared by the National Institution of Nutrition in Hyderabad,
showed, however, that despite the increase in the upper age limit of the child
target group (from 24 to 60 months), sharing of food supplement continued in
75% of the households covered. Improvements in nutritional status have been
negligible, with no impact on the growth status of beneficiary children. Two
of the more important conclusions of a mid-term review in Janaury 1976 were
that the replicability of supplementary feeding on a national scale was
suspect on grounds of impact and cost (US$0.15 per week of supplementary food
for a child less than four years). The review also decided that five years
was too short a period to determine whether a lowering of infant mortality
through improved nutrition led to a lowering of fertility. There has been
evidence that special nutrition education mobile teams have had an impact on
dietary habits; the experiment has not been concluded but here again repli-
cability is doubtful due to cost considerations.



- 26 -
3.09      Two mobile teams in each of the four intensive districts were pro-
vided for intensive IEC and service activities. Difficulties were experienced
in staffing and operating these teams and performance, cost and operational
considerations led to their discontinuation. Mobile training teams were able
to provide inservice training to the target groups, despite the program's
additional massive training efforts to introduce multipurpose workers and CHW
schemes. Attempts continue to be made to improve quality of training.
3.10      The project is unique in that it permitted experimentation with
additional inputs as well as in routine program operations, within its natural
setting unlike pilot experiments which operate in an independent organizational
environmeat. In Karnataka, five different strategies are being tried,
including the involvement of a voluntary agency in managing the program in a
PHC, introducing new management methods at PHCs, delegating more responsi-
bilities to paramedical staff, involving non-health Government agencies, and
testing the effect of non-cash incentives. In addition, a few combinations of
these strategies are also being tested. In U.P., experiments were made in the
area of dai training, intensification of condom distribution in rural areas,
data collection of vital events, and the involvement of traditional medical
practitioners. While the estimate of quantitative impact for most of these
program changes is not fully available, valuable lessons have already been
learned in terms of process dynamics. These lessons include an appreciation
for required changes in planning and evaluation, better activity planning at
the periphery (made difficult by other organizational constraints) and need
for greater managerial capability in the area of human resources.
3.11      Population centers took longer to establish an institutional capabil-
ity than envisaged, thus providing a better;'perspective of the time element in
the maturing process of an institution (role definition, goal clarification,
establishment of sound personnel practices and, above all, an institutional
culture). In spite of these difficulties, the population centers designed and
implemented a number of baseline surveys, operational research programs and
service statistics systems. They have produced a substantial amount of infor-
mation on program operations as evidenced by newsletters, reports and seminars.
The exercise of their monitoring functions has had an important impact on
performance. In taking over the two centers rather than allowing them to
become units of the central Government, the states have recognized the value
of an operational research unit working closely with program administrators.
3.12      Many observers and evaluation missions have suggested better organi-
zation and management as offering the best potential for improving the Indian
program. For the first time since the program's inception, attention was paid
to the management aspects of the program by affiliating two management insti-
tutes with the program. Training, better supervision, improved activity
planning and increased commitment were identified as having a marked effect on
program performance. Studies were carried out for improving supplies of drugs
and medicines, reorganization at district levels, and management of urban
programs. In particular, the following elements of management assistance were
found useful and requiring further support by the program administrators:



- 27 -
a.   MIES simplifies record keeping, saves time, establishes
criteria for judging performance of service units and
provides feedback to program administrators. Similar but
separate systems were established for each of the states;
these are now being merged. The new system, which includes
all primary health services data, will be tried out at
district level before being adopted for the whole state;
b.   Management training to improve capabilities of PHCs and
district level medical officers will be extended to cover
the entire project area; and
c.   Management consultant services (never previously used by
state governments) will be used to concentrate on specific
program problems.
3.13      Several lessons have been learned about the processes of project
and program implementation:
a.   Project management was established with little respect
for Indian administrative practice. A separate project
implementation structure under a Project Governing Board
was set up and was, in the initial stage, distinct from
program management. The separate structure was useful in
making the project inputs available for a considerable
extension of program services and in general keeping the
project before the attention of the highest level of state
Government. However, no mechanism existed by which
feedback could be channeled into the routine state programs.
Close liaison with state authorities was forged only after
considerable time and effort;
b.   Better organization and improvement of management continue to
offer possibilities for program improvement. Within overall
guidelines relating to policy, strategies, aud financial
restraints, program planning should be decentralized to
state and district levels. The divisional level structure
needs to be strengthened and district level organization needs
to be rationalized. Better activity planning, supervision,
monitoring and feedback are required to improve performance
of service units and field staff;
c.   Sevice outreach constraints encountered include oversize
catchment areas for subcenters, limited staff mobility
and shortage of lady medical officers; and
d.   While improvements in quantity and quality of services will
result in improving performance, more emphasis is needed on
demand generation activities. With hindsight, it was a
mistake to anticipate that the program's routine IEC activ-
ities would be adequate. Carefully conceived strategies of
local applications should have been devised and community



- 28 -
involvement sought to generate demand for services. An
improvement in general socio-economic conditions will affect
both determinants of fertility and ability to provide ser-
vices and, therefore, linkages should be established with
such developmental programs.
IV. THE PROJECT
A. Project Concept, Objectives and Design
4.01      The project has been designed by the GOI as part of the development
of its family welfare structure and strategy model which is expected to be in
position throughout India by the end of the Seventh Five-Year Plan (1988). It
is part of an acceleration in program development targeted towards 32 districts
in seven states, selected according to criteria which indicate their relative
backwardness in terms of socio-economic development, health services infra-
structure, and high fertility and mortality levels. For these area-specific
programs, the GOI has sought external assistance from the UNFPA for Rajasthan
and Bihar, from DANIDA for Tamil Nadu and Madhya Pradesh, from the ODA
for Orissa, and from IDA and SIDA for U.P. and A.P.
4.02      The project is based on the GOI's long experience and mixed success
with its family planning program, including that derived from implementation
of the first population project referred to in para. 3.13. The project wil'l
have as major objectives the lowering of infant and child mortality, the
improvement of the health status of mothers and children, and the lowering of
fertility.
4.03      Principles to be followed in the delivery of the family planning
aspects of the family welfare program are to be found in the Government's
policy statement of June 1977 (see Annex 1) and the Interim Report of the
Planning Commission's Working Group on Population Policy issued in March 1979.
They include:
a.   Family planning will be an integral part of a program embracing
all aspects of family welfare, particularly those which are
designed to protect and promote the health of mothers and
children;
b.   Efforts will be entirely voluntary in respect of contraceptive
acceptance;
c.   All methods of contraception, both male and female, will be
promoted with equal emphasis and it will be left to every
couple to decide which method of contraception, if any,
it would wish to adopt; and
d.   The family welfare program will be primarily directed
towards those currently underserved, particularly in the
rural areas.



- 29 -
The project will lend support to the accelerated implementation in the project
districts of the integrated national family welfare program. The activities
to be supported for this purpose are outlined in a document prepared by the
Ministry of Health for area programs. This model plan covers the intensity of
services to be provided and levels of facilities and staff required. It also
outlines the objectives and strategies of support activities such as training,
information, education and communication, and monitoring and evaluation.
4.04      The service delivery system envisaged for primary health care is
as follows: one dai and one CHW per 1,000 population are to provide services
at the village level (see para. 2.16). A health sub-center is to be
established per population of 5,000 staffed by a MPWF and a MPWM. The MPWF
provides MCH and family planning services and nutrition education while the
MPWM treats minor ailments, promotes hygiene and sanitation and provides
family planning services. Four MFWFs and four MPWMs are supervised by a
female and a male health supervisor respectively. The organizational base for
the primary health care system continues to be the PHC where curative services
are provided and paramedical staff is trained (see para. 2.14). The referral
facilities are to be provided by 25% of upgraded PHCs which will have 30 beds
each, and staff including specialists such as pediatricians and obstetricians/
gynecologists. More specialized referral facilities are provided by district
hospitals and medical college hospitals. The urban areas are served by
centers providing MCH and family welfare services. The structure of the
service delivery system envisaged is sound in design and similar to those
being developed in other countries in the region, such as Thailand and the
Philippines. While the peripheral levels of staffing specified in the above
guidelines are adequate, a PHC can effectively serve only about 50,000,
or about half of its present population. However, the expansion of the
number of PHCs is constrained for the time being by lack of resources.
4.05      Within the framework of the guidelines, the project has been designed
by task forces established in U.P. and A.P., respectively. The project proposals
were prepared after extensive discussions with Government officials, community
leaders and staff responsible for the delivery of family welfare services. For
the first time within the official program, an attempt has been made to respond
to the needs of the program in a district context without, however, losing
sight of the need for state and national replicability. The design is based
on five premises. Firstly, that increased family planning acceptance will
be possible only through the development of a variety of activities which
together promote an improvement in the socio-economic environment of the
population below the absolute poverty income level, which in 1977 constituted
47% of the urban and 52% of the rural population of India. Secondly, a signi-
ficant decrease in fertility is not attainable in the short-run over a period
of, say, five years. Thirdly, that family planning acceptance is intimately
related to impraved family health, particularly improvement in the health of
mothers and small children. Fourthly, that in seeking to attain both improved
family health and increased family planning acceptance, it is necessary to
improve the quality and utilization of existing basic health/family welfare
services and extend their currently limited coverage. And fifthly, that
strengthening and expanding service infrastructures are not, of themselves,
sufficient but need to be supported by communities themselves which have been



- 30 -
provided with the necessary information and ability to make the maximum use
of it. The project design provides linkages as appropriate and possible with
other development activities which also have a bearing on fertility levels,
for example the national adult education program.
4.06      The lack of an effective vital registration system precludes a
satisfactory assessment of current vital rates and inhibits forecasting.
The estimation of changes in MCH coverage and contraceptive acceptance in
the project districts, up to and by the end of the five-year implementation
period, also poses serious problems caused by inadequate data and unreliable
methodology. However, estimates of the order of magnitude of expected changes
have been prepared (para. 7.03). Scanty data on utilization of facilities, in
both the family planning and MCH fields, also restrict the establishment of
reliable quantitative performance objectives. Although there is a perceived
underutilization of facilities, such as PHCs and subcenters, it is difficult
to assess the extent of underutilization because it depends on the one hand on
the characteristics of the clientele, and on the other hand on a multitude of
program variables, which affect the performance of individual staff. Consider-
able care needs to be exercised in setting performance objectives, because,
as noted above in para. 2.25, the setting of unrealistic targets has had an
adverse effect on program performance. Instead of being used as management
tools, they have often--and particularly during the Emergency period--been
used to hold individuals accountable for obtaining large numbers of family
planning acceptors. Immediately after coming to power in 1977, the Janata
Party Government abolished targets for these reasons. Later, however, they
were reinstated as "expected levels of achievement." An important project
activity will be to undertake baseline surveys and establish a system which
can set objectives. These objectives will be modified in the light of results
of surveys and program experience.
4.07      Improved coverage and quality of services, and efficiency of re-
source use, all necessary to achieve the project objectives, can be realized
through the following efforts:
(a) More staff and facilities should be provided and staff
mobility should be improved;
(b) Improved training procedures in professional skills
should be developed and utilized for training medical
and paramedical staff;.
(c) IEC activities should be decentralized, improved and
expanded to support the integrated nature of the program
and reinforce demand for both MCH/family planning services;
(d) Community involvement should be an important feature in
program development; a sequence of activities including
orientation training camps, advisory committees, and more
active participation in program activities are envisaged to
generate and maintain community involvement;
(e) Other departments of Government, communities and local
organizations should be involved in the program through
suitable organizational structures and activity linkages;



- 31 -
(f) Within overall guidelines relating to policy, strategies
and financial restraints, program planning should be
decentralized to state and district levels; and
(g) Program management should be improved by better activity
planning, supervision, monitoring and feedback of perfor-
mance statistics, and the program should be well coordinated.
4.08      The project, for which a five-year period is proposed, will have
five major functional components corresponding with the five major areas
of the program: (a) service delivery; (b) training; (c) IEC activities;
(d) monitoring and evaluation and operational research; and (e) program and
project management. It also provides support for a number of innovative
activities.

C. Detailed Project Description
Service Delivery
4.10      In order to bring basic health/family welfare services within the
reach of 70% of the rural population of the project districts (compared with
35% at present), a subcenter staffed by one MPWF and one MPWM will be estab-
lished at a ratio of one to 5,000 people. Chittoor district in A.P. has been
brought into the MPW scheme; none of the U.P. project districts has been
covered. The scheme will be introduced into all the project districts. The
increase in intensity of services and conversion to the Multipurpose Workers



- 34 -
Scheme will mean that, in addition to converting the appropriate existing
staff, the number of MPWFs will need to be doubled, one-third more MPWMs will
be required, and the supervisory staff for females increased by about 65% and
for males by about 35%.
4.11      In U.P., of the 3,130 MPWFs required, 1,355 will be available at the
start of the project leaving 1,775 to be posted during the project. For A.P.,
557 MPWFs need to be recruited, trained and posted to achieve the necessary
strength of 1,195. In both states, the deficits will be made up by local
training in the project districts, to avoid draining staff from other dis-
tricts. The position with regard to MPWMs is less serious; 447 are needed in
A.P. and 902 in U.P. There is an overall surplus of 1,087 HSM in U.P., many
of whom came from the eastern part of the state and who would not object to
transfers to their home areas to work as MPWMs, despite a downgrading of post
(but not salary). In A.P., the 447 MPWMs required will be trained and posted
during the project period; state laws in A.P. do not allow the transfer of
staff between the six administrative regions into which the state is divided.
4.12      To further extend the availability of primary health services, all
districts will be covered by the CHW and dai schemes immediately. In U.P.
15,660 CHW would be required, of whom 9,855 are already, trained and in
position, leaving 5,805 to be selected and trained. There are already, 2,571
CHWs in the A.P. districts and a further 3,411 need to be selected and trained.
Dais are also being recruited on the same scale as CHWs. In U.P. districts
considerable progress has been made in recruiting and training dais; of the
15,660 needed only 2,801 remain to be trained. Only 1,200 dais have been
trained in A.P. districts leaving 4,782 to be recruited and trained.
4.13      CHWs are recruited by the community to which they belong and are not
subject to supervision by the Multipurpose Workers of the Government program.
This policy has been adopted deliberately to foster community involvement
which, inter alia, emphasizes a bottom-up rather than a top-down approach,
encouraging the need to meet local problems with local solutions. CHWs are,
however, supported by the staff of the family welfare program and have regular
contacts with them. The scheme was started in October 1977 and two evaluations
were made in mid-1978, although it was recognized that this was too early to
be of much operational use. Problems encountered in the scheme relate to the
difficulty of identifying a group from whom the CHWs can be selected and to
whom they can be made responsible. In many areas, the scheme was seen as a
response to unemployment and mainly unemployed males were selected. There is
little doubt, however, that the Government initiative is an important one in
that it directs attention to the needs of rural areas, lessens the dependence
for health care on professionals and provides a basis on which to build
community involvement activities.
4.14      A training program for dais was initiated as early as 1960 but it
was not until 1977 that the GOI decided to extend and strengthen it to achieve
the goal of having at least one trained dai in every village, about I for every
1,000 people. Research data from the Population Center in Lucknow shows that
about 65% of dais are between 30 and 49 years of age and conduct about 6.7
deliveries monthly. About 65% had other occupations such as agricultural labor
but the income from midwifery, although small (about Rs 40 or US$5 per month)
formed about a third of the family income. Of the group covered in the



- 35 -
survey, 83% had become dais because it was a family tradition. The avail-
ability of s trained dai who can conduct hygienic deliveries, refer difficult
cases to the MFWF and follow-up postnatal cases is an important element in
the attempt to reduce maternal and infant mortality and morbidity, as well as
provide motivation for family planning acceptance.
4.15      Health supervisors for male and female Multipurpurse Workers will
be posted at a ratio of 1:4 workers of each sex. In U.P., 222 males and 487
females are needed to complete the number of supervisors required for each
type worker; the corresponding figures in A.P. are 118 and 141 respectively.
Female supervisors are drawn from the ranks of MFWFs and given six months
training to upgrade their supervisory and technical skills. Male supervisors
are drawn from the supervisory ranks of previous vertical programs, such as
those dealing with leprosy and malaria, and given six-months' training. In
order to improve contacts between female supervisors and MPWFs, supervisors
will be posted to a sub-center and from there supervise the activities of
four MPWFs.
4.16      Due to financial constraints, there is a considerable 'backlog
in providing adequate buildings for subcenters in both A.P. and U.P. The
project will provide for the construction, furnishing and equipping of 1,987
subcenters in the project districts--the number of subcenters required to
meet the old target of 1:10,000 people (as per mid-1971 population estimates),
plus 20% of the number of subcenters needed to achieve the new target of
1:5,000 people (as per mid-1981 population estimates). Provision of facili-
ties for all subcenters would have added a further US$10.2 million to con-
struction costs. In light of current and anticipated available funds, the
provision of facilities for all sub,centers India-wide would be difficult to
achieve at a scale of 1:5,000 people. The GOI has, therefore, decided
that the program should aim to cover about 50% of the required facilities by
the end of the Seventh Plan (1989). In the project districts, construction
of subcenters in the number indicated above would allow achievement of this
target by the end of the project period. The remaining subcenters will
function in rented buildings and will be supplied with the necessary equipment.
4.17      The construction of subcenters is viewed in a long-term perspective
of institutional development as part of the Government's commitment to provide
good quality primary health care in rural areas. Once established, the sub-
centers will serve as focal points both for providing services and coordi-
nating the work of health personnel. A small survey of ANMs conducted by
the Population Center in Lucknow, shows that, in general, the people in the
village in which they worked were happier with a new building and felt that
they could get better service than that available at the old, rented facili-
ties. The AMls thought that their services had improved because improved
facilities attracted more mothers with their children. The most serious con-
cerns referred to poor maintenance and the fact that about 10% were situated
about 3 kilometers from the nearest village. The maintenance situation in
respect of small, scattered, isolated buildings is difficult. Lack of staff,
severe climatic extremes and low priority for such buildings result in poor
maintenance in spite of an annual allocation of funds for maintenance. During
negotiations, the Government gave assurances that the states shall each make
appropriate allocation of funds and facilities for the maintenance of all the
buildings used for PHCs and subcenters in the project area.  In selecting sites



- 36 -
for subcenters to be constructed or rented under the project, the Government
gave an assurance that the states shall each ensure that subcenters will be
sited within the inhabited area of the village where they are located.
4.18      Each of the PHCs in the project districts now has two doctors and
a third will be posted during the project, to cope with an increasing work-
load, arising particularly from the introduction of the CHW and dai schemes.
No difficulty is forecast in either state in posting the additional doctors.
Every effort will be made to post at least one lady doctor to a PHC. Despite
the fact that 20%-30% of places in the medical schools in both states are
reserved for female students, there are severe problems in recruiting women
doctors for rural areas. The senior doctor at a PHC takes administrative
responsibility; service delivery, field visits and supervisory responsibi-
lities are divided among the three doctors on a geographical basis. To
strengthen the delivery of MCH services, one of the three doctors will take
a nine-month course in pediatrics. Of the 210 PHCs in the project districts,
117 are functioning in inadequate, often rented accommodations. The project
will provide for construction and furnishing of facilities to overcome this
deficiency. In addition, minor surgery rooms will be provided in the remain-
ing 19 PHCs.
4.19      In addition to improving staffing levels and facilities at the peri-
phery to make services available to a greater number of people, it is also
necessary to ensure that referral services of an adequate quality and of
reasonable proximity to peripheral service points are strengthened. The
development of health facilities differs from state to state depending upon
past political history, capacity to absorb Central Government expenditures,
ability to develop the infrastructure from its own resources, and the respon-
siveness of communities to provide facilities. In U.P., a typical project
district will have a district hospital, a hospital in the headquarters of each
tehsil (other than that in which the district hospital is situated), hospitals
for women, a variety of small dispensaries, both allopathic and indigenous, as
well as PHCs. According to GOI standards each PHC facility should have basic
administrative and technical rooms, and a rural family welfare annex, which is
provided from Central Government funds specifically for MCH and family planning
services and includes a minor surgery room, staff quarters and garages for
vehicles. Over the years, however, lack of basic planning has resulted in,
for example, the construction of family welfare annexes not attached to the
main center and which may be in a rented building, perhaps two kilometers
away. In A.P., the overall situation is essentially similar but there is a
more intensive coverage of taluk (the A.P. term for tehsils) hospitals and
there are no hospitals for women.
4.20      In order to strengthen referral facilities the GOI introduced the
scheme of upgrading 25% of PHCs in 1972. Strengthening will consist of adding
a minor surgery theater, a 10-bed ward, and laboratory services, providing
furniture and equipment and posting an obstetrician/gynecologist and a pedia-
trician. This effort will provide referral facilities for complicated matern-
ity and pediatric cases, female sterilization and medical terminations of
pregnancy. It will reduce the workload of district hospitals, bring better
care closer to the people and provide sterilization facilities as a routine
family welfare service, largely obviating the need for special camps with
their attendant pressures on individuals and reduced standards of care. The



- 37 -
specialist staff will also visit other PHCs in the adjacent blocks. In A.P.
there are proportionately more dispensaries and taluk hospitals than in U.P.,
and they will be included in the number to be upgraded. Taluk hospitals,
which essentially provide curative services, vary in size from 4 to 72 beds in
A.P. project districts. An urban family welfare center is attached to each
taluk hospital and provides MCH aad family planning services. Dispensaries
are small curative facilities usually staffed by a physician and supporting
staff. All facilities to be upgraded will be located according to criteria
based on population distribution, ease of communications and identified
economic growth nodes.
4.21      In U.P., rural female hospitals for women comprise the first tier
for female referrals. The project will improve facilities at 7 of 24 such
hospitals in the project districts by providing a minor surgery theater and
six-bed ward for obstetric and gynecological referrals, female sterilization
and medical termination of pregnancies. The remaining 17 are being upgraded
with help from the ODM. Such facilities were provided in the first project
and have been fully utilized.
4.22      In urban areas, the national program provides for an urban family
welfare center in towns with more than 10,000 population. The centers provide
both static and outreach MCH and family planning services. There are three
types depending upon the size of population to be served. To complete the
coverage of centers in the urban areas of the six districts in U.P., 11
centers will be provided in small towns of 10,000-17,000 people. The mater-
nity homes in Bangalore and Lucknow, provided under the first project, have
proved very successful in providing for deliveries, maternity complications
and family planning guidance, as well as female sterilizations and medical
terminations of pregnancy. Varanasi is the only large city in the six project
districts in U.P. and here the two Government and three non-Government mater-
nity institutions are inadequate and over-crowded. The project will provide
two 30-bed maternity homes in two slum areas of Varanasi which do not now have
such facilities. The coverage of facilities for MCH/family planning service
delivery in the urban areas of the A.P. districts is adequate and needs no
supplementation.
4.23      One of the program's major problems is the lack of staff mobility
which affects supervision in particular. Not only are the required vehicles
in short supply, but many are old and costly to maintain. In the project
districts of U.P., of a total of 416 vehicles, 55 have been condemned and 156
are more than ten years old. A similar situation exists in A.P. where, of the
190 vehicles, 29 have been condemmed and 76 are more than ten years old.  The
project will provide one four-wheeled vehicle for each of 108 PHCs, where
replacement is needed. To provide adequate transport for referral cases, the
project will also provide for one ambulance at each of the 60 ten-bed PHCs to
be upgraded under the project, one ambulance for each of three already
upgraded ten-bed PHCs, and two ambulances for the maternity homes in Varanasi.
All vehicles will probably be diesel vehicles as diesel fuel is cheaper than
petrol and is generally more easily available; all GOI vehicles are being
gradually converted to use diesel fuel.
4.24      Two factors affecting staff mobility are the inadequate allocation
of funds for petrol, oils and lubricants and inadequate maintenance facilities.
The present GOI rate is Rs 7,000 per annum for each vehicle, of which Rs 2,500



- 38 -
is for petrol, oils and lubricants and Rs 4,500 for maintenance. These rates
were set in 1972 when petrol was Rs 1.40 per litre compared with Rs 4.18
today. For U.P. state vehicles the allowance is only Rs 4,500, consisting of
Rs 3,000 for petrol, oils and lubricants and Rs 1,500 for maintenance. Today
these allowances are sufficient only for 4-5,000 kilometers annually. The GOI
now provides subsidies for 100% of these estimated running costs of family
welfare vehicles and 25% for health vehicles (i.e., ambulances). It now
proposes to provide for 75% of the running costs of all vehicles supplied
initially from central funds to a maximum of 10,000 kilometers per annum.
During negotiations, the Government gave an assurance that the states shall
make appropriate allocation of funds and facilities for the operation and
maintenance, on a uniform basis, of all the vehicles used for health and
family welfare purposes in the project area.
4.25       There are severe problems of mobility in rural areas or where lack
of suitable roads prohibits the use of vehicles and no public transport facil-
ities exist. The only effective transport is the bicycle and the project
makes provision for bicycle advances for those health supervisors and multi-
purpose workers who wish to purchase them. Cultural factors inhibit females
using bicycles but these are gradually being broken down. Bicycles were
provided for the ANM training schools in the first project and ANMs were
taught to ride them with considerable success. The project, therefore, also
makes provision for advances for ANMs who wish to use bicycles, leaving
propriety or otherwise to the judgment of individual staff.
4.26       Inadequate maintenance of vehicles is a serious constraint on
mobility, vehicles being off the road for an average of three months at a time
for major repairs such as an engine overhaul. The problem derives from the
difficulty of obtaining sanction for repairs and from the availability of
maintenance facilities. In U.P., the District Chief Medical Officer can
sanction Rs 1,000 per vehicle annually, leaving Rs 1,500 for the sanction
of the state-level family welfare authorities in Lucknow; both amounts are
pooled. It is proposed that in U.P. the Joint Director, Health and Family
Welfare, at divisional level will have the authority to sanction repairs to
a vehicle up to Rs 5,000 at any one time from the pool he will hold. In the
U.P. districts there are regional maintenance workshops for health and family
welfare vehicles at Gorakhpur and Varanasi, as well as adequate private
facilities, and they have mobile maintenance units attached to them. The
situation is considered satisfactory in the light of financial constraints
which inhibit replication throughout the state.
4.27       In A.P. there is an effective State Health Transport Organization
workshop at Hyderabad. Here, the main problem is to decentralize facilities
and the project therefore provides for the construction of a regional workshop
at Cuddapah. This effort in turn will provide better support for the mobile
maintenance units operating in the project area.
4.28       In addition to ensuring that PHCs and subcenters, which will be con-
structed to expand and improve service facilities, are equipped, the project
also provides for the procurement of equipment to bring existing facilities
to an adequate standard. In both A.P. and U.P., UNICEF has provided equipment
within the last five years for about one-half of the existing subcenters and



- 39 -
these will not receive equipment under the project. In the course of appraisal,
equipment lists for PHCs and subcenters have been reviewed and modified to
make them consistent with the services which will be provided at these facil-
ities. The maintenance of medical equipment also presents problems. In U.P.
there is a small workshop for the maintenance of electric and mechanical
health equipment at state level, with two mobile maintenance units, at Aligarh
and Allahabad. The latter workshop covers the district of Allahabad and
the project districts of Mirzapur and Varanasi. Each PHC doctor has a small
fund (Rs 5,000 per annum) for equipment maintenance. Assistance for the
extension of the maintenance system is being sought from UNICEF for the
districts of eastern U.P. In A.P., a workshop capable of undertaking essential
health equipment repairs has been established in the Institute of Preventive
Medicine in Hyderabad with a small branch at Guntur in coastal A.P. For minor
maintenance, the state has contracted the work of two small firms. This has
not been satisfactory because of the wide dispersal of facilities and lack of
interest on the part of contractors to undertake small, routine maintenance
jobs. To provide for preventive maintenance of equipment in the project
districts, the project provides for the establishment of a second regional
maintenance unit at Cuddapah. Provision is made for a workshop, equipment and
two four-wheel drive vehicles; staff and operating costs will be funded from
the state budget.
4.29      For all new facilities and incremental staff to be financed under
the project, provision will be made for the corresponding complement of drugs
and supplies according to GOI standards.
Training
4.30      To provide staff for the extended coverage of family welfare ser-
vices and to improve their quality, training is an important element of
program activity. It consists of basic training and inservice training, both
of which cover, in varying degrees according to the type of staff in training,
the following four modules:
a.   management, primarily for doctors and paramedical supervisors;
b.   orientation towards the new family welfare concepts and GOI
policies for all program staff;
c.   upgrading of professional skills, such as improved MCH
practices for doctors, IUD insertion techniques for HSFs
and training for MPWFs in dispensing oral contraceptives;
and
d.   communication skills for all program staff.
4.31      Once selected by the community, CHWs undergo training for a three-
month period at the nearest PHC, conducted by the PHC doctors (who have
been trained as trainers for this purpose) and the health supervisors. Sub-
jects covered include: (a) principles of personal hygiene; (b) environmental
sanitation; (c) prevalent infectious diseases; (d) nutritional needs of
vulnerable groups; (e) family planning methods; and (f) maintenance of simple
case registers. Training of the 5,805 CHWs required in U.P. and the 3,411 in
A.P. will be completed at PHCs in the project districts within the first year.



- 40 -
4.32      Dai training is also carried out by the PHC doctor and health super-
visors at PHCs for a period of 30 working days. As with CHWs, it is partly
instructional but primarily consists of practical inservice training; one-
third of the time is spent at PHCs and two-thirds with the MPWF of the village
in which the dai resides. Dai training is focused on hygienic deliveries,
postnatal care of the mother and child, family planning methods and the need
to work closely with the MPWFs, particularly in referring difficult cases
promptly. In U.P., the 2,801 dais needed will be trained during the first
year. The training loads in A.P. are much greater, and training will be
extended over the first three years of the project.
4.33      PHCs are also the focus for the retraining of ANMs and male health
workers for their new role in the MPW scheme. Short reorientation courses are
conducted by PHC doctors, who have been trained for the purpose, supported by
district training teams. Training is conducted for two days a month over a
five-month period. PHC training undoubtedly adds to the load of the PHC
doctors but has the following advantages:
a.   it strengthens the relationships in the system between
the community and peripheral workers and between the
latter and PHC staff;
b.   training the doctors as trainers is of itself an impor-
tant retraining exercise in MCH and family planning
practices;
c.   it is local in character, much of the training consisting
of on-the-job practice in the villages; and
d.   it spreads the training load from the regional health
and family welfare training centers which, however,
retain overall supervision of training activities.
4.34      In the project districts in U.P., there are six basic training
schools for MPWFs with a total annual intake of 240 trainees. Three of the
schools will be augmented by 15 places so that about 1,500 of the number of
MPWFs required will be trained during the project period. The other 75 MPWFs
will be supplied from the remaindcer of the state's 42 schools. Of the 18
months' training which MPWFs receive, 6 months is practical training spent in
the field. There are no schools in the selected districts in A.P. and to meet
the anticipated training level of 800 MPWFs, five temporary schools will be
created. Classes of 30 students will be attached to each of the three district
hospitals in the project area and classes of 55 to each of the two medical
colleges. Training will be completed by September 1984. Trainers will be
chosen from senior hospital and medical college staff.
4.35      The posts of MPWMs in U.P. will be filled from existing cadres.  In
A.P., however, there is a shortfall and recruits will be trained at the medical
colleges of Tirupathi and Kurnool in batches of 100, each batch undergoing
18 months' training. The basic training of these workers will be completed
by the end of 1984.
4.36      Health supervisors are promoted from within the service and receive
six months' promotion training. In U.P., the GOI is to establish a school at
Ghazipur, which will admit two batches of 60 trainees each year, to train



- 41 -
female supervisors. Male supervisors will be drawn from existing cadres.
In A.P., male supervisors will be trained at the RHFWTC at Kurnool and female
supervisors at the RHFWTCs at Hyderabad and Vishkapatam.
4.37      At present, there are no plans for the reorientation of staff
once basic training is completed. This lacuna will be filled during the
project by arranging reorientation courses for existing multipurpose workers
and their supervisors. Short courses for MPWs will be held at PHCs throughout
the project period conducted by PHC doctors assisted by the BEE and the health
supervisors. Supervisors will also receive reorientation at PHCs in health
related programs, extension education techniques and record maintenance. They
will be trained by the district training team headed by the Deputy District
Extension Educator.
4.38      The most important cadre requiring reorientation are the medical
officers, from the District Chief Medical Officer to the PHC doctors. Start-
ing with the District Chief Medical Officers and Deputy Chief Medical Officers
and the doctors responsible for PHC management, courses for U.P. staff will be
held in Ahmedabad by the Indian Institute of Management. They will be based
on the courses introduced under the first project but doubled in length to
three weeks' duration. In order to build up a capacity for management training
in health and family welfare within the state, staff will be added to the
Population Center for this purpose. They will be associated with the Indian
Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, staff from the start and gradually assume
responsibility for training during the project as the locus of management
training is moved to the Population Center in Lucknow for the state as a
whole. The project inputs needed to achieve this are covered below (para.
4.63) when the role of the Population Center is discussed. The Indian Insti-
tute of Management, Ahmedabad, will receive a specific contract for training
doctors and initiating a management training capability at the Population
Center. A total of 518 doctors will be trained in batches of 30.
4.39      Because of the bias in their training curricula, most doctors show
a preference for clinical practice and little interest in primary health care
and the preventive aspects of service delivery. It is, therefore, important
to ensure that PHC doctors are given reorientation in MCH and family planning.
In addition to improving technical skills, this training will focus on the
importance of effectively planning service delivery at PHC level to select
carefully risk cases for referral and avoid pressure on upgraded PHCs and
taluk-level hospitals by undue referrals. For this purpose, the two medical
colleges at Varanasi and Gorakhpur will be used to provide four weeks' training
to train 148 PHC doctors during the project.
4.40      To provide for the posts of 37 gynecologists and 37 pediatricians
required at the upgraded PHCs in U.P., the state will reserve places on the
nine-months courses in each discipline at the nine medical colleges in the
state. It is anticipated that the reluctance of doctors to be posted to
rural PHCs will be countered by the opportunity of postgraduate specialization.
4.41      In A.P., medical officers will also receive reorientation training
in management and MCH/family planning service delivery techniques. The
RHFWTC at Kurnool will be used to train 424 doctors during the project period.
Courses of four weeks each will be held for both subjects. The management
courses will be held with the assistance of the Administrative Staff College



- 42 -
of India located in the state capital of Hyderabad. The Administrative Staff
College of India was linked with Karnataka state for the first project and
developed management training courses for PHC doctors. It will develop
case studies and exercises based on A.P. experience, a considerable amount
of material for which is already available. Specialist training for the
gynecologists and pediatricians to be posted to the 26 upgraded PHC/taluk
hospitals will be provided in the medical colleges of Tirupathi and Kurnool.
4.42      Implementation of the training programs in both states will be
large, complex exercises, responsibility for which will rest with the respec-
tive project coordinators. Because the required training of staff is to be
completed within a short period, project inputs in respect of capital costs
are minimal. In U.P., they are limited to constructing and equipping a
training wing for the Population Center, providing furniture for rented
additions to the six Auxiliary Nurse Midwife Training Centers and the RHFWTC
at Varanasi, and vehicles for the Population Center, Auxiliary Nurse Midwife
Training Centers and RHFWTC. Capital costs in A.P. cover the construction,
equipping and furnishing of two hostels for 60 students and three hostels
for 30 students, accommodation at 46 PHCs for field training, additions to the
RHFWTC at Kurnool, furniture and equipment and vehicles for two MPWM training
centers and a minibus for each of the five temporary schools for training of
MPWF. Operational costs in both states will cover salaries, vehicle operating
costs, and contract payments to supporting institutions such as the Indian
Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, and the Administrative Staff College of
India, Hyderabad.
Information, Education and Communication (IEC)
4.43      Although the acronym "IEC" is used in this component of the project
for the sake of brevity, it covers a wide variety of activities, including
community education, mass communications, and manpower development. A
sound IEC program is now of more importance than ever since the broadening
of the concept of family welfare to cover aspects of basic health, such as
MCH, emphasis on a full range of contraceptive services, and the inclusion
of non-allopathic systems of medicine, dais and CHWs in the delivery system.
4.44      The objectives of the IEC component are to effect the following:
a.   make available adequate information on the benefits, effects
and location of basic health and family welfare services
among current and potential users;
b.   support program staff in their delivery of services;
c.   promote the formation of community leadership groups
supportive of the family welfare program by increasing
understanding at the community level of the relationships
between population growth and quality of life;
d.   ensure that all development departments understand the
policies and strategies of the family welfare program; and
e.   improve the demand for and utilization of family welfare services.



- 43 -
4.45      To achieve these objectives the IEC component aims to:
a.   improve the credibility of field staff by increasing their
knowledge, developing their communication skills, promoting
their image and providing them with appropriate IEC materials
in adequate quantities;
b.   create a nucleus around the leaders in each community
which will be actively involved in and supportive of the
family welfare program;
c.   reorient mass communication activities in support of inter-
personal communications which will be the principal IEC
strategy; and
d.   improve the management of IEC activities by decentralizing
planning and strategy design, rationalizing the administra-
tive structure and developing a monitoring and evaluation
system.
4.46      The total population of the project districts is about 22.7 million
living in some 34,000 villages. Because individuals may be members of several
audiences--as a community leader, parent, or consumer of services--no precise
tabulation of specific audiences and sub-groups is possible. The main audience
categories are, however, listed below:
Category                                   A.P.      U.P.
a.   Couples aged 15-44                               1,200,000   3,200,000
b.   Village leaders (10 per village)                    60,000      280,000
c.   CHWs (1 per 1,000)                                   6,000       16,000
d.   Dais (1 per village)                                 6,000       28,000
e.   HFW field staff (1 per 5,000 and PHC
level staff)                                      2,000        6,000
f.   District level leaders (100 per district)              300          600
g.   Other development workers (20 per block)             1,240        2,960
4.47      The need to revive and strengthen inter-personal communication is
derived from three main problem areas. Firstly, the mass media coverage is
only about 30% of the total population and much less in rural areas. Secondly,
the performance of fieldworkers in bridging the gap between awareness and
acceptance has been disappointingly poor, primarily because of the paucity of
services and the failure on the part of program management to train staff in
interpersonal communication skills. And thirdly, the personal, sensitive
nature of the issues and problems which the family welfare program seeks to
alleviate requires personal contact which mass media cannot provide.
4.48      The project will promote community education by the following groups
of activities:
a.   orientation training camps for community leaders at
village, block and district levels;



- 44 -
b.   seminars for formal and informal leaders at district and
state levels;
C.   community involvement at subcenter, block and district
levels; and
d.   production of educational aids to support these activities.
4.49      In covering about 80% of the village, block and district-level
formal and informal leaders, some 223,000 will be invited to participate in
some 6,000 orientation training camps in U.P. during the project period. The
initial camps will be held for two days with one-day follow-up camps during
the project period. Participants will be drawn from opinion leaders and
village officials, CHWs and dais, development workers, teachers and block-level
leaders as well as district leaders. In U.P., the aim is to reach about twice
as many participants per district than in A.P. because program performance
(MCH as well as family planning) has been at a much lower level than in A.P.
and the impact of the Emergency was much greater. In A.P., the initial camps
will be of three days' duration, followed by one-day annual follow-up camps
and will cover about 47,000 leaders. With a greater percentage of eligible
couples effectively protected, the orientation training camp strategy in A.P.
will be to obtain greater participation with a coverage of some 15 people from
every village. Camps for village-level participants will be organized by the
PHC and its associated subcenters and for district-level participants by the
District Medical Health Officer (or District Chief Medical Officer). In
addition to the costs of attendance, the project will provide for the produc-
tion of a manual to guide staff in the planning and implementation of these
camps, basic equipment such as blackboards, and a single educational kit for
each participant. To foster the development of community support, small
groups rather than individuals will be selected from villages.
4.50      One of the chief problems of program implementation is its isolation,
and therefore lack of support, from other Government development departments.
Understanding and cooperation are particularly needed at district, division
and state level. The project provides for the costs of holding annual seminars
to advise Government staff of new developments in health and family welfare
policy, appraise them of progress, identify coordination problems and agree on
solutions. Provision is made for reaching a total of 71,000 staff in U.P. and
33,000 in A.P.
4.51      One of the main objectives of the IEC component is to activate com-
munity involvement. For this purpose, orientation training camps will be held.
However, ways must also be found by which community involvement may be main-
tained. Many village-level organizations, such as women's and youth groups,
are dormant. Most of the active voluntary organizations are urban-based and
their leadership and membership are not representative of the rural poor. The
project makes provision for the phased introduction of advisory committees
from sub-center through PHC to district level, once the initial orientation
training camps have been held. These committees are intended to maintain
contacts between program staff and community leaders. The intention is that
women should form a substantial part of the membership and that the committees
could form the nucleus of women's clubs which have been used to considerable
effect by the national family planning program in Indonesia. To stimulate
interest further, provision is made for visits within each state by committee



- 45 -
members to observe areas in which good program progress has been made, to
visit referral facilities, examine development projects and to maintain
contact with other community leaders supporting the family welfare program.
In consultation with the district education authorities, provision is also
made for bringing this program to the attention of school students.
4.52      It is important that these community education activities should be
supported by suitable educational materials. The effective use of such mate-
rials at the periphery of the program is now inhibited by over-centralization
of design and production, poor distribution and inadequate training of field
staff in the use of materials. The project makes provision for the design
and production of display kits (charts, posters and other visual aids),
portable kits of more sophisticated visual aids such as flipcharts and three-
dimensional models, and aid-making kits comprising materials for supervisors
and BEEs to produce their own diagrams, posters and wall-charts. Instruction
on the use of these materials will be included in the retraining courses for
these educators and other field staff.
Extension Education and Mass Communication
4.53      Mass communication has been the primary IEC activity of the Indian
family planning program in the past 15 years. But from its early success in
creating awareness comes the problem of translating awareness into acceptance.
The point made by a marketing expert at a UNESCO meeting in 1969 that the
Indian IEC program was "all warm-up and no sell" is still true today. Because
of the success of the promotional symbols of the Red Triangle and the Four
Faces, messages and slogans have become exhortative and abstract with little
relation to the audiences to which they were addressed. The needs of the
program have overtaken the needs of the consumer in designing IEC strategies.
The sheer size and heterogeneity of Indian population also militate against
the effective use of mass communication alone. One result has been to measure
success in terms of numbers--numbers of posters displayed, number of film shows,
numbers of meetings--with little attention to the relevance of the themes and
messages and to the quality of the media used. Officials are, however, alert
to the problems and the difficulties and even before the Emergency, a bold
attempt was made to utilize private sector expertise available in the AAAI.
This campaign went beyond "awareness-spreading" to persuasive and informative
appeals which dealt with specific issues rather than generalized slogans. It
was unfortunately interrupted by the Emergency but there were also difficulties
created by an inadequate organizational structure which would have inhibited
successful implementation.
4.54      Nevertheless, mass communication is an important IEC support
activity and the project makes provision for strengthening seven activities
in this area:
a.   Mobile film units and film production.  Feature films have
a phenomenal popularity as an entertainment medium but most
films produced in support of the family planning program
have been almost exclusively focused on family planning,
urban oriented, didactic in tone and treated themes largely
irrelevant to their audiences. The project makes provision
for the production of 18 new films for U.P. and 6 for A.P.,



- 46 -
the content and style of which will be specific to the proj-
ect districts. Their themes will cover, for example, MCH
activities, unwanted pregnancies, and community involvement
in promoting better health. Provision is also made for the
improvement of facilities to show films. There is, at
present, one 16 mm film projection unit in each project
district but these are more than ten years old and need
replacing. One unit can, however, only cover about 6% of
the villages in a district each year. With the need to
support increased IEC activities, such as orientation
training camps, the project will provide for three units per
district. Each unit will be equipped with a vehicle, film
projector, generator and public address system;
b.   Radio-tape extension service.  Family Welfare "cells"
established in All India Radio stations produce pro-
grams in which family welfare is the main theme or which
support programs for special audiences such as women and
farmers. The reach of radio is limited (nationally to
about 20% of the population) and the project does not pro-
vide further inputs at the broadcasting level. To extend
the use of programs prepared by All-India Radio, a radio-tape
service will be introduced in the project areas. BEEs will
be provided with cassette tape recorders and each month
will be sent cassette tapes on one side of which will be
dubbed a selection of these broadcasts. The reverse side
will be used by BEEs to record interviews with local leaders
and program officials, talks, and other family welfare-
related events to build up a library of both state-level and
local material for use in their communications work. The
project makes provision for 210 cassette recorders and the
annual production of 12 tapes for each;
c.   Cultural programs.  The program has long used a variety of
local, live entertainment, (including songs, dance, drama
and puppet shows) with family welfare themes in its commun-
ication activities. The project makes provision for inten-
sifying their use and capitalizing on their wide, popular
appeal. Shows will be arranged in conjunction with orienta-
tion training camps, village meetings and health exhibitions.
The project makes provision for an average of two shows
annually at subcenter villages by local troupes and 500
shows and 200 shows annually, for U.P. and A.P. respectively,
by larger troupes organized at district level;
d.   Filmstrips and slides.  The project makes provision for the
production of locally oriented film strips and slides to sup-
port the BEE and peripheral workers in their IEC activities.
Film strips will be prepared and processed at state-level
and slides will be produced at district-level. The project
provides for a camera for each District HIEO and a slide
projector for each of the 210 PHCs in the project area.
In addition, each HIEO will have one battery-operated pro-
jector for use by BEEs in situations where main electricity
is not available;



- 47 -
e.   Video service.  Video has not thus far been used in the India
family welfare program, although there is experience of its
use in rural extension work and animal husbandry extension.
Its use for family welfare is indicated in the draft Sixth
Plan. The project provides for the limited use of video
services as an extension and training aid. The "intimacy"
and direct impact of the video medium is particularly useful
for small group meetings and training sessions and can
localize subject matter to the level of the needs and
interests of a few key individuals in a village. The
project will provide for a video unit at each district
headquarters and will consist of a video camera, video
cassette tape recorder and monitor screen. The unit will
use existing vehicles and existing film projectionists will
be trained in the use of video equipment. During the third
year of the project, the use of video will be evaluated by
an external institution, such as the All India Film and TV
Institute, the Center for the Development of Instructional
Technology, or the Institute of Mass Communications. If
the application, effectiveness and technical aspects (such
as maintenance and repairs) are found to be positive, the
project provides for a second phase of video use under which
replay equipment only would be made available to the 20
health and family welfare sub-divisions in U.P. and 9)
sub-divisions in A.P. In each phase, only monochrome
equipment would be used;
f.   Extension education in other development agencies.  The net-
work of extension services which could be used to extend
family welfare IEC activities is wide, comprising the pre-
and in-service training: of block development officers, agri-
cultural extension workers, cooperative officers and social
welfare staff. Much of the work of cooperating with these
extension workers will form part of the normal duties of
BEEs and district IEC staff; it will receive special atten-
tion during their retraining. The District Project Officer
will play a major role in coordinating these activities,
thus giving substance to the existing policy of involvement
of other departments in the family welfare program. One
other program, however, is new, extensive and important.
This is the National Adult Education Campaign initiated in
October 1978 with the aim of bringing literacy to 100
million adult illiterates in 10 years. In order to make use
of this important audience, the project makes provision for
supplying to literacy students supplementary literature
dealing with family welfare topics. The material will be
designed and produced by agencies with considerable
experience in this field, such as Literacy House in Lucknow
and Literacy House south in Hyderabad. In addition, special
folders on aspects of family welfare work in relation to
aspects of extension work such as agriculture, women's
development, and cooperatives will be prepared to reinforce
the contacts made by family welfare program staff; and



- 48 -
g.   Outdoor/general publicity.  Visual publicity has an im-
portant legitimizing and reinforcing role in an IEC program
and will be part of the overall IEC strategy used in the
project districts. It will, however, be designed to con-
vey specific messages to specific audiences and use posters,
wall hoardings, cinema slides and exhibition material to
convey those messages. The material will make use of the
work done by the AAAI and be produced primarily by author-
ities at district level to ensure the appropriate context
of the themes and messages.
4.55      Attention is required not only to strategies by which IEC activi-
ties will be used to support the family welfare program and generate community
involvement but also to the problems of administration and implementation.
These comprise a weak organizational structure, sporadic and ineffective
training for IEC staff, and absence of adequate training for program staff
at all levels who need to be involved in communications activities. Typical
of the lack of attention paid to these aspects of program implementation is
the fact that 50% of the BEE posts in A.P. are not now filled and those BEEs
in place are being used mainly for administrative duties. Health education
and family welfare IEC activities have not been integrated at state level and
those responsible have low and ineffective positions in the bureaucracy. With
the exception of the AAAI campaign, little use has been made of the consider-
able IEC resources which exist in India outside the Government sector. The
system of planning and budgeting at state level has left little scope for
initiative at district level.
4.56      The project addresses these problems in five ways:
a.   Reorganization.  In both states, the Health Education Unit
and the Mass Education Unit will be merged to form a Health
and Family Welfare Communication Unit under the Additional
Director, Family Welfare. In U.P., the unit will be headed
by a Joint Director and strengthened by the additional posts
of program officer (community education) and program officer
(extension and development) with supporting staff. Because
of the size of the state and its revenue divisions, a pro-
gram officer will assist the Joint Director, Health and
Family Welfare, at divisional level to plan, coordinate and
supervise the communications program in the project districts.
At district level, the HIEO will be supported by Deputy
HIEOs to work with the Deputy Chief Medical Officers who
have responsibility for a geographical area within a district
for all health and family welfare activities. At PHC level,
the BEE will be redirected to carry out communications
functions effectively. In A.P., a post of assistant director
will be required to head the new unit. Because of its smaller
size, no staff are required between state and district level,
and within a district one Deputy HIEO will be posted primarily
to support the supervision functions of the HIEO. Communica-
tions staff will continue to be administratively responsible
to the appropriate health official, i.e., the BEE to the
PHC doctor and district staff to the District Health Medical



- 49 -
Officer (in A.P.) and Chief' Medical Officer (in U.P.). Tech-
nical responsibi]lity, however, will be established from the
state level downwards, staff retitled to indicate their func-
tions more clearly, and anntual performance reports prepared
initially by the next senior technical officer before sub-
mission to PHC doctors or District Chief Medical Officers who
are now solely responsible for this important career event;
b.   Training.  Having redefined responsibilities and job func-
tions, it is clear that no single institution in India is
equipped to produce the training of staff which is urgently
needed. The project makes provision for two major insti-
tutions--the Central Health Education Bureau and the Gandhigram
Institute--to develop training programs using specialized
institutions (such as the 'Institute of Mass Communication and
the National Institute of -Rural Development) to assist on a
sub-contract basis. Training will cover all staff and will
consist of initial training, refresher training, and follow-up
training. The first two phases will be conducted at the place
of work by mobile teams. 'For senior officials, the project
makes provision for suitable overseas study tours;
c.   Specialist consultancy.  In addition to the institutional
consultancy required for IEC training, the project also
makes provision for specialist consultancy to be made
available to state health and family welfare communication
units. Consultants will be retained to undertake indepen-
dent reviews of the implementation of the communication
strategy, support routine monitoring activities, assess
the need for changes, as well as specific campaign designs,
pre-testing and evaluation;
d.   Response to local needs.  A major weakness in the present
situation is that field-level staff have little opportunity
to develop and implement ideas in response to local needs
and opportunities.  In a modest attempt to correct this,
the project will provide funds for innovative IEC activities.
A competitive scheme will be designed to allow sub-divisions
of districts to submit special project proposals annualLy.
The proposals will be judged by a panel at state level on
their merits with respect to innovation, replicability
and specific needs of the area concerned; and
e.   Vehicle, equipment and materials.  The additional staff will
need support in terms of vehicles, equipment and materials for the
IEC component. The project provides for three vehicles for U.P.
and one vehicle for A.P., furniture for the 17 additional posts in
both states, and funds for the provision of IEC library facilities
which do not now exist in either state.
Monitoring, Evaluation and Operational Research
4.57      The national program has an extensive system of collection and
collation of data and several agenciLes are used for their evaluation.  The
following problems have been identified:



- 50 -
a.   field staff who collect the data spend an inordinate amount
of their time in doing so;
b.   whilst all statistics relating to health, including MCH
and family planning, are collected and tabulated by the
same organizational unit up to and including district
level, each state has a separate unit for health
statistics and family welfare statistics;
c.   there is little feedback to operational units and inade-
quate analysis of data in respect to program performance
and needs;
d.   staff and facilities are inadequate for the tasks of
evaluation and feedback; and
e.   program managers make little use of what information becomes
available.
4.58      The problems were tackled under the First Population Project in
that a MIES was established for each of the two project areas. Working
independently, each of the population centers produced a data collection
system which substituted comprehensive forms for a variety of registers the
ANM was required to keep. The project strategy called for a MIES which would
"link the analysis of performance data to cost and to data from outside the
program, undertake a continuous analysis that will respond to the needs of
administrators, and provide the organizational and technical conditions
necessary for an independent evaluation of the program." In retrospect, this
was an ambitious proposal which has only been realized in part. The project
paid insufficient attention to the time involved in establishing such a
system, involving, as it did, the creation of the population centers as well
as a data collection system. With hindsight, its major weakness lay in the
premise that a different system would automatically change attitudes. Obvious
progress has been made in creating a workable system but less obvious is the
uses to which it has been put. Some of the difficulties lie in problems
mentioned above in para. 3.13, particularly the separation of project and
program in the early stages of the former's development. A long time has been
taken to develop the tool and only now is it possible to consider the broader
objectives of its use.
4.59      The two systems developed by the population centers have been
integrated and an effective system of collecting health and family welfare
data has been derived under the aegis of the evaluation authorities in the
Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in Delhi. At present confined to 120
PHCs in U.P. and 40 PHCs in Karnataka, the system will be further tested on
district scale in each of the two states. It will be introduced into all
the districts covered by the second project in U.P. and A.P. and the first
project districts in U.P. Up to now, data collection and analysis have been
the responsibility of the population centers. In the second project, they
will become the responsibility of the State Demographic and Evaluation Cells
into which will be merged the Vital Statistics Cells in U.P. and A.P., which
have been concerned with health statistics. The Demographic and Evaluation
Cells will be guided and assisted by the two population centers in Lucknow
(for U.P.) and Bangalore, the state government of Karnataka having indicated



- 51 -
its desire to support the project inL A.P., by making available the services of
the Population Center in Bangalore on a contract basis. During negotiations,
assurances were obtained from the Government that the states shall each under-
take a mid-term review of the health and family welfare data collection
systems under the project, and shall make available not later than March 31,
1983, the results of such review to the Association.
4.60      With the merger of the two cells and support from the Population
Center at Lucknow, the Demographic and Evaluation Cell in U.P. has adequate
staff to cope with the changeover to the new system. The Demographic and
Evaluation Cell in A.P. lacks the close support of a Population Center and
additional staff are required to strengthen it. They will consist of an
Assistant Director for Management Evaluation, a Social Scientist, a Statis-
tical Officer, a Statistical Assistant, eight Field Education Officers and
supporting staff. In addition, two vehicles, additional equipment and
furniture, and funds for the provision of a small library are also required.
The training schemes, outlined in paras. 4.31 to 4.42 above, will pay par-
ticular attention to training all levels of staff in the mechanics of data
collection; the system, its uses and importance in program planning and
administration. About five analysts and supporting staff in the Ministry of
Health, GOI, will be provided by the! project for monitoring and evaluating
the accelerated implementation of the national program in 32 districts (para.
4.01).
4.61      The expansion and improvement of family welfare services and sup-
port activities on the scale envisaged are expected to lead to significant
improvements in the health status of the population covered. Some of these
improvements wilL be reflected in a reduction in infant, child and maternal
morbidity and mortality rates and fertility rates. These rates are, however,
the product of complex, interacting factors, the relationships among which are
not clearly understood. Even if an adequate methodology were available, data
on the current values of these rates are not available for the project areas.
There is, however. need to be able to monitor, not only the progress of proj-
ect inputs, but also its impact on the population. The project, therefore,
makes provision for baseline surveys in each district to collect data per-
taining to, inter alia, the following indicators--infant, child and maternal
morbidity and mortality, fertility, including trends in birth intervals and
utilization of MCH/family planning services, including characteristics of
beneficiaries. Performance data re:Lating to mothers registered for antenatal
care, deliveries attended by trained staff, postnatal visits, deliveries
referred to hospitals, clinic attendances, contraceptive acceptance, and
vaccinations and immunizations will be obtained from the data collection
system. Longitudinal surveys will 'be taken annually, following up on a
sample of family planning acceptors, and a final complete survey taken in the
fifth year of the project. The indicators will thus be monitored annually and
the experience gained will be used to refine predictions as to the impact of
the services on the health and contraceptive status of the population.  The
data collected will also be used for a final project evaluation. An illustra-
tive list of performance indicators for the evaluation of project: activities
is given in Annex 2.
4.62      The project also makes provision for operational research to assist
program managers in an ongoing evaluation of project implementation and
program performance. Among the types of studies envisaged are:



- 52 -
a.   concurrent evaluation of IEC strategies;
b.   impact of orientation training camps and subcenter
committees on community involvement;
c.   identification of bottlenecks in program implementation
and recommendations for solution;
d.   utilization of services;
e.   effectiveness of the training programs; and
f.   adequacy of the family welfare services offered at
subcenter and PHC level.
4.63      In the first project, the Population Center in U.P. came under the
Project Coordinator and was separate from the program. The U.P. Government
has decided that it will assume responsibility for the Population Center as of
March 31, 1980, the first project's completion date, when it will function as
a state institution. The Population Center Director will be responsible to
the Commissioner-cum-Secretary Health and a Governing Board established to
supervise its activities. It will be the main professional resource for the
monitoring and evaluation aspects of the second project in U.P. Instead of
channelling funds for project-related activities directly to the Population
Center, as in the first project, however, funds for the second project will be
carried on the budget of the project coordinator. The Population Center will
become one of several agencies or institutions which the project coordinator
will be able to contract for services and studies. The Population Center will
be strengthened to develop a management training capability (see para. 4.38
above) and the project makes provision for construction, furnishing and
equipping of a training wing with hostel and staff accommodation, two vehicles
and incremental operating costs. The project coordinator will also develop a
specific agreement with the Population Center to carry out the base, longi-
tudinal and final surveys, assist with the implementation of the data collec-
tion system, and assist in the monitoring of program indicators and project
evaluation. For this purpose, the project provides for the establishment of
a field unit at Varanasi because of the distance (over 300 kilometers) between
Lucknow and the project districts. The field unit will be headed by an
Assistant Director, and consist of one research officer, six senior investi-
gators and support staff. Provision is made for a vehicle and the costs
needed to operate the unit. As to which institute is contracted for opera-
tional research will be at the discretion of the project coordinator. Whilst
most: of the work will probably be assigned to the Population Center, there
may be occasions when other institutions (such as the Population Research
Center located at the Benares Hindu University in Varanasi or the Population
Research Center in the Department of Economics at the University of Lucknow),
may be more appropriate. Continued support on a contract basis is also
expected from the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad. The switch from
core funding in the first project to contract funding in the second project
recognizes the institutional capability which has been established in the
Population Center and Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, and the need
for monitoring and evaluation to be more closely associated with and directed
by program management. It should also assist in ensuring that research is
more directly linked to program needs.



- 53 -
4.64      In A.P., the same principles will apply.  The implementation of the
data collection system will be supported by the Population Center at Bangalore
in the neighboring state of Karnataka which will assume responsibility for the
operation of the Population Center as of April 1, 1980. The Administrative
Staff College of India, Hyderabad, and the Population Center, Bangalore, will
also be contracted for specific operational research proposals.
Strengthening of Program Management in Project Areas
4.65      In addition to organizational changes which affect program implemen-
tation in respect of IEC activities and monitoring and evaluation, overall
program management will be strengthened in respect of the project districts
in both states in the following respects:
a.   At present, three Deputy Chief Medical Officers (in U.P.)
or Deputy Medical Health Officers (in A.P.) are posted to
a district regardless of the size of population or number
of PHCs. To ensure that the specific geographical area
in which a deputy supervises all health matters is manage-
able, deputies will be posted at a ratio of one to about
eight PHCs.
b.   In view of the broader implications of the family welfare
policy, the need to obtain community involvement, the
importance of involving other development departments, and
the urgency of improving the image, not only of family
planning but of the other aspects of the family welfare
program as a whole, responsibility for the coordination of
program activities, which go beyond the health services, will
be vested in the District Magistrate (or Collector in A.P.).
The Chief Secretary in each state will issue instructions to
the District Magistrates defining their functions in respect
of responsibility for promoting the Government's new policies
and coordinating the implementation of project activities.
The responsibility of District Chief Medical Officers for the
delivery of all health services, including family welfare,
will not be affected. The involvement of the highest admin-
istrative echelons of Government has been one of the princi-
pal factors behind the success of the national family planning
program in Indonesia, which several study tours of senior
program officials, funded by the first project and the UNFPA,
considered could be implemented in the Indian program. In
the first project, an experimental strategy was tried in two
sub-divisions of the Karnataka project area involving the
Assistant Commissioners. Although problems were encountered
because of the transfer of staff, development and revenue
departments and local government authorities did become more
involved in the program because of the support of the Assis-
tant Commissioner. The program should be able to capitalize
on the considerable influence which District Magistrates
exert. In the climate which has prevailed since the Emer-
gency, there are few grounds for anticipating that this
influence will be misused. District Magistrates will be
supported by the district project officers in carrying out
their coordination functions (see para 6.05 below); and

c.   Because of its size, both areally and in terms of population,
U.P. has had a Joint Director, Health and Family Welfare,
posted at divisional level (consisting, on average, of five
districts) since 1973, to exercise some of the supervisory
functions normally carried out by state-level officials.
Th-se officers are, however, not supported by adequate
specialist staff and there are administrative anomalies such
as the fact that there are no differences in the pay scales
and allowances between Joint Directors and the Chief Medical
Officers whose work they supervise. The project will,
therefore, make provision for upgrading the Joint Director
and his staff to the levels which apply at the state direc-
torate. The staff will be strengthened by the addition of
specialists in family welfare, IEC and statistical work, as
well as malaria and leprosy. Funds will be provided for
support staff, basic office furniture and equipment and
vehicles which are not now available and which have to be
commandeered. The strengthening of the two offices of
Joint Director covering the U.P. project districts will
improve supervision, create better technical linkages between
state and district, and relieve staff at Directorate level in
Lucknow of routine responsibilities, freeing them for more
attention to both policy and program issues. There is no
need for similar action in A.P.
Innovative Activities
4.66      One of the important features of the first project was the provi-
sion of funds for experimental strategies and innovative projects, which
were made available to the project authorities without the attendant diffi-
culties imposed by the normal budgeting system. Schemes to make use of such
funds were approved by the project implementation committees and control suc-
cessfully maintained in this way. It is very necessary to ensure that such
flexibility continues to be available and the project provides US$1.5 million
for this purpose. Examples of the type of innovative activity which may be
funded are schemes to: (a) involve women more closely in health and family
welfare activities by promoting their role as income earners; (b) respond
quickly to the health needs of a particular village where, for example, a
safe drinking water supply may be lacking and where its provision would lead
to considerable improvement in health status; (c) support the activities of
a voluntary agency in the family welfare field in a particular village or
development block; and (d) introduce family welfare topics in the regular
training program of non-health extension workers to secure their involvement.
The proposals will have to meet the following criteria: (i) relevance to
program objectives; (ii) innovativeness; (iii) feasibility of administration
and evaluation; and (iv) replicability. Proposals estimated to cost US$50,000
or less would require the approval of the respective state project committee;
those estimated at over US$50,000 would be submitted to IDA for scrutiny. IDA
approval of these proposals will be a condition of disbursement (para. 8.03).

V. PROJECT COST, FINANCING AND DISBURSEMENT
A. Cost
5.01               The total estimated project cost is US$96 million equivalent, of
which US$68.2 million is for U.P. and US$27.8 million for A.P. The foreign ex-
change component is estimated at about US$16.3 million, 17% of total project
costs. Taxes and duties included in total costs are estimated at US$4.0
million. Capital costs for construction, furniture, equipment, vehicles
and IEC materials account for US$38.3 million, or 51% of base costs. Incre-
mental operational and maintenance costs total US$36.7 million or 49% of base
costs. The cost estimates by expenditure and innovative activities category
are summarized in the following table. (See also Annex 3.)

to the improvement of the delivery of basic health and family welfare services.
A further 7% is identified for training, 8% for IEC activities, 1% for program
and project management, and 1% for monitoring, research and evaluation and 2%
for innovative activities. A breakdown of costs by functional category is

5.03     The costs of construction and furniture are based on estimates
derived from prices current in October 1979, and experience with a similar
construction program under the first project. Cost estimates for equipment,
vehicles, and materials for IEC production are also based on October 1979
price quotations. Salaries, training costs and the cost of overseas study
tours are based on standard Government salary and allowance scales as of
October 1979. Estimates of the cost of contracts to be let to consulting
institutions are based on experience gained under the first project costed at
October 1979 rates.
5.04     The foreign exchange component of the cost of civil works is esti-
mated at 30%, of equipment at 37%, and of furniture at 26%, IEC materials at
30% and vehicles at 27%. The only incremental operating costs which have an
estimated foreign exchange component cover petrol, oils and lubricants.
5.05     The contingency allowance of US$21.0 million equivalent (22%
of total project costs) includes: (a) physical contingencies for unforeseen
factors estimated at 5% of the base cost of civil works, furniture and equip-
ment; and (b) price contingencies averaging 25% of base costs and physical
contingencies. Price contingencies for local costs other than salaries were
calculated on the assumption of a 12% inflation rate in FY 1979-80 and 5%
annually afterwards. For salaries, a rate of 5% was assumed for FY 1979-80
and afterwards. Price contingencies for the foreign exchange component of
project costs were calculated on the assumption of an inflation rate of 10%
for calendar 1979, 9% for calendar 1980, 8% for calendar 1981, and 7% there-
after.
5.06     Recurrent expenditures of the Department of Medical, Health and
Family Welfare of U.P. amounted to Rs 888 million in FY 1978/79. This
represented about 7.6% of total state recurrent expenditures in that year.
In A.P., recurrent expenditures of the Directorate of Medical and Health
Services amounted to Rs 590 million in the same year. This represented about
6.9% of total state recurrent expenditures. The proposed project would add
about Rs 66.6 million at May 1979 prices to recurrent expenditures in U.P. in
FY 1984/85, the last year of the project. This represents about 7.5% of the
state's recurrent expenditures in the health sector in FY 1978/79. In A.P.,
the corresponding increase in recurrent expenditures would be Rs 28 million,
or 4.7% of the state's recurrent expenditures in the health sector in FY1978/
79. These increments seem reasonable in view of the proportions of the two
states' populations that will benefit from the project and the high priority



- 57 -
assigned by central and state Governments to the improvement of family welfare
services. The planning and finance ministries in both states have received
and approved the proposed project.
B. Financing
5.07      The total project cost (US$96 million) will be financed by an
IDA credit of US$46 million equivalent or about 50% of total project costs net
of taxes. SIDA has expressed an interest in providing co-financing for this
project of US$23 million or about 25% of total project costs net of taxes.
If, however, SIDA, or other co-financing, does not materialize, the balance of
US$50 million will be contributed by the GOI and the two state governments.
The project would provide retroactive financing of up to US$1 million, for
expenditures after July 1, 1979, for essential pre-project activities
including the establishment of construction units, the posts of district
project officers, preparation of training curricula and manuals for IEC
activities; and preparation of baseline surveys.
C. Disbursements and Audit
5.08      Disbursements under the Credit would cover:
a.   48% of expenditures for civil works (US$17.0 million);
b.   48% of expenditures for furniture, equipment, materials,
and vehicles (US$5.4 million);
c.   48% of staff salaries, as follows:
i.   for borrower's monitoring and evaluation systems
(US$0.3 million); and
ii.   for states staff (US$8.7 million);
d.   48% of operation and maintenance, including studies and
study tours (US$10.6 million);
e.   66% of the cost of innovative activities (US$1.0 million);
and
f.   unallocated (US$3.0 million).
A schedule of estimated disbursements is given in Annex 4.
5.09      As in the first population project, all disbursements would be made
against certified statements of expenditures to be supplied by the GOI Ministry
of Health and Family Welfare. (See Annex 5.) Supporting documents would be
retained by GOI for inspection by IDA during project supervision. During nego-
tiations, the Government gave an assurance that the project accounts would be
audited annually and the audit reports made available to the Association
within nine months after the close of each fiscal year.



- 58 -
D. Procurement
5.10      Contracts for civil works covering about 2,000 subcenters, about
40 PHCs, 2 small maternity homes, as well as the rehabilitation and extension
of existing buildings, would be small and widely dispersed in time and place;
they would not be suitable for International Competitive Bidding procedures.
They would, therefore, be let through the competitive bidding procedures of
the state concerned, satisfactory to the Association. During the first
project, however, difficulties were experienced in securing suitable con-
tractors to work in isolated areas and some of the civil works, not more
than 30% of the total, would be carried out departmentally under the super-
vision of the project construction units. Furniture, equipment and vehicles
will be procured under "rates contracts" by the Director General of Supply and
Disposals, GOI, or by the Director of Industries at state level which procure
economically and efficiently on a national level. Because of the variety and
number of items to be procured, as well as the need for adequate maintenance
and after sales service, foreign firms would not be interested. Where "rate
contracts" do not apply, local competitive bidding procedures, acceptable to
the Association, will be used for packages in excess of US$10,000 equivalent.
Below that amount, purchases will be made in accordance with state procurement
regulations. All the furniture, equipment and types of vehicles required are
available from local manufacturers.
VI. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Project Management
6.01      The staff of the GOI's Ministry of Health will exercise the same
coordinating functions as it did in the first project. An important feature
of implementation will be close coordination with other agencies, such as
UNFPA, DANIDA, USAID and the British ODM, to exchange experiences and ensure
the smooth development of the various area programs. Coordination will
continue to be the responsibility of the GOI's Ministry of Health. At a
meeting in Geneva in March 1979 called by the UNFPA to discuss inter-agency
coordination, the Indian program was one of three national programs to
receive particular attention. The GOI and both multilateral and bilateral
agencies declared themselves satisfied with the present situation and no
additional coordinating mechanisms are required. However, the project pro-
vides staff to strengthen the monitoring and evaluation capability of the
Ministry of Health.
6.02      In U.P., a considerable body of project management experience
derived from implementing the first project exists but no such experience
is available in A.P. Some problems with project implementation were en-
countered initially in the first project because the management design did
not fully respect Indian administrative experience. It was also largely
divorced from the management of the state family planning programs, as
separate units were set up for construction, implementation and research
and evaluation. These were coordinated by the Special Secretary-cum-Project



- 59 -
Coordinator. The management structure of this project has been designed
to overcome these problems. The design also reflects the need to avoid
attracting undue criticism from non-project areas and to ensure that project
specific staff can be absorbed by the program at the end of the project.
6.03      The responsibility for implementation of the program in project
areas will be the same as that of program management in the non-project areas.
The program functions will be appropriately strengthened as described else-
where to provide for expanded tasks of IEC, training, supplies, and research
and evaluation. The project management structure is responsible for making
project inputs available as well as to ensure expeditious implementation of
the project strategy. Thus, the project and program management are integrated
wherever possible without, however, leaving unclear the locus of responsi-
bility for project implementation.
6.04      The differing size and socio-economic climate of each state and of
project areas within the states has resulted in different systems of project
management (Charts 3 and 4).
Uttar Pradesh (U.P.)
6.05      In U.P., the post of Special Secretary-cum-Project Coordinator
will be retained from the first project and appropriate support staff will
be provided. He will be responsible for planning, implementation and monitor-
ing of the project and for overall coordination of different activities in
the project.  The project construction unit (the director of which reports
to the special secretary) will be strengthened to cope with an increased
volume of work;, its organization is described in para. 6.10 below. To inte-
grate the project with the program more fully, the specialized staff of the
former project implementation unit will be transferred to specialist program
units. Program implementation in the six project districts will be the
responsibility of the Director, Medical, Health and Family Welfare. To focus
attention on the increased, intensified and innovative program activities in
the project area, his staff will include a Joint Director, Project Implemen-
tation. The main function of the Joint Director is to ensure that the exten-
sion and intensification of the program in the six districts is carried out
expeditiously. Although the Joint Director will report to the Additional
Director, Family Welfare, linkages for operational purposes will be estab-
lished between the Special Secretary-cum-Project Coordinator and the Joint
Director, Project Implementation. Specialist staff will be provided to
various divisions of the Additional Director, Family Welfare, in order to
strengthen them and maintain focus on the project districts. Responsibility
for the Population Center, which was under direct control of the Project
Coodinator in the first project, will be transferred to the state and its
Director will be responsible to the Commissioner-cum-Health Secretary.
However, in addition to its other responsibilities for the state, the Popu-
lation Center will continue to provide research and evaluation services to the
project. In order to provide more backing for the program at the district
level, cope with the intensification and widening in scope of the family
welfare program, and provide coordination and guidance on family welfare
activities for all departments of Government, the Chief Secretary will remit
responsibility for family welfare program implementation and performance to
the District Magistrates. To enable them to cope with this increased respon-
sibility, a District Project Officer from either the medical or provincial
administrative cadres will be appointed with supporting staff. The District



- 60 -
Project Officer's functions will be to support the district construction
units, attend to site selection and land acquisition, procure equipmenit and
furnishings for the facilities and provide the necessary coordination among
Government departments and between them and local Government authorities
particularly in carrying out the intensified IEC program; responsibility for
the delivery of health and family welfare services will remain with the
District Chief Medical Officer.
6.06      The committee system established under the first project proved
effective in commanding a high degree of attention to the project, removing
bottlenecks in the administrative system and ensuring the effective coordina-
tion of the various project activities. The Governing Board, chaired by the
Chief Secretary, will be retained together with its executive, the Steering
Committee, chaired by the Commissioner-cum-Health Secretary. The Governing
Board will be expanded to include the Secretaries of the Departments of
Education, Works, Agriculture Production Commissioner, and the Director
of Information. It will meet once every quarter to review project progress
and suggest ways and means for improving the project performance. The Steer-
ing Committee will be expanded to include the District Magistrates of the
project districts and its venue moved from Lucknow to Varanasi and other
principal towns in the project area in rotation. It will meet at least once
a month to monitor progress and ensure coordination among various project
activities. At district level, the District Magistrate will chair a District
Project Implementation Committee with representatives of the major development
departments in the district, as well as those responsible for family welfare,
and representatives of local communities and organizations as members.
Consideration was given to combining the responsibilities of these committees
with the existing family welfare committees described in para. 2.12 above.
In view of the advisory nature of the latter, primarily dealing with public
relations, their large size and wide concerns (as reflected in their agenda),
and the need for the project committees to deal with details of implementation,
it was decided that the specific focus of the project committees should be
maintained.
Andhra Pradesh (A.P.)
6.07      In A.P., the problems of size and distance are much less and the
Directorate of Medical, Health and Family Welfare has had a consistently
stronger program than that of U.P. Therefore, project management structure
is modest compared to that of U.P. The focus of project implementation will
be in the Directorate, where an Additional Director for Project Implementa-
tion and supporting staff will be appointed. This Additional Director will be
responsible for planning, implementing and monitoring of the project and the
necessary coordination. The Health Secretariat staff will be strengthened by
the addition of a section responsible to the Deputy Secretary to cope with
correspondence between the state and central governments, management insti-
tutes and the states of U.P. and Karnataka. Responsibility for construction
will be that of the state Chief Engineer who will create a special construc-
tion unit under a Superintending Engineer; the latter will liaise closely
with the Additional Director, Project Implementation. The latter will also
liaise closely with the Additional Director, Family Welfare. The project
implementation will be carried out through the existing program machinery,
strengthened as necessary. The Collectors will have the same functions and



- 61 -
support staff as their equivalents, District Magistrates in U.P. As in U.P.,
newly appointed district project officers from either the medical or provincial
administrative cadres, will attend to site selection and land acquisition,
procure equipment and furnishings for the facilities, and provide the neces-
sary coordination among Government departments and between them and local
Government authorities.
6.08      Separate committee structure is not envisaged in A.P.  The existing
Family Welfare Committee will also serve as Project Advisory body. At district
level, the existing District Family Welfare Committee will also serve as
District Implementation Committee.
B. Implementation of Civil Works
6.09      In both U.P. and A.P., various government agencies and quasi-
government corporations undertake construction work. Current commitments
and the nature of the second project, which requires the construction of many
small buildings over a wide area, make it impossible for these agencies to
assume responsibility for the project's civil works program.  Implementation
of civil works will, therefore, follow essentially the system adopted with a
large measure of success in the first project. However, the proposed organi-
zation for the implementation of civil works in this project differs from
the one adopted in the first project in one important respect. In this
project, architects either transferred from the Public Works Department, or
engaged as consultants, will be an integral part of the project.
6.10      In U.P., the first project's construction unit still exists,
although in an attenuated state as the building program is almost complete.
The nucleus exists for the formation of a larger organization than that
employed in the first project, the volume of civil works being 2-1/2 times
larger than in the first project. The Director of Works will head a unit in
Lucknow with three Joint Directors responsible for a headquarters unit (in-
cluding architectural, design and engineering responsibilities), a unit for
remote subcenter construction, and a unit for other buildings respectively.
A construction unit will be established in each of the six districts under
a Deputy Director who will be responsible for main buildings and subcenters
located in reasonably accessible areas for which acceptable contracts can be
obtained after local competitive bidding. To cope with subcenter construc-
tion in remote areas, three units, each covering two districts, will be
established under a Deputy Director. These units, which will be mobile, will
be responsible for supervising force account work using acceptable state
procedures. In A.P., the Chief Engineer, Public Works Department, will be
responsible for construction and a Construction Unit will be established for
this purpose. It will comprise a Circle Office controlled by a Superintending
Engineer located in Hyderabad. This unit will have an Architectural Wing and
a Structural Engineering Unit. For implementation, an office headed by an
executive engineer will be located at each district headquarters. In A.P.,
it is anticipated that all civil works will be procured by local competitive
bidding. During negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Government
that the states shall each furnish to the Association for its information
and comments not later than June 30, 1980, or such other date as may be
agreed between the Association and the state concerned, preliminary type
designs for all facilities to be constructed under the project.



- 62 -
6.11      In the first project, procurement of furniture and equipment for
buildings was the responsibility of the Project Implementation Officer in
each state capital. Difficulties were encountered in synchronizing procure-
ment with the completion of buildings. To overcome this problem in the
second project, the Deputy Director or Executive Engineer of each district
unit will he responsible for procurement of furniture and equipment relating
to civil works. The Project Coordinator will be responsible for the procure-
ment of other equipment and for all vehicles. The summary implementation
schedule is given in Annex 6.
VII. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS
7.01      The major justification for this project is that it will provide
improved family welfare services to a population of 22.7 million as part of
a comprehensive program including service facilities and supporting activi-
ties designed for the specific areas which it covers. These family welfare
services include both family planning and MCH services.
7.02      The project is expected to improve the provision of these services,
and their enhanced utilization, by providing better facilities, trained staff,
and a coherent strategy of supporting IEC activities. The project will also
make available a wider range of contraceptive services in the context of
MCH care. As the first of the intensive area programs to be developed, it is
expected to have a significant impact on the design and replication of similar
area programs in India. It is particularly important to ensure that these
programs are as speedily developed by the states as human and financial
resources will allow. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that the
states shall each undertake a mid-term review of the progress of the project
activities in the respective areas, and shall make available not later than
March 31, 1983, the results of such review to the Association.
7.03      Estimates of the increased level of services which the project will
provide are difficult to establish because of inadequate methodology, the
absence of a firm data base, and factors outside the control of project
management which may affect the utilization of services. Nevertheless, the
project is expected to help raise the contraceptive prevalence rate in the
project districts of U.P. from its present level of 11%-13% of eligible
couples to 24%-26% by 1985. For A.P., the comparable expected increase is
from 25%-27% to 35%-37%. The percentage of mothers provided with antenatal
services is expected to increase, over the same period, from 10% to 50% in the
project districts of U.P. and from 20% to 50% in the project districts of A.P.
The percentage of deliveries attended by trained personnel is expected to
increase from 15% to 75% in the project districts of both states. Finally,
the immunization coverage of children aged 1 to 5 years is expected to increase
from 5% to 50% in the project districts of both states.
7.04      The difficulties experienced in the first project lay originally
in the way in which it was organized (see para. 6.02 above). These should
be obviated in the second project because the project is an integral part
of the program and, in U.P. at least, there is a strong nucleus of staff who
have had considerable experience. The implementation of the physical side



- 63 -
of the project proceeded relatively smoothly in U.P. and Karnataka and no
inordinate problems are foreseen in the second project. With close program
involvement, problems should be minimized.
7.05      Difficulties were also experienced in building up the capability
of the two population centers and the population units of the management
institutions in Hyderabad and Ahmedabad. All institutions have now been
operating for six years and are firmly established.
7.06      The major risks in the second project lie in the development of the
strategies which will be adopted to improve the health status of the popula-
tion and provide the basis for sustained contraceptive practice. Their imple-
mentation involves thousands of staff and millions of people and, as in all
attempts to change personal attitudes on a mass scale, the outcome is not
easily predicted.
VIII. RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01      During negotiations, agreements were obtained from the GOI that:
a.   The states shall each make appropriate allocations of
funds and facilities for the maintenance of all the
buildings used for PHCs and subcenters in the project
area (para. 4.17);
b.   Subcenters shall be sited within the inhabited area of
the village in which they are located (para. 4.17);
c.   The states shall each make appropriate allocations of
funds and facilities for the operation and maintenance,
on a uniform basis, of all the vehicles used for health
and family welfare purposes in the project area (para. 4.24);
d.   The states shall each undertake a mid-term review of the
health and family welfare data collection systems under
the project, and shall make available not later than
March 31, 1983, the results of such review to the Association
(para. 4.59);
e.   Project accounts will be audited annually and the audit
reports made available to the Association within nine months
after the close of each fiscal year (para. 5.09);
f.   The states shall each furnish to the Association for its
information and comments, not later than June 30, 1980, or
such other date as may be agreed between the Association
and the state concerned, preliminary-type designs for all
facilities to be constructed under the project (para. 6.10);
and



- 64 -
g.   The states shall each undertake a mid-term review of the
progress of the project activities in the respective areas,
and shall make available not later than March 31, 1983, the
results of such review to the Association (para. 7.02).
8.02      For activities costing more than US$50,000 to be financed under
the innovative activities component, no funds will be disbursed unless IDA
has approved the activity before its implementation, according to the criteria
listed in para. 4.66.
8.03      With these assurances, the project is recommended for a Credit of
US$46 million on standard IDA terms to the Government of India.

ANNEX 1
FAMILY WELFARE PROGRAMME
A Statement of Policy
MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND FAMILY WELFARE
GOVERNMENT OF INDIA
NEW DELHI
June 29, 1977



- 66 -
ANNEX 1
The President in his address to Parliament on March 28, 1977,
stated that "Family planning will be pursued vigorously as a whollv voluntary
programme and as an integral part of a comprehensive policy covering edu-
cation, health, maternity and child care, family welfare, women's rights and
nutrition". The Prime Minister has on a number of occasions underlined the
vital importance of family planning as a means of individual and national deve-
lopment and well-being. This Government is totally committed to the Family
Welfare Programme and will spare no efforts to motivate the people to accept
it voluntarily in their own interest and in the interest of their children as well
as in the larger interest of the nation.
2.     Family planning has, however, to be lifted from its old and narrow
concept and given its proper place in the overall philosophy of welfare. Itmust
embrace all aspects of family welfare, particularly those which are designed
to protect and promote the health of mothers and children. It must become a
part of the total concept of positive health. At the same time, it must find
mneaningful integration with other welfare programmes, viz., nutrition, food,
clothing, shelter, availability of safe drinking water, education, employment
and women's welfare. It will be our endeavour to bring about this integration
in a greater degree. We expect the States to do the same.
3.     The change in the name of the programme from family planning to
family welfare is a reflection of the Government's anxiety to promote, through
it, the total welfare of the family and the community. It is our intention to take
the programme forward in the real sense as an investment in man. We wish to
make it abundantly clear that in this task there is no room for compulsion, co-
ercion or pressures of any sort. Compulsion in the area of family welfare must
be ruled out for all times to come. Our approach is educational and wholly vo-
luntary. There will,however,be no slackening of our efforts in this direction.
4.     The Government attaches the highest importance to the dignity of the
citizen and to his right to determine the size of his family. We have no doubt
that by and large the people of India are conscious of the importance of res-
ponsiblc parenthood; given the necessary information and adequate services,
they will accept the small family norm. We will promote all methods with
equal emphasis and it will be left to every family to decide what method of con-
traception it will like to adopt. Employees of the Union Government, State
Governments, autonomous bodies, local bodies, etc., will be expected to set
an example and to adopt the small family norm.



- 67 -
ANNEX 1
5.      We are totally against any legislation for compulsory sterilisation
either at the Central level or by the States. Sterilisation, both male and female,
is a terminal method and suitable for those couples who have reached the optimum
family size. Services for sterilisation will be offered free, of cost to those who
voluntarily wish to adopt this method. Similarly other services under the pro-
gramme will be available to the people free of charge. The acceptance of volun-
tory sterilisation and IUD involves to and fro travel to a clinic, a brief s,tay in the
hospital, resulting in possible loss of wages which the majority of our people can-
not easily afford. In view of this, it has been decided to retain the provision for
monetary compensation. Any medical complication resulting from a voluntary
sterilisation operation will be attended to free of cost; and if in an unfortunate case
recanalisation becomes necessary, this facility will also be offered to the individual
concerned under the best possible profes.innal care without any charge.
6.     Nearly 80 per cent of our population lives in villages. Medical services
are not able to reach them in an effective way. An integrated rural health scheme
is on the anvil and will be implemented shortly. It is of the utmost importance
that adequate ante-natal, natal and post-natal care is made available to pregnant
miothers. To this end a comprehensive scheme of training of indigenous mid-
wives (dais) will be implemented. Under it maternity services will be made
available to all mothers who may need them. The programme of immunising
children against common diseases such as a whooping cough, diphtheria and
tetanus will be expanded further. We expect that the State Governments willgive
necessary co-operation and assistance in this direction.
7.     The direct correlation between illiteracy and fertility and between
infant/maternal mortality and the age at marriage is well established by demo-
graphic studies. While on the one hand the Government will pursue its policy
of according high priority to the improvement of women's educational level,
boti through formal and non-formal channels, it wilt also bring legislation for
raising the minimum age of marriage for girls to 18 and for boys to 21.
8.  In a federal system, the sharing of Central resources with the States is a
matter of considerable importance. In all cases where population is a factor as
in the allocation of Central assistance to State plans, devolution of taxes and
duties and grants-in-aid, the population figures of 1971 will continue to be fol-
lowed till the year 2001. Family Planning and population control is a subject in
the Concurrent List, yet the implementation of the Family Welfare Programme
is very much the responsibility of State Governments. Assistance for the imple-
mentation of the Programme is provided by the Central Government to the States
on cent-per-cent basis. In order to ensure a purposeful implementation of the
Family Welfare Programme, the principle of linking 8 per cent of Central Assis-
tance to the State Plans with their performance and success in Family Wel-
fare Programme will be continued.



- 68 -
ANNEX 1
9.     Population education has so far not received the attention it deserves.
The NCERT have developed some models for the introduction of population edu-
cation in the school education system. These models have already been adop-
ted by the Central Schools Organisation. We would urge that the departments of
education in the States should adopt these models, or their modified versions,
in the syllabus in the schools. Forty-two per cent of our population is below the
age of 15 years. It is this population which will soon be entering in the area of
matrimony. We must take steps without any further delay to see that the youth
receive population education as part of their normal courses of study.
10.    The population of India has been increasing at the rate of about o n e
million every month. It has increased by nearly 270 million since 1947 and is
today estimated to be 615 million. If the present rate of growth continues, we
will be touching the one-billion mark by the end of the century. This rate has to
be arrested. The birth rate targets of 30 and 25 per thousand by the end of the
Fifth and Sixth Plans respectively can be achieved only with the total and willing
participation of the community in the family welfare programme. For this pur-
pose it is important that all media of publicity, including motivation through the
extension approach, should be utilised fully by the Central and the State Govern-
ments. We would very much expect that just as at the Centre we have involved
all media units of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting in the motiva-
tional campaigns, in the States also the State Departments of Public Relations
and other departments having their own publicity set-ups would be totally associ-
ated with the motivational effort.
11.    It is of equal importance that trade unions, chambers of commerce,
cooperative societies, organisations of women, federations of teachers, village
panchayats and all other institutions which can influence public opinion should
be associated intimately with the educational campaigns. The village panchayats
can play a significant role in this task. Their potential as change-agents needs
to receive greater recognition and attention.
12.    No programme will succeed unless voluntary organisations particu-
larly youth and women's organisations participate in its implementation fully
and extensively. So far this participation has been very limited. The Govern-
ment wishes to invite the suggestions of voluntary organisations and such public
bodies as are engaged in the general task of Family Welfare for evolving suit-
able patterns of co-operation and assistance. Full rebate will be allowed I n
the income-tax assessment for amounts given as donations for l! amily Welfare
purposes to Government, local bodies, or any registered voluntary organisa-
tion approved for this purpose by the Union Ministry of Health.
13.    While the existing methods of contracepticn will continue to be avail-
able to the people, it is important that the search fLr newer methods should
be intensified. The Government will give special attention to the necessary
research inputs In the field of reproductive biology and contraception.



- 69 -
ANNEX 1
14.    The programme and the approach for implementation of the Family
Welfare ig:%;amme as outlined in the above paragraphs will succeed only if
there is willing eo-operation from all in full measure. The Family Welare
Programme embraces all the principal areas of human welfare. It will be
wrong to leave it only to thUn M'inistry of Health and Family Welfare in the
Centre and their counterparts in the States. It is essential that all Ministries
and Departments of the Government of India as well as of the States give due
importance to this Programme and work for its furtherance. 'The performance
of Family Welfare in the States will be intensively and carefully monitored and
the Union Cabinet will review the situation in depth at least once a year. Suit-
able machinery for ensuring coordination with other connected programmes of
welfare may be set up in the States also.
