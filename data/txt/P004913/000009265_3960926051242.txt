LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Bornower                 Government of Algeria
AmAount                  US$94 million equivalent
Terms                    15 years including 3 years of grace, at the standard
variable interest rate.
Prosect Desor4dipti:     The proposed Project has the following objectives: (a)
at the local level:  (i) to implement the first
priority investment package for the development of the
Cheliff river basin; and (ii) to safeguard and improve
the income of the farmers and their families living in
the subproject areas and improve social welfare by
providing some basic infrastructure; (b) at the sector
level: (i) to develop and implement new institutional
arrangements to ensure adequate water management,
operation and maintenance in the Cheliff river basin
which, when replicated, would benefit all major
irrigation in the country; and (ii) to develop and
improve internal financing of O&M by increasing user
charges to fully cover costs; and (c) at the national
level, to develop efficiently irrigation potential in
the country by expanding the large-scale irrigation
areas presently used for irrigation by about 252. The
Project would consist of (a) rehabilitation of
existing irrigation infrastructure over 5,000 ha in
Bas Cheliff; (b) construction of new irrigation systems
over 8,000 ha in Haut Cheliff; (c) provision for
equipment and vehicles for extension and O&M staff;
(d) technical assistance for the supervision of works,
for studies of further irrigation works in the Cheliff
valley and for O&M; (e) training and recruitment of
local staff; and (f) on-farm investments. The risk of
slow project implementation which was experienced with
a previous Project has been minimized by careful
design of the procurement packages to facilitate
efficient construction operations (large contracts).
The risk of a slower buildup of benefits than the
conservative estimate made has been minimized by
introducing a strict monitoring system and remedial
measures to be taken to improve agricultural
performance if necessary.

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
DEMOCRATIC AND POPULAR REPUBLIC OF ALGERIA
CHELW! IRIGATION PROJECT
L INTRODUCTION
1.01     During the '970s, Algeria experienced high economic growth, with
Gross Domestic Production (GDP), in constant prices, increasing by 7.2Z p.a.
and GNP per capita more than doubling to US$1,930 in 1980. The evolution of
the economy was characterized by strong investment growth (more than
151 p.a.), a aigh savings rate (about 38% of GDP), substantial growth in the
hydrocarbon, industry and construction sectors, high employment creation and
sustained regional development efforts. However, in addition to pressure on
external and domestic financial resources, there were serious imbalances in
the distribution of investment between industry and other sectors, especially
the agricultural sector, during this period. As a result, the agricultural
sector was unable to satisfy the rapidly increasing food consumption (6X p.a.
from the mid 19609 to the late 1970s) and imports g ew sharply to fill the
gap. This growing dependence on food imports caused the Government, in the
context of the 1980-84 Economic Development Plan, to increase public
investment and to introduce major reforms to improve performance of the
agricultural sector.
1.02     These reforms included the promotion of private sector activity in
agriculture and small- and medium-scale industries through selective credit
and taxation measures, decentralizing and restructuring parastatal enterprises
and state farms, introducing financial incentives to improve labor
productivity and deregulating some agricultural m&rketing and prices. The
reforms are being continued under the current 1985-89 Plan.
1.03     Among the measures taken to improve agricultural productivity are
those aimed at the irrigation subsector which provides 402 of agricultural
production. Programs are underway to expand the availability of irrigation
water and to improve the efficiency of its use by extending and rehabilitating
large-scale irrigation perimeters, expanding small- and medium-scale
irrigation development, establishing institutions capable of ensuring adequate
O&M, and improving cost recovery policy and mechanisms. The proposed project
would contribute to these objectives by extending irrigation over new areas
and improving the efficiency of existing irrigation works in the Cheliff river
basin, and by improving O&M activities and cost recovery. The Project was
identified during a Bank reconnaissance mission which visited Algeria in
February 1985. It was prepared by the Government with assistance of the
FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program in January 1986 and appraised in April-May 1986
by a mission composed of Mr. Darghouth (mission leader), Ms. Effron (Bank),
Mr. Dumaxet (FAO/CP) and Messrs. Abu Sharr and Feher (consultants).

EL THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
A. Role of AMriculture in The Econom
General Performance of the Sector
2.01     Algeria has a total land area of 238 million ha of which 48.5 million
ha are suitable for agriculture and grazing. Forests and esparto grass cover
9 million ha and 32 million ha are used for grazing. Of the 7.5 million ha of
cultivable area, 36S are planted in cereals, 8% in forage crops, 3S in
vegetables, 22 in pulses, and 431 is normally left fallow. Algeria's ratio of
irrigable land to arable land is very low (11% compared with Morocco's 191)
reflecting scarcity of water resources. Algeria has an irrigation potential
of about 800,000 ha of which about 400,000 ha are presently irrigable and
about 310,000 ha effectively irrigated. Of the cultivable land, 4.7 million
ha or 631 are under private farms and 2.8 million ha or 37S under socialist
farms.
2.02     The rapidly growing "food gap" is a major current issue for Algeria.
As a result of the rapid increase in population and per capita incomes, demand
for food has grown faster than supply. Algeria's food self-suffiency ratio
fell to 401 in 1984 from roughly 901 in 1962. This decline has been
particularly severe for cereals, imports of which, after practically
quadrupling during the 1970s, now meet almost two-thirds of the country's
needs. At the same time, the volume of food exports (principally wine,
fruits, and vegetables) fell by almost 901 during the last decade,
representing only 3% of total imports at the end of the period, compared with
631 at the beginning. During the 1980-84 Plan period, Algeria had to spend
almost 151 of its merchandise export earnings to import foodstuffs (cereals,
dairy products, sugar, oil products, etc.).
2.03     The food gap has increased in spite of the respectable growth in the
value added of the agricultural sector of about 41 per year since 1973-75.
Most of the growth has occurred in the relatively high-value vegetables (7.41
per year) and fresh fruits (4.31 per year - other than citrus and grapes),
which in any case are not imported, and in animal production (9.71 per year)
where total consumption has grown even faster. Thus the high growth of these
subsectors has not affected the food self-sufficiency of Algeria, while the
performance of cereals and legumes has been stagnant and that of citrus fruit
and wine grapes has been downward (-6% per year). It is the indifferent
performance of cereals and poor performance of citrus and wine products that
underlies the increase in food imports and the decrease in agricultural
exports during this period. In spite of the overall increase in value added
of agricultural production since 1973-75, the agricultural sector's
contribution to Algeria's GDP has declined steadily from 161 in 1960 to about
6% in 1984. This decline reflects primarily the higher relative growth of
other sectors, principally petroleum and, to a lesser extent, the
manufacturing industry.
2.04     The uneven performance of the sector is partly because agriculture
has to date been unable to achieve public investment program targets. The
z9s:z



-3-
effective share of agriculture in total public investment over the period
1975-84 amounted to about 4.51. In addition, the amounts allocated to
investment in agriculture under successive development plans have been
systematically under-implemented as a result of institutional, organizational
and managerial constraints. The 61 allocation in the 1980-84 Plan has not
been achieved and disbursements have fallen short of budgetary allocations.
While purchase of equipment (tractors, agricultural equipment, farm machinery,
equipment for crop growing under plastic) for the socialist sector and more
recently for the private sector has been favored, little attention has been
paid to modernization of agricultural infrastructure, equipment of irrigated
areas, and facilities for stock raising. Investment in water resource
development has been focussed on the construction of water storage works and
facilities for the supply and distribution of water for household
consumption. Improvements in the irrigation infrastructure have been delayed
by a shortage of prepared projects, cumbersome procedures in contract awards,
and an inefficient local construction industry.
2.05     For all crops, including those enjoying the most favorable
conditions, yields remain low in comparison with other Mediterranean countries
despite their increase in 1984-85. For most crops, average yields represent
50 to 70% of those in neighboring countries. Yields of most crops did not
increase between 1980 and 1984 despite the increase in investment in
agricultural equipment and inputs channeled to the sector, due largely to
successive drought years. With greatly improved weather, greatly improved
harvests were obtained in 1985 and 1986 and the effects of increased
investment and reorganization in the sector are becoming apparent.
Reforms Introdued During the 1980-84 Plan
2.06     With a view to ensuring optimum use of production capacities,
maintaining and revitalizing agriculture and stemming rural depopulation, the
Government introduced a series of reforms in the sector in the 1980-84
Economic Development Plan which have been gradually implemented over the last
five years. Many of these reforms are consistent with recommendations made by
the Bank in the 1981 Agricultural Sector Survey.L' The reforms have been
primarily aimed at improvements in four areas: (a) performance of socialist
sector farms; (b) support provided to the private sector farms; (c)
organization of marketing; and (d) current marketing and pricing policy
through deregulation. The reorganization of the socialist sector farms is a
major sectoral issue directly relevant to the Project; it is treated in paras.
3.09 - 3.11. Progress in the three other aspects are discussed below.
2.07     Important steps have been taken to give a greater role to the private
sector in agricultural production and services since 1981. This has resulted
in the quantity of the major inputs (fertilizers and farm machinery equipment)
distributed to the private farmers doubling over the last five years. The
Bank for Agriculturl. and Rural Development (BADR) has put greater emphasis on
lending for the private sector: loans to the private sector and the number of
1/ Algeria: Agricultural sector memorandum (Report No. 3593-AL), September
1981.
29g3g



-4-
private farmer clients almost quadrupled between 1983 and 1985. For input
supply, the role of the private retailers in distributing spare parts of
agricultural machinery and in providing repair services is increasing. In
addition, about 850,000 ha of state or. cooperative lands have been distributed
to private farmers: 740,000 ha as a result of the restructuring of the
self-managed socialist farms and the dismantling of the production former
cooperatives (para. 3.09) and 110,000 ha distributed under a program started
by Government in 1984 to encourage land reclamation and use in the southern
and central regions of the country. Promotion of the private sector is also a
major objective of the current 1985-89 Development Plan.
2.08     As part of the restructuring effort, marketina aaencies, both for
inputs and outputs, have been placed on a more sound financial footing: their
accumulated debts have been assumed by Government, additional capital in the
form of both equity and loans have been provided and operating norms have been
established for each marketing agency to monitor their performance. In
addition, the Government has decentralized several national marketing agencies
by setting up three regional Offices (East, Center, West) in place of the one
centralized bureau to serve the needs of each respective region. For
distribution of most seasonal inputs at a local level (district and province),
Government services have been transferred to financially reorganized
cooperatives. These cooperatives act as distribution agencies that depend on
the national inputs marketing agency, ONAPSA (Office National des
Approvisionnements et des Services Agricoles). The impact this restructuring
will have on timely and adequate delivery of inputs and marketing of output
and on improved financial performance remains to be seen but the early years
since restructuring have shown some promise (para. 2.10).
2.09     The aricultural price and marketing system has been gradually
deregulated since 1981. All producers, including those in the socialist
sector, are now free to sell their products outside the state marketing
agencies, except for cereals, pulses, edible oils and industrial crops. This
has considerably strengthened the role of the private sector in the marketing
of agricultural produce, at both wholesale and retail levels. As the prices
paid by private traders are higher than those offered by official buyers, the
function of the latter now appears to be essentially to absorb surplus
production and keep regional supply and demand in balance. Since 1982, retail
prices for perishable products have in practice been mostly deregulated and
administered prices for cereals, pulses and wine have been increased
substantially (40-802) and are now somewhat above border prices.
Reeent Trendsand RemaniAng Constraints
2.10     Because the reform measures have been put into effect only recently,
it is too early to assess their impact on the growth of agricultural
production. The restructuring of the agricultural sector involved a
considerable effort on the part of all the institutions involved (redeployment
of personnel, establishment of new structures, reorganization of existing
boards often performing varied functions). The structural changes introduced
in the socialist production sector, the lack of experience among new
supervisors, and problems in starting up the new input distribution systems
2Ss9g



hampered any immediate expansion in production whicb remained stagnant up to
1983/84, although agricultural growth was also greatly affected by a far below
normal rainfall in 1981-1984. Production increased impressively, due to a
combination of factors including good weather, in 1984/85. The major positive
results that can be partially attributed to the Government reforms can be
sumarized as follows: (a) after an intensive campaign to promote cereal
production, cereal production in 1984/85, a year of favorable weather,
sharply increased to its highest level ever of 3.1 M tons, which can be
compared to 2.4 M tons in 1980, also a year of good weather; (b) following the
deregulation of prices and maketing, there has been conticuous growth in
production of vegetables (SS p.a.) and poultry products (132 p.a. for meat)
since 1980; (c) the proportion of profitable socialist farms has increased
from 20S to 30S; (d) the majority of cne marketing agencies were profitable in
1985; (e) the quantity of inputs marketed by the newly restructured marketing
agencies increased substantially; fertilizer distribution, for example,
increased by 36% between 1984 and 1985; and (f) the private sector has had
access to additional land, more credit and more inputs (para. 2.07).
2.11     Despite these improvements, much remains to be done. Performance of
the agricultural sector can still be greatly improved and major issues are:
(a) shortages and untimely distribution of agricultural inputs and credit,
particularly for the private sector; (b) inadequate research programs and
extension services, particularly for the private sector, and insufficient
staff training; (c) limited use of igrigation potential (para. 3.02); (d)
inadequate incentives for workers in socialist farms to achieve higher
productivity; (e) limited capacity of the agricultural sector to use the
investment allocations and to implement projects; and (f) need for continued
reform of the system for setting producer and input prices (including
irrigation water). The irrigation subsector, even though it contributes about
40% of national production, has under-performed compared to its potential,
because insufficient funds have been allocated for rehabilitation and
management improvement and because institutional arrangements in place for
using irrigation facilities efficiently are inadequate. The Bank has begun a
dislogue with the Government that covers each .of these aspects, with
particular focus on the first three topics.
B. Experience with Past LendI   In the Secto
2.12     Bank Group lending for Agriculture in Algeria started in 1974, and to
date only three projects have been approved for a total of US$58 million of
Bank funds. Performance under these three projects was mixed, reflecting the
institutional constraints in the sector. The Technical Assistance - Rural
Development Project (Loan 1159-AL) was completed in 1983 after considerable
delays mainly due to lack of commitment, lack of coordination and poor
supervision by Ministry of Agriculture. In spite of the delays, the Project
partly met its objectives of analyzing the major constraints and designing
and, in some cases, testing different approaches to rural development in
Algeria. The Bas-Cheliff Irrigation Project (Loan 1802-AL) was 80% completed
when the Government and the Bank decided to close the Loan in 1985, two years
after the Closing Date foreseen at appraisal. Delays occurred after bidding
when no offers or expressions of interest were received for the major civil
29,93

works because of the very modest size of these works. The works were finally
carried out by a local public sector enterprise. The project's physical works
will be completed by the end of 1986 and project studies have provided an
essential framework for the future development of the Cheliff river basin
(paras. 4.01 - 4.04). The Meat Industry Project (Luan 1739-AL) was cancelled
in 1983 at the Government's request, a few months after the Loan became
effective. No reasons were given by the Government for this request.
Experience gained during the implementation of the Bas Cheliff Project has
been used in the design of the proposed project. The works have been packaged
so that their sizs  is such that larger, efficient contractors are likely to
express interest in implementing these works. In addition, bidding for part
of the major works has already started to ensure that procurement does not
become a major source of delay.
mI THE IRRGATION SUDSECTOR
A. General Performance
3.01     Although some 40X of current agricultural production value is from
the irrigated areas, the potential for increased production from existing
irrigated areas and for development of new irrigation is still important. The
estimates available show that the total area that can be irrigated is about
800,000 ha or 10.5S of total arable land (7.5 million ha) compared with only
310,000 ba presently actually irrigated. These include 180,000 ha (or 602) in
the socialist farms and 130,000 ha (or 40%) in the private sector farms.
Between Independence in 1962 and 1980 total irrigation area almost stagnated
because the slow development of new irrigated areas was offset by the decline
in the use of land equipped for irrigation.
3.02     The present use of existing irrigation infrastructure is low. The
current irrigated land (310,000 ha) represents about 702 of the estimated
400,000 ha of land equipped for irrigation. The main reasons for the
under-utilization of the irrigated systems reflect the lack of interest given
to the irrigation sector before 1980 and are: (a) increased use of water to
meet urban and industrial demand without coensurate investments in water
development structures reducing, therefore, the amount of water available for
irrigation; (b) insufficient investment programs for irrigation before 1980
causing: (i) limited rehabilitation of old irrigation systems; and (ii) lack
of adequate drainage systems, which were considered unnecessary at the time of
construction, causing serious soil salinization in many areas; and (c) lack of
adequate maintenance of irrigation structures and equipment causing
inefficient use of water for irrigation (para. 3.05). While the use of
existing irrigation infrastructure, in particular in the large-scale
perimeters, is low for the reasons stated above, the limited water available
at the field level is fully used and primarily devoted to the most highly
profitable crops, mainly vegetables and fruit trees which together cover 802
of the total irrigated area.

Prospeots for the Iritation Subsector
3.03     A major effort to boost the performance of the irrigation subsector
started with the 1980-84 National Development Plan. Actual investment
expenditures for water development increased from 850 million DA/year during
the 1977-79 Plan to 2,420 million DA/year during the 1980-84 Plan, almost a
twofold increase in constant terms. The most noticeable progress was made,
however, in the mobilization of additional water resources by the construction
of new dams and main infrastructure. Thus, in order to make up for the
insufficiency of water supplies and enable existing schemes to be used more
fully, nine dams have been commissioned since 1980 and twelve others are being
constructed, while only three dams were constructed between 1962 and 1980.
This has about doubled the annual surface water resources available for
irrigation in Algeria and will make possible a much fuller use of existing
irrigation facilities. However, Government performance in building the
irrigation facilities to make full use of these newly mobilized water supplies
has been hampered due to lack of engineering studies, delays in construction
works, and inadequate supervisory capacity from Ministere de l'Hydraulique, de
l'Snvironnement et des Forets (MHEF). As a result, the progress in developing
irrigation over new lands during the 1980-84 Plan was lower than planned
('7,500 ha instead of 50,000 ha, an implementation rate of 752) and renovation
of existing irrigation perimeters was even lower (10,000 ha out of 25,000 ha
planned, an implementation rate of 40X).
3.04     Under the 1985-89 Plan, the Government continues to give an important
role to the irrigation subsector as a key part of the effort to improve
performance of the agricultural sector. The main objectives assigned for this
subsector under this Plan are to: (a) continue mobilization of additional
water resources by completing construction of the 12 on-going storage dams and
initiating the construction of 17 others; (b) continue expansion and
renovation works with the aim of putting under irrigation an additional 50,000
ha in the large-scale irrigation (LSI) areas and 25,000 ha in the small- and
medium-scale irrigation (SMSI) areas; (c) intensify irrigation in the southern
areas through drilling of tubewells; and (d) carry out a number of key studies
with a particular emphasis on river basin water master plans of which the most
important, the Cheliff Water Master Plan (paras. 4.01 - 4.04), has already
been completed under the Bas Cheliff Irrigation Project financed by the Bank
(under Loan 1802-AL). On the institutional side, the Government intends to
improve O&M of existing irrigation areas, improve cost recovery, enhance the
performance of the public construction companies, expand staff training
programs, and complete water legislation. In view of recent budgetary
constraints because of the drop in oil revenues, Government was asked to
confirm to the Bank that sufficient priority would be given to the irrigation
subsector to ensure project funding. Government has confirmed this and has
submitted to the Bank details on the size and composition of the revised
expenditure program for the irrigation sector for the 1985-87 period which
clearly shows the importance given to irrigation in current policy.

B  Subsector Iss1   Relevant to the ProJect
Organization for Operation and Ma te
3.05     Operation and maintenance of irrigation schemes have been long
neglected in Algeria resulting in a serious deterioration of the irrigation
system. Operation and maintenance are the responsibility of MHEF field
subdivisional units located in each irrigation district. These units have had
little autonomy and have lacked qualified staff and financial resources for
adequate O&M. Most of the 06M staff are experienced but are relatively
discouraged by the poor condition of the networks. Practically all authority
including awarding of contracts is centralized in the Ministry's Regional
offices located in the provincial capitals which leads to inefficiencies in
ongoing maintenance work.
3.06     The problem of O&M was raised in 1984 by the Bank, which urged the
Government to take steps to enhance efficiency of OEM operations in the LSI
perimeters like those in Cheliff, before financing any new projects in the
subsector. Government responded by taking measures to address this issue:
(a) in October 1985, two decrees were issued: onel' defining the roles and
responsibilities and the othert' the statute of new autonomous Irrigation
Authorities (OPI, Offices des Perimetres Irrigues) to be responsible for O&M
in the country's LSI perimeters; (b) at the same time, four decrees were
Issued for the creation of OPIs including one in the Cheliff River Valley
encompassing the project area; (c) a study by international consultants on the
detailed organization and management of the Cheliff OPI and financed by the
French CCCEI" was started in March 1987; the findings of this study will be
used to help set up the proper organization and management structures of the
other OPIs throughout the country. The new OPIs will be state-owned
enterprises with a separate legal entity and financial autonomy. Their Board
of Directors will include representatives of local government as well as local
farmers in the irrigation schemes. Through contractual agreements to be
signed with the MHEF, OPIs will be made responsible for: (a) adequate water
distribution among farmers; (b) operating and maintaining the irrigation and
drainage systems under their control; (c) collecting water charges; and (d)
providing assistance to farmers for on-farm water management. These recent
actions undertaken by Government to create the conditions to permit improved
O&M are a major step toward starting to resolve these problems in Algeria.
The proposed project would include the necessary investments (equipment and
vehicles) required to establish the Cheliff OPI and provide technical
assistance to help put into effect the proposals of the study mentioned above
on organization, management, and operations of the new Cheliff OPI (para.
5.07).

water charges were kept low and were revised only once between 1972 and 1985.
This bas resulted in inadequate budgeting of funds for 06M. However,
substantial improvements in cost recovery policy were introduced in 1985:
(a) in October 1985, Government issued a decreeL' defining the policy
framework of cost recovery in the LSI perimeters. The main features
of this policy are that:
(i)    water charges will continue to be based on a binominal rate
structure including: a fixed annual levy, based on the nominal
hydraulic capacity at the farm turnout gate applied on a per
liter/second/hectare (li//ha) basis and a volumetric charge
applied on a per m3 basis; the charge structure is supposed to
encourage use of the irrigation network in particular for winter
crops when water is plentiful; and
(ii)    the principle of recovering a proportion of capital costs was
established; the decree did not specify how this would be done,
although in practice the fixed annual levy mentioned above-and
the on-farm itrigation works which are generally left to
farmers' financing are meant to ensure farmers' contribution to
capital cost recovery;
(b)  it was stated in the decree creating the OPIs (para. 3.06) that water
charge revenues of the Offices should cover O& as well as the
replacement costs of all hydroa-mchanical and electromechanical
equipment; and
(c) Government issued at the same date a joint ministerial order
increasing the 1979 water charges, as follows:

3.08     However, although increased by more than 501 in current terms, water
charges remained almost unchanged in constant terms and are still low: they
currently cover less than 60% of operation and maintenance costs. At the same
time, they also currently represent only a low percentage of the cost of
produetion of the irrigated crops ranging, for example, in the proposed
project area, from about 31 for the socialist farms to 62 for private
farmers. They can be increased without seriously affecting farmers' revenues
(para. 7.17). Because of the great scarcity of water, farmers know that if
they do not pay the due charges, water will be delivered instead to those
farmers who are ready to pay. Water charge collection rates are therefore
good (they exceed 802). However, a current issue is that water charge
receipts are transferred directly to the Treasury and there is therefore no
assurance that collected funds will be made available to finance OUM
requirements. The proposed project would include actions to introduce further
improvements in cost recovery in the Cheliff perimeter (para. 7.15).
Performance of Socials Sector Farms
3.09     At least 601 of the areas currently under irrigation and the bulk of
new lands that could be developed in large schemes are formed by socialist
sector farms. Because of their poor performance and low productivity in the
past, reorganization of socialist farms became necessary and was started by
Government in 1982. It was aimed at establishing farm enterprises that are
technically efficient and financially viable. The program started with the
implementation of land consolidation in the 2,100 self-managed farms and the
6,400 production cooperatives existing in the country and covered over
3.7 million ha. As a result of the restructuring of the former self-managed
and cooperative farms: (a) close to 3,400 manageable production units
(DAS)-' have been formed with an average size of 680 ha each (against 1,140
ha prior to restructuring), covering a total of 2.3 millions' ha of arable
land; (b) production cooperatives have been dissolved because of their past
failure; and (c) about 740,000 ha of land which could not be allocated to the
DAS efficiently have been distributed to small private farmers as individual
holdings.
3.10     In addition to this land consolidation program, the following major
organizational changes have been introduced: (a) the DAS have been grouped
together, 25 to 30 at r time, to be assisted by 108 technical advisory units
(SDA, Se..teurs de developpement agricole) under the responsibility of
agronomists assigned to assist the managers of the DAB; (b) DAS management
units have been granted greater authority over farm level planning and
operational and financial management. Government no longer imposes farm plans
which are now established by the management unit councils in collaboration
with their SDA; (c) a large number of engineers and technicians have been
hired as farm managers of the restructured new DAS farms to replace
unqualified personnel. These have become full members of the management units
and have full decision making power in the planning and management of the
farms. For most farms, qualified accountants have also been hired. At the

same time most of the elderly workers have been encouraged, with some success,
to retire; and (d) performance criteria and a monitoring system of the farms'
operations has been established, the accounting system of the farms has been
simplified and improved and strict auditing measures introduced.
3.11     Although it is too soon after the restructuring to form a firm
judgment on its effectiveness in improving overall DAS performance, first
signs are encouraging. The proportion of profitable DAS increased from 202 to
302 between 1984 and 1985, for example. For that part of the project covered
by DAS, measures would be taken under the proposed project to ensure that any
DAB benefitting from project works would be restructured to facilitate
efficient use of these facilities and strict performance and profitability
monitoring would be introduced (paxa. 6.12).
N. THE PROJECT AREA
A.  he Cheiff Water Master Pla
4.01     The project area is the Cheliff river basin, which is situated 100 to
200 km south-east of Algiers. This river basin, which covers 44,500 kma, is
the la:gest in the country and one which shows the greatest potential for
development given the land and water resources presently unused. A Water
Master Plan to complete the development of Cheliff was completed under the
Bank financed Bas Cheliff Irrigation Project (Loan 1802-AL) in 1983-85.
4.02     Full development of the water resources of the Cheliff basin would
provide for a total annual assured water supply of 870 Mm3 of which the
total annual regulated surface flow would be about 545 Mm' and 325 Mm3 of
ground water and unregulated Fsirface water. These waters have been allocated
under the Master Plan giving priority to urban and individual use, as follows:

4.04     About 60,600 ha are presently equipped for irrigation; they include
16,300 ha new sprinkler schemes in Haut Cheliff completed in 1984/85 and
44,300 ha old surface irrigation schemes in Moyen and Bas Cheliff. Only
16,250 ha, or 27S, were irrigated in 1985 because of deterioration of the
existing irrigation infrastructure, inadequate drainage in some areas and,
more particularly, lack of developed water resources. The three dams



-13-
completed in 1985s' are rot yet fully operational but, when filled, these
dams will permit a further 20,000 ha to be irrigated. As recommended by the
Master Plan, eight storage dams will finally be operational and a total of
about 66,000 ha will be equipped and fully irrigated. Taking into account the
investments made so far by the Government in the Cheliff Valley and by
optimizing the use of all the land and water resources, the Master Plan has
determined the optimal investment program, including: (a) the construction of
the eighth reservoir damL' (the Sidi Mohamed Ben Taiba dam) '^cated on the
Ebda river which is an upstream tributary of the Cheliff River (see map); (b)
rehabilitation of about 26,900 ha or about 60% of the area of the existing
deteriorated old schemes, and abandonment of the other equipped area; and (c)
construction of new schemes over about 22,800 ha. Investments are proposed to
be carried out over a period of eleven years. The proposed project would
finance a first time-slice of this program involving the development and
rehabilitation of irrigation systems in the upper and lower parts of the
Cheliff Valley.
B. Locaton, Climate and Soils
4.05     Within the Cheliff river basin, there would be two separate
subproject areas where irrigation works will be carried out under the
Project: one in the Haut Cheliff covering about 8,000 ha (about 30% of the
new irrigation included in the Master Plan) and the other in the Bas Cheliff
covering about 5,000 ha (about 20% of the rehabilitation work included in the
Master Plan). The Haut Cheliff subproject area is located in the Ain Defla
district (in Ain Defla Province) which is about 100 km southwest of Algiers
and the Bas Cheliff subproject area is located in the Oued Rhiou district (in
Relizane Province), about 70 km east of Amn Defla (see map).
4.06     The climate in the project area is characterized by cool wet winters
followed by hot, dry summers. Dry periods extend over four months and the
rainfall, averaging 414 mm in Bas Cheliff and 474 mm in Haut Cheliff, shows
great variations from year to year. Average monthly temperatures vary widely
from 9C in January to 29@C in August. Under these conditions, rainfed
farming is limited to some winter crops (wheat, barley, vetch-oat).
Irrigation is necessary for diversifying crops in winter, growing crops in
summer and obtaining high yields.
4.07     While soils in Haut Cheliff are mostly deep, light and highly
permeable and have high gradient, those in Bas Cheliff are heavy and less
permeable. Soil capability analysis indicates no major problems for growing
vegetables, fruits, and forage in the Haut Cheliff subproject area. Extensive
soil, hydrological and topographic surveys undertaken in the Bas Cheliff
district area since 1966 were completed and analyzed by consultants under the
Water Master Plan studies. They determined that tile drainage is needed over
1/ At present, three storage dams are operational in the Cheliff River (the
Ghrib, Fodda and Sidi Ben Ebda dams), three others completed in 1985 are
being filled (the Sly, Harreza and Deurdeur dams) and one is being
constructed (the Gargar dam) (see map).

These areas include only those that will be irrigated under the Project.
While almost all the private participating farmers' lands are fully within the
irrigated areas, the socialist farms are only partly within the proposed
irrigated area so that part of these farms would remain under rainfed
agriculture. Socialist farms average a total of 820 ha in Haut Cheliff and
500 ha in Bas Cheliff. Private land distribution is characterized by the
predominance of small farms. While farm sizes average 4.1 ha in Haut Cheliff
and 2.2 ha in Bas Cheliff, 851 of the farm units have less than 2 ha in Raut
Cheliff and less than 5 ha in Bas Cheliff. Current land distribution of
private farms related to farm sizes is as follows:

4.09     Present Land Use.  At present, about 16% of the total subproject
areas, or 2,130 ha, are already irrigated, including 1,760 ha in Bas Cheliff
and 370 ha in Raut Cheliff. Irrigation in Haut Cheliff is made mainly through
individual shallow wells, but also through tubewells and pumping from the
Cheliff River. Irrigation in Bas Cheliff is made through the existing public
surface irrigation scheme served by the Boukader diversion weir and main
canals rehabilitated under the Bas Cheliff Project (Loan 1802-ALG). The
distribution network, which was not included in the Bas Cheliff Project, was
developed in 1936 and has exceeded its economic life. The elevated irrigation
canals and outlets are deteriorated and drainage channels are silted up. This
deterioration was exacerbated by inadequate operation and maintenance of the
systems over the past 20 years. Because of insufficient water resources,
irrigation is presently restricted to the summer crops (April-October) and
rainfed crops are grown in winter.
4.10     Cropping patterns are currently characterized by the predominance of
cereals (wheat, barley, oat) and legumes (vetch, beans) in the rainfed areas
where fallow still occupies a certain portion (about 81 in Haut Cheliff and
131 in 8as Cheliff). In the areas already irrigated, vegetables are
predominant, mainly potato, melon, watermelon, onion and cauliflower. Fruit
trees are also grown, mainly citrus but also olive trees in Bas Cheliff. Due
to strong demand for most fruit and vegetables in the country and the
liberalization of the marketing system since 1982, farmers who grow irrigated
crops currently obtain very high prices for most of their production (para.
2.09) and thus generate high revenues. Irrigated farming is consequently
highly profitable. The net returns per hectare from irrigated vegetable
production are high: they vary from US$2,000 for season tomato to US$12,000
for melons, and there is room for higher returns because current crop yields
are low (para. 7.04) and farming techniques still inadequate. The use of
improved seeds, fertilizers and pesticides are low, farming operations are not
always undertaken on time due to delays in input distribution by some public
marketing bureaus, farm machinery equipment is lacking, and technical staff is
still lacking in most DAS in Bas Cheliff despite the increased technical staff
at the DAS level in the country as whole since 1982 (para. 3.10).
D. Water Demand and REsourtes
4.11     Water requirements at full development have been estimated for the
climatic conditions prevailing in both subproject areas. Based on an average
on-farm efficiency of 801 in Haut Cheliff and 701 in Bas Cheliff and on a
conveyance distribution efficiency of 951 in Haut Cheliff (sprinkler
irrigation system) and 801 in Bas Cheliff (canal and low-pressure pipe
irrigation system), the annual diversion water requirements are estimated at
7 400 m3/ha or 59 Mm3 in Haut Cheliff and 10,600 m3/ha (including 1,560
m for leaching) or 53 Mm3 in Bas Cheliff.
4.12     The water resources development potential in the two subproject areas
has been estimated by the studies undertaken under the Cheliff Water Master
Plan. Water for the Haut Cheliff area would be pumped from the Cheliff river
after releases from the Cheliff upstream dams which would also irrigate two
upstream perimeters. The upstream dams include the Ghrib dam (annual
29931



-16-
regulated flow, RF = 82 Mm3, constrsicted in 1936), the Deurdeur (RF = 44
Mm ) and the Harreza (RF   24 Mm3) dams commissioned in 1985 and the Sidi
Mohamed Ben Taiba dam (RF a 56 Mm3) planned to be constructed in 1988-92
(see map). Preliminary designs of this dam have been completed under the
Master Plan and detailed designs of this dam are currently underway. The two
upstream perimeters are 16,300 ha in Khemis Meliana completed in 1984 and 800
ha along the Deurdeur river planned to be constructed in 1988/89. Before the
Sidi Mohamed Ben Taiba dam is constructed, the demand for water in the
subproject area would be met by releases from the currently existing dams
after irrigation of the Khemis Meliana scheme. Starting in 1994, water
regulated in the existing dams would become insufficient to meet the
requirements of all Haut Cheliff perimeters (including the subproject area)
and the Sidi Mohamed Ben Taiba dam is planned to be commissioned by then. In
order to ensure that there are adequate water supplies for the Project in 1994
and beyond, Government has confirmed that funds for the construction of the
Sidi Mohamed Ben Taiba dam as well as for the project works have been firmly
scheduled in the Development Plan starting in 1987. In addition, the
Government has assured that it would cause construction of the dam to be
completed before September 30, 1993. Furthermore, it was agreed at
negotiations that after December 31, 1988 no further disbursements would be
made against Project infrastructure and equipment in Haut Cheliff unless the
tender documents had been issued for the construction of the Sidi Mohamed Ben
Taiba dam (para. 5.20). Water for the Bas Cheliff suborolect area would
originate from unregulated flows of the Cheliff river diverted at the existing
Boukader diversion weir rehabilitated under the Bas Cheliff Irrigation Project
(1802-AL). In winter, part of the diverted flows would be used for
irrigation, the other part is stored in the existing Merja Sidi Abed storage
reservoir (see map). This reservoir has a capacity of 57 Mm3 and would
provide a regulated volume of 48 Nm' per year or 901 of the irrigation
requirements of the subproject area. Water stored in the reservoir would be
delivered for irrigation during the low rainfall season (April to October)
with the balance of the requirements coming from direct river diversion in the
winter. Because of the importance of the upstream structures to the success
of the Project, agreement was obtained at negotiations that Government would
ensure routine safety inspection of all dams upstream of both Haut and Bas
Cheliff subproject araas.
4.13     At full development, water balance in the Haut Cheliff and the Bas
Cheliff subproject areas would be as follows:

E. Agricultural Support Servkies andMtitutios
4.14     The wholesale supply of inputs and agricultural machinery in the
Project area, as in the rest of Algeria, is the responsibility of specialized
Government agencies (Offices). At a local lovel, distribution is mainly
handled by specialized cooperatives although private sector traders are also
licensed to sell these products.
4.15     Seeds, Plants and Seedlings.  In the project area a certain number of
DAS are contracted by the Coop6ratives des C6r6ales et des L6gumes Secs (CCLS)
in Ain Defla and Relizane to multiply certified cereals and pulse seeds. The
CCLS then collect, select, condition, and store the seeds. For vegetable seed
production, the Union des Coop6ratives de Semences Maraicheres (UNICOSAM)
organizes local production, although most seeds for potatoes and other
vegetables are imported by the Office National des Approvisionnements et
Services Agricoles (ONAPSA). At the local level, the Cooperatives Agricoles
Specialis6es en Approvisionnements (CASSAP) in Ain Defla and Relizane handle
the collection and distribution of vegetable seeds through their network of
agents. Research Institutes which specialixe in various crops are responsible
for overseeing the selection, testing, and adaptive trials of the appropriate
varieties and in the case of cereals, for the seed certification as well.
Timely delivery of adequate quantities of seed has not been a problem in the
project area, although the poor quality of the vegetable seeds, which affects
farmers throughout the country, is an issue and is being addressed on a
national level under the current National Development Plan.
2999t



-18-
4.16     Fertilixers. Plant Protection Chemicalss Animal Feed and Veterinary
Supplies. At the national level, ONAPSA is responsible for the distribution
of all fertilizers and plant protection chemicals domestically produced and
imported and for the import of pure-bred heifers. At a local level, the
CASSAP and their agents and depots distribute these inputs. Animal feed and
veterinary supplies are the responsibility of the Office National des Aliments
du B6tail (ONAB) at a national level and the Coop6ratives de Services
Specialisees en Elevage (COOPSSEL) at a local level. While the DAS in the
project area have had no serious interruptions in the timely supply of needed
inputs, the private farms, as elsewhere in the country, continue to have
limited access to inputs. The situation Is improving, however, as the
Government has been making an increased effort to supply the private sector
with inputs and, in the past five years, an increased portion of fertilizer
has gone to the private sector. In order to ensure that adequate attention is
given by input agencies to the needs of the project area, the Government has
agreed that it would cause input deliveries to the Project participants to be
timely and in adequate quantities to meet demand.
4.17     Agricultural Eauipment and Machinery Services.  The Office National
du Mat6riel Agricole (ONAMA) has the monopoly on the distribution of all
agricultural equipment, its after-sales service, repair work and supply of
spare parts. The project area is served by the southern regional headquarters
of this office at Ain Defla, and two agents in Relizane. As of 1986, several
private agents have also been licensed to sell spare parta and do some repair
work. Although the supply of agricultural equipment does not fully meet
demand in the project area, Government has made progress in providing greater
access over the years to the private sector.
Agnidtural Credit
4.18     Since 1982 when the BADR was created from the Banque Nationale
d'Alg6rie, all credit to the agricultural and rural sector has been channeled
through the BADR. The BADR had, as of mid-1986, 31 regional offices at the
provincial level and about 200 branch offices. In the project area,
agricultural credit is handled by a regional office and about 15 branch
offices and credit delivery to farmers has greatly expanded in recent years.
4.19     Lending to the DAS has, in the past, been virtually automatic, as the
loans were implicitly guaranteed by Government. However, for DAS consistently
making operating losses and unable to repay their loans, Government has now
introduced financial discipline by allowing BADR to refuse credit to
uncreditworthy clients. Lending to the private sector has certain constraints
which involve problems of guarantees for long-term loans and reaching adequate
numbers of small-scale farmers. Nevertheless, impressive efforts have been
made to reach the private sector in the project area, including establishing
mobile credit units accompanied by input distribution agents and since 1982
the number of private farmers receiving short-term credit in the two provinces
of the project area increased from 324 in 1982 to about 3,500 in 1985. The
issues of credit delivery are nationwide and are being discussed with
Government under a separate operation.

4.20     As of October 1, 1986, the terms of lending are aa follows:
TERMS OF LENDING
Repayment Period   Grace Period  Interest Rate
Short-Term               12 - 14 months         -          4.5 - 7.0%
Medium-Term                  7 years        0 - 2 years   4.0 - 7.0%
Long-Term                 8 - 12 years      0 - 4 years   3.0 - 6.02
The loans to the DAS are financed at 100% of the investment costs, while to
the private sector the financing varies from 60 to 801.
Extension ad Research
4.21     Extension.  Extension is under the auspices of the Direction de
l'agriculture et de la p$che de Wilaya (DAP) and is the responsibility of the
Secteurs de d6veloppement agricole (SDA) for the DAS and of the D6l6gation
agricole de Daira (DAD) for the private farmers. The SDA are responsible for:
(a) giving technical and managerial advice on carrying out the investment and
production plans; (b) serving as liaisons between research findings and DAS
cropping activities; and (c) providing statistics on the production plans,
input and equipment requirements, and financing plans of the DAS with the
cooperatives and Offices and the credit committee".  In the provinces of
the project area four SDA cover a total of 98 DAS in Ain Defla and 2 SDA
supervise 48 DAS in Relizane. Each SDA is staffed by three or four technical
graduates specializing in different aspects of DAS production and management,
and four or five technical assistants. In addition, an effort has been made
to staff the DAS with technicians and competent mana ers, although
satisfactory technical competence is still lacking in many DAS. In Haut
Cheliff, the eight DAB in the subprosect area are well served by the SDA in
Amn Defla. The total techeical staffing available is adequate, the
relationship between the SDA staff and DAS staff seems good, and the SDA
complement the technical deficiencies of the DAS and are active in the day to
day activities of the DAS. In the Bas Pheliff subproject area, the SDA are
not so well staffed, and the technical competence of both the SDA and the DAS
is inadequate, which may partially explain the poor performance of these DAS,
although the severe drought of the past four years has been the major factor.
The Government plans to ensure that the SDA are strengthened to cover the

needs of the Project by recruitment of additional local staff and selected
technical assistance (para. 5.07).
4.22     The DAD responsible for all extension activities suffer from
inadequate staff and means. As a result, they limit their work to gathering
information on the demand for inputs and equipment and put together
agricultural statistics. In the project area, the DAD in Haut Cheliff has an
agricultural technician and an agent at the provincial level and one or
several technicians in each commune while in Bas Cheliff not all communes even
have a technician. The ratio of technicians to private farmers in the project
area varies from 1 to 2,000 to 1 to, 10,000 and is clearly inadequate to
provide adequate assistance either for extension activities or in drawing up
the important farm plans to qualify farmers for access to inputs and
equipment. The Project would provide for recruitment of more qualified 8 aff
at the DAD level (para. 5.07).
4.23     Research.  Specialized research institutes are responsible for
research and about 60 research stations are scattered throughout the country.
In the project area, two research stations exist, one at Khemis Meliana now
specializing in industrial crops and one at Remadena working on improvement of
farming techniques under irrigation and on the improvement of saline soils.
The industrial crops station has produced some potentially useful results, but
most have been on crops that have proved uninteresting (results on sunflower
and safflower have been disappointing and work on sugar beet and soya has been
stopped). The research station at Hemadena is understaffed and research
activities are minimal. SDA staff have also begun to do their own
experimental work on cereal varieties and pulses because they feel that
insufficient work on these crops is done locally. In addition, in 1983 a DAS
of 520 ha in Haut Cheliff was converted into a pilot/demonstration farm
involving a range of crops and a small herd of cattle. Demonstrations have
been held for DAS farmers on the use of farm equipment (seed drills,
tractors). Research country-wide suffers from dispersal of effort,
under-staffing, and lack of organization; research in the project area
reflects these weaknesses. While current research results available are
adequate for the early years of project development, improvements will be
required in the future and the Government is currently reviewing options for
reorganizing and strengthening the research system under its current National
Development Plan.
V. THE PROJECT
A. Ratioale for Bak Involvement and Prowet Objectives
Rationale for Bnk Iwolvemeat
5.01     The proposed project would be the first operation in the agricultural
sector for the Bank since the FY80 US$8.0 million Bas Cheliff Irrigation
Project which closed in June 1985 and under which the Bank had financed, inter
alia, the Cheliff Water Master Plan which provided for the technical
299a3



-21-
underpinning of this project. In addition to providing for a direct impact on
production, the proposed project has been designed to address a key
institutional problem facing irrigation in Algeria - the lack of suitable
organizational and financial arrangements for the operation and maintenance of
existing schemes. Ths Project provides an opportunity to develop arrangements
which, when replicated, could lead to improved 0&M in all large-scale
irrigation schemes in Algeria (currently covering some 100,000 ha of which
about 64,000 ha are irrigated) and as such, its projected impact should be
seen as much greater than that of the 13,000 ha actually being built or
rehabilitated under the Project. Thus, apart from the satisfactory economic
benefits that it would provide, the proposed project is justified in having
the Bank support because of the broad sector impact it is expected to have in
promoting institutional reforms and improved O&M organization and training.
ProJeWt ObJecives
5.02     The proposed project has the following objectives: (a) at the local
level (i) to implement the first priority investment package for the
development of the Cheliff river basin; and (ii) to safeguard and improve the
income of the farmers and their families living in the subproject areas and
improve social welfare by providing some basic infrastructure; (b) at the
sector level (i) to develop and implement new institutional arrangements to
ensure adequate water management, operation and maintenance in the Cheliff
river basin which, when replicated, would benefit all major irrigation in the
country; and (ii) to develop improved internal financing of OLM by increasing
user charges to fully cover costs; and (c) at the national level, to develop
efficiently irrigation potential in the country by expanding the LSI areas
presently used for irrigation by about 20%.
B. Summary Proheot Descriwton
5.03     To achieve its objectives, the Project would finance, over seven
years, the following components:
(a) An investment component, including:
-    construction of new sprinkler irrigation, drainage and road
infrastructure serving about 8,000 ha in Haut Cheliff;
-    rehabilitation or upgrading of existing surface irrigation,
drainage, and road infrastructure serving about 5,000 ha in Bas
Cheliff; and
-    purchase of equipment and vehicles for O&M and extension staff;
(b) A technical assistance, training, and support-action component,
including:
-    technical assistance to the Ministry of Hydraulics, Environment
and Forestry ( MEF) for the supervision of works and for the
studies of further irrigation works in the Cheliff valley, to
29932



-22-
the Cheliff Irrigation Office (OPI) for the operation and
maintenance of irrigation systems, and to the Ministry of
Agriculture and Fisheries (MAP) for the monitoring and
evaluation of socialist farmss and
-    overseas training in operation and maintenance of local staff of
the Cheliff OPI;
(c) On-farm investments as required to develop and intensify irrigated
crops, including sprinkler irrigation equipment, farm machinery
equipment, high-yielding milk covs, stables and fruit tree
plantations; and
(d) Incremental recurrent costs, including:
-    recruitment of local technical staff by the Cheliff OPI to
strengthen operation and maintenance and by MAP to strengthen
extension services and management, monitoring and evaluation of
the socialist farms;
-    operation and maintenance of the new systems, including the
additional costs of the OPI; and
-    pumping costs for the irrigation system in Raut Cheliff.
C. Detailed Featres
5.04     Construction Works in Raut Cheliff.  The Project would provide for
the construction of an 8,000 ha aprinkler irrigation system in the Amra Abadia
district of Raut Cheliff (see map). The system would consist of two sectors,
each served by individual pumping stations and an underground water
distribution network: the Amra sector covering. 3,600 ha and the Abadia sector
covering 4,400 ha. The works would include: (a) construction of buildings
and equipment for two pumping stations on the Cheliff river, with a total
installed capacity of 9,250 kW, lifting water with a combined flow of 6,000
1/s to two regulating reservoirs serving the Amra and the Abadia sectors; (b)
construction of a 366 km underground concrete/asbestos pipe network and
installation of hydrants each serving blocks of about 20 ha; (d) construction
of about 300 km of open ditches to drain overland flows and percolated
irrigation water; and (e) construction of about 9.5 km of gravel feeder
roads. The construction cost per hectare is estimated to be DA 45,200 (or
US$9,600) in 1987 prices.
5.05     Construction Works in Bas Cheliff.  The Project would provide for the
rehabilitation/upgrading of part of the existing surface irrigation systems in
Bas Cheliff which is most urgently in need of rehabilitation (see Map). These
works would be carried out in seven sectors totalling about 5,000 ha, of which
about 3,400 ha would be on the left bank and 1,600 ha on the right bank. The
works would include: (a) improvement of the irrigation network by the
29esX



-23-
replacement of the deteriorated canals by about 63 km of new elevated precast
concrete canals over 2,700 ha and by about 48 km of low pressure
concrete/asbestos pipes over 2,300 ha and insttallation of new hydro-mechanical
equipment as necessary; (b) enlargement of existing drainage channels and
construction of new channels involving earth-moving of about 200,000 M3; (c)
placement of tile drains over about 1,000 ha; and (d) repairs of 28 km of
existing gravelled roads and construction of 65 km of new unsurfaced feeder
and farm access roads. The rehabilitation cost per hectare is estimated to be
DA 27,500 (or US$5,900) in 1987 prices.
5.06    fEuipment and Vehicles.  The Project would provide for the purchase
of 06M, radio-communication and computer equipment to support management and
field operations of the new Cheliff OPI. It would also finance the purchase
of vehicles for supervision of works by MHEF, for O&M by the Cheliff OPI and
for extension services by NAP. A list of equipment to be purchased under the
Project is given in Table 3.
Techicaln  a   eTainigand SuuottAtion   romen
5.07     The Project would finance components which would support MEF and MAP
staff in supervising the project works, enhancing 0&M operations in the
Choliff valley and improving extension services (the TORs of the technical
asistance studies and training are in Annex 8 in the Implementation Volume).
These would include the following:
(a) Technical Assistance consisting of 340 man-months. The consultant
services would be to assist MHEF staff in supervising the project
works in gaut Cheliff (142 man-months) and in Bas Cheliff (102
man-months), the Cheliff OPI in operation and maintenance
(48 man-months) and financial management and cost accounting
(24 man-months), and MAP in monitoring and evaluating performance of
the socialist farms (24 man-months);
(b) Studies. The Project would also include studies for the detailed
design of the remaining works in the Bas Cheliff district, including
rehabilitation works over 4,300 ha and new irrigation over 10,000 ha;
(e) Staff Trainins involving local and overseas training sessions and
project visits for staff in charge of OWM and extension services for
crop production and livestock development. Assistance and training
of the OPI staff in computer use would be provided by the suppliers
of the computer equipment; and
(d) Recruitment of local key staff consisting of: (i) two irrigation
engineers and one electromechanics engineer to head the works
supervision teams in Haut and Bas Cheliff; (ii) four agriculturists
and five agricultural assistants to support extension services
provided to the DAS in Bas Cheliff by the SDA of Oued Rhiou and
Djidiouia and to the private farmers in laut Cheliff by the DAD of
Ain Defla; (iii) two financial analysts to supervise monitoring and
evaluation of DAS in Haut and Bas Cheliff; and (iv) seven engineers

to head the new DAS that would be established under the Project as a
result of the restructuring of the existing DAS in the Haut Cheliff
subproject area (para. 6.11).
On-Farm Investments
5.08     Farmers and DAS will make on-farm investments to take advantage of
the increased water resources available. These investments would be for
mobile pipes and sprinkler equipment, 34 stables, stores and repair workshops,
1,450 high-yielding milk cows, replacement of 636 ha of citrus plantations,
planting 256 ha of new apple trees, and farm machinery equipment. Details for
each subproject area are in Annex 5 of the Implementation Volume.
Inremental Rourrent Costs
5.09     Additional recurrent costs under the Project would include local
personnel hired to strengthen OPI for operation and maintenance of the
irrigation schemes and to strengthen the SDA in Bas Cheliff and DAD in both
areas to provide technical services and extension advice to farmers. It would
also include incremental operating and maintenance costs of the rehabilitated
and new schemes and the additional pumping costs for Haut Cheliff. This
latter item would begin only in the last year of the Project.
D. Status of ProJect Preparation
5.10     Status of Lngineerin^.  Detailed designs and bidding documents for
the Bas Cheliff works are available. Detailed designs and bidding documents
for the Haut Cheliff works were completed in 1971 by international consultants
and are currentlv being updated by the Ministry of Hydraulics. Most of the
design features are acceptable and will be maintained. However, some changes
will need to be made in the design of the pumping stations which were
overdesigned, of the water distribution pipes (the steel pipes proposed in the
original studies for the small-diameter pipes will be replaced by more cost
effective asbestos pipes), and of the open drainage and road networks, part of
which have been constructed since 1971. These design changes are currently
being introduced by MHEF and their consultants. The study of detailed
proposals for the organization and management of the Cheliff OPI (the general
outline of this new organization is already decided: see para. 3.06) was
started in March 1987 and is expected to be completed in about 10 months. It
is to be carried out by a French international consulting firm with financing
from the French Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique. The study will
determine the inventory and the working conditions of the irrigation, drainage
and road infrastructure that the OPI will run on behalf of the Government, the
physical, husman and financial needs of the Office, and its detailed
organization, staffing, management and budget structures. In particular, the
study will determine the precise list of equipment, vehicles and technical
assistance necessary to ensure successful OPI operations. The Project would
contribute to the start-up of the OPI by financing a first package of this
list.
5.11     Schedule for Prolect Implementation.  The Project would be
implemented over a seven-year period (January 1987 to December 1993) in

-25-
accordance with the implementation schedule shown in the bar chart attached to
this report. Invitation to bid for the works in Bas Cheliff and
prequalification for the works in Haut Cheliff are planned to take place
during the first semester of calendar year 1987. The first year of the
Project would be primarily devoted to awarding the corresponding contracts,
hiring consultants and purchasing some equipment and vehicles. Preparation of
detailed terms of reference and letters of invitation for the Project
technical assistance and studies is expected to be completed by June 1987.
Contracts for the work supervision consultants would be awarded by March 1988
and for the other consultants by June 1988. Implementation of the irrigation
works would follow the schedule below:

E. Cost Eftimates
5.12     Total Project costs include (a) the cost of the proposed investments,
technical assistance, training and studies; (b) incremental operating costs
linked to the Project; and (c) incremental on-farm development costs due to
increased agricultural activity induced by the Project during the project
period. Total project costs are estimated at US$185.6 million (DA 872 million)
of which it is estimated that US$94 million (DA 444 million) or 511 is foreign
exchange. They Include an estimated US$34.5 million (DA 162 million) or 18.61
in taxes and duties. Base costs, valued in March 1987 prices, were derived
from recent bidding and appraisal estimates and updated price contCngencies as
indicated below -'.  Physical contingencies have been included at 151 for
the pumping station civil works and 101 for the other civil works, equipment,
vehicles, and technical assistance. They amount to US$14.4 million or 8% of
total project costs. Price contingencies have been calculated on the basis of
the projected annual price increases-L applied to local and foreign costs

5.13     A Bank loan of US$94 million is proposed to be made to the Government
of Algeria to finance 1001 of the foreign exchange component of the Project.
On-farm investments would be financed by the beneficiaries (US$7.5 million)
and by BADR (US$17 million) under its current lending policies and procedures
(para. 4.20). Bank financing would cover an estimated 51. of total project
costs or 621 of project costs net of taxes. The Government would finance the
balance of net project costs (US$32.6 million). The Bank loan would be for 15
years including a 3 year grace period.  The following table sunmrises the
proposed financing plan for project costs:

5.14     The Government would earmark the proceeds of the Loan and its own
financing for the Project to MUEF (US$153.9 million), to the Cheliff OPI
(US$6.5 million) and to MAP (US$0.7 million) through their annual budgets to
finance project activities. The Government would also cause BADR to provide
investment credit to farmers (US$17 million). Beneficiaries would share the
project cost through their down payments for the credit component.
F. Procvrement
5.15     Procurement would be carried out by the Project executing agencies
for the goods, works and services included in their respective components as
described in paras. 5.04 - 5.08. Major project irrigation works are expected
to be grouped in three large contracts (two in Raut Cheliff and one in Bas
Cheliff). Procurement arrangements are described below and summarised in the
following table:

5.16     Contracts for civil works estimated to cost US$1,000,000 equivalent
or more each and contracts for equipment and vehicles estimated to cost
US$300,000 equivalent or more each and valued together at a total of about
US$136.4 million, would be awarded through international competitive bidding
(ICB), in accordance with Bank guidelines. Qualifying domestic manufacturers
of equipment would receive preference in bid evaluation of 15% or the
prevailing import duty, whichever is less. Contracts for civil works
estimated to cost less than US$1,000,000 equivalent each and aggregating not
more than US$4.8 million would be awarded on the basis of local competitive
bidding (MCD) in accordance with procedures acceptable to the Bank (para.
5.17). Contracts for equipment and vehicles estimated to cost less than
US$300,000 equivalent each and aggregating US$3.0 million would be purchased
through SONACOM and other specialized agencies who shall follow international
shopping procedures acceptable to the Bank. Contracts for technical
assistance, studies and training totaling about US$8.5 million would be
awarded in accordance to Bank guidelines.
5.17     Local competitive bidding procedures are generally consistent with
the need for economy and efficiency in the execution of the Project. There
were, however, a few procedures which were inconsistent with Bank procurement
guidelines and others which required clarificaton. During negotiations,
agreement was reached regarding the changes needed to make the procedures
acceptable to the hank.
5.18     Contract review.  All bidding documents and awards of contracts for
civil works estimated to cost the equivalent of U8$2,000,000 and for vehicles
and equipment estimated to cost the equivalent of US$300,000 or more would
require the Bank's prior approval.  This prior approval would also be needed
29913



-29-
for the bidding documents and awards of all contracts regarding
radio-communication and computer equipment. These arrangements would
represent prior review by the Bank of about 82% of total estimated value of
contracts. The other contracts would be subject to random post-review by the
Bank after contract award, in the course of supervision missions.
G. Disbursement
5.19     Disbursement Schedule.  The proposed Bank loan of US$94.0 million has
been estimated to be disbursed over a period of eight fiscal years in a manner
closely following the profile for irrigation projects in EMENA. The Closing
Date of titc Loan would be December 31, 1994 or one year after the provisional
acceptance of the works, which is the time needed to monitor the performance
of the works and to return retention money on the civil work contracts. The
historical disbursement profiles for Bank-wide and EMENA and Algerian
irrigation projects indicate that full disbursement generally requires eight
years. Efforts have been made in the project design and processing to ensure
that this profile will be adhered to, as follows: (a) the advanced stage of
preparation of the detailed designs which will permit prompt start of project
works; (b) major project works will be grouped into a small number of large
contracts; (c) project works would be implemented separately and
simultaneously in Bas and Haut Cheliff; and (d) major investments are
scheduled for the first five years of the project period. The expected
detailed schedule of disbursements is given in Table 2 and summarized below:

Disbursements for the above items would be made after receipt by the Bank of
full documentation except for goods and services provided under contracts of
less than US$200,000 for which disbursements would be against statements of
expenditures (SOE) certified by the executing agency involved. The agency
would retain the supporting documentation and make it available for inspection
by Bank supervision missions and by external auditors. The total amount of
the loan disbursed under SOE procedures would not be more than US$11.0
million. No reimbursements applications for less than US$20,000 would be
accepted. The condition of disbursement for categories l(a) and 2(a) would be
that after December 31, 1988 no further disbursements would be made in these
categories unless the bidding documents for the construction of the Sidi
Mohamed Ben Taiba dam had been issued (para. 4.12).
5.21     Revolving fund.  To improve the efficient and timely implementation
of the Project, the Bank would deposit, after Loan effectiveness, a sum of up
to US$8.0 million into a special account established by the Government to be
used as a revolving fund to finance eligible expenditures corresponding to the
Bank's share of the average four-month Project needs. The account would be
maintained in US dollars in the Central Bank of Algeria. Government
counterpart funds would be secured in a timely manner through appropriate
budget allocations. Applications with appropriate supporting documentation,
2993E



-31-
covering the replenishment of the Fund, would be submitted when approximately
half the maximum allowed amount in the Fund has been spent.
VI. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. Project x anization
Organization for Inplementation
6.01     The Ministry of Hydraulics, Environment and Forestry (MHEF) and the
Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (MAP) would have the overall
responsibility for the execution of the Project. Within these two ministries,
allocation of responsibilities at the central and provincial level would be as
described below. The Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (BADR) would
provide credit for financing on-farm investments.
6.02     Ministry of Hydraulics, Environment and Forestry.  Within this
Ministry, the lead would be taken by the Department of Large-Scale Irrigation
Schemes (DGPI), which is responsible for design, construction and O&M of the
LSI perimeters in the country. DGPI would be responsible for overall
management of the irrigation construction and management activities of the
Project. At the project area level, DGPI will act through: (a) two work
units, one in Bas Cheliff and one in Haut Cheliff, to supervise project
construction works. Each unit would include at least two engineers, two
engineer assistants and work supervisors as needed and would be assisted by a
team of consultants to be hired under the Project (para. 5.07); these
consultarnts would include an irrigation engineer, a civil engineer, a
topographic engineer, and an electromechanical engineer (only in Haut
Cheliff); the units would be controlled at the regional level by the
provincial directorate in Relizane and Ain Defla, respectively; and (b) the
new Cheliff Irrigation Authority (OPI) which would execute project activities
regarding strengthening organization and management of the OPI, O&M staff
training and cost recovery improvement. The OPI will be assisted by a team of
consultants including specialists in water management, operatior, of pumping
stations and financial management and accounting. During the earlier years of
the project the OPI would be built up and strengthened to handle the gradual
take over of Project works starting in 1989 and other existing works in the
Cheliff river basin covering about 36,000 ha. The Government has agreed to
these procedures and arrangements for implementation of the project.
6.03     Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (MAP).  Within this Ministry,
the Department of Planning would be responsible for coordinating at the
central level the agricultural support activities needed in the subproject
areas in collaboration with the departments of the MAP involved in the Project
(crop production, livestock, extension and rural development). It would also
be responsible for reporting on and evaluating agriculture-related project
activities. At the project area level, the Provincial Directorates in Ain
Defla and in Relizane will be responsible for executing project activities
with regard to restructuring the DAS in Haut-Cheliff, monitoring and
2993E



-32-
evaluating DAS' performance (para. 6.12), and strengthening extension services
to all farmers in the Project area through their SDA and DAD (para. 5.07).
Project Coordination
6.04     Overall coordination of project implementation and related
institutional development would be carried out at the national level by
periodic meetings of representatives of all agencies involved in the Project.
The purpose of the meetings would be to monitor progress in project execution,
review work programs and progress, resolve problems involving different
Government departments and recommend any additional measures to assure prompt
execution of the Project. These meetings would occur when necessary, but at
least twice a year to review and agree on the project budget for the coming
year and the annual report of project activities for the previous year. They
would be chaired by the Secretary General of MHEF and include at least the
Director of DGPI in MHEF and the Directors of planning, crop production,
livestock, extension and research in MAP. Since the MHEF's DC-PI would have
the primary responsibility of most project activities it would assume the
Secretariat of this committee.
Project Monitoring and Evaluation
6.05     The DGPI of MHEF would be responsible for overall monitoring of
project implementation through the office of the project manager. It would
act on behalf of MHEF in dealing with MAP to discuss actions necessary for
implementing the project measures on restructuring and improving performance
of the DAS and strengthening extension in the subproject areas. It would be
responsible for monitoring preparation by the provincial departments of MHEF
and MAP of semi-annual progress reports and synthesizing them in an overall
report to be given to the coordinating committees and to the Bank. DGPI would
also prepare a project completion report within six months of the loan closing
date on the execution and initial operation of the Project, its costs and the
benefits derived and to be derived from it, the performance and fulfillment by
the Government, MHEF and the Bank of their respective obligations under the
Loan and the accomplishment of the objectives of this loan. The Government
has agreed to these arrangements for monitoring and evaluation.
Project Accounts and Audit
6.06     A separate project account and records would be maintained by MHEF
for the Project. A financial controller from the Ministry of Finance
permanently controls the accounts of MHEF, which nevertheless should be
audited by independent auditors. To this end, the Government has agreed that
the project account along with the statements of expenditures sent to the Bank
for disbursements, the revolving fund account (para. 5.21), and the accounts
of the Cheliff OPI would be audited annually by independent auditors
acceptable to the Bank and submitted to the Bank not later than six months
after the end of each fiscal year. Certified copies of the accounts as well
as the auditors' report would also be furnished to the Bank.
2993E

B. Organization for Oieration and Maitenane
6.07     One of the key objectives of the Project is to improve the operation
and maintenance of irrigation systems, one of the major issues that has
seriously constrained the efficient performance of the irrigation subsector in
the past. As specified in para. 3.05, the regional offices of MHEF have been
unable to operate and maintain adequately the irrigation and drainage
networks. In the project area, the main problems of O&M are similar to those
encountered by any O&M regional office in the country: lack of autonomy,
cumbersome procedures for purchase of equipment, lack of financial resources
because water charges have been too low to cover full O&M costs and are in any
case remitted directly to the Treasury. The problems are, however,
exacerbated in the project area because: (a) the existing networks in Bas
Cheliff have outlasted their economic life; they were constructed in 1940 and
no rehabilitation has been done since then; and (b) the two regional O&M
Offices concerned by the Project (one in Haut Cheliff and one in 8aa Cheliff)
suffer from a serious lack of qualified staff to run the 25,000 ha presently
under their control. The technical staff of these two districts include only
two engineers and eight technicians. Although experienced, most of the
existing staff are relatively old and discouraged by the poor conditions of
the networks.
6.08     Operation and maintenance of the project irrigation infrastructure,
which will start in 1989 in some sectors in Bas Cheliff, would be undertaken
by the Cueliff OPI recently created by the Government to be responsible for
all public irrigation construction in the Cheliff valley. The roles and
responsibilities of the OPIs are described in para. 3.06. This OPI would
benefit from the Project which would provide for management consultants'
assistance to help it put into place a sound organizational structure and
operational procedures by advising on certain aspects of the Office's
organization and management, O&M procedure, water charge collection and
accounting and financial structure. The Project would also provide for staff
training, O&M, radio-communication and computer equipment as required for a
good start-up of the Office. The Cheliff OPI started to work in July 1986
using facilities, equipment and staff of the MHEF O&M regional offices
existing in the Cheliff valley (including four districts: one in Haut, one
Moyen, one Bas Cheliff and one in Mina). The existing facilities are
sufficient for the OPI to start its work in the short term. In addition to
procuring and installing the equipment and vehicles mentioned above, the OPI
would give priority to taking over the irrigation systems under its
jurisdiction, hiring additional engineers to the key positions and training
the existing staff. According to the decree establishing the OPIs, their
financial resources would consist of revenues coming primarily from water
charges and Government budgetary allocations.
6.09     In order to ensure that the Cheliff OPI is organized and managed
adequately to perform its tasks, the Government has agreed that:
(a) Government would submit to the Bank for review and comment the findings of
the Cheliff OPI study (para. 3.06); and (b) Government would agree on the
principle that the Cheliff OPI would become financially independent from
Government budgetary support by December 31, 1989. Measures to meet this
target include those presented in para. 7.16.

C. Perfowanoe of the SoeiaHst Farms
6.10     Measures would be taken under the Project to ensure efficient use of
the project irrigation system by the project water users once the
rehabilitated and the new systems are operational. About 751 of the
subproject areas are under DAS ownership. There are 8 DAS in Haut Cheliff
which have been profitable since they were restructured in 1982 (para. 3.10).
The main reasons for this satisfactory performance are: (a) their land has a
high production potential; most soils are light, deep and easily drainable;
(b) competent engineers or experienced technicians were assigned as managers
of most farms; (c) the farms benefit from efficient assistance from MAP
services, especially the SDA established during the restructuring program of
the socialist farms (para. 3.10). On the other hand, performance of the 28
socialist farms in the Ras Cheliff subproject area has bee'n mixed; most of
them have had operating losses over the last three years. The main reasons
are: (a) drought conditions have persisted in the area over the last four
years: no cereals were harvested and the area was officially declared to be a
victim of natural disaster in 1984/85, a good crop year in other parts of the
country including Haut Cheliff; (b) irrigation possibilities have declined
because of the increasing deterioration of the irrigation systems and the
absence of adequate drainage which has resulted in the formation of
heavy-saline soils in some places (para. 4.07); (c) the limited water
resources available have been primarily used for irrigation of the existing
olive trees rather than for more highly renumerative crops such as vegetables;
and (d) in contrast to the situation in Raut Cheliff, the SDA and the DAS in
Bas Cheliff suffer from a shortage of qualified staff.
6.11     All DAS in the two subproject areas have been consolidated and
restructured in 1982-84, but in the context of rainfed agriculture. The
average size of the DAS is currently 820 ha in Haut Cheliff and 500 ha in Bas
Cheliff. Since the farms in Haut Cheliff will almost be fully irrigated by
the new irrigation system, they are currently too big to be managed as one
unit and further subdivision is required. On the other hand, only a small
part of each farm (about 170 ha) in Bas Cheliff will be irrigated by the
rehabilitated network and no further subdivision is necessary in that part of
the Project. In order to ensure the irrigation intensity projected (1002 and
1082 in Haut and Bas Cheliff, respectively), the socialist farms in Haut
Cheliff would therefore need to be subdivided into smaller, more manageable
units of 300 to 400 ha under the Project. MAP has decided to do this for all
DAS in irrigated areas of the country and has agreed in principle that this
restructuring is appropriate for haut Cheliff prior to the commissioning of
the new irrigation syscem in 1993.
6.12     The DAS would introduce improved self-monitoring systems under the
Project as a management tool to help improve and maintain good performance.
Criteria for monitoring this performance would include consideration of
productivity in terms of inputs (total cost of direct and indirect labor, of
farm machinery and of seasonal inputs, water use per irrigated ha) and output
(irrigation intensityZ', yields of major crops) relative to established
1/ Irrigation intensity = area irrigated to area equipped for irrigation.

norms, and financial performance in terms of cash-flow by quarter and
profit/loss for the cropping year. Existing planning and accounting systems
will be used as ~he basis for establishing the criteria. Details on the
proposed monitoring system are in Annex 7 of the implementation volume.
6.13     The Government has submitted a statement acceptable to the Bank
defining the principles to be followed and actions to be taken during project
implementation to restructure the DAS and ensure satisfactory performance. In
addition, it has been agreed that:
(a) by December 31, 1988, Government would exchange views with the Bank
on the detailed management and financial criteria, such as those
described in paragraph 6.12, to be used by the DAS and the Government
to measure DAS performance and establish a detailed monitoring system
based on these criteria to monitor performance of each DAS5
(b) by December 31, 1988, Government would also exchange views with the
Bank on actions that will be taken if the expected performance levels
are not met. In Algeria, such actions currently include changing or
improving management and technical staff, strengthening technical
assistance to DAS, consolidation of operations, and/or breaking up
the DAS and attributing some or all of the land to neighboring DAS or
to the private sector;
(c) by December 31, 1989, Government would complete the restructuring of
the 8 DAS of the Haut Cheliff subproject area so that they can use
efficiently the project irrigation system and be. profitable under
irrigation conditions. This would imply: (i) land consolidation and
subdivision of the existing 8 DAB in Naut Cheliff into farms of a
manageable size; (ii) the designation of additional qualified
technical staff necessary to manage these farms; (iii) the
preparation by each DAS of a detailed multi-year development
restructuring program based on full use of water made available under
the project and aimed at improving technical and financial
performance of each DAS.
VIL BENEFITS AND JUIFMICATION
A. Geneal
7.01     The discussion that follows quantifies the costs and benefits, in
some detail, for the time slice of the Master Plan that this Project would
finance. The economic analysis has been done for the entire Master Plan as
well as for the Project, using the data and analysis of the Project as the
basis. This is discussed further in the section on economic analysis (paras.
7.19 to 7.26).
7.02     The directly quantifiable benefits of the Project would come from the
increased production and improved productivity obtained from rehabilitating
irrigation works in Bas Cheliff and the extension of the irrigation system in
209$2



-36-
Haut Cheliff which would result in providing more water and more efficient use
of water for agricultural and livestock activities. These works would result
in a shift from rainfed crops (cereals) to higher value fruits and vegetables
and fodder crops for livestock, and would lead to a higher cropping intensity
and to higher yields for all crops. The result would also be increased crops
(mainly vegetables and fruits, but also fodder and cereals) and livestock
(mainly milk) production, income generation for members of the Project DAS and
their families, increased income for the Project private farmers and increased
employment opportunities for seasonal workers. Cost savings in foreign
exchange would result from the reduced imports of wheat, livestock products,
potatoes and other vegetables. Financial savings for Government would result
from improved cost recovery which would permit adequate operation and
maintenance of the irrigation system, thus reducing the need for eventual
major rehabilitation in the future and reducing as well the budgetary outlays
to finance the O&M costs. Secondary benefits which are not quantified here
include: (a) improved water management, irrigation system operation and
maintenance by the new OPI in the 38,000 ha of the irrigated areas in the
Cheliff river basin expected to be operational by the end of the Project
period in 1994; (b) establishing a model for water management through the
newly created OPI that could be replicated in irrigated areas elsewhere in the
country; (c) providing a drainage technology that will eventually be applied
to the future rehabilitation of 21,900 ha in the Cheliff area; (d)
restructuring the DAS in the Haut Cheliff area which could serve as a model
for DAS restructuring in other irrigated areas; and (e) establishing a
monitoring system for the DAS that could be used elsewhere in the country, in
rainfed as well as in irrigated areas. These are important sectoral
contributions, particularly but not exclusively in the context of irrigation
development in Algeria.
B. Laud Use. Yields and Production
7.03     Land Use.  Detailed cropping patterns and yields for three situations
(existing situation, future "without Project" and future "with Project") are
presented in Annex 4 of the implementation volume and sumarized in the Table
below for the principle crops. At present, about 871 of the Haut Cheliff
Project area and 601 of the Bas Cheliff project area are under rainfed
conditions and the cropping pattern reflects this, with about 60% of the two
cropped areas combined used for cereals and fodder crops and the remaining 402
for vegetables and fruit trees. Without the Project, further deterioration of
the irrigation network in Bas Cheliff is expected, resulting in a gradual
decrease in water availability and a switch from fruits and vegetables into
rainfed crops such as cereals, pulses and livestock fodder. Under the
Project, about 571 of the area would be devoted to vegetables and another 121
to fruit trees. The remaining area would be grown to wheat and to fodder
crops for the increased livestock planned under the Project. Cropping
intensity would increase from a future projected average for the two areas,
without the Project, of 881, to about 1071 under the Project. The incremental
cropping intensity due to the Project would thus be 191. The details of land
use and cropping intensities for Haut Cheliff and Bas Cheliff in the three
situations are shown in Annex 4 of the Implementation Volume and summarised
below.
2992E



-37-
7.04     Yields.  At present, the range of actual yields is quite wide, from
one year to the next, among farmers, and even within a small area where soil
conditions and water availability can vary considerably. The yields used to
calculate production under existing conditions were taken as averages of
actual yields realized in the Project area. It is further estimated that in
the "without Project" situation at full development, the yields would remain
the same as before the Project and that the decrease in production of certain
crops would be the result of reduced area planted. The increase in yields at
full development as a result of the Project are conservative, although they
represent increases of 40-1252 of the present yields achieved /'.  For any
one farm (DAS or private) these yield increases are estimated, for annual
crops, to occur over a four-year period after the irrigated water is
introduced, with a yield build-up as follows: 60X of the projected yield
attained in Year 1, 80S in Year 2, 902 in Year 3 and 1001 in Year 4. The
introduction of new cattle and upgrading of existing herds would also increase
milk and meat yields, as shown in the table above, by about 35% over the
existing situation for DAS and by four-fold for private farmers who already
have cows. Most of the DAS do not now have cattle, however, so that most of
the milk and meat production under the Project would be incremental. This
wouLd occur gradually over a 16-year period.
1/ A notable exception to this is in fodder crops, where the increase in
yields is due to a switch from the lower-yielding vetch oats to higher
yielding berseem and alfafa.

7.05     Production.  Because the introduction of the irrigation water from
the new and rehabilitated schemes occurs over 8 years and the yields develop
gradually, particularly for the fruit trees which reach full production only
in Year 10 after planting, full production from the scheme would not occur
until year 18. The Table below shows estimated production from the Project at
full development and compares this to estimated production in year 18 without
the Project. Incremental production is the result of the following changes:
(a) the total cropped area would increase by 22S; (b) a switch from wheat,

-39-
oats, barley, vetch oats and pulses to the higher value crops, mainly
vegetables, particularly potatoes and fruit trees, plus some fodder crops for
milk production; (c) increased yields, as discussed above. At full
development, the value of annual incremental production represents, in 1985
financial prices, about 694 million DA, of which 658 million DA i8 for crop
production and 36 million DA is for animal production. As a proportion of
total annual national production in 1984185, the incremental quantities
produced under the Project are small, in all cases less than lOS.

7.06     The agricultural price and marketing system has been gradually
deregulated since 1981. All producers, including those in the socialist
sector, are now free to sell their products outside the state marketing
agencies, except for cereals, pulses, edible oils and industrial crops. This
has strengthened the role of the private sector in the marketing of
agricultural produce, at both wholesale and retail levels. As prices paid by
a993X



-40-
private traders are higher than those offered by official buyers, the function
of the latter now appears to be to absorb surplus production and keep regional
supply and demand in balance. Since 1982, producer prices for most perishable
products have been deregulated and have risen considerably (80-2002);
administered prices for cereals, pulses and wine have also been increased
substantially (40-802).
7.37     In the project area, the CCLS would be responsible for all purchases
of cereals. They have to date been responsive buyers, paying promptly and
storing under acceptable conditions all cereals presented for sale. No
problem is anticipated in the purchase of increased amounts of cereals from
the Project area; these amounts will represeint only about 3% of current
purchases within the Project area. In addition, as imports of wheat and wheat
products have accounted since 1980 for 65-801 of total consumption, any
incremental production from the Project would be an import substitute.-'
7.08     The marketing of vegetables is often done by selling the standing
crop to private traders; the principle advantage to the farms is the savings
of the harvesting costs. Prices of standing crops are sometimes higher than
official prices offered by the Government agencies for delivered crops. Of
the incremental vegetable production, potatoes and citrus fruit are the most
important, representing about 421 of total financial and 381 of total economic
benefits from the Project. Potatoes are an important element in the Algerian
diet (average per capita supply in the 1982-84 period was estimated at about
37 kg, compared to 32 kg and 24 kg per capita in Morocco and Tunisia,
respectively), and historically have been imported in significant quantities
(197,000 tons, representing 21% of total consumption, in 1985). Thus the
incremental production from the Project area would be an import substitute.
In addition, in the Ain Defla province, cold storage facilities for potatoes
are being built by several official organizations so that Government
provincial storage capacity will be about 10,000 tons. Citrus fruits are not
reported in the official import statistics, but recent domestic price
increases suggest that demand has grown much faster than supply. Since 1980
the domestic price has more than tripled in nominal terms and about doubled in
real terms. The same is true for most of the vegetables produced under the
Project. The increased production of fruits and vegetables from the Project
at full development represent about 3-52 of current 1984-85 national
production levels. With population growing at a rate of 3.21, Algeria's
population will double in 'ess than 25 years, so that the demand for fresh
fruits and vegetables is likely to increase faster than the growth in
1/ In the discussion that follows, all references comparing actual levels of
purchases or consumption of crops to the "increased" production from the
Project refers to levels of production over and above current production
levels. This is in contrast to "incrGmental" production, wheich refers to
levels of production over and above future levels without the Project.
The distinction is important: increased production is relevant for
establishfng the markets' ability to absorb the increased production while
incremental production is the relevant measure for thq economic value of
the Project.
2993Z



-41-
production from the Project. Thus the absorption of the increased Project
production in the domestic market represents no major barrier and is not
likely to result in any decrease in real terms of the financial prices.
7.09     On a national level, the three milk regional marketing Offices (East,
Center, West) buy about 61 of the national production of milk, the rest going
through private channels. In the Project area, ORLAC (Office regional du Lait
du Centre) would buy the incremental milk from the DAS, which would invest in
milk tanks for daily storage until collection. ORLAC is building a milk
processing unit, in Aarib in the Cheliff area, to be operational in 1988, with
a capacity to process 200,000 liters per day initially and the ability to
expand capacity to 400,000 liters per day in the near future.
7.10     Prices for cereals are regulated and fixed each year in consideration
of the costs of production. Prices for other crops and livestock products are
not regulated, although the existence of official marketing agencies offering
fixed and announced prices serves as a support in times of surplus. At
present private traders offer more attractive prices than the officially
announced ones and profitability of the production of these unregulated crops
is quite high (para. 4.10).
7.11     The Project would result in foreign exchange savings as a result of
the incremental wheat, milk and other livestock products, and potatoes which
are now imported. In addition, the production of fruits and vegetables would
reduce the border trade in these products. The total estimated annual savings
in foreign exchange at full development is US$9.5 M, of which livestock
products account for about US$2.1 M (in projected 1995 prices).
D. Farm Income and Povety Alleviation
7.12     The Project would directly benefit about 850 private farm families
(or about 6,340 people) and about 1,870 members of DAS and their families (or
about 14,030 people),.' for a total of 20,370 people in the schemes where
the irrigation improvement and extension would be located. In addition, the
Project would generate about 1.8 million man-days of employment on the
participating farms at full development, which is equivalent to the creation
of about 6,250 full-time jobs. Only about 211 of this would be family and
direct DAS labor and the rest would be hired labor. Indirect benefits would
accrue to the surrounding populations from activities associated with the
construction, operating and maintenance of the works and with the marketing,
processing and transporting of the incremental production.
7.13     The financial costs and benefits to the farms are summarized in five
farm models. Two farm models are presented for the DAS farms, one each for
Bas Cheliff and Haut Cheliff. Three farm models represent the private
farmers, two in Bas Cheliff and one in Haut Cheliff. The table below shows
the results of the analysis, found in greater detail in Annex 4 of the
Implementation Volume. The existing situation in Bas Cheliff is much better

-42-
than the future without the Project because of the deteriorating
infrastructure (para. 4.09). This deterioration would mean a complete
reversion to rainfed crops, on soils of average quality. Thus, the
deterioration in net revenues in the "without project" situation reflects this
reversion to rainfed agriculture under relatively difficult conditions. In
addition, the table below shows a negative return to DAS in Haut Cheliff,
reflecting the marginal nature of rainfed farming for DAS. The eight DAS
which are currently cultivating land within the Project area also have land
outside the Project area, much of which is under irrigated conditions. On
balance the eight DAS have been profitable, but this is due largely to their
cultivation of irrigated crops, which are highly profitable, while their
cultivation of rainfed crops has been marginally negative (incurring an
estimated loss of DA 115/ha). This is consistent with countrywide information
on DAS performance, which shows that the majority of DAS have been loss makers
because of excessive payments of salaries and a high level of mechanixation
with mediocre yields. Without the Project to permit irrigated agriculture
and, equally as important, to introduce a monitoring system to ensure better
use of factors of production (para. 6.12), this situation would likely
continue. Thus the table below shows that in the future without the Project,

negative. Incremental income increases from 79,400 DA (US$16,715) for the
farms of 1.1 ha in Bas-Cheliff to 10.2 M DA (US$2.1 M) for the DAS farms of
340 ha and 65 members in Raut Cheliff. For the DAS, the increased income
would benefit the 32-65 members of the DAS and be used as well for
reinvestment in the DAS' activities.
7.14     With an official estimate of absolute poverty threshold being US$650
per capita (or DA 3,090), none of the beneficiaries of the project fall into
this category in the existing situation. The table above shows that the
smallest private farmers, with farms of about 1.1 ha, have a net per capita
income, before the Project, of an equivalent US$830, which is about 282 above
the official estimate. Without the project, however, the farms in Bas Cheliff
are expected to decrease irrigated production and experience a decline in
incomes. With no further investment in irrigation, all the private farmers in
Bas Cheliff would fall below the poverty threshold. Thus about 730 farms, or
5,450 people would be in this category, representing 271 of direct
beneficiaries.
E. Cost Ecovery
7.15     The Project would ensure that proper cost recovery levels would be
applied in the Cheliff valley to ensure recovery of 1001 of O&M costs and a
reasonable proportion of capital cost. This would also allow for financial
independence for the Cheliff OPt in charge of 0&M of irrigation infrastructure
in the valley (para. 6.09). As for elsewhere in the country, the 1979 water
charges in the project area, including the volumetric water charges and the
fixed annual levy, were increased in 1985 by 561 (para. 3.07). Despite this
substantial increase in current terms, water charges remained almost unchanged
in real terms compared to their 1979 level.
7.16     In order to meet the objectives stated above, water charges would
have to be increased as follows:
(a) Volumetric Water Charges (VWC). The current VWC are DA 0.12/m3 in
Bas Cheliff and DA 0.15/m3 in Haut Cheliff. At these levels, the
participating farmers and DAS would contribute to about 551 of the
O&M costs incurred to the Cheliff OPI. It has been estimated, based
on the project cost figures, that if the OPI is to cover 100% of its
O&M costs, including e?uipment replacement, the VWC would have to be
increased to DA 0.19/r  for Bas Cheliff and DA 0.43/m3 for Haut
Cheliff. This would involve a 581 and a 1851 increase, respectively,
over current VWC. The charge for the irrigated water in Haut Cheliff
includes about DA 0.08/m3 for pumping costs and the replacement
costs of the pumping equipment, which explains why it is so much
higher than the VWC for Bas Cheliff.
(b) Fixed Annual Levy. At present, in addition to the VWC, farmers are
required to pay a fixed annual levy which is DA 150/ha in Bas Cheliff
and DA 200/ha in Haut Cheliff. In addition to this levy, farmers are
required to finance all on-farm irrigation investments, pipes and
2993K



-44-
sprinkler equipment in Haut Cheliff and quaternary canals and drains
in Bas Cheliff. In addition, a part of the volumetric water charges
will pay for the replacement costs of the equipment under the control
of OPI. It has been calculated that by financing these three
elements, l.e., the levy, the on-farm investments, and the
replacement of the systems' equipment, farmers would contribute about
152 and 7% of total Project investment costs for taut and Bas
Cheliff, respectively. On the other hand, if all investment costs
were to be 100% recovered, farmers would have to pay DA 2,825/ha/year
in Bas Cheliff and DA 5,470/ha in Haut Cheliff.  This would imply a
huge increase over the current level of farmers' contribution to the
investment costs in both areas.
7.17     The returns to farmers from participating in the Project are quite
high (para 7.12) s0 that there is scope for cost recovery of both O&M and
capital costs. The table below shows the burden of full cost recovery as a
proportion of total rents accruing to the farms of different sizes. The rents
are defined as net incremental income less imputed costs of a number of
factors plus an allowance for risk. Details of the calculation are in Table 4
and in Annex 4 of the Implementation Volume, and summarized below, in present
value terms, discounted over the life of the Project.

7.18     From a financial point of view, if expected production targets are
met, the analysis shows that full cost recovery would not impose a hardship on
the participants in the Project. If full cost recovery were instituted for
both O&M and capital costs, the burden to the farmers would be relatively
small, at 7-172 of the rents and 4-11 of the net incremental incomes
estimated to accrue to the private farmers and at 8-131 of the rents and 6-101
of the net incremental income accruing to the DAB. It should be noted,
however, that water charges were increased substantially in 1985 and under
this Project the VWC would be increased again substantially. The scope to
increase fixed annual levies at the same time might therefore be politically
difficult, in spite of the fact that financially such increases would not
impose great hardship, even on the smallest farmers. Government should
2993S



-46-
nevertheless minimize the fiscal burden of the Project investment. It was
agreed during negotiations that:
(a) Government would annually increase the volumetric water charges and
the fixed annual levy in the subproject areas so that 100% of O&M
expenditures would be recovered by December 31, 1989 and that at
least 251 of the capital costs would be recovered by December 31,
1992. According to the calculations here, this would mean that:
(i) VWC per m3 would be increased from DA 0.12 to DA 0.19 in Bas
Cheliff and from DA 0.15 to DA 0.43 in Haut Cheliff; and (ii) the
annual levy would be increased from DA 150 to DA 675 in Bas Cheliff
and from DA 200 to DA 825 in Haut Cheliff, in constant 1985 terms;
and
(b) Government would carry out a study on capital cost recovery policy
with a view to determining if further increased levels of recovery
would be possible, discuss the recommendations of the study with the
Bank before June 30, 1989, and, on the basis of such discussions,
take all measures necessary to implement such recommendations.
F. Envhiromenta luwet
7.19     The Project is not expected to have adverse effects on the
environment. Bilharzia is not expected to arise with the use of elevated
concrete canals and buried pipes in the subproject areas. However, cities
such as Bch Chlef and Khemis Meliana presently discharge untreated sewage in
the Cheliff River. A study conducted under the Cheliff Master Plan has shown
that, although no problem has been noticed yet, this may pose a danger for the
irrigation of fruits and vegetables in the future. To allow the Government to
undertake timely corrective measures if needed, it has been agreed that:
(a) MBF would, through the Cheliff OPI, closely monitor the variation in the
pollution of the Cheliff water, including downstream and upstream of the
basin, caused by sewage (coliform bacteria and biological oxygen demand,
nutrient levels, pesticides, etc.); (b) not later than December 31, 1990,
forward to the Bank for its review and comment a report summarizing the data
recorded on the evolution of this pollution and (c) take all such remedial
actions as may be required to limit this pollution hazard. In addition to
this pollution monitoring the Government is establishing a system to assess
the overall environmental impact of irrigation development, including in the
Cheliff valley, and the results of such assessment will be closely followed by
MNWl and the Bank.
G. Economic Anyi
7.20     The Project would finance a time-slice of the Master Plan for the
development of the Cheliff Valley (paras. 4.01 - 4.05), which involves
developing water resources both for irrigated agriculture as well as for
potable water. Because of the difficulty of accurately allocating economic
costs to the Project alone, an analysis has been carried out of the whole
Master Plan involving equipping and operating 49,700 new and rehabilitated
hectares in the Cheliff river basin (para 4.03) as well as for the investments
as2a3



-47-
included in the Project. The investments already undertaken since development
of the river basin started in the 1940's include 16,300 ha equipped with
hydraulic works and six dams. Ongoing investments include construction of one
dam (para. 4.04).
7.21     The construction of new and rehabilitated irrigation schemes and dams
would be carried out according to an eleven-year schedule. The overall life
of investments under the Plan has been assumed to be 40 years, with
replacement of vehicles and equipment during the period according to the
economic life estimated for each item. Delivery of water to the schemes would
start in Year 2 of the Plan and continue to build up to the full 66,000 ha.
The implementation schedule is sumarized in the table below.  The build-up of
yields to projected levels begins in the first year of the water delivery and
for annual crops builds up to full Project expectations in four years; for
tree crops the build-up takes 10 to 12 years. Full development of the Master
Plan is considered to be in Year 24 (compared to Year 18 for full development
of the Project).

7.22     Costs and Benefits.  All costs were expressed in 1985 constant prices
and valued at border prices. Works under the Master Plan involve completed
works which were treated in the basic analysis as sunk costs. The economic
costs of the Master Plan were taken from financial cost estimates of civil
works, equipment and vehicles, and operating costs prepared by consultants,
converted into border prices. The economic costs and benefits of on-farm
production expected from the expansion and rehabilitation of irrigation under
the Master Plan were projected using the parameters of on-farm investment and
production costs and on the cropping patterns, yields and production levels
developed in some detail for the rehabilitation in Bas Cheliff and the newly
built areas in Haut Cheliff in the Project proposed; then applied to the
larger areas covered by the Master Plan, i.e., for 26,900 hectares to be
rehabilitated and for 22,800 hectares to be newly built (para. 4.03).
Wherever possible, import parity prices were used for items such as
fertilizers, diesel, and agricultural equipment, factoring in the World Bank's
comuodity price projections for 1990 and 1995 wherever relevant. The
conversion of investment costs in financial terms to economic terms for the
economic analysis was based on the relationships of domestic prices to world
prices for the components of civil works and equipment, i.e., steel, copper,
and cement, and on the economic prices for labor, taken as 602 of the market
299s3



-48-
wage for unskilled labor, 802 of the market wage for local skilled labor (20%
taxes) and 1002 of the market wage for foreign skilled labor. Because the
details of the potable and industrial water sugply subproject were not
available, the benefits and coats of the 150Mm allocated to potable water
were excluded from the calculation (para 4.02).
7.23     Economic Prices of Output.  Cotmdities that are officially traded
have been priced at the actual 1985 import parity price, adjusted for the
World Bank's commodity forecasts for 1990 and 1995. Non-traded commodities,
such as fruits and vegetables, currently command exceptionally high prices in
Algeria which may not continue in the medium-term. Commodities that are not
officially traded have therefore been conservatively priced at Moroccan or
Tunisian border equivalents, based on 1985 Moroccan or Tunisian financial
prices, and adjusted for transport costs. The detailed calculation by crop
and comparison with the financial prices are found in Annex 6 of the
Implementation Volume.
7.24     Economic Rate of Return of the Master Plan.  The overall economic
rate of return for the Master Plan is shown in the table below and is
estimated at 171. The Net Present Value of the Plan at a discount rate of 101
is estimated at DA 1,310.8 million. The Plan is thus considered economically
acceptable for financing. If sunk costs and the related benefits are included
in the analysis of the Master Plan (which involve 16,300 ha of extension and
seven dams - see paragraph 7.20), the overaill rate of return is still an
acceptable 111. Thus even if an economic analysis has been carried out (in
1985 terms) for the entire scheme before its start in 1979, it would have been
found economically viable.
7.25     Economic Rate of Return of the Prolect.  A subsidiary economic
analysis was also carried out for the investment under the time-slice that
would be financed by the Project. Since the economic rate of return of the
Master Plan was based on the data and assumptions developed in some detail for
the 13,000 ha in the Project area (8,000 ha in Haut Cheliff and 5,000 ha in
Bas Cheliff), the calculation of the economic rate of return for the Project
alone was a matter of applying them to the investments and benefits for the
13,000 ha. The one diffic'-tty of evaluating this time-slice was the
allocation of costs of the Sidi Ben Taiba dam, which is to be constructed
starting in 1989, but outside the scope of the financing of this project. As
water from the dam will eventually be necessary for irrigation in the Haut
Cheliff subproject area, at least a part of the costs had to be included in
the economic analysis. Part of the water is to be used for irrigation outside
the subproject area and part for potable and industrial water (para. 4.02).
Since it is estimated that seventy percent of the water is to be used in the
Haut Cheliff area, the simple assumption was made that 701 of the costs of the
dam should be allocated to the Project for the purpose of this analysis. The
results in the table below show that the rate of return for the Project is
estimated at 151 and the net present value at a discount rate of 101% is DA 256
million.

-49-
H. Risks and Senrstivity Analyis
7.26     The major rists whieh could adversely affect the economic viability
of the Project are the following:
(a) The newly created DAS in the Haut Cheliff and the existing DAB in the
Bas Cheliff may not make efficient use of the irrigation facilities
provided by the Project so that the expected benefits are not
achieved. In the Haut Cheliff, the proposed restructuring of the
existing DAS will create pressure on DAS management during a
transitional period and cause delays in the production build-up
rates. Contrary to the DAS in Haut Cheliff, those in Bas Cheliff
have not had great success under difficult soil conditions and bad
weather, and the risk also exists that these DAS will be unable to
handle, at the projected pace, the more intense activities required
for an irrigated area. This would also result in slower production
build-up rates and thus lower returns. Sensitivity analysis 'was
carried out to test these risks by decreasing DAB yield. by 10% and
increasing their on-farm operating costs by 10 to reflect inadequate
management. The rate of return combining both efforts drops to 11.61
(the analysis was done on all yields and on-farm investment costs,
but as DAB will occupy 80-85% of the area, this is only a slightly
more pessimistic assumption than if DAS yields and operating costs
were isolated in the analysis). A lag of one year in benefits
reAults in a rate of return of 12.9% and a lag of two years in a rate
of return of 10.4%;
(b) Both private and DAS farms could be affected if agricultural
equipment, livestock and associated investment, or credit were not
available in a timely manner. This might occur either because of the
physical unavailability of the equipment or because of the length of
time for credit to be accorded. Cropping operations would thus
suffer and yields be affected, or alternatively the benefits of the
Project would be delayed. A 101 decrease in yields would lower the
rate of return to 13.5% and a 201 decrease to 9.51. The lag in
benefits would affect the rate of return as mentioned above in para.
(a); and
(c) Establishing a new organization, such as the OPI, has certain risks.
It may not operate effectively at first, either because of lack of
management or lack of experience. It may not be financially
self-sufficient because it may in the early years underestimate its
operating costs and be under-funded, by its collection of
watercharges and by its receipts from Government to make up the
difference. This would ultimately affect delivery of water to the
irrigation schemes, and also might require higher than anticipated
rehabilitation or maintenance charges in later years. These factors
would tend to lower yields and increase operating costs,
respectively, beyond those estimated here. The risk of inadequate
maintenance of the irrigation system was shown by a decrease of 101
in all crop yields and a 101 decrease in cropping intensity, for a



-50-
total decrease in benefits of 202 and an Increase in operating costs
of 10X. The combined impact of these changes would be to lower the
economic rate of return to 9.32.
7.27     The project design has attempted to minimise these risks.  As far as
achieving acceptable performance by the DAS, the Project would ensure that
adequate arrangements are in place to restructure the DAB to handle the
increased agricultural activities and to establish performance monitoring
arrangements. In addition, unacceptable performance of the DAS would be
addressed by changes in management, improvements in technical expertise, and
if necessary, by allocating some or all of the land to other farms (para.
6.13).
7.28     Availability of credit, inputs and equipment would be ensured by
agreement with Government that this is a priority investment area (para.
4.16). Government is committed to improving distribution of these factors of
production. In addition, the procedures for obtaining credit are being
simplified, so that credit allocation will be festor also lead time between
the beginning of the Project works and delivery of water is sufficiently long
that credit for equipment can be applied for in advance of water delivery.
Finally, to ensure efficient operation of OPI, the Project would provide
technical assistance in the early years to help the newly formed organization
begin its operations (para. 5.07). In addition, water delivery would come
on-stream gradually, and this would give OPI time to develop satisfactory
staff and organization. This should mitigate against ineffective operation.
7.29     The switching values of the project are -18.92 for all benefits and
+23.3S for all costs before the net present value drops below 102, the
opportunity cost of capital. While certain risks discussed above could cause
the rate of return to drop to slightly below 102, the Project design has tried
to ensure against the worst-case scenarios (decrease in benefits of 202).
Particularly considering the conservative assumptions used on yield and
cropping intensity changes and prices, the Master Plan should be considered
economically viable and the Project as a time-slice of the Master Plan
suitable for World Bank financing.

area so that, by December 31, 1989, 100% of O&M expenditures and by
December 31, 1992 at least 25% of the investment costs would be
recovered; and (ii) Government would carry out a study on capital
cost recovery policy with a view to determining if inereased levels
of recovery would be possible, discuss the recommendations of the
study with the Bank before June 30, 1989, and, on the basis of such
discussions, take all measures necessary to implement such
recommendations (para. 7.18); and
(j) MElF would, through the Cheliff OPI: (i) closely monitor the
variation of pollution of the Cheliff water caused by sewage;
(ii) not later than December 31, 1990, forward to the Bank for its

evolution of this pollution and the findings and recommendations of
the environment assessment study; and (iiM) take all such remedial
actions as may be required to limit this pollution hazard (para.
7.19).
8.03     It would be a condition of disbursement against expenditures for
construction of infrastructure and purchase of equipment for the Raut Cheliff
perimeter that after Decembe,- 31, 1988 no disbursements would be made in the
relevant categories unless the bidding documents for the construction of Sidi
Mohamed Ben Taiba dam had been issued (paras .4.12 and 5.20).
