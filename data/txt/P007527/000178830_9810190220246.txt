INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE EXECUTIVE
DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO NACIONAL FINANCIERA, S.A.
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE UNITED MEXICAN STATES
FOR A FOURTH LIVESTOCK AND AGRICULTURAL DEVEIOPMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
in various currencies equivalent to US$110 million to Nacional Financiera, S.A.
(NAFIN) to assist in financing a program of credits for livestock and agri-
cultural development in Mexico to be administered by Banco de Mexico, S.A.
as trustee of Fondo de Garantia y Fomento para la Agricultura, Ganaderia y
Avicultura (FONDO). As in the Third Livestock and Agricultural Development
Project (Loan 747-ME) the loan would be guaranteed by the United Mexican
States and would have a term of 20 years including four years of grace, with
interest at 7-1/4 percent per annum. The loan would be used mainly to rediscount
medium and long-term credits extended to ejidatarios, farmers and agro-industrial
enterprises by state-owned and private credit institutions.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The economy of Mexico is dealt with in paragraphs 2 - 13 of the
President's Report of the same date on a proposed loan to Nacional Financiera,
S.A. for a Mexico City Water Supply Project (Report No. P-1207a-ME). A Country
Data sheet is attached in Annex I.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN MEXICO
3.        For a review of Bank group lending in Mexico, reference is invited to
paragraphs 14 -18  of the President's Report of the same date on the proposed
Mexico City Water Supply Project. Annex II contains a summary statement of
Bank loans and IFC investments in Mexico as of April 30, 1973, and notes on the
execution of ongoing projects.
PART III - THE AGRICULTURE SECTOR
4.        While the main thrust of economic growth came from industrial expansion,
the sustained growth of agricultural output was in many ways the outstanding
feature of the Mexican economy during the post-1910 revolution period. During
three decades (1940-1970) the sector grew, on average at about 5.5 percent per
annum in real terms, a record matched by only few countries. It has satisfied



the demand of a rapidly growing population whose incomes were rising throughout
the period, transformed the country from a net importer to a net exporter of
agricultural products, and transferred savings to the urban sector. Since the
mid-1960s, however, production growth has lost impetus, averaging less than 3
percent per annum. While accounting for only 10.1 percent of GDP in 1972,
agriculture is still the largest employer of labor, with nearly 40 percent of
the labor force. It is also the most important foreign exchange earner; agri-
cultural exports amounted to US$933 million in 1972, more than half of total
commodity exports.
5.        In recent years, agricultural production has failed to keep up with
domestic demand. Thile area expansion has traditionally been the propulsive
factor, production growth is now becoming dependent on land productivity
increases, which accounted fornearly two-thirds of output growth of the last
decade. The composition of agricultural output is also changing. From the
mid-1960's, livestock has been developing more rapidly than crop production,
increasing its share to some 30 percent of total output in 1972. Maize and
beans continue to be the basic components of the Mexican diet and are the
subsistence crops for most of the peasants; together these account for nearly
70 percent of the rainfed and 10 percent of the irrigated crop land.
6.        While until iicently the Government's agricultural policies have been
successful in their production objectives, they have not been capable of resolv-
ing Mexico's social problems in the rural areas, where inequality in land owner-
ship, underemployment and poverty still are prevalent. A vast majority of Mexico's
approximately 4 million rural families seem to have been bypassed by the rapid
economic growth of the post-revolution period and today barely participate in the
market economy.
7.        Traditionally Mexican society has suffered from sharp income disparities
- between regions, between the urban and rural areas and within the rural society.
A historically polarized society - comprising a small very rich and large very
poor classes - has, since the Revolution of 1910, witnessed a substantial
strengthening of the middle classes, but income remains quite unevenly distributed.
Thus, the 1972 rural per capita income is estimated to be only about one-fourth
of the national average of about US$744; the rural poverty problem is a compound of
overall land shortage; inequality in land ownership and inadequate public services
and, even in the best of circumstances, will require decades of intensive effort
if it is to be overcome. A recent Bank of Mexico study classifies 53 percent of
the almost 3 million farms in Mexico as subsistence units, producing only
negligible marketable surpluses, 40 percent as traditional, producing cash crops
with traditional techniques, and only 7 percent as modern. Growing underemploy-
ment is another major problem: there are almost one million landless families
in rural Mexico and the rural population is continuing to grow at 1.5 - 2.0
percent per annum. Given the limited opportunities for absorbing new workers in
the cities, increasing attention is being focused on employment creation in the
rural areas.



-3-
8.        The Government has a difficult problem is reconciling growth and
social objectives in the agriculture sector. The Government has realized that
on2y with adoption of improved technology by a large section of the farming
comunity will it be possible to movE! towards an egalitarian rural society
while maintaining the needed growth of output.   The Project before you assumes
special significance against this background; it will improve credit services
throughout the country, with a reservation of funds to be relent to small pro-
duicers at concessional rates, improve extension services and ensure availability
of fertilizers, improved seeds and other production inputs to about 34,000
beneficiary families, two-thirds of whom would be low-income producers.
9.        The Bank has made seven agricultural loans to Mexico, four loans
(aggregating $71 million) for improvement of irrigation facilities and three
loans (aggregating $165 million) for agriculture and livestock credit. Besides
the Project under your consideration, two irrigation projects - Sinaloa and Pgnuco
- are currently being appraised. The Bank is also working with the Government
on two rural development projects - an integrated one covering a series of local-
ities, and one in the Upper Papaloapan comprising one region of some 750,000
families - which we hope would to some extent, also benefit landless families
in addition to very small farmers. The Bank has offered technical assistance to
the Government in preparing the integrated rural development project and the
extension agency to be organized *mder the Project you are considering will be
an important input for the proposed rural development program.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
10.       The proposed livestock and agricultural development project (details
in Annex III; Appraisal Report No. 133a-ME of May 25, 1973 is being circulated
separately to the Executive Directors) consists of (i) a general sub-project
which will be a continuation of the projects previously financed under Loans 430-ME
(for US$25 million in 1965), 610-ME (for US$65 million in 1969) and 747-ME (for
US$75 million in 1971); (ii) a low-income producers' sub-project to assist
ejidatarios and small farmers with long-term credit and cmplementary technical
services; and (iii) technical services and studies. The first two loans were
fully disbursed ahead of schedule. The third project, whose closing date is
September 1975, is proceeding about 20 percent behind disbursement projections
but funds are expected to be fully committed by December 1973. The total cost
of the fourth project would be about US$272 million equivalent, including US$216
million for the general sub-project, US$52 million for low-inceme producers and
US$4 million for studies, training and demonstration. The proposed loan of
US$110 million, or 40 percent of the total project cost, would provide US$82.8
million for the general sub-project, US$25 million for the low-income producers'
camponent and US$2.2 million for technical assistance. The Bank would finance
all the foreign exchange costs (US$84 million) and US$26 million of local currency
costs; paragraph 13 of the President's Report on the Mexico City Water Supply
Project (P-1207a-ME of same date) discusses the need for financing of local
expenditure of projects by external lenders.



11.       The Project has two objectives:  first to help expand Mexico's live-
stock and agricultural production by increasing the flow of institutional credit
along with technical services, and thereby provide the rapidly growing population
with its food and fiber needs and contributing to the country's export earnings;
and second to draw some of the hitherto neglected ejidatarios and small farmers
into the market economy and to enable them to benefit from modern production
technology. Evidently, in the context of the staggering problem of rural poverty
in Mexico, the Project will make a modest and experimental contribution and will
touch only some of the rural poor. However, if successful, the Project will
establish an approach which could be developed and expanded relatively quickly
in the coming years.
12.       As in the previous projects, NAFIN, the Borrower, would transfer the
proceeds of the Bank loan to FONDO which would rediscount loans made by participat-
ing banks for long-term investment in livestock and crop production and in agro-
industries. The past distribution of funds among major users - approximately 60
percent for livestock raising, 31 percent for annual and perennial crop farming
and 9 percent for agro-industries - would continue.
13.       The FONDO was established in 1955 by the Government of Mexico to
provide the combination of funds and technical services necessary to make a
significant impact on agriculture and livestock development in the country.
Lending was to follow commercial criteria and FONDO was directed to operate
through private credit institutions by refinancing their loans.   In 1965, regional
banks of the government-owned Banco Nacional Agropecuario system were granted
access to the rediscounting facilities of the FONDO. Now, Banco Ejidal and
Banco Agricola, two public banks with special responsibility for ejidos and small-
holders, would be granted access to the rediscounting facilities of the FONDO
to help in execution of the low-income producers' sub-project.
14.       As in the previous projects, all loans to primary borrowers would be
based on FONDO-supervised evaluations as to technical and financial viability;
participating banks (official and private), who would generally assume lending
risks, would determine borrowers' creditworthiness. Since 1965 when the Bank
made the first agriculture credit loan, the FONDO has emerged as a financially
sound institution, playing a vital role in channeling long and medium-term
investment funds to Mexico's agriculture sector and almost all the important
publicly owned and private banks active in the sector use the FONDO's discounting
facilities (Mex$2,500 million, equivalent to US$200 million was discounted by
FONDO in 1972). Extension and technical services are weak in Mexico and the
FONDO has made a significant contribution by expanding its own technical staff
to 465 by 1972 and in addition has assisted the participating banks with training
of more than 400 technicians for agricultural lending. It maintains an adequate
network of 70 offices and agencies supervised by six regional offices. The
past institution-building role of FONDO for lending to the comparatively well-
off farmers is now to be extended to operations concerning the poorer farmers.



- 5-
The General Sub-Project (GSP)
15.       The GSP is essentially a continuation of the previous three projects;
on the average farmers and livestock owners would contribute about 15 percent
of their investment requirements and agro-industry borrowers about 20 percent,
while the balances would be financed by loans from participating banks, which
would then be refinanced by FONDO (on average) to the extent of 81 percent.
A sample survey of the loans already made reveals that on the average, investors
contributed 15 percent from their own savings and borrowed US$18,300, and that
their net cash operating income increased by 45 percent as compared to their
income before such investment.
16.       The terms of loans to ultimate borrowers under the general sub-project
and the terms on which these loans would be rediscounted by FONDO, would vary
with the size of the loans. For loans up to US$12,000 the interest rate would
be 10 percent, and for larger loans 10.5 to 12 percent. The rediscount rates
would range from 7.5 to '0 percent, providing the participating banks with a spread
of 2.5 percent, except on loans in excess of US$80,000 where the spread would
be 2.0 percent. The proposed interest rates to be paid by borrowers of US$20,000
or more are one percentage point higher than those under the Third Project and
reflect the continuing objective of bringing long-term loan interest rates in
agriculture into closer alignment with commercial rates. The proportion of
loans eligible for rediscounting would range from 90 percent on loans of less
than US$12,000 to 70 percent for loans in excess of Us$hO,000. Repayment terms
would reflect the projected cash flow of the borrowing enterprise and range
normally from three to fifteen years including grace periods of one to three
years; in exceptional cases loans would be made for up to twenty years. The
FONDO rediscounts would be secured by, and would have the same maturities as,
the promissory notes representing loans disbursed to sub-borrowers.
Low-Income Producers' Sub-project (LIPSP)
17.       The FONDO facilities have so far been utilized essentially by enterpris-
ing farmers willing to apply modern technology, and the previous Bank-financed
projects made an important contribution to crop and livestock production in Mexico.
Since 1963 the Government has also been making a conscious effort to extend
credit, through the FONDO operations, to smaller farmers at concessional rates
of interest (initially 5.5 and now 7.6 percent). With the assistance of two
USAID loans (US$20 million in 1963 and US$21.5 million in 1966) and two loans
from Inter-American Development Bank (US$20 million in 1968 and US$32 million
in 1971) a total amount of US$68 million had been rediscounted by FONDO until
September 1972 under these programs. Farmers with gross annual income of up
to US$8,000 (or net of about us$5,000) are eligible to borrow under the above
program. With the enactment of the new Agrarian Law (1971) the possibilities
of extending agricultural credit to ejidatarios and small farmers have improved
and US$25 million of the proposed loan will be set aside to assist farmers with
net annual family incomes up to 1,000 times the legal daily minimum rural



- 6 -
wages for the zone (approximately US$2,000). It is estimated that a substantial
portion cf the beneficiaries will be those having annual family income around
US$600 - 700, and thus belonging to the poorest 25 percent of the Mexican
population.
18.       Technical support services are regarded as the sine qua non for success
of the low-income producers' sub-project and the Government hasiseVip a special
fund for technical assistance and guarantee for agricultural credits (FEGA) with
an initial contribution of US$2 million. The FONDO will make special efforts to
organize and strengthen these technical services in some of the poorest parts
of the country, (States of Oaxaca, Guerrero, Queretaro and Aguascalientes - see
attachiid map), where the ejidatarios and snall farmers are in greatest need of
such assistance. In addition, the low-income producers in other parts of the
country also will have access to facilities under the sub-project.
19.       For reducing credit risks it is the practice in Mexico to encourage
formation of groups or cooperatives of small producers for the purposes of
institutional borrowing, and to require crop, livestock and life insurance from
the beneficiaries. This practice will be continued under the Project, though
eligible individual farmers will also have access to the funds. The sub-project
is estimated to benefit 22,600 families through 1,746 loans.
20.       The beneficiaries under this sub-project will pay an interest of 7.6
percent, the ceiling prescribed by the Bank of Mexico for such loans. Given
continuation of Mexico' F rate of price increase of recent years of about 3.5
percent, this will yield a modest positive interest cost in real terms. The
beneficiaries will contribute 5 percent of the investrnent cost and borrow the
remaining 95 percent from a participating bank, which in turn will receive dis-
counting facilities at 4.6 percent for 90 percent of the loan from the FONDO.
The sub-loans will be repaid in three to fifteen years (in exceptional cases
up to 20 years), including grace periods ranging from one to three years.
21.       In August 1972 the Bank of Mexico changed its reserve deposit require-
ments to make it attractive for private banks to chanrel 2 percent of their
deposits to small farmers at 7.6 percent interest, while banks in the Federal
District may channel 3 percent of their deposits in this way. With the guarantee
from the new Trust Fund, FEGA (paragraph 18) for recovery up to 80 percent of
such concessional loans to small farmers the private banks will be able to
participate in the sub-project and it is one of the objectives of the Project
to give them incentives to extend their operations to lower income segments of
the farm population. Besides the private banks and Banco Nacional Agropecuario,
which have experience with FONDO operations, the Banco Ejidal and Banco Agricola
will be two new government-owned participating banks and between them will account
for more than half the sub-lending under LIPSP.
22.       The Banco EUidal and the Banco Agricola have faced management and
operational problems, accumulating sizeable bad debts. The bulk of their past
operations consisted of shoru-term credits.   Realizing the value of specialized



- 7 -
banks to any effort to help low-income producers, the Government has recently
taken steps to improve them: top management has been reorganized, loan accounts
are being examined and bad debts written off, and the accounting and technical
staff is being increased and trained. The FONDO will assist these institutions
to expand and improve their long-term lending to the rural poor, especially
by training their technicians. The discounting facilities under the Bank-assisted
project will be handled through special accounts for such funds, to enable close
supervision of the sub-lending and recovery operations. As under the general
sub-project the participating banks will repay to FONDO promptly the amounts
they recover from the borrowers.
Procurement
23.       As under the previous loans for agricultural credit in Mexico, and as
is common to most agricultural credit operations, purchase of the equipment
financed under the proposed loan will be made by the beneficiaries themselves,
who will individually buy quite small quantities of widely diversified products,
both foreign and domestically made, through local dealers and distributors. In
these circumstances, formal international competitive bidding is not practicable.
The Government has undertaken to issue promptly the necessary permits for the
import of machinery and equipment required for the Project. The sub-borrowers
will obtain at least three quotations for imported breeding stock and five quota-
tions from not less than three countries for purchase of agro-industrial equip-
ment when the cost of such equipment in any sub-project exceeds Us$100,000.
Disbursement
24.       Disbursements to sub-borrowers would take place over three years.   Since
the loan is expected to be committed in about two years, disbursements, which
are made against 56 percent of FONDO's rediscount payments, are expected to cover
about five years. The disbursement projections are presented in Annex III.
Economic Evaluation and Benefits
25.       The economic rate of return of the Project is estimated at approximately
29 percent; 26 percent on the general sub-project and 41 percent on the low-
income producers' sub-project (with shadow pricing for family labor at 25 per-
cent of actual wage levels). If labor on the low-income producers' sub-project
were charged at the actual wage, the return on this sub-project would be 25 per-
cent.
26.       Under the general sub-project 10,843 sub-loans are expected to be made
and under the low-income producers' sub-project 1,746 sub-loans benefitting
22,600 families are forecast. The estimated current and projected income levels
of the beneficiaries under various investment models are summarized below:

4,590            Perennial crops          12,800                28%
27.       On full development the Project will increase Mexican production of
livestock and agricultural products by approximately the following percentages:
Beef         11
Milk          6
Pork         10
Cotton       13
Corn        (-1)
Sorghum      26
Beans         6
Alfalfa      10
Grapes       i7
Bank Loan Terms
28.       The three previous Bank loans for livestock/agriculture credit projects
had terms of 20 years, including four to five years of grace. Under the Project,
sub-loans (including a grace period up to three years) up to 20-year terms are
expected to be made in the first two years and disbursed within five years.
The Goverrment, as in the previous loans, will take over the repayment of the
Bank loan, leaving the amounts received from the participating banks with the
FONTDO to be used for further medium and long-term lending for FONDO-evaluated
livestock/agriculture projects.

PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Loan No.
450            Third Irrigation Project: $19 million loan of May 25, 1966;
closing date:  December 31, 1973.  The revised project costs
are about 33 percent higher than estimated but the project
rate of return will not be affected because of higher than
anticipated returns. The closing date has been extended by
one year to December 1973. In spite of delays in construction
and land leveling, agricultural development has progressed
satisfactorily; net farm incomes have risen by 38 - 45 per-
cent, and over two-thirds of farm population benefiting are
ejidatarios.
527            Fourth Irrigation Project:   $25 million loan of January 26,
1968; closing date:  June 30, 1976.  Estimated project costs
have risen by about 36 percent f-rom $95 million to $129
million). Project benefits will be higher than at appraisal,
but probably not enough to fully offset the cost increases.
Civil works are about 50 percent complete. The original clos-
ing date (June 30, 1975) has been extended by one year to
enable completion of works and disbursements. Agricultuire
development is keeping pace with civil works construction.
528            Road Project III:  $27.5 million loan of January 26, 1968;
closing date: September 30, 1973. The project initially
delayed by heavy rains was comp=leted in early 1973.  The
original closing date of Mach 31, 1972 has been extended to
September 30, 1973 to permit disbursements.
695            Road Project IV:  $21.8 million loan of June 26, 1970;
closing date:  June 30, 1975.  The project is slightly behind
schedule, because of delays in budgetary allocations. The
delays are expected to be overcome shortly and it is expected
that disbursements will accelerate in 1973.
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any problems
which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy them.
They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that they
do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses
in project execution.

747            Third Livestock and Agriculture Project:   $75 million loan of
June 9, 1971; closing date: September 30, 1975. Disbursements
are almost 20 percent behind earlier projections but commitments
cf sub-loans are proceeding well and the loan funds are expected
to be fully committed by December 1973.
793            Tourism I, Zihuatanejo:   $22 million loan of January 22, 1972;
closing date:  December 31, 1975.   Though the loan became
effective only on March 31, 1973, the physical performance under
the project is satisfactory.
820            Ports I:  $20 million loan of May 17, 1972; closing date:
June 30, 1976. The project is going ahead satisfactorily,
despite some delays in the preparation of tender documents.
The operations consultants financed under the loan have
completed much of their work.   An extension of their contract
will be necessary, however, in order to implement their
recommendations and to complete tariff studies. Negotiations
are under way between the Government and the firm selected to
carry out the National Ports Development Study.
824            Industries II, FONEI:   $35 million loan of June 2, 1972; closing
date: Tune 30, 1976. The loan became effective on October 12,
1972 It has taken more time than was originally envisaged,
to staff and organize FONEI fully; consequently no loans have
yet been approved. Recently the top management was changed,
and discussions with the Bank are in progress, on how to
expedite execution of the project.
825            Railways II:   $75 million loan of June 2, 1972; closing date:
December 31, 1975. Tmplementation of the Investment Plan
and procurement financed by the loan are progressing well; a
slow start has been made on the Plan of Action, and little
progress has yet been made on several required studies. A
new management team was appointed in May 1973. Operating
results to date have been much as the forecast, with an
improved operating ratio. Transport planning at the Govern-
ment level has, however, made little progress.

834            Fourth Power Sector Program:   $125 million loan of June 23,
1972; closing date: December 31, 1974. The loan became
effective on April 13, 1973. Increase in power tariffs by
December 31, 1972 was originally a condition of effective-
ness of this loan.   In December 1972 the Government and CFF
(the borrowing Federal Electricity Commission) informed the
Bank that for reasons of domestic economic policy, they would
not be able to put the electricity rate increase in effect
by December 31. The loan included $35 million for joint
financing of further payments due on orders placed before
December 31, 1971. With the approval of Executive Directors
(R73-23 of February 1, 1973) the Loan Agreement was amended
to separate this $35 million from the remainder; this allowed the
Loan Agreement to be made effective and permitted withdrawals
of up to $35 million even before CFE had taken the measures
required to improve its financial situation. The remainder
of the loan ($90 million) is to be withdrawable - unless the
Bank agrees otherwise - only if CFE on or before July 31,
1973, adopts adequate measures to present an acceptable pro-
gram for financing its investnent needs.
